      "description": "I don’t think I am, but my family acts like I’m ruining everything for the rest of them. \n\nI come from a super mormon family and all our Christmas traditions revolve around church and Jesus themes. This includes acting out a nativity scene and reading the Bible birth of Jesus story on Christmas Eve, attending church if the holiday is on a Sunday, churchy Christmas songs, etc.   I am a staunch atheist and the only one in my whole family, immediate and extended. I try not to rub it in their faces because it’s just cause for drama, but they really try to “fellowship” me back to church by asking me to pray before the meal or read a passage of scripture or play a role in the nativity play, etc.  I don’t want to ruin their Christmas, I just don’t want to be involved (I even abstain from other things they dislike out of respect, like no swearing around them or drinking coffee or wearing certain clothing) so I say, no thanks and that should be that but it never is. My mother gets quietly upset and I know she’ll cry to my dad about it all Christmas Eve night and it’ll hurt her feelings. I just feel guilty about it but I don’t think I’m wrong for setting some polite boundaries.  The religious guilt is real ffs ",

      "description": "First time posting.\n\nGetting right into it, about a year ago I met this girl at work. Let's call her Sam. Sam and I became friends pretty quickly as most people at our job are older. Sam deals with anxiety/ depression and doesn't have a lot of friends, so I made an effort to invite her to outtings with my friends outside of work, who are the most supportive humans I know. As we got closer and hungout more, it became pretty clear Sam liked me. Eventually, Sam told me this and I explained that I like being her friend, but was not interested in anything else, which Sam was cool with.\n\nFast forward a year later and I start to feel like Sam has become way too invested in me for being just a work friend. Examples include her leaving work early because I didn't grab lunch with her (we normally get food together) and Sam calling me out at work about how I haven't invited her places when I hangout with my friends.  \n\nRecently, Sam has been telling me that she needed to talk to me about something important, but whenever i brought it up she would never say what it was. This happened about 6 times over the course of a month. Finally, this past weekend at about 4am her and two of my friends were at a bar and Sam told me that she loved me and has never felt this way before. I didn't say much bc my friends were right there. After several texts the next day Sam confirmed this was what she wanted to tell me. I told Sam that I need space and that we can't do lunch anymore but when It comes to being in the office together that I won't act any differently toward her. Sam has called out of work sick since this happened so I haven't seen her since. I feel Sam is way too emotiallly invested in me to the point where it is unhealthy which wad affecting me at work. I also realize Sam deals with a lot of health issues and has a very limited friend group. \n\nAITA for telling my work friend Sam I need space after she admitted she loved me?  ",

Most are about wanting to be in our child’s life and I have a lot of guilt about keeping him away from our daughter. (Don’t get me wrong there are a lot of mean messages mixed in there too). I don’t trust him, he is violent and has a drug problem but I feel guilty because I will be keeping my daughter away from her father. Many people have said that there is no replacing her father and that they have a right to be in each other’s lives. \n\nHe now says he’s given up on ever being apart of our lives and that it’s my fault our daughter won’t have a father. That I didn’t give him enough of a chance or that I can’t put the past behind me for the benefit of our daughter. \n\nSo AITA for not giving him a chance to be in our daughters life?

      "description": "So I'm going to be using the names Bob for me and Susan for my girlfriend. I apologize if this post seems to be in shambles, it's late and this question has been tearing me up inside lately.\n\nSo I, Bob, am a bisexual man. I came out while at college, and during this time I got really involved in my college's Queer Student Union. That's where I met Susan. We instantly clicked. We had all the same interests and loved the same books and bands. I knew she was asexual when I first met her, but despite that I sorta started falling for her.\n\nBy the end of my sophomore year, I found out that despite being asexual, she was still romantic and still craved intimacy and romantic relationships. At this point, she was a close friend, and since we had so much in common, I decided to go for it. \n\nFast forward to now we're becoming really serious, and I think that's what has caused potential permanent abstinence to set in. I haven't had the guts to attempt to initiate anything because I knew she was asexual before we started, but I don't know whether it's \"repulsed by sex\" asexuality or \"never initiate\" asexuality, but I'm afraid of pushing her boundaries and ruining both our relationship and our friendship by being pushy.\n\nI'm a virgin. I'm Catholic and the emotional crisis I went through before realizing I was bisexual meant I never tried anything with anyone because I was too scared over the possibility that I might be gay. When we started our relationship I thought no sex wouldn't be an issue cause I'd never had it before, but I'm realizing that was a naive assumption. Now that I'm comfortable with my identity, I want to experience that part of life, but I don't feel I can if I stay with Susan.\n\nShe's the first person I've ever been in love with, and that love was built on the foundation of our friendship beforehand. But, even though we love each other now, I think we'll end up resenting each other if I don't end it now. At that point, not only would the relationship end, but our friendship too. Even if she was willing to have sex for my sake, I'd feel like I was manipulating her because she wouldn't actually want it. Yet, at the same time, I feel like only a complete shitty asshole would break up with their best friend when they feel so strongly for each other over something as minor and selfish as sex.\n\n**TL;DR: Girlfriend is asexual and I knew that going in. We're starting to get really serious, but I don't think I can keep abstinence going, so I'm considering breaking up before it gets to the point of no return.**",

      "description": " \n\nAbout a year ago I broke up with my ex (ltr) and moved to the city, around this time I also started a new job. The first few months I was trying to get my life together when I made a new friend at work, let's call him Bill. Bill is an interesting guy to say the least, I'll leave some details out, but I will say that his teenage years were rough and he struggled with substance abuse. He's been clean for 2-3 years now, but drinks and smokes pot daily. I thought this was fairly normal for guys our age (20's) and started hanging out with Bill 3-4 days a week after work &amp; on weekends.\n\nBill lives with his girlfriend, Sally, and early on I could tell they didn't have a healthy relationship. Bill was verbally abusive to Sally, and it doesn't really matter who else is around. Most of the time when I'm with the both of them it doesn't get too bad, but sometimes it does and I've had to step in and tell him to shut up. Turns out, he treats a lot of people this way, such as other friends and even his mother. I happen to be one of the only people he treats with respect 24/7 (the only other one I can think of is his dad, who by the way, happens to be one of my bosses at work). He's actually been a great friend to me, helping me and being there for a major life event.\n\nWhenever we hangout, usually at his place, Sally is often home. Apparently, I'm one of Bill's only friends that talks to her and tries to be her friend too. Sally is gorgeous, and is the sweetest and most interesting woman I've met since my breakup. Turns out me and Sally have super similar interests and we're both very chill, down-to-earth people. Bill, is hot-headed, judgmental, and argumentative. I couldn't help but fantasize about being with Sally, but I didn't think too much of it because obviously I would never do that to my friend, Bill. At least I thought that until recently...\n\nA couple weeks ago Sally texts me, and asks to borrow my truck, and hints that she's using it move out of Bill's house. I explain that I don't think that's a good idea, that I don't blame her one bit for wanting to leave Bill but I can't get involved for fear of causing drama at work (I should mention while all of this is going on, we're in the process of Bill being transferred to my department at work that I supervise, he's already working under me at this point). She understands and let's it go for awhile.\n\nThat is until over the course of the last week we've slowly been starting to text more and more. It started with her just venting, and this is when I found out the situation was worse than I thought (there has been domestic events, the last one the police were involved). It then progressed to just chatting, with her occasionally flirting while I tried to be neutral. Eventually, I couldn't help myself and starting flirting back. Feelings came out from both sides, apparently this has been mutual for quite awhile now and we've both just been fighting it.\n\nAITA?",

If my mom asked for help in any way he’d refuse her.  \n\nThat wouldn’t stop my mom from trying to make things better. She had him over every Saturday for dinner. Drove him across the states to see his son because his medication kept him from flying. \nNot once did he ever say thank you for any of it and it anyone could see that it ate away at my mom. \n\nNow last Tuesday he finally died. He wrote a trust for the house we are in. He told us that he was giving us cheaper than normal rent so we could buy the house. But that’s not what he put in the trust. I haven’t read the trust, but I was hoping the house would be split between my mom and her 3 brothers. Only 2 of the brothers we would have to buy out. The other didn’t want it.  However, what he put from what I’ve been told is that the house is to be sold because he never wanted my mom to live in it.  So now we are looking to sell because we sure as shit can’t afford it. My grandfathers last act on this planet was to throw my family out because he never liked my mom. \n\nNext Saturday is the memorial service. My moms asked me to go to support her but I honestly don’t think I can do it. I want to support her but I can’t give that crapsack any respect when he had none for us. \n\nAm an asshole for refusing my mother’s request and not going to the service?",

      "description": "Disclaimer: I'm a first time poster so bare with me. Also this is a long one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently in college and last year I went through some tough times. All I did was sit in my room and sulk. A friend of mine would often hang in my room with me, she would often play movies or we'd play board games, but we would never go out or anything. She asked me to be her roommate this year and I said yes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis year I'm doing much better. I have a girlfriend who really gets me out there, I've joined numerous clubs and am even the VP of one, and I have finally made a solid group of friends. I am so happy to finally be getting the true college experience. I finally don't feel the need to sulk in my room, I want to be out living life. My roommate is not taking any of this well. She often gets upset at me for lying about who I really am. I don't feel like I lied about who I am, I was just in a bad place when she met me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause she wants me to revert back to a time of depression I avoid spending a lot of time in our shared space. I'll often spend time out with my girlfriend, or with my friends. In the beginning I would invite her along but she is rude towards the new people in my life. I tried to talk to her about her attitude towards them but she just gets defensive and claims that they just don't understand sarcasm.Now I just don't invite her places, or won't tell her where I'm going. On weekends I'll usually be out the entire time. She informed that on weekends if I'm gone she only gets up to use the bathroom and won't eat or anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a lot of other small details that don't really matter but basically the situation has really taken a toll on me, which sucks because I've finally gotten myself to a good place. So reddit, AITA for resenting my roommate and not hanging out with her so much.",

He is always rude to me and my mother, sometimes spanks me and cheats on my mom with different women very often. When he isn't at home, he is with some friends drinking at the bar (he gets home drunk almost everyday) or with some woman, who knows. He has never been a present father, and I became used to it, but I really feel that I hate him sometimes for making us go through all that bullshit.\nBesides all that, he really does everything for me, his only child. He pays for my college, bought me a car, taught me how to drive, gives me everything I need/want.\nSo I ask, AITA in this situation? Am I being ungrateful for everything he does to me?

      "description": "So this just happened not 30 minutes ago. \n\nJust for context I have a job that I work at till 12:30 am and because I have to rely on public transport I don't get home till 3 am. I only work 3 days out of the week so I don't mind the commute. I also live in between a pretty upscale gentrified neighborhood and a pretty sketchy part of town so there's an abundance of homeless people around my area.  Also the place I live in has a gate so it's kind of secluded but it's on a Main Street. \n\nI just got home after work and taking the 2 buses to get home. I took my dog out to do his business as per usual when a clearly drunk homeless man approaches the gate and starts calling for my attention. I'm used to this as this happens pretty frequently and also there was a gate between me and him so I wasn't threatened. \n\nHe asked me if I could bum him a cigarette which I obliged I even gave him 2 more for later. He then tells me how hungry he is and how he's from somewhere else and how he hasn't been able to eat for a while etc. so I told him to wait. I prepared him a little meal bag consisting of a bag of chips, a Tupperware container filled with chicken and chick peas that my rooms mate had made for dinner (there was plenty of leftover), and a couple of mini payday bars. I came out with the food and handed it to him and he was very grateful. \n\nWhat really irked me was that after I gave him this food he proceeded to ask me for money to buy a beer. I told him I have no cash and that he should be on his way. He was upset and yelled at me for not giving any money and even called me a \"piece of shit\" for not giving him money. \n\nI understand the struggle and this man was clearly going through some issues in his life but am I really a piece of shit? This is a trend I've been noticing around the homeless around my area. It makes me not want to even acknowledge their presence but then I feel guilty about that. \n\nTL;DR I gave a homeless man food and cigarettes and he called me a piece of shit for not giving him money for beer",

      "description": "Sorry for the long post, I just have a lot to unpack and I'm trying to explain both sides to the best of my ability. TLDR at bottom. \n\nSince kindergarten I've been in Speech Therapy, for about 2/3's of the Alphabet, and a slew of problems such as talking too fast, volume control, etc. It isn't anything mentally wrong, just never really learned correctly so they had to reteach me. Finally, at the end of 8th grade I \"graduated\" from Speech, after (mostly) learning my R's and working with speed control. \n\nMy odd way of talking has given me a British accent, and I constantly get asked about it. But, I also never fully learned my R's and honestly I kinda backslided a little when I stopped being taught. So, from the time my kid brain could process it to now, I've always dealt with the fear of not being understood, and it never goes way. It's always the back of my mind. That, coupled with my mom constantly making me say words/pointing it out, makes me absolutely hate people pointing anything out near it.\n\nBut, I've also grown up with it so I'm pretty used to it. With my friend group we roast each other a lot so it comes up decently often. And while it bugs me, I usually just joke back a little and then change the subject quickly. They are my friends and they are just making lighthearted jokes, I'm not gonna blow up from it. \n\nBut this time, I don't know. My bf(of almost one year) knows how insecure I am about it, and we were just hanging out when he kept (jokingly) making fun of me; using a British accent, telling me to say certain R-heavy words, etc. I tried to keep it lighthearted and keep it to telling him to stop, but when that wasn't working I did turn to guilt tripping him, telling him about how awful and embarrassed it was making me feel.\n\nNormally, he'd apologized or stop. But this time he said something along the lines of \"Calm down, I'm just messing around\" and I fucking lost it.\n\nLong story short, I shoved him away(we were lounging around together on his bed) and told him he was being a dick and super inconsiderate of my feelings, and that I felt like he didn't even care that I was telling him to stop. I was pretty angry, so this was all yelled. This led to him being pretty shocked and said that I never really minded it before, and he didn't realize that I was getting generally upset over it. \n\nI told him I didn't want to hear it and that it isn't an excuse since I told him to stop. He apologized, but the night was ruined so I just went home after telling him I'd text him in the morning when I've had time to cool down.\n\nWell now I have and now I can't tell who was really in the wrong. He was the one mocking me and I had told him to stop, but at the same time he didn't know I was actually upset since normally I never really appear to be so my reaction seemed out of line. \n\nSo who was the asshole in the this situation? \n\nTLDR: I grew up with a speech impediment that made me insecure. Bf was jokingly roasting me about it, and I lost it when he didn't stop upon being asked. Bf didn't realize I was being serious since normally I don't appear to be bothered by it.

      "description": "So this happened like three years ago, but I still feel guilty about it. My boyfriend (24M) and I (20F) met and started dating. After a month or so, everything is good so I start to meet his friends. Initially, it was all fine. He had six friends, a little group, and lived with two of them. \n\nWell, as time went on we got a bit more serious. My boyfriend started taking his job more seriously, as I am an intense workoholic, and I tried to relax and party more like him. His friends are INTENSE partiers. They're all now in their late 20s/early 30s and still go out every other night and drink until utterly smashed. \n\nThings started to go wrong between me and his friends by then. They blamed me for him not going out more (we went out every friday and Saturday with them), and just generally started to complain. The main complaint they had about me was I'm too opinionated and annoying. There was also an incident in which I yelled at them for drunk driving home from a bar with my boyfriend passed out in the back with no seat belt. Still, I tried to stay positive and went out of my way to be friendly, making dinner and baked goods for them and staying home alone so my boyfriend could have more guy time. \n\nDidnt work. They started a \"campaign\" called \"Make (OP's boyfriend) Single Again\" and teased me about stupid stuff like where I went to college, my accent, and my anxiety disorder. This really pissed me off and I stopped spending time with them, and my boyfriend stepped back a bit. \n\nSo when my bpyfeiend and I moved in together I told him point blank that the only one who could come over was the non asshole friend. My boyfriend could go see them, but I would not be uncomfortable in my home. My boyfriend just stopped being friends with them. \n\nI didn't really think I was an asshole until a few months later when (small town) someone said to my friend that they heard I didn't let my boyfriend to have friends and that I was isolating him and manipulative. \n\nSo, AITA?

I have talked to her but she is so stubborn and doesn’t want to listen.\n\n my first semester went shitty because the situation affected me so much ,i felt like i wasn’t in university,i didn’t go out with friends and i was staying home because i was angry with myself for something that is not my fault. After the christmas holiday break I promised myself to just do whatever i want , to say no to my grandma and to stop caring if i hurt her feelings even if it makes me look like an asshole.\n\ni know that i sound ungrateful , i understand that she feels happy to have me near her and seeing me everyday and i know a lot of people would love to live in a big city near their university without having to pay but i feel like if this situation continues i won’t enjoy my university life the way an average student does .",

      "description": "This happened 2 weeks ago, but I just discovered this sub.\n\nI was with my girlfriend for 6 months and everything was great.  We didn't fight much since it was pretty early on into the relationship, and I'm not really a contentious guy.  Then, she told me that she got plastic surgery...  We're both Korean and Koreans are known for their plastic surgery.  I've always been completely against any type of procedure that changes your appearance.  Her surgery wasn't anything major, it was just double eyelid surgery.  For those not in the know, double eyelid surgery is very popular, especially for asians.  I'm not sure about the numbers, but I'm pretty sure a large amount of asians do get them and they're not really seen as a big deal.  However, to me it is.  I became distinct with her and could not get rid of the negative thoughts that started to form in my head.  \n\nThe part that really bothered me was the fact that she would spend money to change her appearance, albeit slightly, because she wasn't satisfied with the way she looks.  I know some might say what's the difference between that and makeup, but just the idea of permanently changing your appearance does not sit well with me.\n\nSo I decided to end the relationship with her.  I met with her and ended the relationship but I did not tell her the reason was because of her surgery.  I just assumed that it might be best not to tell her because she might start to hate herself for getting the surgery or become self conscious about her appearance.  I was really flustered and just told her it's because of personal reasons and did not get into details at all.\n\nShe texted me a few times throughout the week asking me what the problem was and what she did wrong, but I just kept telling her I didn't wanna talk about it and eventually ignored her (or responded very late) to her messages.  We live in the same town and whenever I see her friends, they all try to ignore me now.  I'm sure they all think i'm an asshole.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; girlfriend gets (minor) plastic surgery for double eyelid surgery.  i break up with her.  don't tell her reason why b/c i feel it's best not to.  everyone ignoring me.",

      "description": "So 2 weeks ago I met a girl on Tinder, and we hit it off pretty quickly. We had similar taste in music which was a big plus. Here's the thing though, she lives about 200 miles from me. She told me her location was set to where I was because she didn't want her clients to see her on tinder. She's in the mental health field, so apparently she needs to keep her work and personal life separate. She said she was about 2 years away from moving to the city I'm in. I didn't think much of it at the time. \n\nSo we started chatting a lot, and after a day or two it turned into every day. We had similar chatting style so it seemed like a great match so far. One weekend goes by and then she tells me she's coming in town for a concert on the upcoming Friday, and then she'll be free the next day on Saturday. We both wanted to Bohemian Rhapsody, so she bought tickets to the movie at a theater right by my place. \n\nLast Friday approaches and I start rethinking the date. I had told her before that I wasn't looking for anything serious, but whatever happens, happens ya know. She was at her concert so we didn't talk much Friday night. Saturday I wake up and start to worry about the distance. Where she lives it's about 3 hours from me. 3 hours isn't 'too' bad... But it's far enough to be a pain in the ass. \n\nSo I decide to cancel the date. I didn't bullshit her, I sent her an apology message. I also sent her $20 through fb messenger for the movie tickets. I told her that the distance was too much for me. She was ok with it at first, then she got upset and told me how shitty it was for me not to give it a chance. Also shitty that I told her I wasn't looking for anything serious, so why not just make a new friend. I told her sorry again and let her know that I guess I was looking for a more serious relationship. Then she once again wouldn't let it go and told me I was an asshole. \n\nAITA for being honest with her and cancelling? I just figured it wasn't fair to her to go into the date knowing I wasn't ok with the distance. Or should I have just given it a chance? \n\ntldr: I cancelled a first date with a girl that lives 200 miles away from me on the morning of the date. I sent her money for the movie tickets she bought. She told me I'm an asshole. ",

      "description": "A little history here. My older sister has always been troublesome, like pulled a knife on me and my brother more than once troublesome. Most my life she has been verbally and physically violent so for awhile I just kinda fell out of touch with her. A few years back she started medication for her anger issues (diagnosed with depression and anxeity, but I think there might be something else) while on medication she was okay, still pulled some dick moves but nothing violent. So fast forward and my sister falls pregnant and since I just had a baby of my own I keep helping her with this and that but during her pregnancy she has to stop taking her meds. Slowly, slowly her old self came back. When she had her baby she had a lot of troubles. I kept pushing for her to start therapy and take meds again (she wasn't breast feeding as she found it too demanding). It took 6 months but she finally did. My mother agreed to take care of her baby during her appointment but after my Mother agreed my sister pushed for more time to herself to go drink with her friends, which my mother agreed too because she is a sweet woman. On the day of my sisters appointment I had playgroup with my baby (a year older than my sisters) and during this playgroup I took a fall and partially tore the 3 major ligaments in my ankle. I called an ambulance and for legal reason they wouldn't allow my son to ride with us. My Hubby was already on his way but works quite far away so I called my Mother to ask if she could come grab my son and take him to the hospital to meet with my husband. So she takes my sisters baby comes grabs my baby drops him off to hubby and goes home. Unknown to me she called my sister and explained the situation asked if she could get her baby incase I needed to go into surgery. My sister came after her appointment but because she missed out on time to herself she abused my mother (even though she had 3 hours before the appointment baby free) she screamed at her saying she needed help and its always something with me or my son and mom is never there for her and all kinds of horrible things. The conversation ended with my sister saying she was done with the whole family and didn't need us. I'd been texting her in the hospital and asking how her appointment and I didn't get any response. I found out later in the day what happened after finding my mother bawling her eyes out. I was livid. The next down I realised she blocked me on facebook. 3 days later she text my mother an apology I don't know what it said but Mom said she isn't ready to forgive her which is very unlike her(she has even cancelled her christmas dinner). On the 4th day she asked what was wrong with my ankle. I bluntly explained that it was fucked and I have to take care of my son in crutches and with a boot for 2 weeks followed by a month of a brace. She said wow that sucks let me know if you need help which on a paper sounds nice but her offering of help is always disengenous. I didn't reply. Day 6 she tried calling twice, I didn't answer. She texted R U mad at me? And I ignored it. Day 8 two calls ignored again. We are on day 10 now. I still haven't contacted her. I know she has issues with her mental state, I know things are hard for her but after everything she has done I am just too tiered to continue a relationship with her. My Husband hasn't liked her since she made a commotion at our wedding she he keeps telling me just to ignore her but his view point is bias. So Am I the Asshole here? Should I just give her a pass because she is struggling with some sort of mental issues? And ultimatley what should I say to her? Thanks for reading\n\nTL;DR My sister who has a history of mental issues blew up at my Mom after having to cancel baby sitting time due to me badly injuring my ankle. It's been 10 days and I still haven't spoken to her. ",

      "description": "So my two  friends don't have cars and I feel like they expect me to give them a ride home for spring break. We are from the same city and go to college 4 hours away.  One of them has a dog that they brought from home for a bit, and I know that it will be hard for her to transport it otherwise.\n\nThey haven't asked me yet for a ride, but I know that they will. My reluctance is from the fact that I want to leave two days early ( My classes got cancelled), to have time at home and see my long-distance boyfriend.\n\nThey are joining me on a trip over break, and I don't want them to resent me. But I've become their go-to friend for favors and its gotten to a point where I feel used. \n\n\\-------------\n\nBackground story of initial tension:\n\nTo top it off, i once overheard them talking about using me for a free place to stay in the city. They called me, and thought that I had not picked up the phone yet, and I heard them saying this:\" I know it's awkward, but it saves us $40 and gives us a place to stay.\" This was after an incident where I asked one of them to pay me after drinking a $40 bottle of my burbon with another one of my roommates without asking.\n\n The other roommate was being incredibly dramatic about it and acting like I was penny pinching her, and then later insisted that I would need to chip in for groceries if I had a slice of her pizza ( I decided to buy my own because we eat different things.) It was really hurtful, because I spent 400 on alcohol for my birthday party the week before, and tried to make sure to contribute to the apartment. The sad part is that my two \"friends\" talked about me badly behind my back with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are entertaining people to have around, and I live with them... but I can't see them the same after all of this. They are also way too keen on men with money, which leads me to believe that they are users in other aspects of their lives.\n\n\\-----------\n\nI know they would chip in for gas, but I'm getting tired of our dynamics. I feel pressured to keep the peace because we're all going on a trip together, and making new friends at this point feels like it might be too much effort. I know that these people are not worth keeping around after college.",

      "description": "Pretty straightforward. \nMy husband and I are gamers. He recently bought me God of War for the PS4. YASS! I've grown up with GoW so having this was a must. I had finished the main storyline and was working on finishing up the side quests so I can build up my stats and start defeating the Valkories. I also needed one more level of the impossible trails which are a bitch to get threw. I mean, I spent a lot of time on this game. \nMy husband, he also has been playing GoW. He isnt to far behind me as he too finished the main storyline but he still needed quite a few side quests to complete plus including those impossible trails. Also, hes not very thorough when hes searching for items so he doesnt pick up or find nearly as much important items as I do. \nSince we are somewhat around the same areas of gameplay, the saving files are starting to look a little similar. So husband confuses himself and creates another save file to save his progress. Nothing wrong with that, cool. We dont get confused. \nNot until the other day... he was finishing up his play and came to the save screen. Three save file... he chooses mine and saves... \nHe says it was an accident, that he was truly confused. I do believe he was confused but we have been (play) arguing on who's a better player and who's Kratos is stronger, yatta yatta and then this happens. I can't help but to feel that he played the petty game slightly but I also know he wouldn't go that far as to erase my entire progress. I am pissed and I kind of dont want to play anymore but I dont want to make a big deal about a game either. It's just a game. \nHubby says I can piggyback off his game and start from there 😑😑\n\nReddit, Am I being An Asshole for feeling this way about my game being saved over? \n\nTL;DR Husband saved his God of War game file over my game file when he had two saved files already, he was confused and I'm upset about it.\n\n\n\nMy Kratos can still kick your Kratos ass. Love you babe.",

They love classic Hollywood, not just Crawford, Garbo and Monroe as well, but especially Crawford. It would be one thing if they just liked  her as an actress, but they idealize her as a person which I think is really weird considering she was an awful human. Her and her little friend often have these little old Hollywood parties where they dress up as their favorite starlets. She talked me into going to one as James Dean. It was fucking weird. I thought they just dressed up and got drunk. No. Oh no. It was like a fucking LARP for film nerds, they were all in character. After about five minutes I couldn't take it anymore and I told my girlfriend I was leaving. She asked why and I said this shit is mad weird, she told me to kick rocks and so I did. She hasn't spoken to me since. Was I the asshole?",

I was uninterested and proceed to ignore the kid, hoping that he would understand that I have no interest. But he kept on going talking to me non-stop about his favorite class and stuff.

She's a good person generally but her word is not.. trustworthy.\n\nThe other day he was with one of our friends and after a bit of alcohol, he pushed himself against her and she defended herself and screamed at him to leave.\n\nHe was arrested and is possibly facing a lot of charges.\n\nWe were having a discussion about it today over text and she was getting a bit crazy. She was saying how she wanted to kill him and other things. She says that although there is 0 proof, he should be locked away for the rest of his life and is working with her lawyers to accomplish this.\n\nHere's where I fucked up. I said \"I hope that doesn't happen otherwise the world would turn to shit\".\n\nBad choice of words.\n\nOf course I want this dude to go to prison but I'm of the opinion that NOBODY should be locked up if there's 0 proof. Unless this dude literally says \"Yeah I did it\" then I don't think he should go to prison. I tried explaining this to her but she wouldn't have it.\n\nSo she screams at me and tells me that I'm a terrible person and blocks me, tells all my friends to do the same and most of them have turned against me because they believe that I'm a heartless bastard that encouraged my friend to do it.\n\nAITA here?",

It's really awkward hearing them talk about it in front of me without getting an invitation and today I heard them joking \"no party happening here\" and laughing when i entered the staff room.\n\nWhat baffles me the most is that this makes me question whether people actually enjoy my company or they're joking behind my back. I consider myself intelligent and realistic so i do not think I'm tripping when it comes to stuff like that. \n\nI understand that they do not have any obligation to invite me, however i find it inelegant as fuck and awkward to be in the same space with them. \n\nAny thoughts? \n\n\n",

      "description": "Backstory: \n\nMe and her (let's call her \"X\") grew up in the same neighborhood but only become close and subsequently best friends  about 4ish years ago. About April last year she moved upstate  (about 7 hours away) to live with her boyfriend. Since then, whenever we've been able we've met up and hung out and it's always been the best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore recently however, I've been diagnosed with depression and sometimes I get sad and need my friend. I'm not the kind of person to be needy or dump my shit on other people so it's only usually when I could use cheering up that I call her and we talk about random things and try and make each other laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 4 weeks ago, my sister was rushed into ICU and I was feeling low. I simply messaged X \"Just so you know \\[sister\\] is in hospital and I'm feeling really low\" and I sent her a photo of my sister in hospital too (as X knows her). X left me on seen and so I left it a few days, until I texted her \"What's going on?\" and this time she didn't leave me on seen, but had clearly been online but just wasn't responding to me. I had other priorities so I didn't think much of it except that it was pretty shitty of X. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week I finally messaged her \"Can you let me know whats going on?\" and she explained that the photo was uncalled for and she didn't know how to react. I admit that, that was pretty shitty of me to send a traumatic image without any warning or anything. She then explained how she felt really bad for not being able to get back to  me because it upset her so much. We managed to talk it all through and we were back to normal(ish) again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my depression was being really bad again and all I wanted was to talk to my friend, but I became afraid that she'd just ignore me again or whatever, or maybe she just doesn't want to know... So  feeling insecure I messaged her \"I'm sorry if this is difficult to say, but where are we? I mean,  we used to come to each other with everything, but  now  I'm scared that will make you uncomfortable  and things and I don't want that to destroy us, so can you please let me know where I stand?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe responded \"??\" \n\nI first put \"I don't want to ever make you feel bad, but depression can make me feel really low at times\" followed by \"Look, sometimes when I'm sad you ignore me, and I get it, you need space sometimes, but are we the kind of friends who can tell each other bad things, or are we only the kind of friends that  just make each other laugh?\"\n\nShe responded \"It's weird to define friendships like this\"\n\nSo I said \"I'm not trying to define our friendship, I just don't  want to break any boundaries or do anything that could destroy us. So I'm asking X, where do we stand, can I tell you when I'm low or not?\"\n\nShe  blocked me...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo kind people of reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "My SO and I had travel plans for 2 weeks and his coworker offered to board our 2 dogs for $200 at his place. We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he’s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we’re away from the house for a couple hours but they can’t be in their cages an entire day or they’ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he’d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn’t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they’d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog’s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker’s wife nonchalantly states that “he got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning” and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he’s vomiting they scold him for “ruining their carpet” \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn’t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of “Hey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that’s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great”\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog’s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we’d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the “exercise” I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n",

After my parents divorce they stopped communicating with my sister and I (age 11 at the time) and I haven't really seen them since. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to recently and my dad is in rehab again and wants to reconnect with his mom who is elderly. I found her info online and sent her a message asking if they would like to meet. They seemed happy and said yes. My dad and I went to a restaurant and met up with my grandmother, aunt, and cousin (who is 22). It was all going well catching up until we were saying goodbye and they kept talking about how important family/blood was. My grandmother made a snarky comment about my mother, who they dislike for leaving my dad for his issues, and \"jokingly\" implied I was too much like her. Literally talking about how key blood relationships were. Now it's important to note my aunt adopted my cousin years ago when she was a baby, and to my knowledge it was something she knew about. She was only a toddler when I last saw her, but she looks nothing like my aunt/uncle and my dad had told us and never said it was secret. So I commented back that Cousin seemed to be fine despite being adopted, and it was like a bomb went off.  Apparently she was never told? My dad seemed surprised at the reaction too and they left angrily. Was I wrong here?  I probably would never have mentioned it had she not gone on about how important blood ties were. ",

      "description": "We've been together for 5 years, but for the past 3, we've been living somewhere where he has to keep his rig in our bedroom. \nHis hobbies are gaming and making games. I admire that he knows what he wants to do with his life and I love the passion he has for making games. \n\nBut since both of his hobbies involve the pc, he's on it almost every moment he's not at his day job. He takes his meals in front of it, the first thing he does upon waking is turning it on and if uninterrupted will remain there until he wants to sleep/bathroom/have an errand to run. \n\nFor background, I'm a terrible sleeper. I know that's on me for not getting my sleeping schedule in order. During the week I have work and school so I usually get in bed around 11, midnight at the latest and wake before 8 am, but on weekends I stay up to upwards of 2 am or so working on homework or trying to get some socialising in with our roommate before the new week begins. \n\nHere's where I'm wondering: I've expressed to my partner on numerous occasions that when I'm trying to sleep or do homework in the bedroom that I would prefer if he's not in voice chat, so I can rest or get my work done. Sometimes he remembers not to do that, but more often than not I have to share this space with him and 3 or so of his friends on the call. \nThere's been numerous occasions where I've come in to the room and tried to talk to him about personal stuff, only for him to AFTER let me know that he was in a call. There's been a couple of times I realized I just unknowingly aired out my family business to aquiantances (friends to him) and they've even heard me a few times complaining to him about stuff like him being on the pc while I'm trying to do homework. \n\nAll of that is what really upsets me, not even taking in to account that he doesn't make time to spend with me without gaming. I've stopped trying to make time for him these past few months as it hurts when he can't just talk with me or do something mutual together (besides gaming).\n\nAnytime I try to express to him how it makes me feel he seems regretful and will apologize, even promise to try not to do these things in the future, but it just doesn't pan out like that. \n\nLast night I came in around 2 am and laid down. He was in a call, which I did my best to ignore. I couldn't so I asked to borrow his noise cancelling headphones to listen to some ASMR. I could still hear him chatting, laughing, and the clicking from the game. I felt rude to ask him to get off, as he was in the room already and I came in after so I just took my pillow and went downstairs and slept on the couch.\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling like our room is just his gaming room now? Where we live he has to have it up there. I just want him to remember that it's my space too and that I don't get to relax in there any more. But I also feel like I'm being one of those gamer hater girlfriends. I just want to feel like we're in a romantic relationship and not just roomies who fuck and do favors for each other. \n",

      "description": "This one wasn't actually me, or even anyone I know, but an interaction I witnessed on the bus a couple days ago, that left me a bit bewildered.\n\nThe bus was packed with people standing in the aisle, yet there were still two empty seats in the back (one had a lady's purse in it, but I still count that as 'empty' as the lady had nothing else in her lap, but in any case the other seat was completely empty).  One guy was trying to squeeze past enough people to see if there were any seats left, so he called to the back of the bus, \"Hey, are there any seats?\"  Somebody answered, \"No.\"  A blatant lie, and the guy had managed to see past enough people to KNOW it was a lie.  He was still trying to squeeze past people to get to the seats in question, some people were letting him through, but at least one person was obstinately blocking him.  He gets pissed for being lied to and denied a seat that there was no reason that he shouldn't be able to sit in.  If someone else wanted the seat, I'd understand that, but nobody else was sitting down in it either.\n\nThe thing that confuses me is that the entire bus seemed to condemn the guy as an asshole.  Yeah, he did start yelling and being rude once he realized he wasn't getting the seat, but I think that's justified, right?  One girl shouted, \"It's just one seat!\" as if seats should only be utilized if there are enough for everyone.\n\nIn any case, the guy eventually admitted defeat and stood for the rest of his trip.

      "description": "We’ve been married 14 years. \n\nWe opened our Valentine’s Day cards and gifts before the kids went to school. The kids got chocolate or cookies, balloons, and cards. Hubby got chocolate, a card, and a 4 foot folding camp table (he has been complaining at every camp out for the last year that he needed a table). I got no card, two stuffed animals, and some chocolate. \n\nI had been saying since before Christmas that since I had pierced my ears I would like some earrings. Nothing fancy. $10-$25 sterling silver earrings from Walmart would have been fabulous. Instead, he spent $30 on stuffed animals and candy. \n\nI told him that I was slightly disappointed that they didn’t get me any earrings AND he didn’t get me a card. He said that they had spent enough money, that the kids picked out my stuffed llama, and that he thought I would like the stuffed sloth he got me since he calls it his “spirit animal.” \n\nSince I spent $10 more on him than he spent on me, I went to WISH and bought $10 worth of earrings. \n\nAITA for being disappointed in my Valentine’s Day gifts?

      "description": "So back story: I was 16 and fell pregnant with triplets with my boyfriend (who lives half away across the world) and struggled a lot. My mum basically looked after the triplets for most of the first few months of there lives. I found out I was pregnant with twins when the triplets were 7 months and before anyone jumps on me for being an irresponsible teen I was on the pill both times i fell pregnant (because of painful periods) and we used protection. \n\nI decided I didn’t want to keep the twins because I was in a good place at the time and didn’t want to have to rely on my parents to help me with the twins again and am about to move out of my parents house and was happy with my life and had gotten over the dark time I was in after I had the triplets. I didn’t want to get an abortion so I started looking into adoption at birth. I found an amazing gay couple and we organised for them to be there for the birth and for them to basically take the twins as soon as they were out of the hospital. I met up with them a lot before the birth and they had bought all the correct baby equipment and seemed really prepared and excited for the twins. We also organised to have an open adoption - the triplets and I visited the family every week. \n\nSeeing the twins every week made me wish I hadn’t given them up but they were in a loving family so I didn’t say anything to the couple. But after about 4 months the gay couple told me they weren’t as prepared for being parents as they thought they were (which surprised me a lot since I thought they were prepared and ready) and that they were actually thinking about giving the twins up for adoption to another family. So I jumped in and said that I would take them back because I was struggling with giving them up and that I would love to re adopt the twins if they were serious about giving the twins up for adoption. I had moved into my own house by this time and had a stable job and was in a healthy mindset so I thought it would be fine. \n\nThe couple basically said they were the legal guardians of the twins (they are) and that they have complete control over the twins (they do) and there not giving their twins up to some asshole who gave up her own kids. Which is true. But I don’t think it’s fair and that even though they do have full legal guardianship of the twins and they get to decide who they go to I do think I should be the first choice because I now the twins (at least a little bit, because of our weekly visits). \n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR; gave my twins up for adoption at birth but the couple who adopted them is giving them up for adoption again and I would like to re adopt them but the couple doesn’t want to give me the twins",

      "description": "So, sorry if the post will be long, but you need a little backstory. \n\nTomorrow me and my girlfriend will celebrate our first anniversary. That means gifts, or at least for us it is that way. Unfortunately I am really picky when it comes to receiving gifts, whereas my girlfriend is more reasonable. For what concerns the giving portion, I am really good at it ( at least for what concerns my presents to her ) while she's quite terrible. This situation never bothered me, since we love each other and our relationship is really strong, but I always joked with her on how bad she is at picking gifts for me. Furthermore, she said multiple times that she wants to improve at this, since she knows that it's not one of her strong points. \n\nNow, for my birthday in October she gave me a really cool winter jacket. Good and all, but my ex girlfriend gave me an almost identical jacket the year prior. No big deal, I love me some jackets. For Christmas, I specifically asked for a particular book, which I received. I bought her some boots that she wanted. After that, during the holidays I did what every picky asshole like myself would do, which is hinting at possible gifts that I wanted. It was stuff like \"wow I really need an Hard Drive\" or \"jeez I could use some bag for my arcade stick\" etc.  On a side note, just two weeks ago I wanted to buy a trench coat, and I asked her for advice, but I ultimately didn't go through with it. \n\nAnd now our anniversary. I bought her a really hard to find ticket for a concert held on a beach this summer by her favorite singer. She went ballistic when I gave it to her, and I was super happy. Just an hour ago she told me what she bought me: a trench coat. Not the kinda expensive one I wanted to buy for myself these holidays, just a trench coat. Also, this is just a fresh coat of paint on the birthday gift. Same piece of clothing! She told me that she initially planned on buying me a game that I wanted, but she didn't since she is planning on giving me one when I graduate, and thought that two videogames were too unoriginal (!!!). Then, she wanted to buy me the arcade stick bag, but since she started looking for my gift a few days ago, she was worried that it might not arrive on time. \n\nLook, I know that I should be grateful that our relationship is going well and that she loves me, and that I should be happy that I received a gift in the first place, but I cannot help but feel extremely disappointed at her lack of effort, in spite of how much she told me that she wanted to get better at picking gifts, and despite knowing me this well. So, judge my materialistic ass. \n\nAlso, sorry if the post is low quality, it's my first here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Last weekend I spent a few days in the mountains with my friends. We arranged to meet in a certain place and leave all with the same car to spare money and I offered to drive. A friend of mine, let’s call her Emily, was really upset because her dad’s car (she still lives with her parents and hasn’t got her own car, so even if it belongs to her dad, she drives it as well) was damaged just a few minutes before we met. As we met we went to buy some things we needed for the trip and for a bit it seemed as she was calm. \nLater while I was driving Emily asked me to stop along the way because she said she was nervous and she really needed to have a smoke, my two other friends who were with us answered that she could smoke once we arrived (it’s a 20 minutes drive) and she just didn’t answer.\nA few minutes later Emily asked me if she could smoke in my car promising she would keep the cigarette out the window, I said no since I’m trying to quit smoking (one week smoking free today btw) and I didn’t want my car to smell bad. She answered that I used to smoke in my car and it wasn’t fair forbidding her to do the same, I just sighed loudly to let her now she was annoying me and she stopped talking for the rest of the trip. \n\nLater that day more friends arrived and I don’t remember how, we began talking about what happened in the car, one of them (Margaret) told me I was being a hypocrite for not letting my friend smoke in my car since I used to do the same (it happened like three times because I REALLY needed it), and the thing that I was trying to quit smoking is not a valid excuse because not much later I would have seen them smoking, and it would have been the same as letting Emily smoke in my car. \n\nI was sure I hadn’t done anything wrong since I had that conversation with Margaret, but she made me feel like I failed in helping a friend in need, so AITA?",

I work in customer service and at my job the rules for cellphones are if they are on you then they have to be on silent and stay in your pocket. I have been at this job for three years and have never had a problem with my phone being on silent until today. My sister tried to get into contact with me by texting me 17 times none of which I heard because my phone was on silent. (She was texting so I could cancel a dentist appointment she had made because she is currently out of the country and can't do it herself.) Two hours later I go on break and see all the messages and I tell my sister \" im sorry I was at work I missed your texts.\" This is when shit hits the fan. \nMy sister tells me that I should always have my phone on vibrate, and that what happened if she was kidnapped.\nI respond with there is nothing I can do of you are getting kidnapped because even if you where back in the country we live 6 hours from each other. I then tell her the rules of my work and about how the only way I can have my cellphone on me is because it's on silent. \nThis doesn't help. She insists I am putting work above family. And telling me that I am an uncaring asshole. I tell her that I can't put it on vibrate it will bother customer's, distract me and it goes against the coporate rules of cellphone. She said that if I can't do it then  I should just quit  because otherwise I would be putting  my job above my family. After that I haven't responded because I don't know how to. \n\ntblr: my phone was on silent at work. I missed 17 text messages from my sister in a span of about 2 hours. Sister accuses me of being an uncaring asshole and putting work above family because I refuse to put my phone on vibrate because that goes against the rules at work. Sister tells me to quit because I am choosing work over family. ",

      "description": "This probably gonna be a long one, sorry in advance.\n\nI have a friend who I used to be close to when we were younger. Ever since, he has progressively gotten worse with his problems. He has a pretty bad drug problem and uses marijuana so much that it has become a crutch. (I don’t mind casual smoking but it becomes harmful when it gets to a point) \n\nHe has always tried to come visit to be with my family and I have had a hard time saying no because there is no nice way to do it. Most times, he will just book flights with out making sure its ok and then we are stuck with him. Every year, however, I see him over the summer and he always seems to be a different person. He’s one of those people that has never found their own true personality and is often fake in his interactions with others. \n\nThis year, he has become almost obsessive about his “spirituality”. He’s been here for only a few days and so far its been all he can talk about. The strangest thing being I saw him only a few months ago and he told me he had completely stopped believing in god. Now, he is a very, very serious christian. It doesn’t help that my whole family is pretty much atheist. \n\nTo be clear, it’s not the christianity part that bothers me. I have christian friends and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. However, it’s annoying when you feel like someone is constantly trying to push their religious beliefs on you and your whole family. \n\nBut thats not it. I don’t think he’s really christian once he went into detail about it (unsolicited). His ideas he has aren’t any type of christian i have ever heard of before. It started at first when he told me that god had spoke to him and given him a prophecy. At first I thought he was joking but he read his entire prophecy to me about all kinds of strange things that I couldn’t follow. He was saying that WW3 was going to happen and that Israel and America would rise to be world superpowers? Also something about how we would have a world government and we would get our energy from Venus.\n\nNot only that, but he also told one of my relatives that he has a girl inside his head talking to him. The girl was talking to him at that moment and that he wasn’t supposed to be telling anyone this. \n\nHe constantly preaches about how he believes in 3 different types of “eyes” (like a third eye). He drew a whole diagram of them for me and explained how god was always talking to him and giving him definitive answers. At first, I tried to discuss with him about it and try to be open minded. The longer we talked, however, I couldn’t keep my cool as he always would argue back that Jesus was in his heart and helping him to try to be a better person. He always used that argument regardless of what point I was trying to argue. \n\nAlso he said he would believe in this forever, he could now get vibes from others (literally just called empathy every one has it), and that doing drugs lets him see more. I couldn’t take it anymore and I started to call him ridiculous and obsessive. I told him it made absolutely no sense for god to tell him a prophecy. To be blunt, he wasn’t happy I said any of that and said I was making fun of his religious beliefs. \n\nSo am I the asshole?",

      "description": "This happened a very long time ago, but the \"friend\" is still mad about it. Sorry for the cluster fuck of a story, I can't remember it well as it happened years ago.\n\nBack in middle school I had this friend (we'll call him Matt) and he is interested in dubstep. Back then I was listening to pop songs and etc. Sometimes Matt would email me some dubstep songs which he liked or showed me during school. After Matt sent me some of these songs I started also getting into dubstep thanks to Matt. One time during sports we had to run laps around the school, Matt was able to run for a long time without stopping so I asked how he did it (I can't remember how he did it but I recall thinking it was stupid and I didn't use the technique.) The next day where we had to run the same lap, I also managed to run without stopping. After the laps, Matt thought I was using his technique when I didn't and got very unhappy. Another time which something like this happened is during art, where I didn't have any ideas of what to draw and noticed Matt had a great drawing so I asked if I can use Matt's idea which he responded Yes.\n\nBut the more the I started listening to more and more dubstep, the more he was unhappy. He would also got made about me copying his art idea and his technique. Because of this, he got ALL his friends (some of which are my friends) to turn on me, to the point where if I asked them questions none of them would respond to me and they would ask me questions like \"why did you copy Matt?\" \n\nI sent him an email later to which he would call me out for playing the same video game as him and said stuff like \"yeah I got that game first why would you copy me\" and called me out for everything  in the first paragraph. The next day when I sent the email he would show everyone in the class and his friends the shit I wrote in the email, some didn't care, some cared and turned against me. This kept going on where he would talk shit about everything I do to all his friends who turned their backs on me. \n\n1 year goes back and we're both in highschool, he still wouldn't let go about what happened in middle school. Everytime I talk to him he would just ignore or talk to me in a angry accent.\n\nSorry for the cluster fuck of a story. It happened a long time ago and I can't remember it well enough. \n\nAITA for \"copying\" Matt?",

      "description": "I'm in second year of a technical university and I started giving private lessons for high school students and highschool entrance exams (math, German, French, accounting, java programming and law). I took a teaching class at another uni for a while to improve my teaching skills. I usually get only good feedback from parents/students.\n\nNow this one first year HS student I'm teaching is struggling quite a bit in maths (barely passed first semester, now at least we got him up to a grade that he can compensate with other subjects). What I've noticed is that he seems to have trouble writing down the theory the teacher writes on the screen during class (large gaps where the theory would go in the math book). Last week I met his parents and when I told them, they asked me to write a summary and help him get more interested in maths.\n\nFor me, this goes beyond what's normal. I'm just a student and not a real teacher. I told them they'd have to get help somewhere else, but that I could do the summary for an additional one time payment (though I told them I didn't think it would be very helpful). I was then asked to do it for free since it was \"part of normal lesson preparation.\" I told them they could forget that, I don't like to give up my free time for nothing in return. Got called egoistic and greedy for that. AITA for thinking they should pay me more if I have to spend additional time?",

Hope i’m not the AHole\n\nSo just another casual day at the bus with a lot people standing( i live in a third-world country where buses are always crowded). \n\nSo on my mid way to trip there’s this woman who got in the bus and stand as there’s no seat to sit. I was looking down as I was tired and i saw her stomach bulging. I was almost gonna stand up and give her the seat but the problem was that my mind doubted in a split second. Is she pregnant or is she just fat or full? Her stomach somehow looked like about 8-12 weeks old im just guessing. I really cant tell. So in the end I looked down for half an hour analyzing wheter she was pregnant or what. I was so confused and guilt was killing me inside if she was indeed pregnant. Half an hour passed I got to my destination point and she did not get my seat as another man came in and sat fast. I felt so sorry and man guilt is still on me.\n\nSo AITA for not letting her have the seat?\n\n",

Lately it has gotten bad enough to where I cannot find any joy in anything I do, no matter how much I used to love doing it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a group of friends who I have been frequently hanging out with lately, but every time we're with each other I cannot enjoy myself; every time I smile with them it's because I don't want to be rude. Because of this, I am extremely boring. They are very great, smart people and I do not want them to think of me as the boring person I have been lately. I have thought about taking a break from hanging out with them so I can focus on my mental health and hopefully return to the more fun person I was before\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason I don't want to disclose to them that I am (potentially) taking a break from spending time with them is because I feel like they've had enough of me and my depression. I know that sounds absurd but every time we hang out the person who I am closet to (she also has depression) notices how off I am and checks up on me. And while that's well and good I do not like how responsible she potentially feels for me.

      "description": "So a little context to start with me (24M) and my GF (23F) have been together for just under a year. We met on tinder but really hit it off in our first date so started to see each other pretty regularly for a couple of months before deciding to commit to a relationship. At the time we lived pretty close to each other (about a 20 minute drive) so we would meet up 2-3 times a week for dates and then hangout over each others houses on the weekends. \n\nI’ve had a full time job since I left uni at 21 and when we first met my GF was working part time and thinking about going back to uni for her masters, as of September last year she decided to take the plunge and moved to a city 2 and a half hours away for the year to finally get her masters. So for the past 7 months I’ve been travelling down to see her pretty much every other weekend, we’ve had a couple of bumps along the way like any relationship would doing the whole long distance thing. \n\nSo now down to what happened, last Friday I was driving down to see her after a full day In work, I hit a bunch of traffic (2 and a half hours in to what ended up being a four hour drive) and was tired so I stopped to grab an energy drink. I gave her a call just to let her know I would be a bit later than expected and the conversation was pretty normal until she mentions she wants to go out clubbing and is thinking of trying MDMA. So we’re pretty much the same level when it comes to drug use we’ve only ever smoked weed once or twice, so it struck me as a bit of a surprise and I panicked a bit and probably overreacted saying if she did it I didn’t want to be there because I’m not comfortable being there while she takes pills that we have no idea what’s in them or where they came from. \n\nShe said it was fine she wouldn’t take them and I continued driving and eventually got there but things were really off when I got there and preceded to be for all of Friday night and Saturday morning. I was a bit annoyed because she was barely speaking to me and I could tell something was wrong so I confronted her about how awkward things felt and she flipped out about how she doesn’t think she can go out and have a good time with her friends when I’m there. I was hurt because I only get to see her for 2 days every two weeks and she has all the time in between to spend with her friends. So AITA for not wanting to go out clubbing so she can take MDMA with her friends?\n\nTLDR: I only see my girlfriend every other weekend and she wants to go out clubbing and take MDMA on the weekend I come to spend time with her.

      "description": "So I was very fortunate to be born to wealthy parents, who do business in west Africa. I thusly go to a very expensive private school. Some of my friend's parents are not so rich (although by most standards still wealthy), and some can go as the companies that their parents work for pays their tuition ($ 32k). Now when somebody brings the price of something up, I will sometimes say that \"oh, that isn't that expensive\", forgetting who I'm talking to. Now recently a friend of mine (who is also rich, but less so) brought up the Maserati that his dad had just bought him for around 60k, and I said \"Oh, that's a steal!\". Later another friend (referencing this incident said that I was an a-hole and a douchebag. So reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "Around a month-and-a-half ago, our local rock gym was forced out of their location. They didn’t go out of business, but we’re essentially evicted from they building they were in for 20+ years so a developer could build some apartments and restaurants. They have made it clear that they are not going out of business, but finding a new location for a whole new gym will definitely take some time and effort. \n\nYesterday I received a text from a friend of mine to an Instagram page of a gym south of ours is setting up a new gym in our local scene. In this post they imply that the local gym that was evicted is now closed for good, and that they were coming to “fill the void”. This really rubbed me the wrong way as the gym that was originally here has made it clear that they are working on getting set up in a new location. I’m not opposed to two coexisting gyms supporting the area. We have had multiple surf and skate shops coexist and support one another.\n\nI left an anonymous comment on their Instagram post saying that they should change their language. I felt that implying that the other gym is gone for good will spread false information about the situation. I’ve felt that climbing should always be about support and community, and their phrasing seemed the complete opposite of that. AITA? \n\nI can provide screenshots for further context. \n",

      "description": "To sum up the entire story as quickly as possible. I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.",

This happened on Friday.\n\nT= team mate \n\nG= our friend (more her friend) \n\nF = bf's friend\n\nBF = boyfriend\n\nMe= me\n\n\nLet me start by saying F is (was?) a good friend of mine, too. At 6 am, I noticed that we were missing an important part of a drawing project due later. I hadn't noticed before.\n\nI texted F and she got mad that I didn't tell her sooner. I figured she wouldn't fix it (school lends us PCs &amp; wacoms, and we had two free periods so there shouldn't have been an issue), so I did a quick painting over my template (she was supposed to follow it so this wouldn't happen). I didn't use F's drawing bc I thought it would be rude to change it. \n\n\nFastforward to 30 minutes before the class, we're sitting in a classroom. G and other 2 students were there. I showed F what I had done in those 2 periods. Once again, F brought up that it was my fault for answering so late. I told her \"you had the time and means\". F got mad and continued talking loudly. Then, F got angry at T over the gc for not submitting the image to the teacher. No one had told T to send it, but we all assumed he was going to. I told F something like \"you can't expect T to send the image when you didn't even send it to him through e-mail. You sent a low-resolution jpg in the gc.\" \n\nShe got louder \"No one told me to send it. How was I supposed to know?\" I thought this was hypocritical of her and told her \"You already know the gc sends low-quality images. No one should have to tell you, you're not a little girl-\" \n\n\nF cut me off, shouting: WELL, YES, I AM A LITTLE GIRL\n\n\nG &amp; I: no, you're in university-\n\n\nF: I HAVE THE MIND OF A LITTLE GIRL, YOU SHOULD TELL ME THINGS AS IF I WAS A LITTLE GIRL\n\n\nG: no, you're not, and- Me: Ok, don't interrupt- (at the same time) \n\n\nF: I'LL INTERRUPT ALL I WANT BC YOU'RE BLAMING ME FOR THINGS I DIDN'T DO AND NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT. YOU'RE ANGRY AT ME FOR THINGS THAT ARE NOT MY FAULT\n\n\nShe stormed off. I sent T my image and told him \"make both versions and send them, pls\" He did &amp; we went to class. \n\n\nF entered the class &amp; didn't look at me. We presented. The class agreed her drawing was prettier but mine fulfilled the checklist. I talked to my teacher and my bff and both told me to cut ties after the project was done.\n\nThen I told my BF. He defended F &amp; said \"Please understand F, she's having a hard time. Her mental health is bad. I know this doesn't excuse her but maybe it was a bad moment. I think you should just talk to her\". This hurt me a lot as I have mental health issues, too. \n\n\nI have F's texts to BF if anyone wants her side on this. \n\n\nAITA for not wanting to apologize? And most importantly, Would I Be TA for asking my BF to side with me on this? ",

      "description": "Hello. Im 16 and have been at my Subway job for only 3 weeks, part time. Last and this week have been my spring break from school, so ive been in during daytime shifts to make some extra cash.\n\nMy general manager (H) has been the only person working with me while on spring break. He’s almost 50 years old, and pretty skilled at running a subway. His accent is thick and his English is a little broken though, so there’s a bit of a barrier between us.\n\nSo, H has been complaining to me about a number of things about my performance the last day or two. He complains that he’s “tired” of having to interrupt his GM duties to help me get sandwiches made quick enough, or to receive customers. He also tells me that i move too slow and take too long to get ready to start a sandwich.\n\nNow, let me remind you, ive been there for 3 weeks; im still in training. I take maybe 30 seconds or so to get my hands washed and get plastic gloves on them (our paper towel is awful quality.) While i do so, im still taking the order and talking to the customer, apologizing for the wait. They’re often just fine with it. H isn’t though- sometimes he’ll move me away and excuse me for being in training, even if there’s just a person or two there.\n\nThe sandwiches follow a specific formula and im still trying to remember them all, so sometimes i have to glance at the charts. It takes two seconds and then i get to work. There are also certain things sometimes that only apply to specific sandwiches, some of which I’ve only seen once since starting to learn the meat side. If i glance at the chart, he comes out and reads it to me after im halfway through, then tries sometimes to take over what im doing. \n\nAlso, I haven’t been taught how to ring out a customer yet. H complains that he has to stop doing what he’s doing to do so, yet when I ask him to teach me about that, he gets angry. I can’t be allowed to do my job if im not being taught.\n\nHe’ll also send me to do things in the back and then get mad when I need a few extra seconds to stop what im doing and get up there.\n\nAnyway, AITA or is he asking too much from me right now, as a trainee?",

We were having conversation, making jokes, etc. At some point I made some weird spastic movement for no reason, Rf1 asks laughing \"why did you do that?\" I replied jokingly \"cause I'm autistic.\" Having done this before in a friend group and it got a couple of laughs. Then everybody went silent and there was an awkward silence for about 5 seconds. Then C replies \"I am autistic\" having realised my mistake I just sat there silent for another few seconds. Then I just mumbled \"sorry\" and walked away. \n\nThe worst part is I knew he was autistic because it came up in a  conversation between my mom and aunt I overheard.

      "description": "So a bit of backstory. My ex and i work together and i noticed she had been chatting to another guy in work quite often. She assured me that this guy was just a friend and there was nothing going on. This guy is married and has a young child. \n\nFast forward a couple of months, my ex and i had been on holiday to Egypt where my ex was really off the whole time and at points refused to speak to me or hang out with me. She was busy messaging another guy who she used to be in a relationship sending lots of pictures and even a bikini photo showing a decent amount of boobage.\n\nI was understandably (imo) annoyed about this and we had a little argument over it. \n\nWe get back from holiday and back to work and I notice she's really off with me. We'd sit in her car on our lunch breaks together and would watch tv shows or just chill. One day she got out early and went to sit in  the car, I got off a little later and when I got to the car she was hiding her phone screen away from where I might be able to see it and messaging someone rapidly. \n\nI pick up the phone and I see she's snapchatted the guy she told me was just a friend and she'd logged out of it. Presumably just incase I looked. I only got a glance to see that she'd sent him a chat message.\n\nA couple.of days or so later in early december December after worrying that something was going on I was in our bedroom and she'd left her phone. I saw she had another chat from him. So being the curious boyfriend and feeling as anxious about it as I was I gave in and checked. \n\nShe'd been sexting the guy telling him what she wanted him to do to her and he'd sent a picture of his member. I confront her, do the usual how long has it gone on for etc. She admits she's sent a picture of her boobs to him and that he was wanting him to meet up with her and she'd been chatting to him like this for 2 weeks.\n\nEarly January we broke up, I told my close friends what had happened and it turns out another one of my friends that I don't really speak to had mentioned it to another colleague from work, whom I then had to explain it to.\n\nEx didn't turn up for work and told her manager she was having a \"bad day\" then that was it. So I feel a little bad that she felt (I presume) too ashamed to come into work, but a part of me is happy not to have to keep it to myself and pretend like nothing happened.\n\nI expect a fair judgement from all you lovely people. \n\nThanks.",

      "description": "First time poster, on a throwaway because I don’t know how controversial this might be. I’m also on mobile So I apologize if anything is incorrect. \nI need to start with some context so apologies in advance if it’s a tad bit lengthy. \nOn Snapchat today I posted a story about a neighbor who threatened and used racial slurs towards two children I was babysitting at the time for riding their bikes too close to their house (we live on a very small dead end road right next to a main road so I usually let them ride their bikes up and down the street, because no one ever comes up here) \nthe kids were on the public road but the neighbors came out and chased the children down the road calling them slurs and threatening them with a shovel. The family later moved away because they did not feel safe because where I live there is only older white married couples. \nI posted about this on Snapchat today in a text post on my story where I did put the n word in asterisks only leaving the first and last letter so you could see what it meant. I DID NOT type the n word out. (I’m a teenaged white girl for context)\nA girl I’ve never met messaged me and this happened \nGirl:L\nMe:Me\nL: Are you white or black\nMe: I’m white, why\nL: then you should never use the n word, not even if you censor it\nMe: I never meant to be racist. I just put what my neighbor said for context\nL: It doesn’t matter, that’s racist even if you censor it\nI blocked her, because honestly I was confused because I didn’t think that was racist at all. I’ve never done anything racist in my life and I’m afraid if even censoring the n word crosses a line. \nAITA?\n",

      "description": "Ok so basically some back story is me and this girl used to date somewhere around the begining of the year and I had to break up because I needed to prioritize my studies than anything ,but she didn't want to accept it. After a few months pass by we start talking for a few. During our conversation i considered her as friends and nothing more. She would then start to call me babe and names like that. I thought of it as a friendly thing and nothing more. She then starts to post about us and starts telling people that we were in a relationship the problem was that I wasn't aware of this at all. Later on when I find out that people are telling her that I want to get back with her (which I did not) I tell her I'm sorry but I cannot be in a relationship becuase of alot of factors. The factors being that im not in a stable mental condition extremely stressed and trying my best to improve my grades. I told her all this because she wouldn't leave me while I was trying to study for my finals (and all of it is true). The next day I get a text message from her best friend saying that she has passed away. The second I hear that I start bursting in tears I keep asking how and he replies with stuff like \"you don't deserve to know you never loved her\" but in-between the he tells me that she got an anxiety and Asma attack. He then tells me about how he heard her heart monitor read no pulse. The problem is I cannot go and check myself on anything he says becuase of the major factor that I live far away and I also have a final exam the next day. I start spamming both of their phones with calls after calls and I get no answer from either of them. The guys then tells me that they are giving her for and from the way he described it to me the doctors took their time to think of giving cpr and they spent a good amount of time doing it (at this point I start to turn skeptical becuase a brain without oxygen for even a few minutes can cause severe brain damage) I leave the situation as it is and continue studying because I'm going no where with calling them and no matter my situation my exam will not be postponed. She then calls me later at night asking me if I am fine and that she is in a hospital bed. Her voice just sounded tired. She tries to ask me if I still love her and I go around the question becuase of the possibility she is in an actual hospital bed. The next day I finished my exams and went back home to prepare for a big party me and my friends were going to. After getting ready and preparing to go to the party location she calls me and tells me she's drunk and with her friend and the driver is under the influence and driving. I get worried and drive the car with them to make sure everybody is alright and nothing wrong happens. She keeps trying to touch me and hold me for some reason and I tell her I'm in the middle of driving and there are people in the car. I take everybody with me in the car to the party. While we're there I keep constantly telling her that I am not interested in having a relationship atleast with her because of all the reasons I mentioned before. And she keeps asking the same questions over and over again even when the answers were obvious and exactly the same. So I just suddenly snap after half an hour of repeating my answers in the the least idele place (a party) and loose all my patience. I just say that I don't want to be with you and that I'm a complete ass hole and everything you keep saying just leave me alone and that I'm going to enjoy the party. I run upstairs and she keeps blocking my way,  pushing me downstairs, and forcefully holding my hand. Completely by accident while going upstairs she falls becuase of how hard I'm trying to run away from this situation. When she falls it looks bad so I go back down to check if she's alright and to tell her I'm really sorry.  She then starts begging me to kiss her on the lips good bye. I tell her I don't not want to and she keeps forcing me again and again into doing it. I then tell her that I'll give a hug and that's it. Eventually she goes back home in a taxi with one of her friends (who I asked her to). The next day I get a text message from her friend (the one from the begining of the story) telling me she's been admitted to a hospital becuase she fell into a coma around 3 A.M. and he continues to tell me that she was found around 5 A.M.. Again this sounds really unautheic and was expecting the same ending as last the last time. AND MIRACULOUSLY IT DID! She has died twice and lived to tell the tale twice sounding as if she just woke up and was able to go the next day and get drunk each day.",

      "description": "I need the unbiased Reddit users of this sub to tell me whether I'm being an asshole in this situation because I've received mixed feedback from the people in my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy best friend got engaged to a guy who over the course of their 10-month relationship has cheated on her multiple times with multiple women, broken up with her more times than I can count, and just put her through hell in general. She's not having a bridal party and seeing as the two of us live about three hours from each other we haven't talked much about what's going on with the wedding until a few days ago when I received an invitation in the mail. Now, I love my best friend but can't stand the guy she's dating because every time he would cheat on her or dump her or whatever I was the one she called or came to crying and I was the one to pick up the pieces. And I was happy to do that the first time it happened but as their relationship continued and she repeatedly took him back I became less inclined to comfort her when something happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I thought about it a lot and decided that I really wasn't happy that they were getting married and that me being at her wedding would only put me in a bad mood and I wouldn't be able to guarantee that I could keep my mouth shut about my disapproval. I don't want to ruin her wedding by being a bitch. So, rather than sending my RSVP as no without any explanation I called her up and tried to explain my thinking to her. She knows I don't like him so I thought she would understand where I was coming from, even if she was upset which I couldn't fault her for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe did not understand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got in a huge argument about it. She said that I'm her best friend and should be happy for her because she's happy regardless of who it's with. I said that I couldn't be because I knew what kind of guy he was and knew how this marriage was going to end. I see where she's coming from and if it were just a guy I didn't get along with but that treated her right I would be over the moon for her but this guy treats her like shit and I don't want to validate her choice to let him by supporting her marriage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to go?",

      "description": "Throwaway for this post. Backstory \n\nDec 2017, my bf\\[27M\\] and I talked about getting engaged. I gave him a link to my pinterest with ring styles i liked, and left it at that, expecting him to propose.   \n\n\nfor context, a lot of my bf's friends were getting engaged and he was helping them plan and execute their proposals-- and he seemed to enjoy doing so. There was one friend, however, who decided to propose at his gf's home in an \"ordinary\" manner ( which is great if thats what youre into!) My BF, however, thought it was lame because in his mind proposals are grand events. He made it a point to mention this to me...god knows why. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, one day in his car he pulled over after our date and started saying sentimental stuff. my face lit up because i thought this was gonna be him proposing.... On seeing my reaction, he laughed at me. Said he wasnt proposing at that moment, but watching my reaction was \"hilarious\". This was right around christmas time. \n\nFast forward to February and he announces we're engaged?  No proposal. Instead, his family came to my familys home and asked my parents for my hand (which is tradition).  He tells me to pick out a ring online and use his credit card to pay. I did pick out a ring  (but ended up paying for half of it myself). His family then mocked me for my choice of ring (I didnt want diamond, went with moissanite). \n\n Anyway, its a year later, we've since gotten married.  i voiced my dissatisfaction with how the engagement happened. He wants to \"re-do\" the proposal, but i told him I dont want a \"re-do\". He thinks that makes me an asshole (not letting him fix his mistakes). AITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway account here as she is on reddit, too.  I'm really struggling with this one.  \n\nMy wife and I generally get along great. We rarely argue, and when we do, we resolve it and move on.  No big issues to the relationship, and very few little ones.  Definitely my soul mate.  \n\nThe only thing that's come up as an issue between us is the time she spends on her phone.  When we first started going out this was a frequent issue between us.   I spend very little time on social media, and she was on it constantly on her phone when we were together and it really bugged me.  From her point of view I was being controlling and telling her what she could and couldn't do.  From my point of view I was totally fine with her being as active on social media and YouTube as she wanted, but since our time together was limited due to our schedules, I really wanted our time to be our time.  She had lots of opportunity when I was at work and she was off to keep up on her favorite Youtubers.  Her family lives in a different time zone, so I'm totally fine if she needs to text with them when they're available, but when we're at dinner or hanging around the house I want to talk to her, not sit and watch her scroll through Instagram.  Just to be clear, I don't have any suspicions that she's doing anything sneaky.  She's not texting exes or sexting strangers.  \n\nIt came to a head about six months after we started going out, and after several big arguments we worked out some ground rules she and I could both live with.  Things were good for a while.  \n\nFast forward to the past few months, and things have been creeping back to how they used to be.  She's been under a lot of stress, and with maybe a little depression, so I haven't said anything so far and have just been dealing with it.  She lost her phone for a couple of days recently, though, and I remembered why I made such a big deal out of this.  Without her phone around we had much more engaged, animated conversations.  We'd cuddle up in bed and talk instead of me reading a book and her being on her phone.  We talked about more than what posts we've seen on Reddit or Insta.  Damn, I wish it could be that way all the time.  \n\nSo am I being a controlling husband, or do I just miss my wife's company?  Thanks.  Looking forward to y'all's feedback.  ",

      "description": "  I will preface this by saying I'm not the best at expressing myself through text and if it doesn't completely make sense I'm sorry. I'll try to answer any questions. I'm really looking for honest advice here and if I'm the asshole I'm okay with that.\n\n  Little bit of backstory. Im a mechanic and always have been. I generally go out of my way to help friends and family with vehicle problems, because the cost of repairs can get pretty crazy. I usually just ask for the favor to be retuned or for very little money. The most ive ever charged someone was like $300, to fix a transmission issue in a powerstroke, which entailed removing the trans about 3 times before finally fixing the problem. I dont general work on fords, so it took a few tries to get all the issues figured out. Ive done hundreds of repairs for literally pennies on the dollar. My rule of thumb is you never ask for a discount, but you also never charge a friend full price. We all need money so i feel wierd taking from a friend.\n\n\n   My wife has a friend that does photography and is wanting her to take some pictures for us. I understand that photography is time consuming, but this person wants $600 for 1 session and i think we will end up with maybe 10 pictures. My wife has watched this persons child for $15/hr and has gotten up to about $300 so far. My wife has taken care of a child for 20+ hrs and is only halfway to the cost of 1 photo session. \n\n   So i completely understand that this is how they make there money and i would never complain to them about it, but everytime my wife brings it up i feel extra salty about it. I really just feel like it is ridiculous and a very unfair trade off. We recently had pictures taken at another professional place and im very pleased with what got and spent under $400. \n\n  Am i the asshole for bitching at my wife about this? Should i just accept it for what it is or am i right to feel this way?",

      "description": "I’m a junior in high school who has some lofty goals for college, and I understand that part of the process for really good schools is getting a good ACT score. I took it last summer and got a 34 composite, and I now have a 35 superscore. I thought that that was good enough, but I didn’t study that much for it (just took a practice test and reviewed some techniques). My worst section was math, mostly because the math on the ACT is from classes I haven’t taken in a few years, so I was a little rusty. However, I’m proud with my score and feel like it is more than adequate.\n\nMy parents, however, don’t think the same way. They think I need to take the ACT one more time, and put some serious study time into it. I don’t really want to (but am anyways) and expressed my frustration with them.\n\nMy logic: my score is still really good. The ACT is supposed to be an aptitude (predictor of future success) test rather than an achievement (test of learned skills) test, so studying for the ACT is learning to get good at the ACT and not good for what the test actually wants to test. I don’t want to take it again and take the time to study when I could do other things. Also, the other parts of my application are strong, so if my ACT is “weak” to my parents, they’re forgetting that I have other stuff as well. Also, I feel like if I took it again I’d be doing it for them and not for myself which makes me feel icky. I feel like I’d only be getting my score up so they could show off or something, which I know they wouldn’t but still feel like they would.\n\nTheir logic: I could improve my score. I know I could do better if I studied more, and one or two more points on the composite could possibly sway my results for college admission. There’s no harm in taking it again, and I’ll be happy if I improve anyways, even if I’m upset about it now.\n\nAITA for being mad at my parents about retaking this test?",

      "description": "My son is in the US Navy and I, like most parents, am very proud of his service. I have bumper stickers on my truck that say ‘proud navy dad’ and T-shirt’s that say similar things, or just ‘Navy’ and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he’s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I’ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it’s happens I’ve always immediately corrected them and they’d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son’s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it’s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was ‘stolen valor’ for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of ‘stolen valor’ even if it’s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I’ve recovered since then.)",

      "description": "So back the end of 2017 my dad had a heart attack. It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?",

      "description": "I think there are three things you have to understand about me to get this story:\n\n1. I grew up in Indiana. In the place I used to live white nationalism was a normal thing. It's really embarrassing to admit, but if you'd met me eight years ago or so you might have heard me say things like - Africans have a genetic predisposition toward low iq. I'm really embarrassed that at one time I normalized and actively spread hate speech and was just so ignorant - even if I was really young. Currently twenty-eight.\n2. I'm a professional scientist now. I take a lot of pride in my work. I really value truth. I'm a bit of a quiet activist too. I spend time volunteering, donating, do a lot of research in medicine.\n3. I'm extremely quiet, awkward, and I don't really have a lot of friends outside of my SO and my family - but everyone in my family and my SO are extroverts.\n\nSo I'm at my older brother's party, and we're sitting in a circle playing Codenames. We really like boardgames and music. One of my older brother's friends had competed in a race earlier that weekend and done middlingly. He commented something like - \"well if I had the extra bone in my foot like black people I'd have done better.\"\n\nI realize I was being a little bit sensitive, but I tried to be immediately dismissive of the comment. I replied along the lines of - \"come on man, that's just some crappy rumor. There's not much genetic differences between the races. Trust me, my PhD is in medicine lol.\"\n\nThen my older brother cuts in and I'll paraphrase the conversation:\n\nBrother: \"there's no bone, but black people are genetically stronger and faster.\"\n\nMe: \"The primary genetic trait that's unique to black skinned people is extra melanin in the skin. I'm pretty sure that there's no evidence that there's significant difference in athletic ability between people with different skin tone.\"\n\nBrother: \"no, it's been proven.\" - pulls up some trash article\n\nMe: \"That's not how proof works, there has to be a real, mechanistic, intervention-based scientific investigation\"\n\nBrother: finds an article from very junky scientific journal \"No see, I found this scientific study. If there's a study, there's at least evidence that it's true.\"\n\nMe: \"That's not how science works, you need a community consensus. Not one sample that's not even well peer-reviewed\"\n\nBrother: \"Well, it's enough data for me that I'm not going to change my mind.\"\n\nMe: \"It's not just about changing your dumb-ass mind, we're in front of a group of people and when you emphasize poorly-supported divisive ideas, you make all these people in this room more comfortable with ideas that inch towards racism. You normalize it.\"\n\nBrother: \"Well, I don't care because I don't want to change my ideas.\"\n\nMe: \"that is the most ass-headed way to think about things. Why wouldn't you trust me? I'm a professional scientist in a closely related field. All I do is try to evaluate truth in things like this.\"\n\nBrother's-Friend: \"Jesus Knoxvillefox, you're making this party really awkward for everyone. You should just drop it so everyone can have fun.\"\n\nMe: \"I don't care, I'm not going to sit here and let my own blood normalize anything even approaching racism. And I'm not going to let him normalize bull-headedness and a consumer's approach to reading research. Because there's also plenty of data out there that falsely asserts that black people are iq-inferior to people with different skin colors and we should be guarding ourselves against believing anything that's written in a book or journal.\"\n\nAt that point I'm sort of raising my voice. Not yelling, but definitely stern and angry. We argued for a while until I had to leave. I feel bad in retrospect :c",

      "description": "First, sorry for my bad english.\n\nI was with my ex two years until she cheated on me. Those two years are the only good experience I've had in my life, they are like a treasure to me. Then she cheated on me, I forgave her, she cheated on me again and she left me. Even though it would have hurt, I would not have minded breaking up if she did not love me anymore, but instead she cheated on me. This was half a year ago, I do not even know anything about her right now, but at the time I demanded her to not continue to be with the person she cheated onme with because that was just what made me feel replaced, I thought that it was taken for granted but it seems that I am the only person who thinks this way. I think that if you cheat someone you should stop seeing the person with whom you cheated, not continue to take away your former partner's value, try to maintain the value of those years you spent. Since that day I feel replaced, ironically that day has been the best I've felt so far, because every day that passes, I feel worse, and 6 months have passed, people often forget over time, but I day I feel that I have less dignity if they continue to see and I am still tempted to demand it again. Those years that I was with her I do not want to change them for anything in the world, but she has only made it more difficult for me, taking away their value day after day. For me it's the only nice thing I've had and I do not want it to end up knowing I'm being replaced. God, I haven't even told my friends about the cheating part and I'm not going to. I still feel the need for her to find someone else, whoever it is, just to think that there was no one who valued more than me from one day to another. I think I would have done the same for her without needing to be demanded for it, although I would not have cheated on her anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking this way?",

If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?",

I figured it was no big deal I could just give the unused ones to my friend or something and buy the regular ones I like. My girlfriend suggested I leave a bad product review, but I told her I didn’t want to bother with that. \n\nThis morning I got an email from amazon that said “Thank you for your product review!” on the condoms we bought. It was a one star negative review that stated neither of us enjoyed them. The review also has my first and last name publicly available. This bothers me because I’m a private person and don’t want my friends or family or people I do business with to see that (even if it’s a small chance). \n\nI’m also not sure if I should be mad that she used my phone without me knowing (she has my password) and used my account to post the review without telling me. I don’t know if I should be mad or not.",

It got worse last week when he spotted me checking her out, and now he goes out of his way to ignore me. His girlfriend however, understands that I didn’t mean to offend him and has tried to convince him to spend time with me again, but he refuses.

      "description": "She’s had a history of depression for the past 5 years or so (started in high school, she’s a college Junior). I like being there for her; I see her almost every single day, and we live in apartments just over a mile from each other. Yet, she dumps all of her emotional baggage on me, and not any of her three female roommates (one of whom she declares her best friend). The aforementioned best friend seldom knows about it when my gf has this bouts of depression, simply because gf hides it from her. And, gf’s best friend and I are pretty much the only people she hangs out with regularly. She almost exclusively vents to me, and I feel worn out most times, but she also gets upset with me for “not showing that I care” about her emotions very often.  \nAlso, I always sleep poorly when we share a bed, just because she makes it hard for me to move in her sleep. I don’t hold that against her, but I do try to avoid sharing a bed more than 3-4 nights in a row. \n\nSo that’s the background. \n\nShe stays at my place more than I do hers, simply because her complex is more than happy to give you a parking ticket if you lack their validation. Exclusions are weekdays between 9p and 8a, and all day Saturday/Sunday. Tonight, she needs to study for two exams she has in the morning. She asked me to come over to her place and help her study and leave in the morning (meaning I’d get about 5 hours of sleep at best), even though I work in the morning. I told her I’m emotionally drained right now, being her only support group, and I just need to rest; so, I’d like to just sleep at my place and have her go to hers. What I requested is exactly what happened. Should I have pushed through and dealt with more crappy sleep, or should I be selfish and keep myself together? AITA?",

We usually don't talk a lot, but sometimes we'll chat a bit when our parents aren't home. So one day he decides to tell me he's done different types of drugs, that he's done it multiple times and that he uses it quite frequently, and I'm just kind of like \"That's not very good.\"\n\nHe said he only did stuff like snuff and sometimes vaped with friends, but insists he's not addicted and that he'll never do cocaine or other stronger substances. \n\nI was kind of split on what to do, so I just ended up encouraging him to tell our parents, which he then ended up doing after I reminded him a couple of times.\n\nAfterwards my mom questioned me because she found out I knew about it when they didn't, but I hadn't told them. My reasoning was that he'd no longer trust me if I told them, and that he had asked me multiple times to not tell our parents, but my mom still seemed to be upset that I did not tell them about it. I see why she would be on som parts, but I was not sure what to do.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "At the end of last month, I told my apartment that the drain in my shower was draining really slowly. Like, it would take more than twelve hours for it to fully drain. I tried fixing it myself, but ultimately turned it over to them. The next week, it wasn't draining at all, so I went back to update them. They said they'd get someone out that day and I gave them permission to enter if I wasn't there, but I came back from work that day and there was still 6 inches of stagnant water. I told a maintenance guy about it this last Friday when some contractors came through to fix my drywall (got new wiring for washer and dryer installed in November) but I again came home to it not being fixed.\n\nSo today, I went down to the office vented my frustration with them because it had been two or three weeks since I told them about it and they hadn't done anything. I'll be honest, I was a little (albeit, not overly) antagonistic as I felt that I was allowed to be at that point; specifically, when they said they were gonna get someone out that day, I asked if it was gonna be like last time where I would come back to my shower still being messed up.\n\nThey did ultimately fix it today, but it still took them two and a half weeks and I had to go down there three times to get it fixed. So I sent an email to their corporate office expressing my overall frustration with the experience. I sent it not even 45 minutes after the maintenance guy told me fixed my drain.\n\nTL;DR the apartment took forever to fix my shit and I bitched to corporate office right after they fixed it.\n\nAlso, I want to mention this to be fair, that drywall being messed up for so long was not their fault. Some residents were uncooperative when they came by to fix that.",

      "description": "Throwaway because little bro browses Reddit. I'm currently struggling with the success my brother is having and I feel like it's destroying my relationship with him. I know I'm going to sound really bad from what I write but I'm just being completely honest. I (41) have been having a real hard time speaking to or speaking about my brother (27) ever since he graduated from college and got a good job. To put it bluntly, I'm jealous. Jealous because I didn't get the same opportunities as him. Our parents lived in a 2nd world country and by the time I came to the United States, my little brother was only 4 and I was already done with what is HS here in the U.S. He got the privilege of going to American schools and speak English at a pretty much native level while I had to struggle like crazy to learn it. He always had a knack for school, I didn't. I hated school because I felt so stupid not knowing English. My brother and his wife got together when they were 14 (around there I think) and they got pregnant at 18. My whole family gave them shit for it and I did too because I felt it was my responsibility as an older brother to tell him how badly they messed up. Well, beyond my expectations, both he and his wife worked throughout college and he graduated and got a job as a software engineer and she got a job as a nurse. It killed me. At 24 I wasn't doing anything like that. I was working shit jobs without any motivation. I make good money, but nowhere near what he makes (not sure exactly how much he makes but I have an idea). He gets a ton of benefits, a bunch of vacation, can work from home...like wtf? How is that even possible? I struggle to just get one day off! I not once have asked him about his job because I can't stand it. I don't want to know about it and whenever someone else brings him up or his job, I just leave because of how depressed and angry it makes me. I am never mean to him btw. This is all stuff I keep inside of me but it's ruining how I feel about him. I really want to see their new home but, just the thought of it makes me sick. He makes me feel like a loser and I don't really have anymore excuses to reject his invitations. Am I the asshole? Again, I've never been mean or visually upset at him; but is it wrong for me to feel this way or jealous? I'm human, I can't help it. ",

I’ve ended up with them because I babysit for her sometimes, it’s going to cost around $1500 to have my place treated. Anyone my kids and I have visited, sat on their furniture or rode in their vehicle, I’ve informed them of our situation so they can take action themselves. I told my sister she should stop taking her kids to her sitters house and inform the sitter of the bug problem, but my sister refuses to say anything because then she’ll lose the sitter. I want to tell the sitter because I know how quickly the infestation can spread and how expensive it is. Would I be a asshole if I told the sitter? ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years I’m 22 and he’s 33 and lately I have been suspicious of him possibly cheating.\n\nMy main issue is him being iffy about his phone such as me even touching it or on one occasion where I wanted to call my phone because I had lost it (btw I am not one of those gfs who demands to go on his phone and never have I entertained the thought of going on it when he left the room although he has done that to mine, but I respect his privacy) however he grabbed it out of my hand before I could even turn it on. \n\nThere’s been many occasions of that as well as him having condoms by his bed that we never used and were open and seemed used. I asked him about it and he just stumbled over his words and seemed to give me a bs answer but I didn’t prod. \n\nHe lives an hour away from me and we used to see each other every weekend but lately it has been a lot less, him claiming to be working more which I can believe and wouldn’t mind at all, but there are many inconsistencies such as the time we were in the car with his mother (after he told me he was working later so I had to leave soon) and she had asked him what he was doing that day and he looked nervous, but didn’t mention that he was working later which I found odd but perhaps I was overly paranoid given the previous two instances.\n\nThe reason I’ve been so cautious more observant of these things is because while we were on a break a while ago, but getting back together that weekend I was FaceTiming his niece on his phone and he got a text message from a girl saying “I miss you so much” and he snatched the phone out of my hand and got visibly angry and said it was his cousin which was total BS. I let it go and he kept trying to guilt buy me stuff the rest of the day which I refused and when I got home I asked his relative (who is also my best friend and who I met him from) if she had a relative of that girls name, she said no and I confronted him about it and he kept denying it before he eventually told me that he was talking to someone else, but they only ever talked and not done anything sexual which I don’t believe but w/e. \n\nI asked him about all of this and he gave me shit answers that didn’t really answer my questions so I broke it off with him quite badly; however, later got back with him, but it’s still nagging at me so much as he is one of the sweetest people I’ve ever known, but his libido is out of control and I wouldn’t doubt he’d do anything given I wouldn’t find out about it.\n\nAm I just being an over paranoid asshole or is this deserving of being skeptical over?",

      "description": "I live in a small dorm room and my roommate and I have gotten along pretty well for a while, but recently (around decemberish?) she starting having long conversations over FaceTime past 11pm. \n\nI know I’ll already seem like an asshole by saying I’m a studious person who goes to sleep early, but she wasn’t having important discussions, she was gossiping for hours on end. We have a lot of mutual friends and so I knew that when she was talking to them, they were just fucking around. I’m fine with that, but then one night, she didn’t hang up until 2am and I had a final the next day. Once again, we live in a small dorm room and she is kind of a loud person. \n\nI told her “[her name], I always remind you to hang up before midnight. I really need sleep.”\n\nTo be totally fair, I was afraid to flat out say “I need you to hang up at (x time) because I want to go to sleep earlier.” I did, however, tell her to go to sleep for a solid 5 nights in a row around 11:45ish. \n\nI ended up talking to our “dorm advisor” as we call her, and she said that I need to file a formal complaint with our school. She talked to my roommate (without my knowledge) and now my roommate hates me. \n\nShe didn’t stop. I asked our other RAs (I’m one of them) what to do, and they suggested I apply for a transfer next semester, but we’ve been friends for a while and I don’t want to lose a friendship over this. \n",

      "description": "Get ready, because this is a long one.\n\nFor reference, I sell body jewelry.  I’ve been doing so for about two years now.  I know everyone in the industry in the area now and there is exactly one shop I’ll go to BECAUSE of this incident.\n\nI had my nipples pierced about a year and a half ago in a different local shop. I’d met the piercer in passing a little while before this and he came highly recommended by a friend. My piercer was out for health reasons, and I knew I wasn’t gonna do it if I didn’t do it that day, so I trusted my friend’s judgement and went to him.\n\nHe was very cocky and sarcastic through the whole process.  Not my favorite, but whatever.  First nipple went in fine.  In a moment of mid-piercing desperation, I asked him to put the second needle in before he did the jewelry for the first.  He smirked and said no.  Second was a lot more painful and came out crooked.  I normally taking pain pretty well but holy hell, that shit hurted.  I was really lightheaded and almost fainted; he put a cold washcloth on my forehead and said nothing, then left the room.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, he came back in and asked how I was doing.  I said I was fine and wanted to leave.  My friend that had recommended him was with me and wanted to get an opinion on a bump on her nose ring.  I threw on my shirt and went out to the waiting area.\n\nAfter we got in the car, she told me that he had said I was a “pussy” and I should “get out of the industry” if I can’t handle such a “simple piercing”.  She’d known him for a couple years at this point and even she was shocked.  I cried a lot about his comments and my crooked piercing.  I still haven’t taken it out because it healed okay and I don’t wanna go through the trouble of getting it redone again.\n\nWhile at work today, I had three women come in.  They were all quite friendly and one in particular was looking for jewelry.  She got her nose pierced by the same guy, who now works out of a different shop, and was having trouble with it.  I recommended jewelry for her and sent her to my guy to change it.  I also asked her how she liked him, she said she didn’t, and then asked why I had said that.  I paraphrased my story.  She wasn’t surprised.  She bought her stuff and left. \n\nWhile I had been telling the story, another woman had walked up and started looking at jewelry.  After the other people left, she said it was unprofessional of me to be badmouthing piercers and that she was going to call customer service to complain about me, (joke’s on her, we’re a tiny company.  My DM handles any complaints.). I told her that it was only my experience there, it wasn’t an unwarranted personal attack by any means.  She didn’t listen.  I already texted my DM and gave her a heads up, she’s heard the story before and is kinda indifferent on me repeating it as long as it’s not embellished or me bringing it up with no reason.\n\nSo...  AITA for talking shit about an unprofessional piercer, or should I have kept it to myself?",

      "description": "My neighbor who is also my ex and I are renting two separate areas from a landlord who lives in his house. In order to get to my car without walking around the whole house and using another gate I cut through her gate. She has said it freaks her out when I walk through her gate at 5:30 in the morning and wants me to say hello everyday. But most of the time I'm running late or she's sleeping so I just pass through quietly. She says it's creepy and wants to lock the gate, and threatens to lock the gate when I use the gate without saying hello then will text me throughout the day upset with insults. I sort of think she's just starting problems because she knows my schedule and knows its me, not an intruder and can hear my car start up afterwards. The landlord said it's fine and when I use his gate, all his dogs start barking so I want to avoid that. Should I have to pay a troll toll every time I make a five foot cut through? I've offered to ring a bell as I passed through or knock on the door but I don't want to wake her up and she sleeps with the lights on so I never know if she's awake. Should I just pay the troll toll every morning and wake her up? Amta?",

      "description": "So, me and my friend have been really close friends for around 2,5 - 3 years. When we started communicating she was in uncomfortable situation, or better said: she broke up with her boyfriend, she was not satisfied from her work, wanted to try to work in the field of graphic design (i work in this field, she is an architect, so we started working on projects), she was single all the time. We used to see or call each other almost every day, she was  available for work or hanging out. Of course, she was also very good friend and co-worker of mine as well, I can not say nothing but the best for her.\n\nHowever, in the beginning of the summer, we went to another city (4 hours drive) for an exhibition where she caught a boyfriend. She also got promoted at work. More over, she started working on her own even though in the past we used to work almost everything together. If not, we would be at least updating each other all the time. As the time was passing, I realize that she seems to be less and less interested in our friendship. I feel like there is no space for me in her life. She is emotionally stable with her new boyfriend, totally over her ex one, does not need help with her graphic design work, got promoted at her architecture work, and goes out with other people for socializing. I have the impression that she is contacting me only when she needs something or commenting on some Instagram stories. \n\nLets make it clear, i am happy for everything that happens to her, and i do not have any romantic feelings towards her. I just feel left and lonely because she is losing touch with me more and more. I am afraid that i might me possessive or jealous but i do not think that is the problem here. Every comment would be much appreciated.",

      "title": "AITA for asking my GF to spend more weekends with me and less with her family (and eventually friends)?",
      "description": "First of all a little bit of background: I'm a 22 years old male, my GF is 21. Since we live considerably far from one another (65 km) and mainly because she's the only one having a car, since I'm disabled and cannot afford a car with the changes it would need, considering the things I would need it for, and she already had one, we see each other only during weekends. We are almost all weekends at my home, since her house is too small for me to sleep there, she shares her room with her little sister and there's no room for me, we've tried it a few times but it didn't work out. When she comes, either at my mom's house, or my dad's house (they're divorced) which I go to from time to time, she comes here Saturday morning around 11:30 A.M and leaves on Sunday in the afternoon. During the week we see each other only when we attend courses at uni, which is from the end of September to the end of December, and from the end of February to the end of May: we go to courses together, we have lunch and study together, but of course we don't do any of the proper \"couple's stuff\" in that time, like going for walks, on dates or so on. Due to this situation, and considering that we have built a strong bond as a couple even though we haven't been dating for that long (in March we'll celebrate our second anniversary), I am particularly attached to our weekends together, also because a nice group formed with my friends and their partners, on top of it all. Now, it has to be said that she has been raised in a pretty oppressive family, that has never given her much space or freedom growing up, keeping her tied to some \"rituals\" forcefully, independently from their objective importance. She is with her family all day, her father has a job which allows him to be home every weekend and to be home every evening by 07:00 P.M, not including all of the holidays and days off work. Her mother is a housewife, and her sister is much younger than her, so they live together. Despite this, it happens that we skip weekends for reasons that I consider to be stupid, like the fact the she had to take her sister to see the high school she would have attended (my GF is the only one to drive in her family, her parents haven't driven in years despite having the driving license), staying at home for minor religious celebration (her family is profoundly Catholic), and birthdays that could be celebrated during the weekdays, since all of her family members that would attend them live very very close to each other, less than a kilometer apart, and stuff like this. She doesn't think I'm wrong about this whole situation, but won't actively oppose to it. As an added motivation to keep this trend, she said that doing so she has the chance to see friends that live in her area that she doesn't see much more often, despite the fact that she can meet them during the weekdays, and that this year only she has already planned three vacations (for a total of 15 days) exclusively with her friends, without involving me. I protested regarding this last thing as well, but my position hasn't been considered, because she said that none of her friends are going to bring their BFs. Am I the asshole for have asked her to at least try to not skip the weekends that we do skip for the reasons I listed previously? Am I being unreasonable in doing this request?",

      "description": "Here's the story:\n\nIn the Summer of 2016, so about a year and a half ago, I (24f at the time) stepped out of the shower to grab a towel and noticed my step-brother (16m at the time) holding his Go-Pro on a selfie stick up through the laundry chute, as to catch me naked since I have to reach over the chute to grab a towel from the shelf. My Mother was in Florida, at the time, so I was home alone with my step-father and step-brother. My relationship with both is more or less non-existent. We don't speak and it isn't a secret that we don't like each other very much. Because of this, I did not confront step-bro until my Mom returned from Florida. At which point, she told step-dad and they took step-bro's go-pro away and that was it... No apology, no punishment, no \"consent talk\", nothing. \n\nSince then, I have been pretty transparently rude and passive-aggressive towards step-bro. Such as making comments loud enough for him to hear, refusing to go to any \"family\" functions with him, and complaining about pretty much everything he does.  This has caused recurring arguments between my Mother and I, and I am asking this today, a year and a half later, because today she told me \"I need to let go of the hate, I'm too lovely of a person, and its unhealthy.\" \n\nI also want to add that this shower incident isn't the only reason for my resentment. He makes the entire living situation difficult, he leaves messes everywhere and never cleans up after himself, he purposefully pees all over the toilet seat and bathroom floor, blasts music, and him and his girlfriend have sex very loudly right next to my room. All of which I have complained about multiple times but the parents don't discourage any of his behavior. Also want to explain that I suffer from panic disorder with agoraphobia, so I can't work, which is why I still live at home. I'm moving out soon, as my husband and I are in the process of buying a home.\n\nAnyway, am I the asshole for still being upset all this time later? I still feel violated, and I feel very angry that everyone else in the family acts like I don't have a reason to be upset. Every time I bring it up my Mother makes me feel like I'm being unreasonable and that what happened wasn't even bad enough for me to still complain about it. \n\ntl;dr Step brother filmed me in the bathroom, never apologized, and I've been a bitch ever since.

      "description": "My wife currently super pregnant with baby #3 and we have twins who are almost 2. The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?",

      "description": "So I currently run business in a small office building. I have the largest suite with a lot of foot traffic from my 20 sales reps. My neighbor across the hall has the next largest suite with a lot of foot traffic for their pharmaceutical reps. My neighbor to the right has about 7 employees that do house flipping.\n\nWe all have one private bathroom within our suite with and have access to a public office one in the hallway.\n\nHowever there is one more neighbor with 2 people working. They have the smallest suite in the building with obviously the smallest staff. They do not have a private bathroom and use the one in the hallway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently the office manager has made a change that is the reason for this post. They decided to give the once public hallway bathroom to the 2 people working next door as a private bathroom. Reasoning being \"it's only fair that they get one too\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bothered me because I signed my lease with the understanding that there would be a public bathroom. With the amount of employees I have the one bathroom in my suite is not enough and it is currently placed in a position where everyone can watch you go in, and everyone can watch you come out. It's just a door that enters a broom closet with a toilet seat and sink in the biggest room of the suite. There's just no sense of privacy. I really just want a spot where my people can leave the main room, take care of business, and come back in. The bathroom is in the front of the room so its super visible.\n\nI sent an email to the office manager and landlord to express my concern pretty much asking for the once public bathroom to be back. I feel bad because I am friends with the 2 neighbors next door and they seem pretty happy to have their own private bathroom now. I just also feel annoyed because I have 20 people working all day with others coming in for our retail section and the one bathroom is not cutting it. Frankly I would not have picked this space if it didn't have a public bathroom.\n\nI feel entitled to having a public bathroom because the needs of my 20 are more than the needs of their 2. But that also makes me feel super shitty that I am taking away from their now \"private bathroom\". However when my lease was signed, I did have access to that bathroom so really I'm setting the standard back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel conflicted. I feel like I may be an asshole right now. Maybe I just needed to vent? Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Public bathroom made private by landlord in an office. I want to make it public again but in doing so I take a private bathroom from my neighbor. I have 20 employees vs their 2, however I do also have a private bathroom while they would not if I took it back.",

      "description": " \n\nOkay, here's some background, I promise I am not an entitled brat.\n\nSo  It was a couple years ago in 2017, I had a 10 gallon tank outside,  waiting to be used. (Note I wasn't planning on using it anytime soon,  this is important.) So I go outside to find a big crack in the back of  it, making it unusable. I question my sister, who was 6 at the time, and  she admits it was her fault. It was a complete accident, and she had  gone to our mom about it. What annoyed me was that I was not immediately  told, but I got over that. My mother said she would get me a new tank,  and so I left it at that.\n\nFast Forward  to now, a replacement for the tank has still not been bought. I am  getting into Fish-keeping and breeding on that, so I need a tank to put  Fry(Baby fish) in. I casually ask my parents when they can get the new  tank, and they flat out say they are not getting a new one. I am kinda  taken back by this, considering they said they would. But as I don't  need it asap, as my fish kinda ate their first fry, I am not in a  hurried mood. I brought it up again today, and they said again that they  aren't getting me a new one, even after a friend offered to give me a  50 gallon tank for free.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for trying to get a replacement tank for the one my sister broke?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first time posting anything on reddit, so if there are any questions, just ask.",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I started dating in the middle of the 2016 election. She is apolitical and I am a republican in a liberal state, so I also keep quiet.\n\nHer family, especially her father and brother are extremely liberal. To the point where they talk about it way too much imo. They talked about it when we first met, and I stupidly answered honestly when they asked me what my affiliation is. \n\nThey were sort of rude after I told them, but we were able to move on and me and her father have some common interests sports wise.\n\nHowever after Trump won each member of her family has gotten very political. They straight up say that by remaining silent they are being complicit. They say this on both social media and irl. Whatever, but then i started seeing messages on their facebook that were very insulting.\n\n\"The issue is not just with Trump, but with his supporters. And his election shined a light on how racist america is.\" I am not a racist and I voted for Trump, so I took offense, but i refuse to fight publicly on facebook since people I work with follow me.\n\nBut now I know what they really think of me. So when we meet up again (my gf loves her family and wants me to be apart of it) they start the same old bullshit, and I am straight up asked if I am a racist. This is very insulting to me, especially to ask that in front of other people. I tell her brother that hes out of line for asking that question.\n\nHe then mocks me and asks if im afraid of someone \"taking my job\" in a redneck voice. I am from a rural area and do have an accent. I feel like he is purposely degrading me, my opinions, and where I come from. I say whatever.\n\nSo now the gossip of her family is that im some \"triggered\" (the brothers words) redneck who is insecure and a closeted racist. All because I am a republican. I tell my gf I dont understand why they keep targeting me if they want me to be part of the family, which is what she tells me.\n\nNot only that, now my girlfriends dad is asking pointedly why I am not going to college. I tell him that I am a tradesman (welding) and I am happy where I am. He asks me why i think people with a college education lean democrat. I immediately realize the implication of this conversation and I tell him I don't care either way.\n\nSo now the father, who I once got along with, is insulting me to my face by implying that im stupid. From my point of view, they are being very insulting and degrading to me when I have done nothing to them but try to be apart of their family. \n\nI even helped the younger brother get a great deal on a new car by setting him up with a used car dealer I know, while also showing him how to change the oil on his car since they never learned that stuff.\n\nI refuse to visit her family anymore as things have not gotten better and they wont stop with the politics talk. They are also making me feel insecure about my life and my job. My girlfriend accepts this but tells me she wishes things were different, which makes me feel bad.",

      "description": "My husband and I are trying to keep active by regularly going to the gym. I am a stay-at-home wife (with no children) so my schedule is very flexible. I prefer to work out in the afternoons and my husband prefers to work out when he gets home from work at night. Neither of us want to work out in the morning before he goes to work. The issue is that my husband will usually not go to the gym unless I go too. He says it motivates him for me to go with him. However, I don’t like working out at night and prefer my afternoon workout sessions. I notice that I tend to have less energy at night (yes, I’m sure he has less than I do after a full day at work!) and working out at night messes with my sleep. \n\nI finally told my husband this after months of going with him and while he said he probably will stop going, he understands my point. I really want to motivate him by accompanying him but that means I have to sacrifice what I want to do for him. I do enjoy going with him but I'm not meeting my goals if I do. Unfortunately, a home gym is not an option at this point.\n\nAITA?\n",

We don't text much, usually just to make plans to see each other. \nLately I've been sending texts along the lines of \"hey do you want to hang out next Saturday?\" and he'll open it but not reply. Usually I have to send another text like \"hey I really need to know if we're gonna hang out so I can plan my weekend, get back to me please?\"\n\nAt least once I've had to send a third message telling him I need him to reply and that it hurts me when he opens my texts and doesn't reply. Only then would he respond.\n\nWe had a fight about this last weekend. He says he doesn't reply because he doesn't always know if he'll be free to hang out or not and because he's just too stressed out with college and work.\n\nAm I being too harsh?",

      "description": "So I recently moved out of my rented flat(which I loved, rip) I shared with my friend and moved in with my dad as I have gotten into a bit of debt and my dad said I could live with him rent free in his spare room until I get back on my feet. The only furniture in the room besides my own is my older sister's old bedframe and mattress. My sister has never lived at my dads before but she has moved flats numerous times over the past few years, her last move being to an already furnished flat so she was using my dads spare room as storage for her old bed, it had been sitting there unused for about a year. \nMy sister was fine with me using the bed at first but about a week ago she messaged me saying she's moving (again). She's obviously very excited and sends lots of photos of her really nice flat and then she tells me she's gonna need to bed back.\nI say that's fine, ask when she's moving in and she tells me she gets the keys in a few days but is still trying to get out the lease on her current flat and will take another 3 weeks. \nMy mum(who was on holiday at the time) called sometime later and said she'll go halfers to just get my sister a new bed for her flat so I didn't have to worry about getting a new bed for myself and said that we can sort out costs when she gets back in a few days. \n\nThe next day my sister gets the keys to the flat and won't stop messaging me for the money for the new bed. I told her just to wait a few days so mum could help me out as I was having money problems. She then calls our dad asking him to give her money, so I tell her again that me and mum are going to pay for it in a few days and to stop with the constant messaging. My sister isn't the most patient person. She then messages back about how nice she is being about the whole situation considering I'm sleeping in her bed and she needs to order a bed right now because it takes a while to arrive. We start to argue so eventually I just say 'If you want your bed come and take it, I'll sleep on the floor I don't care, but I'm not giving you any money'....am I the asshole here? \n\n\n\n \n",

      "description": "\nThis is going to be a little long, but the back story is essential for my reasoning.  TL;DR at bottom. \n\nI'm 23. My sister is 16. We have the same dad and different moms. We both had custody agreements growing up that put us both at my dad's on wednesdays and weekends. Being 7 years apart, we weren't the closest. We also had normal sibling problems and fights. Not getting too far into it, she was definitely my dad's favorite. \n\nUntil I was around 12 or 13 my dad was a heavy alcoholic. Very typical alcoholic at that. He used to punch me, treated me like shit, all the bad stuff. I absolutely hated him growing up. But he finally got sober (I'm more than grateful for it.) Which puts my sister at 5 or 6 years old. So she actually got the better version of dad than I did for the majority of her memory. I don't ever remember him ever laying a finger on her, especially the compared to the stuff I got. \n\nFast forward to a couple years ago. I think it started when she turned 13. She started distancing herself from my dad and his family (which is less than 15 people. Small family.) My dad would maybe see her once a month. Then once every 3 months or so. My dad is still kind of a dick, but he has a full heart. He's texted my sister every morning for the past 3 years and never gets a response. She's 90% given up on that side of the family. She says its because of my dads wife, but they've been together for almost 7 years I think, and she loved his wife when they first got together. So none of us really know the reason.  \n\nFast forward again to last summer. My dad hadn't seen my sister in a full year. He gave in and invited her on the yearly family vacation. She went and on the last day, she punched our step brother, (9yrs old) called our step mom a cunt, and raised her hand to swing at our dad. She told my dad, indirectly, that she expects an apology before she'll talk to him. Which to me is fucking outrageous. \n\nMy Baby's due date was right before Christmas.  Before Thanksgiving my sister, at this point still hasn't seen my dad or family, messaged my GF. She asked, \"even though I don't want to see my dad and his family, can I still see the baby?\" I told my GF to tell her, \"no, that isn't fair to your dad.\" She never responded, and now in January, we have a beautiful baby girl and no one has heard from my sister.  My dad and I have great relationship and he absolutely loves his granddaughter. \n\nTL;DR. My sister gave up on our family and I haven't let her meet my baby. \n\nSo back to the point, AITA for not letting my sister meet my baby?\n\n",

      "description": "Okay ok, I know how this sounds but there is some backstory as well. \n\nMy boyfriend(23M) and I are a fairly new couple (1 Year), we’ve had a very open and honest relationship about our pasts with one another since the very beginning. We both in our past were a bit of players for a better word, and we both acknowledge and accept this. \n\nHe’s always been closer with girls and has always had more female friends then male. This has never bothered me as I feel secure in my relationship. However one of his closest and longest friendships was with a girl named Rachel. \n\nRachel and him have has a interesting past, back in high school towards the end of his first relationship he hooked up with her. They continued to be friends with benefits for four years, her always wanting to date him and him never wanting that commitment. They broke things off when my boyfriend discovered she was cheating on her boyfriend(which he was unaware she had) to sleep with him. The two broke contact and reconnected when they turned 20. \n\nAt this point one of them was always in a relationship and they remained only friends. Rachel would always tell him though that if things ever fell through with her current interest, he would always be her option B. She would still flirt with him and any time he showed interest in a girl she would bully anything and everything about her. \n\nIf Rachel wanted to hang out, my boyfriend had to be free or else she would get angry with him and yell at him. Vice versa if he ever wanted to hang out with her she would get mad unless he gave her a week in advanced. She’d say passive aggressive shit to him all the time if he ever did something she didn’t like, or if he was seeing another girl. \n\nAround the time I came into the picture she became more and more determined to hang out with him, and grew increasingly more angry if he was ever busy. He wanted to tell her about me and she shut him down saying she never wanted to hear my name again because it was ‘ugly’ and she decided I was ‘toxic’ for him. \n\nEvery time my boyfriend brought her up to me it was always negative, “Rachel is doing this again”, “Rachel is telling me I can’t do this”, “Rachel said I shouldn’t do that without her permission”. You get the gist. He would constantly remind me how good of friends they were and how she probably hated me because he chose to date me when he never dated her—aka I was constantly reminded that they were indeed FWB for awhile. \n\nIt was getting to the point where every time he mentioned her on the daily I would just grit my teeth and get upset. I didn’t want to control who he hung out with or who he spoke to as I’ve always prided myself in not being that type of person, but, if whenever I brought up my concern about Rachel he’d always get agitated and shoot me down. \n\nAbout a month ago he and I were having other issues and the topic of Rachel just kind of came up out of nowhere. I couldn’t hold it in anymore and every emotion and thought I had on this subject erupted out of me. He listened, defended her, listened some more and then agreed. I asked him to tell me one good thing she has done for him, one good thing he could tell me about her. All he could come up with was ‘Rachel has a good taste in music’. \n\nI told him at the time I didn’t mind if he stayed friends with her, it would just make me extremely uncomfortable and I just had a bad feeling about the entire thing. He told me he understood my viewpoints and respected them and that he would end the friendship—and he did. \n\nI didn’t think much of it but I felt weight off my shoulders. Everything was find until last night, we got into a mini argument and he told me I forced him to lose his friendship with Rachel, one of his closest friends. He told me he felt like his arm was twisted and I had given him an ultimatum: Either me or her. He thought it was awful and told me it was the only moment in our entire relationship he ever considered breaking up with me. \n\nI feel awful that I put him through that without realizing it and it sucks hearing that it was relationship breaking, but at the same time I have no remorse and I’m glad she’s out of his life. To me he’s seemed much happier since then but that could just be me trying to ease my conscious. AITA for making him give up an 8 year friendship?\n\nTL;DR I gave my boyfriend an ultimatum between me and a friendship he’s had for 8 years. ",

      "description": "So I live in another country where I am enrolled to do my PhD. I am in the final year of it and feeling very stressed to wrap it up before my stipend runs out in September. I am almost done with the first chapter and then the other two should be fairly smooth sailing (according to my supervisor) since this first one was the major foundation chapter. Then I have to write the intro/conclusion. My student visa ends at the end of May (I can get an extension) and I have been getting a lot of pressure to move home from my parents. I currently live with my partner and our pup that we adopted a few months ago (I protested that we weren't ready for a dog, but when we met her my heart melted and I couldn't say no). I moved in with my partner last year, after a few months of dating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love him and our pup very much, but I do not feel supported to do my PhD. I do almost all of the cooking and cleaning in the house (de facto gender roles), as well as try to work from home as much as possible to take care of our dog (we live in an apartment so she has to be taken on walks to use the bathroom, plus she has separation anxiety and often cries when left alone, though I have been training her out of this). I am fortunate in that most of my work can be done remotely on a laptop. However, I am far more productive in a campus environment or co-working space than at home. My partner works full time in an office.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am considering moving home in May, as my parents have a condo that I can live in that is close to a university that I have contacts with (who would welcome me into their research group for a post doc when I hand in my thesis). I'm tempted to move home when my visa runs out, because I could focus on smashing out the last bit of writing and then work on grant proposals with my contacts at this other university.\n\n  \nI don't have many friends in my current city (essentially only my partner, and one other couple that we spend time with). I am homesick. But mostly I am stressed and really just want to finish my degree without the expectation that I also manage a household. My partner doesn't seem to think it is a problem for me to go to uni each day after lunch for a few hours and then come home and make dinner and wash up the dishes. I've tried to do this, and after dinner I try to work at the table, but he plays video games or watches movies (we live in a studio apartment) at full volume, where I can hear the dialogue through my headphones. Anytime I ask him to turn the volume down he gets irritated with me. I've asked him to take care of a few things before I get home from uni at 6:30/7ish (I try to make the hour long walk home before it gets dark), and it is never done. I had asked him once to fold the towels from the laundry I did that day before I came home and he threw a temper tantrum. I have asked him to help with the cleaning and cooking numerous times and he tells me I am nagging. I have tried to stress the gravity of this last year of my PhD and it feels like I am talking to a wall. Most of my friends were pulling 12 hour days most days of the week in their final year, and I know I have more work to complete than they did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinancially, we split all of our bills evenly. He makes much more than my stipend, so when it is his pay week we tend to go out to eat more often or go to the pub more. He has said that since he makes more money, that he should not have to put as much into the labour of the house. I try to remind him that we split our expenses equally and the extra money is spent on luxuries that I would be fine with foregoing (I don't need to go to the pub when I have work to do, and so I often opt out of going if he has friends meeting him there too so he isn't alone). Once again, this goes in one ear and out the other. Every time it is my pay week, as well, he continues to be surprised and irritated that I don't have much left after paying our bills and buying food to spend on beers- it is like he has recurrent amnesia that I don't even get minimum wage on my stipend.\n\n  \nIf I move back home, I would have to break our lease and I would effectively be breaking up with him and abandoning our dog. My partner wouldn't be able to come with me, and I don't think I would want him to, because it would be the same issues but in a different location. I do love him, but have been extremely frustrated since we've moved in together about essentially being his caretaker. I would love to take our dog with me, but I feel like that would be pouring salt on a wound.",

      "description": "\nSo my boyfriend and I have been together for several years and he has known my family for some time now. We used to visit them every couple of month and also stayed for several days since it is a rather far trip to my home town. The relationship between them has been ok, but they never got very close, partly because my boyfriend does not speak yet the language perfectly (he just moved here a couple of years ago), and my parents don’t speak English. \nI think my mom has had some reservations against him from the start, but she never said so to me, let alone to him. Then last year we got engaged and when I announced it to my parents I could notice that she was not happy about it. \n\nI have to add that my mom and I have had our disagreements in the past and there were several of my life choices that my mom was not ok with (for example me moving away from my home town, studying abroad for a year etc...). She is not the type of person that you can persuade to change her mind, so I just stopped arguing with her, because it only ends in a huge fight. \n\nSo last Christmas, my boyfriends’ mother was coming to visit him and I thought it would be nice if we could all celebrate Christmas together. My parents have a big house, so there is enough room for everybody to stay 1-2 nights. I had however forgotten that Christmas is a huge deal for my mom, where she decorates the whole house, is envolved in a lot of voluntary work and is in general very stressed out. So when I asked her if it was ok that this year not only my boyfriend would come but also his mom, she totally freaked out and basically told me that this was completely impossible. \nSo my boyfriend had to tell his mom that she could not stay at my families’ place after all, because I had already told them both that it wouldn’t be a problem (yes that was stupid of me). \nSo we ended up celebrating Christmas separately, he with his mom and me with my family (because I also wanted to see my sisters and my dad). \n\nSince then my boyfriend has refused to visit my parents because he still feels deeply offended that they would not welcome his mother.\nI wanted to see them for the Easter holidays, but when I mentioned it to him he categorically refused to come and said that it would take a very long time until he would be able to look at my mom again. And he said I should respect that decision and not pressure him any further. \nBut I think we are both mature and tolerant enough to be able to ignore that incident for a couple of days, because there is no point arguing with my mom anyway. She won’t see that she did something wrong. \n\nSo am I an asshole for telling him that he as my partner should come with me to see my family, even if he is in disagreement with my mother? ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to take custody of my nephew?",
      "description": "Throwaway because reasons.   \n\n\nThe nephew in question is my wife's brother's kid. He was dealt a lousy hand from day 1. His father is a deadbeat heroin user and his mother a literal crack whore. Not long after the baby was born they lost custody and it was given to my in-laws. However, this didn't effectively change too much. The birth mother more or less disappeared, but my brother-in-law lived with my in laws, so even though he didn't have custody, he was still there.   \n\n\nFast forward 8 years, my father in law died a few years back and my mother in law has dementia. The brother in law's drug habit is severe, and he's been in and out of hospitals for ODs and drug related health conditions. He's become unstable and abusive towards my MIL and nephew. My nephew has been raised in a house of horrors with no real parental guidance and has a lot of behavioral issues. All he has ever known is constantly screaming and violent behavior. He has attacked and severely hurt animals (once stabbing a dog and recently severely beat another with a piece of rebar.) We have three geriatric pets. I worry about their safety with him.   \n\n\nSocial services has been a constant presence in their lives, and the police are called out to the house several times a year for various domestic issues. My MIL has refused to do anything to either move away from there or kick her son out of the house, because through all of it, she still feels like she needs to take care of him. Social Services has now decided to remove the child from the home, and with no one else coming forward, it's come down to either my wife and I take custody, or he goes into foster care.   \n\n\nNow, a few things about my home situation. First, my wife and I have two older kids, both living at home. One is in college, the other is a senior in High School. Both kids have their own issues, which I'm not going to go into because even with the throwaway there's enough identifying information here that someone familiar with the situation wouldn't have a hard time figuring out my identity. Suffice it to say, there's a lot going on there, and I'm trying to make sure my kids are OK.   \n\n\nI'm in my 40s, and we've struggled financially. I have a good income, but I just wiped out the last of my savings to deal with a large home repair. I have 0 dollars for retirement right now. For the most part, I'm living paycheck to paycheck. My wife went back to school when the kids were old enough to allow it. After 9 years she just finished with her Masters and is about to start her first real job in almost 20 years on Monday.   \n\n\nWe separated a few years ago. We got back together, but the underlying issues that led to our separation are still largely unresolved. I have concerns about the stability of our relationship with all of these changes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife and I are both in poor health for our ages. Even before the custody issue was raised my wife was contemplating whether or not she could hold down a full time job with all of her doctors appointments and physical issues. My physical issues compound my lifelong struggles with depression and anxiety disorder, which is often severe. I struggle to get by day to day.   \n\n\nWhen I told my wife I had reservations about taking custody, she told me she'd leave me if I don't agree. In her words \"I'm not letting him go into foster care. I'll get my own place. I'm not going to live in my own place and stay married, so I'd want a divorce.\"  \n\n\nI was completely overwhelmed by life BEFORE this came up. When I stop and think about taking on another kid, I feel panic. I think \"I can't do this. I can barely hang on right now. This will break me.\" When I try to tell my wife how I feel she says I'm being dramatic and repeats her threat to leave if I don't agree. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know how many years I've got left as a functional, mobile person. Pushing back the clock on raising kids ten years feels like it means if I ever am done raising kids, I'll be too sick to do anything. Financially, I'll have two kids I'm trying to support in college by this fall. I barely knew how I'd make ends meet before this, but adding the expense of another kid wasn't in the plans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My nephew is being removed from his shitty living situation by social services. My wife says she'll leave me if I don't agree to take him in. I'm in no shape financially, physically, or mentally to do it.  \n\n\nHow about it, Reddit...am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Here's the backstory: I (F19) dated this guy, let's say called Ben (M30), on and off for about 3 months last summer. He messed up a lot, mostly through using me for sex and to get over his ex while telling me he liked me at the same time to keep me hanging on.\n\n\nI eventually figured out what he had been doing and blocked him for a month. During that month I got the space I needed and he realised he actually did like me for real. After a lot of convincing on Ben's part we agreed to start 'seeing eachother'. This was November. After two weeks I had already figured out I couldn't trust him again the way I had originally and told him it was friends or nothing. He was hurt but agreed to friends as we both don't want to lose each other. We have since remained very close friends and hang out at least once or twice a week.\n\n\nIt has now come round to Ben's 30th birthday and I had been invited about a month ago to attend his party. Last week Ben started dating a new girl and has now told me I can't come to his party because of her.\n\n\nI feel hurt because me and Ben have known each other for a year and he is excluding me for a girl he's known all of two weeks. I felt like our friendship was worth more than that and expressed this to him. He just told me \"not to be like that\". I just need to know, AITA?\n\n\nTLDR: ex, now very close friend, has excluded me from his birthday because he has found a new girl in the last week ",

      "description": "Ok, my parents are at the very end of their divorce. My dad has always been an ass but he's my dad so I just tried to ignore things.\n\nWhen my mom left my dad about a year and a half ago, she moved in with me and my husband and actually acted as nanny for my first child who was born about 3 weeks after she moved in.\n\nThings got difficult with my dad because he said I enabled my mom to leave him because I let her move in with me. Once my daughter reached a year old, we put her into a daycare/school so that she could continue to grow socially and get education (my mom is not a teacher or anything). This also allowed my mom to go \"back to work\" and get a job (she was working full time for us and we did pay her). My dad has made it very clear that he thinks this wasn't a real job and that she should have gotten a job making more money.\n\nAt Christmas, I tried to reach out to my dad to see him and exchange gifts, let him see is granddaughter, etc... He lives about 4 hours away and has barely spent any time with my daughter since she was born (he refuses to be anywhere my mom is... We have made trips up to see him without my mom and he came down to see us once). \n\nAnyways, he refused to return my text messages regarding Christmas so I basically said that I tried and it was on him if he wanted to see his granddaughter. \n\nWe we're actually in town and went to pick up my sister for our Christmas trip (she was carpooling with us to Colorado). She lives with my dad whenever not in school so I figured I could give him his gifts when we went to pick her up. \n\nHe refused to accept my gifts and ended up throwing them at my head as I walked back down the driveway. I have not spoken to him since. He has also made no attempt to reach out to me. I am now pregnant with my second child and don't feel as though I need to include him in any way. I haven't even told him I was pregnant. Either my sister told him or he found out in family court (they are still working on finalizing the divorce). \n\nEither way, it's been a week since the court date and he has still not reached out. I am ok with this as I feel like he shouldn't get to be a part of my life or more importantly, my kids lives. I had to deal with so much emotional garbage from growing up with him that I don't think it is a loss for my children to not have to put up with it.\n\nAITA for depriving my kids of their grandfather?",

      "description": "Me and a couple of close friends (4 guys and 5 girls) where hanging out at our friend's house over the weekend. After dinner we all sat down, had a couple of beers and talked with each other, just like we usually do. I noticed that one of my friends (let's call her Kelly) wasn't drinking and it then struck me that I couldn't remember the last time I've seen her drink alcohol. I absolutely don't have anything against people who choose to stay sober, but Kelly had told us stories about her recently getting drunk so I knew that she wasn't fully abstaining from it. I asked her about this and also reaffirmed that I didn't mind it at all and was just being curious. She told me that for the last year or so she had refrained from getting drunk among men since she didn't feel safe doing so. This of course made me concerned. I asked her if there was any specific incident that had made her come to this conclusion, but she assured me that it wasn't. She said it was a decision that grew forth over time from reading the news, hearing stories and things like men groping her at the club.\n\nNow this is where the potential assholery begins. In the group we have all known each other for at least five years and I've known Kelly since grade school. The house we stayed in was out in the forrest, far away from anyone else so we weren't going to meet any other people that night. When she said this I therefore interpreted it as that she didn't trust us guys not to take advantage of her if she got drunk. As far as I can tell none of us has ever shown any tendencies that would support this. We've all gotten drunk together plenty of times and I've never seen any of them make unwanted advances or anything like that. I told Kelly that I understood where she was coming from, but that I felt hurt that she choose to apply this rule even when it was just us guys from the friend group there. During my explanation two other friends, one guy and one girl, joined the conversation and asked us what we were talking about. I let Kelly tell them the story whereupon the other guy reacted basically the same way as I did. The girl however told us both that it was non of our business and that Kelly didn't have to motivate her decisions to us. I handled this the same way I always do when a confrontation is imminent: I told a joke at my own expense and changed the subject. We didn't talk anymore about it, but the rest of the weekend was a little tense between the people on the opposing sides of the conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole for taking this personally or at least for calling her out on it?",

      "description": "I’ve known this woman since college. She was a really good friend to me while I was in college, even after she graduated and I was still in school. I moved to the same area she lived in after I graduated. She was dating / married this guy who expected a lot of her and is kind of a misogynist, but we kept the relationship going. She had baby number 1, still friends, though it got harder just because he refuses to help so she had all of the kid responsibilities. But we adapted - when we did get together, we always picked a place she could bring the kiddo. \n\nWithin the last year, she had baby number 2, and I got married a few months later. When we sent out the invitations, I was kind of surprised that she was the first one to RSVP, and she said how excited they were about the wedding (her ex was in my wedding party, which is why it was surprising she was so excited). But okay, great, see ya there. Fast forward to the day of the wedding, had a great time. The next morning it hits me - I don’t think she was there. Confirmed with our planner and people at their table. They just never showed. When I posted our wedding pictures on Facebook, she sent me a 2am text basically saying “oh crap I forgot”. I said we missed her. That it. Never sent a card, gift, or anything to acknowledge that she not only missed it for no good reason (she has access to reliable childcare too, so unlikely that was the reason), or that we shelled out a ton of money for two places that went unused at an expensive wedding. \n\nShe reached out to me this week for the first time since the wedding (almost 4 months ago) to say “do you have any time before Christmas?”  It’s a week before. Seriously? \n\nAt this point my husband is so very done with these friends. He hates the husband because he’s a heavy drinker and treats his wife like a servant, and the wedding was the final straw. I am still really hurt, but I also feel bad walking away from a friend who helped me through some tough times a long time ago. At the same time, the fact that she thinks a text makes up for being a no-show for no good reason has me feeling really put out. \n\nTL;DR: She RSVP’ed yes for 2 and then skipped out for no reason. No real apology but she has a crappy husband and two little kids. Can I let the friendship fizzle?  ",

      "description": "Ok this is a throwaway account because I'm a Redditor and dont want this post in my normal account history.\n\nTo start off, I am one of those women who cant orgasm vaginally, I can only orgasm through clitoral stimulation and this has caused issues between my boyfriend of almost 2yrs and I. When we first got together and he found out I cant orgasm vaginally he started bragging about how many orgasms other women have had through him vaginally(immature I know...we are both in our late 30s so that was an ew moment for me). He's referred to me as an alien, abnormal, and being broken sexually. We've tried toys and whatnot to get me to cum vaginally but it just doesnt work so he usually just goes down on me to get me off.\n\nI don't need to get off everytime we have sex and Ive told him I dont expect him to get me off everytime, most of the time Im perfectly satisfied with just a good pounding, but it really bothers him to the point of he gets irritated at me that I cant cum through intercourse and then I feel like there's some thing wrong with me. This has turned sex into something somewhat stressful and makes it take longer than normal for me to cum when he goes down on me because the whole time Im feeling self conscious. I feel like if I cant get to orgasm quickly then I've failed at sex and making him happy.\n\n3 weeks ago I started taking anti depressants, and a side effect is inability to orgasm or taking much longer to get there than normal. I told him this but he's getting even more irritated now because he wants me to cum within minutes when he goes down. \n\nThe last two times he went down on me it felt great as usual but I just didnt feel any of the usual build up to climax and I knew if I told him I didnt think I was going to cum because of the meds he would say something assholish about me being broken again, so I decided to fake it both times. He was happy that he \"made me cum\" and asked for the usual accolades and I avoided the awkwardness and irritation from him afterwards. I feel bad about being deceptive, Ive never had this be a problem in any of my previous relationships and have never faked an orgasm before. AITA?\n\nTL;DR faked two orgasms because boyfriend gets irritated when I cant cum quickly.\n\n",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom\n\nSo, a little backstory. Me and my friend has been really close since a couple years back, we share everything. \nA while back she started talking to this guy and at first I thought there was something between them so of course I asked like a million times. \n\nEvery time the same answer. \n\nWe’re just friends, I don’t like him, etc. After a while I just gave up because it seemed pretty clear that they were in fact just friends. \n\nNow I’ve been single for way to long in my opinion and I easily get bored of people, therefore I start talking to new people all the time and I stumbled upon this guy. I got his number and we talked for a couple hours that night. \n\nLike I earlier mentioned me and my bestie keep no secrets so I told her that I was talking to this guy. Since I had joked about the two of them before I left the following message “haha think I might have stolen you boyfriend just now”. She doesn’t have a boyfriend so at first she was like what? Who are you talking about?\n\nI explain to her that I got this guys number and had talked to him quite a lot the night before and she FREAKED OUT. \n\nI’m just gonna say it again, she had said multiple times that there’s nothing between them and never will be and I trusted her. \n\nSo now she was all mad at me and I could not for the life of me figure out why. Of course I asked again if she was into him and again she said no. \n\nMy bestie is a little on the jealous side and I understand that but she wouldn’t even let me talk to a guy SHE WASN’T EVEN INTERESTED IN. \n\nAt this point I was quite mad. \n\nWe argued for a bit and she literally forbid me to talk to him. \n\nNow I’m no saint so I talked to him a tiny bit but making sure I wasn’t actually getting to know him. I know that was wrong but that is not what I need help with so moving on. \n\nAfter a couple days she finally tells me that she kinda liked the idea of him. After about a week she gave me permission to talk to him again but she’s still being all passive aggressive about it. I know what I did is wrong but I kinda think her reaction was uncalled for. \n\nI really like this guy and hopefully he likes me too but this whole situation is kinda ridiculous. \n\nTL;DR\nMy friend is friends with this guy, I start talking to him, she panics and forbids me to talk to him. \n\nPlease help me decide if I’m the asshole. I know I should’ve made sure that she was okay with it but am I really the only one to blame for this mess?",

      "description": "So long story short I(21 M) am apart of a friend group with about 10 people roughly all the same ages. We went on this trip to snowboard and all of us stayed in a big cabin. One of our girl friends decided to bring a friend of hers who none of us really hung out with before. This guy in the group who literally fangirls about everyone would always comment how pretty she was etc. He says this about so many people he follows on instagram/knows etc. At the trip I was going through some personal stuff and so I would spend some time outside walking and thinking. Soon enough the new girl (Elle) came out with me and talked with me about what I was going through. I still saw her as nothing but a friend, especially because my friend was obsessed with her lmao. Some of these guys in the group always would say things to make feel not confident, and like I couldn't get girls which is lame because they all know Im just really nice and picky. \n\nOne the trip ends the new girl Elle started texting me and always wanted to hang out. I drove like 30 minutes to see her and even invited everyone in the group to come and they decided not to. I made it clear to them that I was hanging with Elle, even to the guy that \"liked\" her. After a few times hanging out she told me she was interested and I said I was too, but my friend liked her so we have to let everyone know whats up. The next night when I was going to tell everyone, we were out at a bar with the group and Elle was being super touchy with me and all that. Everyone in the group got the idea that she was interested in me, and tied the knots together that we have been hanging out and immediately assumed the worst.\n\nThey all left me and Elle at the bar, and didnt even let me explain. The next day I was trying to explain everything to them, even the part that I didnt do anything with Elle because I didnt tell them yet. They were crazy about everything and called me a piece of shit and that i somehow stole Elle from the guy in my group even though she NEVER liked him/showed interest, and he likes everyone. I ended up just forgetting them all as friends, because I feel like they were never there for me or made me feel good...BUT I alway think to this and wonder AITA for everything that happened?",

      "description": " \n\nThis is my first time posting to /r/AmItheAsshole so i am sorry if i break any of the rules of the subreddit, or have any weird formatting issues.\n\nMe (17M) and my sister (19F) have come from a very abusive household. My mother has been disabled for as long as i can remember, and my father has always physically and verbally abused me and my sister (My parents have been divorced since we were kids). It stopped when we got into our freshman year of highschool when we both decided to stop talking to him and seeing him on the weekends. I am now in my senior year of high school and my sister is now out on her own. She started getting into cocaine very heavily and its part of the reason why we kicked her out of me and my mother's apartment. She had nowhere to go so she just stayed with her friends, months roll by and she STILL doesn't have a job and into drugs more than ever. Her “Friends” got tired of her shit too and decided to kick her out. At this point me and my disabled mother couldn't afford to pay for the apartment anymore, so we moved in with our grandparents.\n\nMy sister, still having nowhere to go, thought it was a good idea to move back in with out dad, and he forced her to get a actual job and hold it down. this was about 4 months ago. We got a call from her last night that my father was beating and threatening her again so we left and picked her up for the night. We told her that she could stay ONE night while she finds a new place to stay.\n\nDuring the night we let her over, she brought over one of her guy friends and snuck him into the house, she completely trashed my bathroom, leaving her makeup and shit everywhere while still leaving piss in the toilet and not flushing, literally like a child. Her dog, that i let stay downstairs, Pissed all over my carpet and the living room carpet. (Keep in mind i am allergic to dogs, not to the point of dying, but i will make me break out in SEVERE hives)\n\nI now want NOTHING to do with her, she has treated me and my mother like shit for the entire time she was with us, and now expects us to come running to her safety when she makes bad decisions. So, am I the asshole here?\n\n(Also i have not just thrown her onto the streets with her own caution to the wind, I am giving her a ride to wherever she needs to go to get shelter, and currently am in the process of helping her find apartments that she can afford and live in)",

      "description": "So this woman is my boyfriend’s brothers wife. We’ve hung out somewhat, I don’t really know if I’d call her a friend but I had her added on Facebook. \n\nMy boyfriend messaged me the other day telling me that her hamster died and that she was an absolute wreck. I saw several posts on her Facebook mourning the loss of her hamster. I was out of town visiting some friends and family at the time. \n\nShe messages me on Facebook asking me to share a gofundme for her vet bills. It was so fucking cringy and emoji filled I could barely stand to read it. It was the biggest sob story and all over some hamster she had for like a few months, and attached to the post was some poem about dead pets she found on google titled ‘the rainbow bridge.’\n\nI told her I’d share it because I didn’t want to be an asshole, but I never did end up sharing it. I don’t post a lot of stuff on Facebook and the stuff I do post is just stupid memes and videos most of the time.\n\nI just thought it was really cringy to beg for money over the loss of a hamster and act that distraught on social media. At this point, since the hamster was dead, it was solely to benefit her. I probably would have shared it if the hamster was sick or something but it just really rubbed me the wrong way. She’s in her 30s and I would expect a 7 year old to take losing a hamster better than she did. \n\nTL;DR - didn’t share a friends gofundme for vet bills for her hamster because it was a huge annoying sob story. \n",

      "description": "So my ex-roommate’s and I’s lease ended around a month ago and we just got part of our deposit back. We met up at a cafe to talk about it. The deposit was $1500 and we got back $1000. They sent a list of damages with the cost of repairs along with it - $100 for the holes in the wall, $100 for the holes in the window screens (thanks to her cat) and a whopping $300 for the floors in her room to be redone. She had her cat's litter box in her room and she was an absolute slob about it. Her cat frequently pissed, shit and vomited about her room, seemingly anywhere but the litterbox, and she never cleaned it up (anytime it was in the common room, I was the one who cleaned it). Consequently, it ruined the nice wood floors in her room and the cost to repair her floors is $300. The refund was deposited into my account (she never had anything to do with the rent/bills/lease/account; she left that all up to me). I have the copy of the damages list too.\n\nWhen we saw the list, she said, “Well that’s not bad! At least we both get $500!” and I immediately disagreed. I told her that we can split the cost of the holes in the wall and even the screens (even though that was her cat who ripped them up, she constantly left the windows open even though I frequently asked her not to), but she was going to assume the cost of her floors. So I would get $650 ($100 in fees for me) and she would get $350 ($400 in fees for her). She immediately exploded and said that wasn’t fair and told me I was being a “huge fucking asshole” and that “damages are just part of having an apartment”. I disagreed and said that I have written proof that the damage happened in her room and showed her the list again. She said that if I didn't give her half of the deposit she was going to sue me and stormed out of the cafe we were at.\n\nThis conversation just happened and I still have the whole refund, and I'm conflicted about what to do. I feel like I’m being fair given the circumstances, but maybe not. AITA? Does my roommate have any legal leverage to make me give her half of the deposit?\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend has a new acquaintance who is a girl. They have known each other for about a month. The girl is in a relationship, but spends her time whining about her boyfriend to my boyfriend about how she is not sure they should be together. My boyfriend has encouraged her to work her relationship out.\n\nShe constantly asks my boyfriend if he's going out that night. She's sent him drunk selfies at night. She asked him to go to her old high school alumni ball with her, because her boyfriend couldn't come and she had already bought a couple's ticket. (my boyfriend refused because he had a friend's birthday party that night). She jokes about how much she likes a certain hoodie my boyfriend has. She jokes about how much she likes the way he talks. She has used phrases like \"where have you been all of my life\". Ever since they met, she has always been aware that my boyfriend is in a happy relationship. Her actions feel extremely flirty to me and my personal opinion is that she is an inappropriate cunt.\n\nWe have talked about this with my boyfriend. He says he has no interest in her and I believe him. He says that he understands why I would be uncomfortable but he doesn't want to be rude to her. Again, I get it - he's kind of the human version of Mr. Peanutbutter and just wants everyone to get along and be happy.\n\nAt the same time I feel very irritated. I want him to set hard boundaries with this girl because honestly I wouldn't be surprised at anything she'd try to do at this point. I would like him to tell her to fuck off permanently. He doesn't want to be too harsh to her and would still like to be (platonically) friendly with her. Technically he hasn't done anything wrong and I know he has no intention to. However, I also feel like he hasn't made enough of a clear statement about how he is not interested in her, because clearly mentioning his girlfriend (aka me) hasn't been enough to deter her.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting him to cut her out of his life completely? Also am I overreacting to her behaviour or would this be considered normal between platonic friends who have known each other for a month?\n",

The competition went 3 hours longer than expected due to complications with the judges scoring etc. We did place second at the competition as a team which we were all happy about.\n\nNow my girlfriend deals with a lot of anxiety when it comes to large groups of people and almost the entire team knows that. She was very nervous and antsy all day but did very well in her category. However my team decided to constantly yell and play music on speakers on the way back from the competition (there were two speakers playing completely different songs so it was deafening) and my girlfriend is hyper sensitive to noise so she began to panic very very bad to the point she was doubled over crying. I asked everyone if they could please quieten down at least three times, telling them the situation, but they still refused to stop. \n\nAt this point I was very pissed off and decided enough was enough and yelled \"Can you all please shut the hell up my girlfriend is having a panic attack for fucks sake!\"\n\nWhile I feel that what I said was a bit extreme, I did ask them several times to please just quieten down as I was fine with the music and talking as we just placed well in a competition and they all just ignored me, so AITA?\n",

      "description": "So last weekend my boyfriend’s friend was apparently found dead in his car of a self inflicted gunshot wound. No one really knows what happened or why.  My boyfriend was at work when he found out, texted me that he was going home, wanted to be left alone, was going to shut his phone off and then turn it back on the next day.  About a week or so prior to this he himself had made a comment about being Tommen Baratheon done with everything. (For those who have never seen Game Of Thrones, Tommen takes his crown off and then walks out a window). I went to his house on my lunch the next day and he didn’t answer the door. His phone was still turned off. I went back to work but I was still worried about him, so I looked up his previous roommate who is currently deployed on Facebook and sent him a message asking if this was normal behavior.  When he said yeah, that my boyfriend had done this before, I just gave him a thumbs up and said ok thanks. Well.... The roommate called my boyfriend’s supervisor and the supervisor and another coworker drove over to his house. Apparently he hadn’t called in sick or filed for leave or anything and was completely drunk, beer bottles everywhere and house was a giant mess with clothes everywhere and trash on the floor. When I got there the supervisor was shaking his head and telling my boyfriend that he needed to clean up and then chastising him and asking “I’ll see you at work tomorrow, right?!” My boyfriend is pissed at me and blaming me because now he’s in trouble at work and has to go see his first shirt on Monday. I was just concerned about him and I don’t think I did anything wrong. I could have called the police instead I guess, but I honestly didn’t know the roommate was going to call the supervisor. ",

(She usually send me snaps about work so I've never texted her before) Plus I've not been sick or in need to get away with a shift for a long time so I felt that her sayins she's always been here felt odd.

I took no security deposit when she moved in and I need to find a roommate to replace her. She has a place to go and will be fine. \n\ntl;dr - roommate didn't give notice for moving out, so I gave her a shorter time frame than she gave me. ",

      "description": "**With regards to the meta post:** I know I'm not an asshole for leaving her. I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?",

After this I tried using my card but it was constantly being denied.  I screwed with it for a while before calling an employee over to help with it.  Meanwhile a mom with her kids is standing off to the side giving me an angry look, when I look back she says something along the lines of, \"What are you doing, there are people waiting, do you not know how to operate the machine?\"  It wasn't necessarily the words that set me off, but more so her tone of voice, which to me felt unnecessarily hostile and confrontational.  After that I promptly told her to fuck off before leaving with my stuff.  I don't know if I should have been as angry with her as I was, I kind of feel guilty that I approached the situation in that way, especially in front of her kids.",

(Even though I will probably let him out after too long) He got the chest buckle without issue. He has been sitting for 10 mins whining and saying he can't undo the base buckle. I feel like I might be an asshole for how I am choosing to do this but shouldn't he know by now? I have watched late 3yos and 4yos get in and out of their seats without issue. At least I took him out of the car. I know my father would have left me in the car to figure it out. He opens the car door from the outside and inside without issue. He has basically destroyed a controller button mashing. He can control the backhoe attachments better than most adults I have seen. Am I the asshole for expecting this of him?

      "description": "I have a cousin who I don't have the best relationship with. On and off arguing throughout our whole lives growing up with each other, but we still hang out despite my annoyance of her. She tends to ask me a lot of favors, like editing her college essays, doing things online for her, homework help, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA month ago, she asked me to buy $300 tickets for a concert for her and my sister (and they would pay me back). They were both unable to buy these tickets because they had school at the time they'd be sold, and for this concert, it was very difficult to get tickets. They'd sell out within minutes. I'd have to wake up 3 hours early, get into queue to buy the tickets on multiple electronic devices, and  fight with thousands of other girls for these tickets. I was willing to do it, but I felt like I deserved something for doing this favor, like a bit of money. With ticket scalpers who resell tickets for much higher prices, I thought it'd be reasonable if I asked my cousin and my sister to pay me $20 each for buying these tickets for them. Maybe that is too much to ask, but I'm a broke college student.  In the end, they declined my offer and skipped school to buy the tickets themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week later, my cousin realized she and my sister did not have a ride to this concert. She asked me if I could drive her and my sister to this concert that took place about 150 miles away from us. Thinking about the price of an uber, the cost of gas, and the \\~3hrs out of my day, I thought it would be reasonable if I asked for some money in exchange. I can't remember how much money I asked from them, but it was cheaper than the price of an uber. Maybe $30 or $40 from each of them? She thought this was outrageous and declined the offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my cousin accused me of exploiting my family members for a profit. She claimed that if she were in my shoes, she wouldn't be asking for money or any kind of profit for doing these favors. She claimed that I was extremely selfish and assumed that I act this way with my friends, never doing favors out of kindness. The thing is, I've been doing these small favors for my cousins for years. I never really liked her, rarely asked for favors, and never texted her first, but every time she texted me to drive her somewhere around locally, help her with homework, or edit her college essays for hours into multiple nights, I would do it out of kindness. I also found it quite rude that she'd assume I act the same way around my friends... I treat my friends out for lunch the same way they treat me out and do favors for my friends as well. I just felt like these particular favors my cousin asked me to do were more time-consuming, mind-consuming, and money-consuming. But I admit that I legitimately did want to make some profit from doing these favors, but I tried not to ask for an outrageous amount and considered that she is my cousin.

      "description": "We are all in our early 20s if that information is helpful. I am sorry it’s so long, I tried to edit down. Backstory first:\n\nI have two friends that live together, one of whom needs a green card to continue living here; my understanding with the situation is that her work visa runs out in March, and to avoid immediate deportation she either needs to be in a new job that will sponsor her (would take too long/be difficult for her field of work/not a permanent solution) or be married and starting the paperwork process of getting a green card. The process of actually applying for citizenship is apparently a long, very expensive process with a low success rate, so that’s out of the question for her. I’m not gonna argue with people in the comments as I honestly do not have more knowledge on the subject.\n\nHer roommate, we’ll call her D, agreed to marry her, probably back in April 2018. They already live together, D is a very socially-dependent person and very attached to her, my friend seems to be the only one who can balance out D’s personality, and they’re both low-key gay for each other though they won’t admit it. It’s perfect.\n\nExcept D has abandonment issues that present in the form of commitment anxiety, and she’s also afraid her parents will absolutely lose it if she marries her friend. She doesn’t want to be disowned. So she still hasn’t told them she’s marrying this friend. She tried bringing it up to her parents once, that this friend either needed to marry her or me, and her mother said something like “well I guess she’s marrying \\[TheAllMightiest\\], then.”\n\nSo D keeps not telling her parents. And she’s been not telling her parents for months and months, and time’s running out. It’s making my friend and I nervous, especially my friend. In September, worried that D would back out and this friend would get deported, I told her I would marry her if D backed out. I genuinely don’t want her to get deported, platonic marriage is a huge life goal for me, and I don’t have to worry about my family’s opinion. And at that point, I had no other major life plans in the works. I was content with the idea of platonic-marrying her.\n\nFast-forward to now. My friend only has about a month left before she needs to be hitched to someone. D still hasn’t told her parents, throws a fit about how she “can’t deal with this stress right now” every time my friend and I try to get her to either tell her parents or just back the hell out fully. I’m worried she will continue procrastinating until the last minute, have a breakdown over it, and then back out entirely.\n\nMeanwhile, in the last several months, I’ve really hit it off with someone. We were already friends, but we’ve been talking more and more, discovering we have the same life goals, and we really enjoy each other’s company. What started off as joking about platonic marriage has turned into actual, genuine “we could do this???? oh my god????” I am in love with the idea of platonic marrying this person, getting a house with them, fostering children with them. They are reciprocal in their excitement. They keep bringing it up. It's obviously not a done deal as marriage is a huge commitment, but I want the opportunity to have that life with them.\n\nBut now I might be expected to green-card marry my friend.\n\nIf D backs out, AITA for going back on my word and not green-card marrying my friend? I'm asking the internet because I already feel like a huge A-hole just thinking about telling her and I want other's opinions.",

      "description": "So I've been dating my girlfriend for 10 years, have been engaged for 5. We have a 6 year old son together also. Recently for the past year and a half, shes been in and out the hospital for health issues. Most recently liver failure and due to the liver failure the doctors told me she might not make it. I asked what had caused the liver failure and  they told me it's because of how much alcohol shes been consuming. Now throughout the time we've been together I rarely if ever see her drink. So I confronted her about it in the hospital and she got angry at me for even mentioning it. She said yes she had been drinking but it was none of my business. I told her why I was upset because she might die because shes secretly been an alcoholic for who knows how long and she didnt care about our son or me to give it up. After our argument I tried to apologize for the things I said but she was still angry at me, so I blocked her on my phone. So AITA?",

      "description": "So my S/O and I live together, currently I am the only one working. I work a normal part time (getting full time soon in a few weeks) job in specialty retail, so we are frequently short on cash after rent and bills. I work about 30 hours a week. I don't drive and my S/O does takes me to work on time, every day, about 30 minutes one way. \n\nI basically refuse to do any house work while I'm home or off, except for a few basic things like emptying the dish washer, vacuuming, taking out the kitty litter trash and cooking most nights. Everything else I just don't feel the need to do, since I'm gone about 6-9 hours a day. I do ask my S/O to do the chores since they don't have a job and are currently not looking for one. They are trying to get disability for mental health reasons, but basically sit at home and play video games or go hang with friends all day. I come home to a really messy house with dirty dishes basically every day. I then clean the pots I need to  use for dinner and cook for the both of us. I understand why its difficult for them to get started, but it doesn't make it any easier to deal with and some effort would be great to see.  \n\nMy S/O also has a habit of taking naps while I'm at work after staying up all night. I find this frustrating because I can't just take naps any time I want while I'm at work and feel tired all the time. I know this is a common symptom of mental illness and one I struggle with as well with my anxiety, but it also doesn't seem fair to me that I don't get to nap all day and come home exhausted mentally and physically all the time.\n\nI bring this up to them frequently and it always devolves into argument where I do get pretty extreme. Saying things like the time I'm at work they should be cleaning and not taking naps/playing video games ect. But honestly if they managed to clean and then decided to play video games after I wouldn't really care that much I guess. I also can go over board saying stuff like don't eat really good food without me. Like if someone is buying them food to save me some cause its not fair, since I'm not usually able to buy food like that on our restricted budget.\n\nTheir side of the argument usually revolves around how they have trouble being motivated due to mental illness and that if they weren't around I would have to go to work and do all the chores myself and expecting them to do it by themselves is basically just demanding a live in maid.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I work, my S/O doesn't. I request they do the chores while I'm at work and this causes intense arguements in an otherwise happy relationship\n\n*I also purposefully left identifying genders out of this so it didn't skew the answers.*",

      "description": "Hello reddit. I’m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what’s best for my son. \n\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the “class clown” and often disrupts class. I’ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I’ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\n\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his “biggest” disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own “song,” even when the teacher said no.\n\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn’t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route. \n\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot. \n\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\n\nI workin the healthcare field, and I genuinely don’t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.  \n\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don’t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn’t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don’t want to put him on meds. AITA?",

      "description": "Sorry, I know the title is a mouth full.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this just happened minutes ago, I live in a house with 8 people, including a one and a half year old boy who shoves literally everything in his mouth, ex: house phones, spoons, remotes, etc. Just anything that fits in his mouth. My sister lets him roam unsupervised a lot and makes other people watch him or she just leaves him alone for 10 minutes at a time so she can go smoke weed or cigarettes. She had a child outside of marriage and was pregnant while she used heroin, but quit when the baby boy was born so she could live with us and we could help care for the baby boy. Her boyfriend lives with us too under the condition that they both work. She and her boyfriend have smoked for the entire time the baby boy was growing in our house and I have no idea when they started smoking marijuana. We don't know how to handle them smoking pot since it's legal now so we decided to let it go and warned them it's a gateway drug.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough I'm completely against the use of drugs/tobacco and I know she can choose how to spend her life doing whatever she wants, I just don't want that around her son who isn't capable of leaving the room is she smokes in it and doesn't know better than to not touch the cigarettes. I constantly find rolled joints and cigarettes, both used and unused, on the ground, on her bed (when she asks me to watch him) and on low tables. I tell my parents since they are the owners of the house and they told me not to start conflicts with her, but today I found a whole cigarette on the floor of the room her son plays in and my dad (a total hard ass) saw me pick it up and I brought it to my sister's bf to tell him I found it and it was dangerous. My dad then walked over and started telling him how he's repeatedly said no tobacco in the house and the bf just says it fell off from behind his ear (He perches his cigarettes there like you would a pencil). things go bad and there's arguing. then my sister comes down with her toddler and my dad reminds her about the no tobacco rule. She asks why I'm there and my dad says I'm the one who found the cigarette and I tell her that her son could choke on it or poison himself and she starts yelling we are all ganging up on her. I make her son a bottle of milk because he looks thirsty and I thought that's what she came down here to anyways, so i give it to her and tell her I'm not mad at her and she shoves me away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decide to let her cool off so I go upstairs and go to my room and lock the door, it's a habit. 5 minutes later, she's pounding at my door telling me it's my fault all this happened (my dad told her I showed him the cigarette) and that if her son doesn't have a father and leaves her because our dad yelled at her bf on his first day back from a trip, it's all my fault. Am I the Asshole? I don't know what to do",

      "description": "I love my apartment and have not had any issues with neighbors or the landlord since moving in.\n\nAn elderly gentleman lives below me in a 2 story complex. We both have neighbors to one side, than a stairwell and more neighbors on the other side. Monday evening I came home from work around 6:20. I checked my mail outside and smelt something funny, but didn't think too much of it since our mailboxes are outside. I went upstairs, opened up my door, and a terrible smell hit me in the face. I thought it was burnt BBQ. It was definitely burnt something. So I check out my place, feel on the electrical outlets to make sure they aren't hot, visually inspect my heater, oven, and water heater. Everything is fine. The smell is strong enough I turn off my heat and open all the windows. I go to my neighbors and ask them if maybe they're BBQing or something. He says no, then asks if my place stinks too. I say yeah. We go into his apartment and it does stink, but not terribly. We go to mine and he says it's a lot stronger smelling in mine. We chat for a bit. He tells me the older man has a history of accidentally catching things on fire! I've seen the fire trucks out once before but I didn't know where they were going. My neighbor laughs it off, saying the old man is just forgetful, falls asleep, etc.\n\nThis guy is right under me! I have a cat and I'm almost never at home during the day. My whole place could go up and I wouldn't even know it until hours later.\n\nSo on Tuesday, I talked to my landlord who seemed surprised. I guess no one has ever told them about the frequent but small fires this man creates while trying to cook. They sent maintenance to \"check on some things\" and took it very seriously.\n\nBut I can't help but feel like an asshole. He's an old man and I don't want to be the person that gets him sent to a nursing home. No one ever visits him and his next door neighbor basically helps take care of him. I don't want to mess up this man's life, but I don't want my complex to catch on fire either, especially since my place would be the second to go up in flames.\n\nAITA or am I feeling guilty for no reason?",

      "title": "AITA for feeling uncomfortable being the third wheel",
      "description": "My best friend (Sarah) got a boyfriend (Tyler) about 10 months ago. For the first 6 months, we barely talked and we didn't see each other for a while as she lives with him (they were roommates) and was distracted. They are fun to be with individually.\n\nWe've started to hang out again recently, but I'm finding myself uncomfortable more than anything else. This is because Tyler is almost always present. It is worse when just us 3. I appreciate her efforts for me and her boyfriend to be friends, but it just feels awkward. I feel like if they broke up, I'd never talk to him again lol. Sarah said this to me:\n\n* \"Man, I don't understand why you have to think of it as third wheeling. Whenever Tyler hangs out with his best friend he always has his gf there but he just considers it hanging out. And he's been dating her since college so he's been 'third wheel' without being in a relationship many times but it never bothers him, I don't understand why it can't just be us hanging out\" *\n\nI gave Sarah examples of times I felt uncomfortable - when I ask her to hang out or get dinner, she invites Tyler along then spends (what I feel) most of the time talking to Tyler instead of me. It's usually your average day-to-day couple talk like \"lets plan to go on a date this weekend\" (plans not including me) or \"remember that episode we watched the other night?\"\n\nWe hung out with 7 people. I was the only single one there. We played Jackbox and everyone was paired up working together except for me. Then we watched a movie and everyone was cuddling up while I sat to the side. Sarah says she understands why I felt uncomfortable *that* time, but not when it's me+her+bf.\n\nWe had plans to go to a one-night-only showing of a movie for a couple months, but she flaked on me the night-of to stay at home with her boyfriend, because she wanted to bring Tyler and I told her I didn't want to go with Tyler.\n\nAnything personal I've told her in the past, Tyler now knows about me.. That also makes me uncomfortable.\n\nSarah says it is hard to want to hang out with me when she feels like she has to exclude her boyfriend, so I get left out instead. Sarah and Tyler agree that it feels hard to be a normal couple when I am around. I understand that things are never going to go back to how they used to be, but currently we've grabbed dinner 1-on-1 once a month to catch up and then we go home. I want to do other things like go to the beach or movies, to create more lasting memories with her than just \"catching up\" over dinner. Am I the asshole for not pushing my feelings aside to cause less tension between us?\n\n**tl;dr** Best friend got a boyfriend. I don't like hanging out with her + boyfriend and we do not see eye-to-eye. They feel like they can't be a couple around me, so they leave me out of a lot of activities instead. This hurts my feelings because I want to be doing those activities, too.",

      "title": "AITA for dropping my long time best friend for becoming addicted to drugs",
      "description": "This happened a few years ago now. This is sort of complicated, so it's a long one, sorry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a long time best friend, who I met in second grade. We happened to change schools together the next year, and even after she moved away a few grades later we always kept in touch and tried to hangout semi regularly (as much as kids who live a few towns away can do).  \n\nShe was always smart and funny, and when we hadn't seen each other in a while it was easy to catch up. \n\nAnyway, fast forward to senior year of high school, she's 18 and she got in a big fight with her mom (they always had a weirdly rocky relationship) so she went to stay with her mostly online boyfriend who lived in the next state over.  She just kind of stayed there, and didn't go home. \n\nNow this guy was only a few years older than her, but he had kind of a hard knock life, and had done all sorts of drugs and things like that.  I met him and although he was nice, I obviously didn't love the negative influence of that stuff and how she hadn't finished high school. But she had been seriously struggling with depression for years, and talking to her I could tell she was much happier there with him, so I didn't want to spoil that. And she said she was going to get her GED, do online school... \n\nSoon they move out of where they were to a trailer, because they didn't have much money.  However, there were a few times where she asked if she could \"borrow\" some money. I don't remember if it was really under the premise of paying me back, but I knew it was really just to give.  Each time was said to help with groceries or bills or something, and was always less than $100 for sure but I also didn't have that much money myself at this time. \n\nSo comes the first time I'm gonna see her in a while, and visit her in the trailer and stay the night. She looks a bit different , and at some point in the night she's straight with me and tells me she's been doing heroin (snorting, specifically). \"Just to party\" and \"just to have crazy sex\" and \"I don't even need that much\" and that she doesn't need it to function (unlike the guy she's with).  I of course tell her I don't like it and don't approve, but I can't control her life.... \n\nThe next day she asks for some money for gas and groceries (they picked me up and dropped me back off, it was about a 45 min trip one way) , and they did drive me so fine. \n\nAfter all of this, the next few days I think about it more and get angrier and angrier about the situation. I felt like she was throwing her life away, and asking me for money indicates that they are financially struggling and yet they're spending the money on these drugs... I didn't even know what to say, and I didn't want to talk to her for a while, so I blocked her while I thought about what I wanted to do about the situation. \n\n\"a while\" turned into months, and I just didn't know what to say to her, and at that point it was clear that she had tried to get in contact with me but I wasn't reciprocating, so I knew when I talked to her I would have to explain that... And I just kind of never did. It got worse me thinking of having to explain why I didn't talk to her, and time went on and now its been years.\n\nI still feel guilty about it, because if I was going to stop contact from the beginning I should have told her so and the reasons why. But even that, I could/should have tried to intervene, but I just felt lost to even how to do that... She was deep in with the boyfriend(/fiance?) and I was in no position to offer her a place to stay if she would leave him/the life behind. \n\nSo, \\*\\*am I the asshole for basically ghosting this longtime friend because of me being mad at her for using drugs, among other things?\\*\\*",

      "description": "The background is, we dated one year ago, but he ended up breaking up with me because I was clingy. \n\nAfter a bunch of happy and less happy times, we managed to become somewhat regular FwB. Except this last month is a situation I’ve seen repeating itself too many times, and I don’t know what I can make out of it :\n\nSome months ago, I would ask regularly to see him, to which he would reply he didn’t have the time. I would tell him I understand that, but I missed him anyway. Like I understand he was busy, I just wanted to let him know that I’d have liked to spend time with him. I wouldn’t pester him with my demands, but I would regularly renew them in a casual way, and just retreating myself when he said no\n\nFats forward a month ago, when I asked him one more time, he just replied that it was up to me if I wanted to see him. I somewhat sensed it was forced, but I really don’t trust my guts, so I wanted to make sure if he was really okay with it by asking him. Twice. Both times he said he was sure he wanted it, so I went.\n\nWhen I arrived, he seemed more detached than usual. I tried to cuddle, but he wouldn’t move or even acknowledge me. Me feeling he literally didn’t care about my presence, I began to cry, telling him that he didn’t want me there he could simply tell me to go. Instead of that he cuddled back (?) and we ended up having sex. I went back home a bit after that\n\nSome days after this meeting, he confessed by text message he was not comfortable anymore seeing me because he felt pressured inviting me and having sex with me. I didn’t understand, I had asked him all the time if he was sure about his decisions, and he always told me he was. I got angry, telling him he didn’t have the right to hold me responsible for his decisions and feelings, and demanded an apology I never got. I ended up understanding there may have been some unconscious pressure on his end, and apologized while respecting his wish to not see me\n\nI’d like to point out that this situation arose many times before, and would always end up with him coming back and being kind and gentle with me. I would always think he would understand that he could not blame me for his decisions, but it sounds like he never learns.\n\nThis weekend I ended up texting him that I could not stand hanging on him like this, and that I’d rather cut ties than seeing the same situation happening all over again and hurting. He said whatever, but I wasn’t sure of my decision so he asked me what I expected of him. I simply told that I’d have liked us to be friends, that I was willing to settle for a sexless relationship, whatever it may be\n\nHe replied “Well I know you struggle with some social interactions, but I sometimes wonder if you live in the same reality...”... Now I understand I have some troubles figuring people out (and we already talked this out), but it sounded really condescending, and I’m not really sure about the innuendo he made in that sentence\n\nI just replied that I couldn’t understand what he wanted if he wasn’t upfront or wasn’t willing to open himself up to me, and he just replied that I was annoying. And he stopped replying altogether. It’s been a few days now\n\nI just texted back telling I wasn’t okay with the way he was treating me, and that he didn’t have the right to be that condescending just because I was trying to work the situation out.\n\nAs I wrote above, it had already happened. Him telling me that I was just a child because I asked too many questions, that I never understood anything. He has the right to be frustrated because there are seemingly obvious things I don’t seem to understand, but it hurts a lot to be talked down like that, and I never got any apology...\n\nWITA in this story ?",

My birthday is on 2 weeks and originally I wasn't going to celebrate whatsoever, celebrating my birthday isn't something I enjoy. But she said she'd feel bad if she didn't do anything to try to make the day special, so the bare minimum was for us to spend the day together, we both took off work that day to be together. We agreed beforehand that I didn't want her to get me a gift because at the moment she's not working, and I'd much rather her be responsible with her savings then spend it on me. That being said, whatever we end up doing for my birthday, I'm paying for out of pocket. So I told her that instead of a gift, I'd like her to be the one to make the plans for what we do, where we eat, etc. Considering I've done all of that for literally every other date we've ever been on. But now she's making a big deal about it, because she doesn't want to do all of that.

      "description": "I haven’t talked to my father in almost 2 years, and wasn’t planning on talking to him ever since I was pregnant with my first born.\n\nI lost my mother to cancer when I was 4 years old, and so then had to live with my father and my stepmom. Growing up my father had a really horrible temper and was extremely controlling. I remember coming down the stairs after waking up in the morning when I was only 5 or 6 and him asking me if I snuck into their bedroom in the morning and woke up my stepmom, and I had no idea what he was talking about so I just answered “No” and that was returned with a punch so hard to my stomach I was knocked over and couldn’t breath for seconds afterward. That was when I learned my father was unpredictable.\n\nLiving with him was like living with a walking bomb. Sometimes you could say snide remarks, and sometimes it wouldn’t end well. I don’t remember what I said to him, some mean teenage remark, but all I do remember is him on top of me punching me non stop while I screamed for someone to help me. \n\nHis house often felt like a prison to me. It was a rarity when I was allowed to leave the house (he was “protecting” me), but to the point where my friend would show up to my front door and I wasn’t allowed to bring them inside NOR go out with them, not even stand in the front yard with them. I felt so alone. There was a time I was grounded to my room, I wasn’t allowed to leave my room (only to use the restroom), and wasn’t fed during the day. I remember hearing my father come home and smelling the food he brought home. I was so hungry it made my mouth salivate. He loudly pronounced how he came home with hot steamy food and while they ate he loudly yelled about how delicious the food was loudly so it would hurt me even more. I was finally allowed to eat when everybody finished their dinner.\n\nI “ran away” from my home when I was 19, after he told me he wasn't going to let me see my now husband. My now husband picked me up in his car and I called my dad and told him I was leaving. He begged me not to leave, but I told him I had to. I think that made him resent me.\n\nI feel like my father tried to be a good dad to me, but he just had a bad upbringing and because of so he had a bad temper, had a negative view on life, and didn’t know how to raise a child. Because of that, I still tried to keep communication with him after I left and had to beg for his forgiveness for leaving the way I did. But I ended up being the only one to call him (he never called me), and every time we talked he was emotionally abusive to me and made me cry. One of the phone calls where he made me cry he literally laughed and said “aww did I make you cry?” in a mocking manner. After I told him I was pregnant with my first and he just laughed at me and pretended like I was joking the whole time, I decided I didn’t want that negativity in my life. Every single time I decided to call my father it made me feel extremely stressed and anxious, and I didn’t want to feel that way during my pregnancy. After I gave birth and still didn’t hear from him, I felt like I didn’t want that stress and negativity in mine or my children’s lives. \n\nI just found out I am pregnant with my 2nd a few weeks ago and just announced to everyone. I talked on the phone with my stepmom and she cried really badly saying how it hurts her so much seeing me hurt my father by not calling him and how horrible it is that he hasn’t met his granddaughter. I told her if he feels like he wants to talk to me he is more than welcome to call me and I won’t ignore his phone call, and she told me “Well he never said anything about it, but I know he wants you to talk to him”. She kept crying about how much he loved me as a child and how he was a \"perfect father\" and that I can’t deny that he was a great father. I couldn’t say anything because she was balling her eyes out at this point. She told me she thinks he’s hurt because of the way I left that he was worried that I ran off to my husbands family and told them quote “things you shouldn’t have told them” and then quickly changed it to “told them lies about him mistreating you and other things that aren’t true”. She finished the call saying “you know how your father is he isn’t the type to reach out, please it’s hurting me so much to see you two not talking please it’s in your hands to fix things, it’s Christmas, it’s supposed to be the time of love and family” etc. This made me feel really bad and guilty like I’m an asshole.\n\nI have no desire to call my father and talk to him. I don’t know if he even wants to talk to me, he has never expressed the desire to and has been very hurtful when we did used to talk. I only feel bad because my stepmom wants me to talk to him, she begged me to call him and said how much it’s hurting her. It stressed me out immensely just thinking about calling him. Would I be the asshole not to call him for Christmas? Because I really don’t want to. But I also don’t want my family to resent me just because I don’t want a relationship with my father. \n\nTLDR; I stopped talking to my emotionally and physically abusive father, but my stepmom wants me to call him again for Christmas and I really don’t want to, but I also don’t want my family to resent me.\n",

      "description": "So this happened sophomore year of HS (I’m 18). There are a few student photographers at my school who really flourish during dance season, but need “models” to photograph to create a portfolio for potential customers to refer to. \n\nI didn’t personally know this guy (we can call Steve), but I knew of him and we shared a mutual friend. Our mutual friend texted me one day. Steve said he thought I was pretty and that I’d make a good model. I, naive, told her to set it up.\n\nSteve texted me and we scheduled a time and place. The day comes and I get into his car and we drive maybe 20 minutes to the area and on the way he talked about me and how I looked, and though I was flattered, I was unfamiliar with him &amp; admittedly a little uncomfortable. We park and walk towards a fenced off area near the very back of a park. He isn’t saying anything about where we were going, but he points out an opening in the fence in which we climb through and are now immersed in bushes, trees, and branches. We walked deeper and deeper under these branches where eventually a path way was visible and I could finally see the sky again. Fortunately, I was just paranoid and he lead me to where he had planned to take photos of me; it was a flower field. The entire time he was taking photos of me he was silent. Didn’t say a word, didn’t tell me what to do.\n\nSteve wraps it up and we walk back to his car. He says he’s tired so he lays his head in between us, barely on my thigh. I ask to look through the photos to avoid sitting in silence. After 10 minutes he sits back up and asks if I wanted to get food. I politely declined multiple times and said my family was waiting for me to come home, so we could eat dinner. He drove to some food place where he insisted he at least buy me something to drink. \n\nOn the drive home, he was very interrogative and asked personal questions. I wasn’t really engaging in conversation. \n\nI thanked him when he dropped me off and went inside. I immediately made a “spam post” about it on my private instagram expressing my unique and uncomfortable situation. The next day, I had another shoot with a rivaling photographer  (we’ll call him  Dave) and Dave was really talkative. He was a lot more fun to talk to and it seemed he made an effort into trying to make sure I was okay and comfortable.\n\nEventually, when i get home later that day, I find out steve had commented on how dave photographed me after him. Dave, who actually follows my private instagram, said things with the general idea of “well at least I didn’t weird her out” and proceeded to show him things I posted about our shoot. \n\nSteve then ranted to our mutual friend about how I was a snake and a mean and malicious person for doing this, and that I shouldn’t have said I was “okay” when he asked.\n\nMaybe I should’ve been more private...I didn’t intend for him to feel embarrassed or for my posts to be used against him so...AITA?",

      "description": "So about a year ago, I went home for 3 months during my graduate schooling to assist my family with some funeral and estate dealings after one of my family members passed away. I left the northeast, fly back to the Pacific NW, and spent some time grieving and being in a really depressed mood while we buried one of my godfathers. (Not my 'official' one but a mentor and my great uncle) I was down and using alcohol and weed to cope and one of my former flings from college hit me up while I was in town for a few months. We started to see each other and casually date but mostly just go to basketball games and get food. Let's call her Sarah (fake name)\n\nOne night, we are out partying and I drink way too much. I fall asleep in the backseat of my best friend's suburban parked around the corner from the night club. I had been throwing up and my best friend (Let's call him Zach) put me there with a blanket and some food. I passed out and when I came to, Sarah was on top of me having sex with me. I of course pushed her off and found Zach and left. (This is January of 2018) \n\nWe break things off and go our separate ways. I fly back to the northeast and do my thing. Then in April, I get a call from her telling me that she's pregnant. I of course freak out but I remain surprisingly calm and decide to be an adult. I tell her that if I am the Dad, that I will be there for the child but I want absolutely nothing to do with her whatsoever. She begins to bounce between abortion and keeping it every single day. I tell her that she needs to be taking prenatal vitamins, going to the doctor (which she finally does after a month), and getting our finances in order. She does all those things and then is hesitant to tell me the due date. Turns out her Due date was December 5th or something. I do the math and if we had \"sex\" January 2018 there is no way that \"our\" kid would be able to be born in December. \n\nShe confesses that she was trying to trap me and that the real Dad just got sentenced to 9 years in prison. I tell her that I wish her luck but I need some space and I would not like to talk to her for some time. \n\nEverything goes away and she has the baby, etc. But then this week, she messages me on Instagram \"Hey how are you doing!!\" and all that crap. She continues to message me and call me non-stop trying to get back into my life. \n\nI wasn't sure what to do but after a few beers, I called her and blew up on her over the phone. I said something along the lines of: \"You know Sarah, you are the biggest piece of shit I have ever known in my entire life. Knowing you has been a mind-numbing, agonizing experience from start to finish including you sexually assaulting me when I was passed out, trying to stick a fucking child that wasn't mine on me, and thinking its all okay and that I \nam being an asshole because I told you that I wanted my \"child\" to have vitamins, regular appointments, and good food/support\". You are fucking scum and I hope you never fucking talk to me every again you fucking cunt\". I put her on blast on social media (Facebook) with tons of people saying \"Wow Sarah\", etc. She then apparently has been crying ever since. I took down the post this morning off of Facebook.  \n\nGranted, I feel bad, because she does have some mental health issues, but I have been through a lot. So AITA Reddit? Did I go too far? Or should have just let it ride? \n\nTL;DR: Family member died, moved back home for a few months, got depressed, dated bad girl, got taken advantage of in my passed out state, got almost trapped in a pregnancy and left, and then blew up on the girl later on for trying to come back into my life ",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI'll try to keep this short; \n\nAt my workplace, unless you are explicitly in a tipped position, you are not too accept tips. You can accept gifts with a value of up to $100 but it cannot be considered currency in any way. \n\nI know with almost 100% certainty that most of an entire department is accepting tips under the table. These are people I've worked with in the past, and while I wouldn't call them friends, we all know each other and are friendly. These tips can be upwards of $500 and likely even more, and while I don't know the frequency, it's safe to assume that each individual participating are getting these tips on at least a weekly basis. If it's true that most of these people are accepting tips against policy, there's no way they're being claimed with their taxes and they are effectively defrauding the IRS for tens of thousands of dollars annually.\n\nTruthfully, I think they, and everyone else, SHOULD be able to accept tips, given the environment that we work in (I won't specify but it's probably not hard to figure out). My issue comes from the fact that many other people have turned down hundreds and thousands in tips while this particular group of people have been accepting then because there in a position where they can do it behind closed doors, and in turn, this income goes unreported.\n\nI won't deny that these thoughts are partially driven by jealousy and greed, as I've heard that the IRS sometimes financially rewards people for tips leading to issues like these, so that begs the question.\n\nWIBTA?",

      "description": "My best friend and I are attending a formal valentines ball together to commemorate our friendship. Sounds silly I know but I’m kind of single (as in dating but no serious prospects for this event that is for Valentine’s Day) and we found out the ball was on the same day we met last year so it’s super important and we kinda got all weepy about it... Suffice it to say it’s just super important to us. \n\nI haven’t said anything to either of them and am unlikely too, but sometimes this friend really makes me uncomfortable - she makes fun of me to my best friend and my best friend always has to defend me. She also tends to monopolize the conversation most of the time she is around. I try very hard to include her in so much we do, in all our conversations when she is around, and activities that we plan, but she tends to get super offended if we do things when she is working or if anything ever happens without her. \n\nI happened to get my best friend a necklace, I bought it for her because it was similar to one I had that she loved. When the other friend saw my best friend wearing it, she asked her where she got it, and when she found out I got it for her, she said “But what about me?” \n\nI feel like “but what about me” is like her tag line tbh. I buy my best friend food a lot (so I can make sure she eats because she doesn’t always take care of herself) and any time I do this and don’t buy the other friend something she gets upset. She also gets mad when we go to the bar without her because she doesn’t have any money (which is a lot). \n\nShe also got really mad when my best friend drunkenly told her how I reacted when I heard she was coming out one night (she had a recent DUI and no license, I didn’t want her driving, though the reason she got a DUI was because she went out with other friends and we wouldn’t have let her drive like that, we always send her home in an Uber or take her home with us) she got really pissed and thought I didn’t want her around. \n\nAITA for not wanting the friend to tag along? For just not wanting to deal with her for a night and have my best friend night? I’ll never say it but it’s got me so disappointed. But I feel like a complete asshole because part of me thinks she’s like this because she’s just starved for attention, and because I feel like maybe part of me just wants my best friend to myself more, which is weird I guess... like jealousy or greed or something...? I don’t know. ",

I didn’t have anything (which I’m okay with). \nOnce we got back together, she seemed perfectly normal. She told me about her experience while on the break, which didn’t bother me too much. That was until she didn’t stop bringing up the guys. I asked her to stop and that I wasn’t going to continue if she kept saying stuff about them. (Ex: “*Name* was so hot and funny but I blocked him now. I’m loyal to you. Here’s a picture of him. He was cool.” Blah blah blah). Keep in mind that we’ve been back together for two months at this point. I never brought up any past relationships unless she asked, she just brought them up daily.\nNot only would she bring them up, she would also slightly change the story each time. For example, she said she blocked one and then the next week they were still friends? Who knows. \nEventually I just told her that enough was enough and I’ve asked her too many times to leave them in the past. I don’t trust her. This lead me to split with her and block her. And of course, it had to be on her birthday. (I still really like her now I just was tired of it).  Now her friends are texting me telling me I’m the asshole. \nHelp? AITA?

My brother has admitted that he’s oblivious to the point of being inconsiderate, and I tend to get annoyed easily. I also get chronic headaches that last for days (which he knows about), but I’ll get more to that later.\n\nWe’ve gotten into an argument about him bringing someone over before (it was 3:30am on a weekday and I work a 9-5) and they were so loud that they woke me up when they were outside the apartment complex.\n\nHe told me that he can’t read my mind about noise, so we decided on a compromise of me texting him if his friends were being too loud. That’s doable, right?\n\nLast night he brought his friends over after they went to a bar. It was only midnight, but I told him earlier in the day that I had a headache and wasn’t feeling well, so I was trying to sleep. They went to hang out in his room with the door closed, and I closed my door as well and turned on my tv for a little bit of background noise to drown them out, but I could hear them over my TV and through two doors so I texted him letting him know.\n\nThey responded by getting louder, and the next morning my brother told me that one of them upon learning I texted him asking him to quiet down said “fuck that” and wanted to play the guitar outside of my door.\n\nI told him that if his friends were going to be that rude when I was trying to compromise like we had discussed before, I didn’t want them coming over because they made me uncomfortable and he responded by telling me he would bring his friends over “whenever the fuck he wants.” \n\nI’ve told him before that his friends make me uncomfortable for other reasons, but their comment last night made me feel like I’m not even welcome in my own home.\n\nAll of his friends live alone and he’s the only one with a roommate but they always choose to hang out at our place. I’ve asked him if they could hang out at their houses a little more often, especially on weekdays, but he told me that he doesn’t have to do anything and that he’ll bring his friends over whenever he wants and that I don’t control him.\n\nAITA for not wanting them to come over?

      "description": "Neighbor (let’s call him Steve) is retired. I work from home. Steve has designated himself as the neighborhood watch. I’ve always been civil and have just wrote him off as a harmless, bored retiree. \n\nSteve has been nice enough to snow blow our driveway a few times over the last few years. Yesterday he did our driveway and apparently ran over a newspaper which obviously shredded it to pieces. There is no way anyone could have seen this newspaper due to the fresh snow.\n\nSteve was mad that I didn’t have the courtesy to pick up my newspaper. I asked if his snow blower was damaged and he said it was.  He then started getting loud and said he “doesn’t have to do this for me, and I could at least pick up the newspaper”\n\nHe then told me that when he snow blows, I need to come outside and shovel out my car and move it for him. \n\nAt this point, I was trying to take care of a screaming baby. I just said sure, and sorry for the hassle because I wanted to get back to my son. Later that night I decided to tell Steve that while we appreciated him doing it, please don’t snow blow the driveway anymore.\n\nThis is where things got weird. He started saying I was being mean to him and INSISTED that he’ll continue to do it. I should note we never asked Steve to do this, but to be nice we brought him dinner or a six pack regularly to say thanks. He continued to say he was still going to do it whether or not I wanted him to. I had to make it very clear to Steve that he is not to snow blow my driveway anymore. He stared at me for a second and said “if that’s how you want to be about it, then fine!” And stormed inside. \n\nI am more than capable of shoveling my own driveway. I never asked for him to do it, but made sure to show my appreciation. At the same time, I don’t want someone giving me orders. AITA? \n\n",

But during the course of our relationship I gave him quite a lot of money and spent a lot on him, and it was not given back. For his birthday I gave him £90 which is a 1/4 of my pay, and it didn’t leave me with much. Also here and there I would give him £10 because he was short, he does not have a job. Part of me wants to let it stay in the relationship and the part of me thinks I want some money back because I didn’t get much out of it. We were only together for 5 months and I would say I spent about £900 on him all together. I am not asking for it all, but some would be nice.\nSo AITA if I ask for some money back?",

      "description": "My roommate and I live in a small apartment. Shared bathroom, two bedroom, open kitchen/living area. We’re in northeast Georgia (the us state) and so temps are getting low. Our apartment hasn’t gotten below 69 deg with heating and air off but yesterday she turned the heat up to 75 deg. I find this really high but more importantly I cannot afford that. That will raise are electric bill drastically, something I’ve experienced in the past. I support myself, pay student loan bills, medical bills, and I’ve been helping my unemployed mom and sister. My roommate is a grad student with no job so she doesn’t seem to have to worry about money. When I let her know that 75 was going to cost a lot because the heat would basically have to run constantly she responded with “it’ll only go up a little and I need to study.” I suggested she use a blanket, wear heavier clothes, get a small space heater, and do other things she hasn’t tried. She told me she doesn’t want to. I told her she can also study on campus where it might be warmer but she refused that. \nThen what really irritated me is she said that since I was just worried about the cost then that’s not a good enough reason. I told her that, no, that’s not my only reason, I also won’t be able to sleep in that high heat and having heat running constantly increases our risk for a fire. But also I don’t get paid much (I’m a research professional at the same university she goes to and just graduated in May) and I can’t afford our electric bills to get higher than the $30 we each pay. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I gave her suggestions and compromised by agreeing to leave the temp at 70 deg so it will always stay that temp because it’s automatic. I would keep it down around 65 deg if I could to avoid paying for heat but I recognize that I live with someone else. ",

When I was little I only behaved if I knew we were gonna go to McDonalds that night, I've only really opened up to girls when I see sex in the future, I go eat with friends because of the food, not the company, and basically drop out if I don't like the food.\n\nI don't dislike anyone, I'm not trying to be a dick, but I've always had the instinct to only put in effort when there is something to gain.

      "description": "So my friend loves having pets. She currently has two dogs and two cats. Her frog died two days ago and she's looking to replace it with either another frog or a lizard. I'm not sure she knows the cause of death for the frog and plans to reuse its container for her new pet, which I'm not sure is a great idea if the cause of death is not known. \n\nShe is chronically ill and lives in an abusive situation with a sibling and her mom's boyfriend who both constantly berate her and the brother hits her. Her mom does nothing to help. \n\n(She's an internet friend and I've suggested calling the cops, especially after the last time her brother beat her, but she claims it's not a possibility because she doesn't have anywhere else to go, has no income, doesn't have access to any sort of birth certificate, ID, etc since her mom has it all and won't hand it over. I don't know what else I can do from a distance.)\n\nShe's planning on leaving soon to stay in a hotel or something, but I'm unclear how this will work financially for her and the last thing I think she needs to add while looking for another place to live is another pet, especially when she already has two dogs and two cats she wants to bring with her. She's constantly saving money up for medical treatments and medications and anything to make her more comfortable/feel like she's in less pain, which is understandable, but a new pet would add more unnecessary costs especially because all of her income comes from commissions and she pays for everything pet-related herself. \n\nOther friends have said I'm extremely insensitive since her pets make her happy and what she needs in her situation is some happiness even if it comes from pets. Which I totally get. My pets make me happy too. But I'm not in the process of trying to escape abusive family with not much of a plan at all and no income.\n\nAITA for thinking it's a bad idea for my friend to get another pet in her situation? ",

      "title": "AITA for telling my roommate she was wrong to host a party in our apartment?",
      "description": "I’m a college student living in an off-campus apartment with three other roommates. \n\nLast week, during midterms, one of my roommates texted our roommate group chat saying “I’m hosting a pregame at our place in two days on Thursday.” I responded by letting her know that I was okay with it only if they did not plan to be loud since I had a big paper due the next morning. Another roommate also said that she wasn’t sure she was comfortable with a large gathering in our apartment since she had a 30 page paper due that night and a test in the morning. Neither of us expressly said no, because we didn’t want to ruin her night, but we both expressed discomfort. The final of my three roommates responded by telling the wanna-be hostess that if other people had work to do, then it probably was not a good idea to host a pregame.\n\nThe night of the party arrived, and the living room of our apartment was filled with people. It turns out that not only was this gathering a pregame, it was also a 21st birthday party for the hostess, who’s birthday was a few days prior. While we tried to study in our rooms, there was loud music playing and shouting, and it basically sounded like we lived in a bar. After asking the hostess to please get her guests to be more quiet, the noise only got louder. They only stayed from about 9 to 11, but in that time they made it incredibly difficult to do work and managed to dirty our living room and kitchen, which are the main places where we all do homework. \n\nIn the past, this roommate that hosted the party has told us in advance that the rest of the roommates needed to be quiet on certain days because she had exams, and I think we’ve complied to the best of our abilities.  We have several mutual friends over to watch TV a few nights every week from 9-12, and we probably talk loudly, so I understand asking us to be quiet. Because she previously asked us to be quiet for her, I thought it seemed unfair that our roommate would ignore other people’s requests to have the apartment stay quiet. \n\nThe next day, another roommate and I talked to her, told her that we didn’t appreciate her having a loud party last night, and that in the future, we would like her to ask 3 days in advance if she plans on holding a similar event.\n\nShe responded by telling us that it was unfair of us to complain because we made loud, distracting noises while we watched TV, and that she never asked us to be quiet even though we distracted her. She also said that, since it was her birthday celebration, we made her feel like she was unwanted and shouldn’t celebrate. I told her that I didn’t have a problem with her having a party, I just wish she’s asked sooner because the night she chose to have it wasn’t a good time. I also said that in the future if she felt we were being too loud, she should text us and let us know, and that we would do the same for her. \n\nAm I the asshole here?  ",

      "description": "My fiancee is no longer really speaking to her mother for unrelated reasons, but her mother recently texted her saying I was a \"psycho bitch\" for this particular incident. I'm wondering if maybe I was in the wrong.\n\nMy fiancee and I are a same sex couple and have been together going on three years. We've lived together around two years, including around a year in our current apartment. Her mother came to visit a few months ago, and I wasn't totally thrilled (she is very religious, conservative, and anti-science. I usually just avoid those topics, but it bugs me hearing about how she treated my fiancee when she came out). Anyway, she kept trying to bring up religion (I'm agnostic, probably leaning toward to atheist side of things) and I was polite, but would change the subject. For example: \n\nFMIL: Where do you go to church?\nMe: Oh, my sister used to sing for the church choir at (redacted) Episcopal, so I still go there when she's visiting sometimes.\nFMIL: Well, [fiancee] can't get married there with you. We're Presbyterian.\nMe: We haven't really made any solid plans for where we're having the ceremony yet. We're trying to find food vendors right now, and they're all so pricey. Do you know any good food vendors?\n\nKind of trying to organically change the subject like that.\n\nShe tried to dig in with religion multiple times until I was finally like, \"Hey, I'm not really that religious. I don't really like talking about it because I don't really know much about it,\" or something to that effect.\n\nShe told me I needed to learn more to get myself \"right with the Lord\" and I said she was probably right, which seemed to satisfy her. She seemed to drop it after that.\n\nLater that night, we were all sitting in the living room and I was working on a Biology assignment that was due in a few days. At this point, my future sister-in-law had joined us. Future mother-in-law glanced at my textbook then said, \"Evolution is a load of crap. It should be illegal to teach that stuff.\" She said this with a tone, like she was trying to start an argument with me. At this point, I was over it, and said I was going to go to bed to work on homework and left the room with my textbook and laptop.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I live in a small city that doesn’t have a lot of dog parks. One just opened near me, and I was ecstatic. My dog is super friendly, hyper, and great with other dogs. \n\nBut here’s the thing: he’s a 10lb toy poodle. He always plays great with other dogs, is never aggressive, and some of his best friends are an 80lb Bernese mountain doodle and a 70lb pit bull/Rhodesian ridgeback mix. My dog is perfectly happy playing with dogs a lot bigger than him, and he can generally hold his own. And, I keep a close eye on him to make sure everything is going okay. He loves the park. It’s the highlight of his day. And it makes me so happy to see him be happy.\n\nAnyways, every now and then, there will be a dog at the dog park that is overly aggressive, has behavioral issues, or won’t leave my dog alone. Last night, a dog who was maybe 40lbs got obsessed with my dog, was barking in my dog’s face nonstop and trying to nip at him. And when my dog came to hide between my feet, and I bent down to pet him and reassure him, the other dog lunged at my dog, almost knocked me over, and and nipped my dog so hard that he started screamed. \n\nI tried to intervene, and I couldn’t because the aggressive dog kept dancing away when I got close, and then lunging at my dog to bite him again. I called the owner over and asked him to control his dog. \n\nThe owner went on a rant at me about how **I** was the asshole for bringing my small dog to the park (there’s no small dog area or other dog park anywhere near us). He said that small dogs have no place at the park, and he shouldn’t have to worry about his dog hurting a small dog “by accident” when his dog is just “playing normally.” \n\nI took my dog and left, but it made me angry, and got me to thinking. Why should the onus be on me to protect my dog from over-aggression? To me, this seems similar to victim blaming. He thinks it’s not his dog’s fault for being aggressive, it’s my dog’s fault for being so small and easy to bully. It reminds me of when people tell women it’s their fault they got assaulted because they put themselves in a dangerous situation for drinking alcohol or wearing revealing clothes.\n\nAnd, his 40lb dog plays with 70lb dogs all the time, and the 70lb dog owners would never dream of telling him not to bring his dog to the park because he’s “too small to play safely.” So why should a 40 lb dog owner be able to tell me that? \n\nI get that I should protect my dog and not put him in dangerous situations. But as I’ve already said, my dog has NEVER had a problem playing with dogs that are significantly larger than him, **unless** the other dog is aggressive and has behavioral issues. And when that happens, I remove my dog from the situation. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for taking a 10lb dog to the park? Should I just give up on my dog’s happiness, so that people with aggressive dogs don’t have to put any time or effort into training their dogs? ",

She \"wants to be friends\" then disappears.\n\nI started talking this girl (online) and we really hit out off. We texted for a few days and had a \"maybe\" to meet. She bailed the day of, because her cousins birthday party ran long. I said I would like to meet her this week but next week is okay if she wanted to talk more. We texted/talked on the phone with plans to do something the next Saturday. \n\nSaturday rolls around and she bails again! She texts me ~2.5 hours after we were supposed to meet and said she's sorry. She said she left her phone in the car during an office party and she also had the time wrong.. I accepted it and said how about tomorrow? Then she mentions her cousin was planning to kidnap her and bring her back sometime tomorrow. \n\nThe next day she texts Hey and gives me the sidestep. After nearly the entire day she agrees to meet me. We hang out at her house and have a relaxed time. The next day she's even more open.\n\nWithout disclosing too many details on here, her ex came by after a really crappy day and did something nice for her. This is the same ex she's been out of a relationship with for 5 months; they dated 4 years and were supposed to get married that Halloween. She said it never worked between them and that they were still friends. The Sunday I met her I could tell she still liked him. That Monday after the visit she went to bed earlier than usual. The next day she was super distant w/ me, where she had been wanting more all the time.\n\nIn hindsight I should have done something different, but I mentioned she still had feelings for her ex and I liked her way too much for how much she seemed to like me. I also said that we should be friends (which is what she said she wanted anyway, most of the time). This really struck a nerve with her! She got mad and maybe blocked me? She didn't respond except for one text, so I assume she did.\n\nAnyway, 9 days later I message her on the dating app and apologize. My timing was awful but I never knew where I stood with her (so many mixed signals). It didn't help I mentioned this (ex thing) on the 30th, when she probably had a lot on her mind.\n\nShe sends back \"I would like to be friends\", but doesn't respond to anything after that.

We’ve messed around before but (tmi) we don’t get very far because she breaks down crying (turns out she’s a virgin and hasn’t given a blowjob etc). She does this thing where sometimes she’s hypersexual and sometimes she breaks down crying, panic attacks, etc. She said before that she wants to wait a few months to have sex but then she’ll go and mess around with me so I don’t think she’s sure. It’s just frustrating. Obviously I wouldn’t do anything unless she agreed to it though\n\nSo anyway, about a week ago she attempted suicide and yesterday she was discharged from the mental hospital. She lost her housing last week so I agreed to take her in since she doesn’t have family to stay with.\n\nMy question is is it really that bad to have sex with her if we’re fooling around and she says yes? Like if we’re both consenting adults then what’s the big deal?",

It also automatically adds a 15 or 20% gratuity, and I always put 20%.\n\nIf you had a negative experience, they actually offer you credit on the app or a refund, so unless I'm missing food or anything...\n\nI mean, I know how to use the app, so no issues = +1, I got the right food = +1, the driver delivered said food = +1, right?\n\nRight, well tonight I ordered chinese food. I live in an apartment building so the drivers always call, and I go downstairs and meet them in the lobby of the building.\n\nSo tonight the driver calls and says he's downstairs. I go down (I'm in my slippers, it's not like I'm going outside?) and... he's not in the lobby. I go to the door and he's not even parked... he's sitting in the car in the middle of the road in front of the building. He gestures kind of impatient, hands me the food and 3 drinks with no cup holder, and as he does he says quite abruptly. \"Please hurry, it's too cold and I have many orders.\"\n\n... I know I have a right to be annoyed. I'm cold too. That's why I ordered food instead of going outside (in coat and boots rather than slippers) to get my own.\n\nHowever, if I complain on the app (it's asking if I was pleased with the delivery itself: I'm not) I don't know how that will affect the driver. \n\nSo... WIBTA if I rate him poorly, or is it best to be honest? Is it even worth being irritated about?\n\n(The food was warm enough, and other than wet slippers and a slight chill, I'm fine)",

We had a great conversation and all three of us have the same interests. \n\nAfter a few dates he told her there was no chemistry and moved on. I asked him why and he said she’s a bit chubby and average looking, and that she hadn’t had sex with him even though they’d been on 4 dates (she always paid for her own stuff and never asked him for anything, by the way) so he passed. She took the news fine and wished him well. \n\nI asked him kind of jokingly for her number and he gave it to me. I texted her and we started talking, now we are getting ready for our third date tomorrow. I really like this girl and I told my friend as much. He hasn’t said it outright, but I can tell by his mannerisms that he doesn’t like the fact that she and I are a better match than she and he were. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nTLDR: AITA for dating the girl that my best friend chose to stop seeing after a few dates?",

Yes, I've recently upgraded to having an exclusive, VIP Black V-card. \n\nSo here's the thing, there was once a time when I wanted to be in a relationship with someone badly. Lucky for me, I have had a few dates throughout my life sprinkled in here and there. Except they were never really more than just dates. It never really panned out-- some of the reasons being me being super awkward about the whole dating thing to finding some of the girls just not relationship material. \n\nBut as the years pass I've increasingly noticed that the whole dating/relationship scene is kind of fucked. More specifically, I find the rampant issue of cheating to be disturbing. I mean I've seen some of my friends and acquaintances being affected by a partner who cheated on them and it just gets to me. While I'm still open to the idea of being in a relationship, I now tend to err on the side of caution when interacting with girls who show interest. Because I don't want to be cheated on. (Nor do I want to cheat on anyone...in case that needed saying.) \n\nI understand that not everyone cheats and that there are good people out there. I get it.

      "description": "Me and my friend (let's call him \"Rob\") are males in our mid/late 30s. He's been a close friend of mine for almost 20 years now. I'm married with two kids, but Rob is single and lives alone. He's a bit of a hypochondriac, and suffers from crazy anxiety. Last summer he recently moved to my neighborhood after living out of state for 5 years. Over the years Rob has called me to ask about various health issues he's been dealing with. Everything from skin stuff to stomach/digestive stuff, to mental/emotional stuff. I've always tried to be supportive and helpful, and give him the best advice I know how. \n\nA couple months ago (after moving back here) he asked if I could take him to the ER because he was having shortness of breath, tightness in his chest, high heartrate, etc... So I took him, even though it was a really bad time for me and caused some issues with my wife because I had to drop what I was doing. His diagnosis ended up being \"stress\", I believe.\n\nThe reason it was an issue is my life is fairly tightly scheduled: Our oldest son is severely autistic and has *all* the ADHD (it's pretty bad). He's 6 years old, non-verbal, and requires heavy therapy and \\_constant\\_ attention, and it's severely draining on my wife and I. Luckily I work from home and have a flexible work schedule, otherwise I'm not sure what we'd do lol. Basically taking any kind of time away from my family is a \\_big deal\\_. Rob knows this.\n\nThis brings me to today.\n\nRob called me up today while I was out with my family asking if I could take him to the Urgent Care, citing dizziness/light-headedness. He's been expressing feeling under the weather for a few days, so it wasn't terribly surprising. \n\nI texted him and told him I was out and about, but I'd let him know when I get home in about an hour. I said that it was just a bad time for me, that I couldn't make it out of the house right now. I suggested he get Walmart or even 7/11 to deliver some Tylenol or something since they do that in our area, and to keep hydrated and get some rest. I also suggested he call an Uber if he really needed to go the ER/Urgent Care.\n\nHe said that he hates being alone and that it was more about having a friend there than the actual logistics of getting a ride.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad for him, I do. I just hate being guilt-tripped when I'm not available at the drop of a hat to go take him to the ER for something that I'm almost positive is going to be a minor cold, or anxiety / stress (as I mentioned there's been a pattern to this kind of thing with him).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here for not taking him? He's one of my oldest friends and I value my relationship with him and don't want to de-value it, but I'm starting to feel like there are boundaries being crossed here due to the fact that he's single and lives alone. I'm honestly torn here.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My son's mom and I broke up a year or two ago and she moved out, took the kid (her name is not karen). We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?",

      "description": "Trigger warning: some domestic violence/ mental health issues\n\nMy father-in-law (FIL) is crap. Physically, verbally &amp; emotionally abusive &amp; regularly cheated on his wife (MIL). The physical abuse stopped when HB had a growth spurt in college. The verbal &amp; emotional abuse mellowed w/ age &amp;  health problems (stroke, hypertension, etc). \n\nBut FIL is a good grampa. He doted on my kid (MK) &amp; was heartbroken when we had to move to far away years ago for work. The distance strained FIL's &amp; MK's relationship. It's hard to maintain the same kind of closeness when you only see each other on Facetime &amp; a few weeks a year.\n\nFIL's illnesses, it's become harder for them to go out. Most days, they just stay in &amp; watch TV. Their lifestyle, my FIL's health (might be related to his abusive behavior?), he was also diagnosed with anxiety &amp; major depression.\n\nVisiting my in-laws costs A LOT (we have to fly out). It takes a year to save up for it. Last Xmas, we visited for 2 weeks &amp; it was okay. We survived the holidays w/ a verbally abusive man &amp; managed to shield MK from most of it.\n\nNow it's summer break in my country, so HB, MK &amp; I started to make the most of it. We go on short weekend trips, take pics &amp; post them on social media.\n\nMy FIL follows our profiles. Apparently, seeing all the fun we've been having made him really depressed. So my sister in law (SIL) &amp; MIL called, practically begging us to visit so my FIL can spend time w/ his only grandkid, MK. They asked for 2 weeks.\n\nBecause they asked nicely, MK &amp; I went through our options.\n\nWe just spent last Xmas with them, so we don't have enough money for the entire family.\n\nOther option is to let MK fly as an unaccompanied minor but HB &amp; I don't like the idea. \n\nEven if that wasn't a problem, MK's not exactly raring to go.\n\nMK is an active kid, goes to summer music &amp; sports classes for fun. She knows going to my inlaws would mean just sitting in front of the TV with them or going on hospital visits. No malls, movies or museums. Just the house/ hospital.\n\nLast Xmas, MK also witnessed how verbally abusive FIL is to HB &amp; MIL. TBH, this for me is the biggest reason why I don't want her to go. We're not there to protect her. \n\nSo we called MIL/ SIL back to tell them that a summer visit isn't an option. We can't afford it &amp; we're not comfortable shipping a minor across the country unaccompanied. We'll make an effort to call FIL more often &amp; tone down the social media posts. We'll save more money so we can spend more time with them this Xmas.\n\nThat made us selfish &amp; uncaring assholes.",

She would also send coursemates to me with reminders to do stuff, and prevent me from doing certain things because I'd do it too slowly apparently. I put together a tube of reagents we both needed for a future experiment and she watched me do it only to say she'd prefer if we'd used one she'd done. I have dyspraxia so I do things a little bit slower but it doesn't mean that I did anything poorly. \n\nAnyway, we're doing the write-up now and she keeps messaging me asking for help. She said she wants to share ideas with me. However, I know what I'm doing, I kinda feel like that's her problem and I don't want to risk being seen as colluding.

      "title": "AITA For being upset that my husband didn’t do anything for Valentine’s Day?",
      "description": "Obviously, the title makes this sound lame, and it probably is. Today is Valentine’s Day and my husband (29M) and I (22F) typically just do something really small like dinner and small candy gifts. \n\nMy husband has a history of not getting me any gift at all for things (Christmas, my birthday, our anniversary etc.) because he typically forgets. Sometimes he’ll get me something retroactively, but sometimes he doesn’t. An important detail is that our birthdays, Valentine’s Day, and our anniversary all fall around the same time of year so it is kind of a lot all at once. \n\nThis year we were talking about our birthdays and I said “don’t bother getting me anything.” He argued that he would like to get me something so I said “I want you to make me a nice dinner.” (This is something I have asked him to do for the last 4 holidays and it still hasn’t happened.) He said he would do that. Then I asked about Valentine’s Day and he said “We’re definitely doing something.” \n\nToday, I arranged to have a bakery make a small personal sized cake, chocolate covered strawberries, and a chocolate heart for him. I got off work an hour early and came home to surprise him with it. He stayed home from work today because he is recovering from a fever and cough, but he was 90% better today and went out for errands. He wasn’t home when I got home, which was strange so I tried calling him. He didn’t answer, so I waited about 15 minutes and called again with a follow up text. No answer. I started to get really worried and called another 3 times in a row and still no answer. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later he calls me back and says “I was getting a haircut, but I’m coming home now. Is everything okay?” I said yes and see you soon. \n\nI thought he would be bringing something back for me for Valentine’s Day. But he came home empty handed, and seemed genuinely surprised that I got him something. I then expressed that I was a little hurt that he didn’t get me anything and his response was “Well, I had planned to get something on the way home but then you called me so many times I thought you were mad I wasn’t home so I just came straight here.” \n\nTo me that feels like a BS excuse and he forgot to get me something. I clearly told him on the phone that everything was good and I was just worried about him not answering for so long. I feel like he’s trying to flip it on me, like it’s my fault he couldn’t get me a gift. \n\nSo I took the chocolate covered strawberries for myself and I’ve been kind of snippy with him tonight when he asks me what I want to do. \n\nAITA for being upset that he didn’t get me a Valentine’s Day gift?

      "description": " \n\nI am a 36 and engaged to my girlfriend, 24, of 1 year. We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fiancée used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fiancée is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fiancée she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fiancée what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fiancée started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fiancée is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fiancée was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fiancée for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?",

      "title": "AITA for cutting ties with a toxic martial arts school?",
      "description": "Tl;dr: Cut ties with my old martial arts academy, parents are upset because they waived my tuition. \n\nI've been practicing tae kwon do for almost ten years now and it's like a religion to me. For those who don't know, there is a certain code of conduct that is expected of tae kwon do practitioners. I won't list all the rules, but the general gist is to respect everyone and everything, including yourself, and basically be a decent human being. \n\nSince I was 10, I had been going to an academy close to my home. At first, I was over the moon - I had been waiting for this opportunity to practice for a few years now and it was like my dreams were finally coming true. When I was very young, I had watched martial arts performances and instantly fell in love. My first dream was to achieve my first degree black belt - this would be a big deal because I would be the first black belt in my family. This did eventually come true when I was about 12. This was also the time I began leadership training. \n\nFor a while, everything was normal and good, but there was one major problem with my academy - the head master never stayed around for usually more than a year or two. Many of them went on to open other schools elsewhere and we never heard from them again (though one was more understandable, as he had to return to Korea to take care of his sick parents), leading to discontinuity in our curriculum and policies. While it is inevitable that two people won't teach the exact same way, there was just too much discrepancy from one head master to the next. This made it confusing for almost everyone. Additionally, we had \"smaller\" masters that would often come and go, which made me worry that they were either not being paid well or treated poorly. \n\nNow where it starts getting really bad: I was in my sophomore year of high school, and known as an assistant instructor at this point. For a while, I was getting along with the other assistants and senior instructors all right. I was going out with my first (now ex) boyfriend, though we are still on ok terms now. I'm not sure if he had some mental disability (possibly high functioning autism?) but he was in some special needs classes at my school. Did have some speech impediments but was otherwise pretty normal (he was also a martial artist but at a different academy in the area). On one Saturday, some instructors and assistants were asked to help with a birthday party for one of our students (he wanted it in the academy). While the party is going on, one of the senior instructors who happened to go to the same high school as my then-boyfriend and me (and was the son of one of the head masters) starts poking fun at his disabilities, and gets the other two senior instructors in on it too. They called him a retard, and the ringleader even went as far to DM him on Instagram calling him such. This made me extremely angry, so when I saw the message that my boyfriend had screen shot me, I showed it to the other head master of the time (not the guy's dad - he had heard enough about it from my bf's mom). He brushes it off and asks what my point is. Well, my point is that this behavior is not fitting for martial artists, much less those in positions of leadership. He thinks I'm lying and tells me I should apologize if I'm wrong. \n\nAngry at this display, I tell my own dad about it. I had told him about the offensive DM a few days ago and his immediate response was, \"Well, do you think your bf has some challenges?\" Essentially the equivalent of asking a rape victim what they were wearing. Then when I tell him about my master's apathy (we'll call him Master A), he proceeds to say I did the wrong thing and I shouldn't have anything to do with this. For a while, I believed he was right and tried to forget everything. I was pretty upset that no one took me seriously and considered leaving the academy then and there. I brought the idea of transferring up to my parents, but they talked me out of it and I ended up staying out of fear of disappointing them. The other instructors hardly said a word to me for a while, only poking fun at me when I made mistakes. Maybe this is just me, but I have felt that they condescended on me for a while too. \n\nFast forward to sophomore year of college. Master A is gone (opened his own school) and Master B is now the leader ( I think he still is, but I'm not 100% sure). He's pretty nice and reasonable, having waived my tuition for helping teach, but hardly speaks a word of English, making me worry if something like this happens again, he's more likely to believe the person who can speak Korean (I hardly do). I feel bad thinking he would let go of something like what I described above, but it's just made me have trust issues with any form of leadership from this place. I had been visiting my old academy during breaks, and it was pretty much the same deal as before I left for college. \n\nDuring my time at college, I joined a new academy and found a new boyfriend (who also treats TKD like a religion and comes from a family of practitioners). This new academy puts much less emphasis on competition and much more on the philosophy of martial arts. I was quite nervous about joining at first, but everyone there (senior instructors included) seemed to treat me as if I had been a part of the academy for forever. I was worried that the kids there would see me as an outsider and not listen to me, but they followed all my orders without question. I ended up falling in love with this place and am currently studying to be a senior instructor there, something I've always wanted. The head master there has been leading the academy since the 1980s and doesn't show any signs of leaving soon. He is also extremely generous, sometimes going as far to invite the whole academy to his house for lunch. For me, this new place was salvation and everything I ever wanted. \n\nWhile my bf and I were talking about my old academy, I told him about the incident mentioned above and he seemed just as upset as I was. He said that I did do the right thing because poking fun at someone's disability is not what a senior instructor should be doing. I also mentioned that I wasn't very close to most people there anymore, and he recommended that I cut ties with them. \n\nI took his recommendation last Thanksgiving. When my mom asked why I stopped going, I told her that I didn't think it was the right environment anymore. Cue her going on a verbal tirade about forgiving and forgetting (she is a strong Presbyterian. I am Presbyterian as well, though not nearly as strongly) and constantly mentioning that Master B waived my tuition, and that I was being ungrateful and selfish. She said I was being too heavily influenced by my new boyfriend (not a Christian, but overall a good person with a strong moral compass and very smart), and that I should be forgiving of something that happened a few years ago. I remind her that it's not the actual deed that made me most upset, but the fact that no one seemed to care much and that the environment has become toxic and I don't feel valued there anymore. Not one email/text from the other instructors/masters asking where I've been, so I guess I'm not too missed there (though I did get a text from a kid). \n\nSorry this is so long, but I need to know if I made the right choice. Everyone's perspectives clashing together, and I need some closure. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA? Ending a long term friendship due to their stagnated adulthood.",
      "description": "I have a close friend from college who I've known  for 10 years. He's always been a very non judgemental &amp; fun person to be around because we enjoy many of the same activities that my other friends don't - and his family treats me like I'm one of them. I've had a very close one on one friendship with this person for a long time. \n\nHere's the problem: There have been a series of issues/events over the years that have made me rethink whether or not we should be friends. I decided to end our friendship after a trip where I literally didn't want to be around them because they refused to change anything about their lives to make it better and I had nothing to talk with them about. The issues are below.\n\n1) The first being that he dated a woman for 4 years, knowing she had different long term goals than him of a nuclear family and quitting her job to raise children. The entire time they were together all he did was complain about her and talk about how he didn't want to marry her. I had many conversations with him on why he should break up with her - in which he would just apologize and say she wasn't that bad. It made me difficult to like her because he painted her in such a negative light all the time. Fast forward and he basically forced her to break up with him because he didn't want to move in with her, and that's the moment she realized she was wasting her time. I should also mention she had a condition that in her mid 30's, it would make it extremely dangerous for her to conceive. She was 32ish when they broke up.\n\n2) The reason he didn't want to move in with her (beyond not wanting to marry her) was because he still lives at home and has only moved out of his parents home for college. He is 31. Sees no point in getting his own place. Then complains about how he won't be able to get a girlfriend living at home.\n\n3) Has a low paying job as a mid level developer for a boss he hates for a company that has terrible beneifts. However he doesn't bother to find a new job despite having the upper hand in the job market, and complains about his situation whenever we talk about our careers. I always tell him it's easy to find a new job, but he claims he can't get a new job because other companies would want a referral, and his bad boss wouldn't give him one.\n\n4) Does not get along with my other friends. More so, he's not \"comfortable\" around them or my boyfriend. My bf is laid back and everybody loves him, and my friends think this friend is a bit of a snob. Not to mention he has this aversion to my other guy friends and only wants to talk with or be friends with the other girls at social events. He claims this is because girls are more accepting of the fact that he likes tea, cooking, baking, and other more stereotypically \"feminine\" activities. I wonder if he was bullied for not having a more \"masculine\" personality/phisique/whatever growing up, but I just wish he could blend in with my friends as seamlessly as my bf did when I introduced him. This is why him and I only hung out one on one usually.\n\n5) Lastly, he tends to think of himself as being better than other people because he has more \"intellectual\" interests/conversations or just because he has a masters degree.\n\nNeedless to say, over the years, my other friends and I have bought homes, changed cities/jobs/apartments/relationships.. started families, found long term partners, divorced... just changed. This friend for all their good qualities is stagnant, and Im frustrated because when you meet with friends you talk about life, and his never has change or anything good going on. And his lack of action to break up with a girl who was never a long term fit to begin with... It feels so spineless. \n\nI found myself thinking of this friend as a spineless individual who won't change their situation, and I dreaded hanging out with them as a result. I finally blew up at this friend during a weekend trip I took with them, and at first they just accepted that I \"thought they were holding me back\" (his words not mine), then after more explaining and me expressing concern that he was just rolling over to avoid conflict, he got angry and accused me of repressing my emotions/thoughts even though we've had many conversations about our lives &amp; life choices. \n\nI should mention in this conversation he said he was going through a dark depressive phase where he thought of himself as a piece of shit due to the loss of his girlfriend. \n\nWe ended with me apologizing and saying I thought it best to end our friendship for the time being and that I wanted friends to grow with and that he's had the same issues for as long as I've known him. I've cut all ties with him at this point in time.\n\nAITA???",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my brother's girlfriend to watch her kid more?",
      "description": "Ok Reddit, for this you'll need some backstory. I'm a 16yo girl who's lived alone with my mom and cat for the last 4ish years after my mom kicked my brother out. About a year and a half ago, my brother(21) announced that he got his girlfriend(35), pregnant and that he was bringing her, their kid, and her older kid down to live with us around Christmas time. Long story short it ended up being 3 kids, instead of 2 but we just kinda shrugged it off. \n\nNow, the girlfriend is extremely immature. She loves gossip, \"drama\" and is extremely lazy, think of her as a high school freshman essentially. One of her kids is a girl a month younger than me and, while she stayed with us, she was watching the baby more than everyone in the house. She fed him, changed his diaper, carried him everywhere, bathed him, etc. She was basically his mom. Now the reason she could do this all day despite being a child, was that she was homeschooled, but because she spent so much time watching him, she never did any work. Eventually her grandma, girlfriends mom, came down to visit. She was the one who kinda spilled the beans on everything, saying she was glad her daughter came down here because she didn't want to raise another one of her grandchildren (she p much raised the older kid.) The older kid eventually left with her grandma, her reason being that she \"didn't want to be a babysitter anymore.\"\n\nNow here we are in present day. The job of babysitting was transferred to MY grandma, until my mom called them out of it, and then to her 13yo kid. Now like I've said before, I've lived alone for the past couple of years, I'm an introvert at heart and prefer to stay away from people. If anyone's been super affected by these guys moving in, it's my 14yo cat, Shelly. Once the baby started  walking, his favorite place to be was the laundry room, in here he would turn the laundry on and off and eventually start eating cat food (this later turned into dropping cat food into her water dish.) His mom never stopped him from doing this, she'd just say, \"Ky, stop.\" And leave it at that. Their move in general caused my cat a lot of stress, but this threw her way over the edge, she started defecating and urinating outside of the litter box, became a lot more vocal and would only go eat at night. Now, I didn't mind cleaning up after her, my problem was that my mom was threatening to get rid of her because of this. I've had this cat since I was 3, there was no way in hell I'd give her up cause some milf can't watch her kid.\n\nA few nights ago, my mom and I asked her if she could try to keep him out of the laundry room (keep in mind that his actions alone raised my mom's water bills to $400+.) She became super defensive, saying that she can't watch him 24/7 cause then she \"wouldn't be able to do anything but watch him.\" She then got mad at me for \"blaming him for being a baby\" when in reality I was blaming her for not watching him. This really pissed me off because, even though my cat's actions aren't my fault, she still complains to me about her going on the counters (searching for clean water in the sink) and crapping on the carpet. I still take responsibility for my cat, but she refuses to take responsibility for her son.\n\nTLDR; My brother's girlfriend doesn't take responsibility for her son's actions and considers me an asshole for wanting her to watch him more.",

      "description": "So every July there is a huge festival where I live with artists like Eminem, Bruno Mars, Dua Lipa, Macklemore etc. It's ongoing for a week and as young people (18-20) my friends and I often go to have a great time, get hammered and listen to a couple of artists, but the festival it's know for being one week of partying. \n\nThis year we all graduate from gymnasium (like high school) and wanted to make a boy-camp with 8-10 of my close friends from the gymnasium because we have had bad experiences with making camps with the girls from our class etc. and we wanted it to just be us because this might be the last time we are all together - so we bought a huge area, around 100 m2. \n\nNow my girlfriend didn't get to buy a place in time and her and a couple of friends haven't found anyone to lay with. So of course she asked me if they could stay with us. I told her I really didn't think the other guys would accept since some girls from our class had already asked and we said no to them. I kinda just brushed it off since I didn't really want them to be there either but didn't want to tell her - if she's there I don't think I would be as free to do crazy, funny stuff and didn't want anything to hold us back from having the best time which is also why we said no to the girls from our class. \n\nFast forward a week, and a guy from my camp asks if we could share our space with some guys he knew. They wouldn't interact with us, we didn't know them and we would save some money so we agreed - only because they would be like all the other strangers around us - we wouldn't have anything to do with them and they would set up their own camp but just use half of the space we bought.\n\nMy girlfriend found out and got incredible mad which I understand since I said they couldn't lay with us but some other guys who asked after them could. I really tried to explain to her that we wanted a camp with just us guys and if she she had a camp right beside us I don't think it would be like that. I told her she was welcome to visit but if she was a few meters away it just wouldn't be the same... so Reddit..\n\nAITA for not wanting to share the space we bought with my girlfriend but said yes to some random guys?",

      "title": "AITA for holding a grudge against my girlfriend still in contact with one of her former lover (not in a lover's way, but there are messages)",
      "description": "My girl's parents divorced when she is young, she lived with her mom, &amp; her mom was quite abusive, so she had some rebellious time &amp; some farther figure issue. During her teenage years, she had some quite complicated love and sex life w/ some much older men. One of which is an Australian gentleman, whom according to her, was a very passionate lover, and amazing in the sack. (Frankly, although I told her I don't really care about her past lover, it did strike a nerve). I really appreciate her honesty as she told me these at the very beginning. For me, it is in the past, if she has let it go, it really just means I got to work harder in those areas. The Australian gentleman, as much as he encores her, left her as he thinks it's best for her to go live a normal life after his work term is done.\n\nFast forward, I accidentally found a cache of intimate pictures, letters, &amp; audio recordings in her hard drive, when she asked me to fetch a file for her. I was rather agitated at that moment. We talked about it. She says she is over him, just want to keep that memory. I agreed since I had my own cache of photos of my first gf too. But my cache was nothing intimate, it's a bunch of photo about a lot of the school activities we both participated. I agreed as I thought she means no more communications. Later on, it turns out they still occasionally chat a bit, exchange pleasantries and stuff, which I kinda feel annoyed (note that I never really seen any major messages being exchanged, just some seasonal greetings &amp; \"how's everything\" over Skype). Since it really does not affects our daily life, I soon forget about it, and from time to time, I told myself, \"look, I'm working on building our own life here, it's not easy, but it's moving forward. there is nothing I should be worried about.\"\n\nFast forward to last week, I found a letter laying on her desk from him - it's more daily life stuff at the beginning, but eventually, he asked her to gave him her banking info to be put in his will, so that she can receive some of his legacies. All of a sudden, I feel quite a bit of anger coming out, &amp; I just can't let it go. I talked to her, she says she really doesn't reply to those messages. But I feel that deep down she still wants to receive those messages. I mean if she hasn't given him the new address, there is no way he can know the address. And if she really doesn't care about the messages, she would not give him the new address.\n\nAlso, she claims that she has already forgotten what is in that cache of files since she has not gone through it in ages. I personally find it believable, as I barely remember what is in my cache of files. But it's hard for me to forget all those dirty jokes in the audio files, those love letters, and those intimate photos, as long as I know it is still in the hard drive.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I hope the need for a tosser account is obvious, but anyways here goes:\n\nWife and I are both on our second marriages and carry a lot of baggage into this relationship. I love her very much and we've had long talks that it was our fucked up pasts that led us to each other. Her relationship with her ex husband is actually really good and I the three of us actually have a really productive relationship in order to raise their bio kids. \n\nHowever, in between me and ex husband she dated this \"bad boy biker\" guy named \"Rod.\" As much as I question why, I know she fell pretty hard for this guy and he was at the very least borderline abusive to her. This part of the post could go on for ever but he pretty much left her high and dry and with some deep scars. As she tells it to me and her ex-husband, Rod proposed to her and then was literally gone without a trace the next morning. She suffered and the kids really suffered because she was an emotional wreck for almost a year. \n\n\nIt's been about 3 years and every year in February she sinks into a deep depression because this is when Rod pulled his disappearing act. \n\n\nLast night I was dropping the kids off with her ex-husband and he invited me in to have a beer. Like I said we get along really well so this is pretty normal. He started asking how February was going for my wife and I said it was just like every other February. He said that as well as he knows her, it's going to be like this until she gets some sort of closure. \n\n\nA little light bulb went off in my head so while she was out last night I created a gmail account that was my best approximate of what a douchey biker guy in his 40s would use and emailed her \"Hey this is Rod, I know what I did was fucked up but I wanted to let you know I'm sorry for fucking you over. You were a good person and I hope I didn't hurt the kids too much. I live in New York state now but I feel bad for what I did. Just wanted to say this.\" \n\n\n\nThe reason I'm asking this question is I stared at that send button for probably a good 20 minutes before I finally said fuck it and hit send. \n\nHer emails go to her phone and she reads everything immediately, even spam so I know she saw it. She didn't say anything when she got home last night and she's still asleep this morning and she didn't respond to the email from \"Rod.\" \n\n\nI'm sweating my ass off because what's done is done but I'm really torn if I did something nice for her to help her get through the month or if I way overstepped my bounds. No one besides, me this sub and the google overlords know what I've done and I plan on keeping it that way but AITA?\n",

      "description": "My parents have always been overprotective - at times it feels like they just want to be in charge and don't think I'm smart enough to take care of myself. Last year, I took a year off from college because of depression, I'm fine now and back at school, and they know I'm feeling much better. My only real concern rn is my Aspergers and my difficulty making friends.\n\nThis past weekend, my mother insisted in coming over for a few days so she could cook and clean my apartment. I was a bit embarrassed since no other student receives that kind of special treatment, but reluctantly accepted because I could use some of her excellent cooking and because my parents are paying for my apartment so I couldn't really refuse them. She came over and spent a few days working very hard to cook my a shit tone of delicious food.\n\nThe third day asked me seven or eight times in the span of half an hour if I wanted to eat my lunch. Each time I politely told her no, she ignored me completely and just asked again. This is not the first time she has acted like this, and after the eigth time of her asking me this I got annoyed. I raised my voice somewhat at her, telling her that I didn't want my fucking lunch and that I would eat it when I was hungry, and asked her why she kept asking me that question.\n\nWell she finally got it in her head that I wasn't hungry, and laid off for a while. Later we were having a light hearted conversation about some silly things one of my siblings did, and she handed me her phone to show me some texts she sent my father about my sibling. The texts her phone was showing had nothing to do with my sibling, but rather with me. The texts showed that she:\n\n* told my father that I screamed at her and told her to leave over her asking if I wanted lunch\n* told my father that I was depressed and stressed out again (I had told her multiple times that I was feeling fine)\n* told my father that my apartment smelled of weed and accused me of smoking to fit in (I don't smoke)\n* called me gullible for buying an expensive shampoo meant for frizzy hair (I have very frizzy and ugly hair, and don't want to cut it short because I am going bald)\n* told my father that when we went out for dinner the previous night I insisted on ordering a $90 steak (I ordered a $25 one)\n* made fun of me for not wanting other people to know that I have Aspergers\n* complained that I was forcing her to do my laundry (she did my laundry despite my asking her not do)\n\nOf course I was hurt by these things, and shocked that my mother was so vitriolic and manipulative. I and asked her why she would say such things. At first she ignored my question, then lied and said they were about my brother (they clearly weren't), and as I got angry, started saying some bs story about my father being mad that she had a boyfriend (they are divorced), and started fake crying. After 20 minutes of this and me asking her to leave she finally left.",

      "description": "So for a while I've been wanting to join a school club, but after the resignation of the club's former leader, It's been a nightmare to find it. Luckily I have a club with someone who goes there. So he mentions MUN in said club and so afterwards  I go talk to him about it. after a few minutes we decide to meet up at the MFL block, and he'd show me from there. So, come the next Tuesday (the day it's held on') and I'm outside the MFL door. I'd just left the block about 3 minutes after the beginning. I waited for 7(ish) minutes. In them anxiety started kicking in. 'What if they've set me up?' 'What will people in groups hanging out there think when I've been waiting for half an hour?' So then I left and went to my other club (I wasn't ditching it, this club was on every day and was a filler club for me). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for ditching this person? Were my anxious thoughts reasonable? Please let me know!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So this has been a story that's been bugging me for a while. I had a friend in elementary school, let's call her A, that was basically my best friend for a good two years. I'd transferred into the elementary in 2nd grade because my family had moved (we changed houses a fair bit cause my parents were good at gauging the housing market). I ended up staying there all through the rest of elementary.\n\nAnyway, early days of 2nd grade she introduced herself and we became pretty good friends. (We'd always go over to her house to play because at the time her family was a little better off than mine and could afford things like a new Wii and a big dollhouse and lots of toys.) So up until about early fourth grade, A was my best friend in the world. We'd play together after school (eventually at either of our houses cause my mom got a better job and we could afford nicer toys), have dinner at each other's houses, all the usual best friend kit stuff. \n\nBut for some reason, as we got a little older I become more stereotypically \"nerdy\" and not to mention I was a probably bit of a mess of a kid with unruly hair and the same 10 t-shirts all the time (I liked em, don't judge). A, however, started dressing nicer and even I think started wearing a little makeup to school (I wasn't allowed to touch makeup till I was 16, so I was pretty bad a recognizing it on people till like 7th-8th grade). \n\nOne day at recess, I went to find A to play something together cause that'd what we did, and she just starts asking me all these weird questions. I don't remember most of them, but one that always stands out in my mind is \"What's your favorite animal?\" I'm not good at picking favorites and thought she might like if we had the same favorite as her's was a tiger (plus I've always been a cat person) so I said tiger like her.\n\nA FLIPS OUT yelling at me that I can't have the same favorite animal as her because that means I'm copying her etc. etc. I remember crying as she was yelling at me and then never being able to talk to her again after that (I was lucky to find another couple of friends that were really sweet and one I still catch up with from time to time to this day) because she and her new friend group (all the classically popular girls) would always leave when I came around.\n\nSo yeah, you'd think that's it, dumb grudge from elementary school. But no, it gets kinda worse.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be placed in the 'accelerated learning' program or whatever (puzzles for smart kids) classes in 3rd grade, of which there were two sections each for 4th and 5th graders. A was in the other section in my grade, and I learn on the day we \"graduated\" that we both got into the same local magnet school (only one in the county, so there was no avoiding her). I remember actually getting to talk to her once after the ceremony, saying how it was great she got in. I also gave her one to the two Webkinz animals I'd managed to win from the lottery prizes that day as an olive branch of sorts I think.\n\nSIDENOTE: I loved Webkinz as a kid, cause I'm allergic to dogs and the one cat we had was super mean to everyone and we thought would probably kill any other pet we got (which proved true when she tried to kill our rescue kitten a few years later). I asked for one for every holiday/special event for a while. Birthday? Webkinz. Christmas? Webkinz. Special family vacation souvenir? Webkinz (and luckily that time a few postcards from Las Vegas cause my parents were smart enough to know I wasn't always going to have an expensive stuffed lizard). I ended up collecting a fair few of them from family gifts and such over the years, and it was A who introduced me to them so I thought she'd like it and we'd settle our differences.\n\nWell my, in hindsight, buying of her friendship lasted a good month and a half maybe. She glared at me in the halls less and wouldn't catch my gaze only to shoot me a nasty look and then ignore me as often. I found some new friends I'm fortunate enough to still know in college but A never changed. Our middle school and high school were in the same building and we both got back into the school for our last four years (high school classes were more varied so I saw her less).\n\nThe thing that irritates me is so many people tell me to forget about it. My parents don't think our breakup (and subsequent encounters) could've been that bad, and my friends who had projects/classes with her in high school said she was pretty cool and that I should've tried to hang out with her on occasion. And if they didn't suggest that they'd just kinda nod at my explanation and change the subject. But A has never stopped looking at me like she wants to rip my soul out and feed it to her dogs. She never stopped ignoring my polite nods in public or excuse me's when I squeeze past her in the hallway (there was one occasion where I think she might've mocked me for it at her locker before school with others, but I might just be overreacting there idk).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr A girl burned our friendship in elementary, ignored all my attempts at making peace, and proceeded to ignore me/glare at me just to make a point all through middle and high school.\n\nAm I the asshole for never wanting to forgive her even though everyone said she's probably fine and I should maybe try to hang out with her?",

      "description": "To add a little perspective on this, I’ve grown up in Texas and there’s a huge stigma against men not being the bread winners or at least pulling the same income as females.\n\nMy wife is in the military and we’ve been married about 10 years. Our entire relationship I’ve always had a full time job in Corrections in different states (each duty station). I’ve always pulled decent income and helped significantly build up our savings accounts.\n\nThe issue is I am really unhappy with this career and my wife pushed me to continue college and get a part time job somewhere, so I did after we were stationed in another state instead of pursing corrections again. Furthermore, being a military spouse I can’t hold a career long term because of the constant duty station changes. So I decided education was a smarter option. I was able to land a nice part time gig with my previous background experience pulling a decent wage. I also go to school full time. My wife is also pregnant with our first and will be due in a few months so I will also be taking care of the baby since she doesn’t have the option.\n\nHer mom insisted to her I need to get a full time job to pull my weight. I’ve already felt like garbage because I’ve transitioned to a part time job and rely mostly on my wife for income. I’ve told my wife I would happily get a full time job if she wanted me to, but she insist her mom is just being stupid and I’m fine.\n\nNeedless to say, this transition has taken a sucker punch to my self esteem and I don’t know if she’s right.\n\nAITA?",

I work at a Starbucks in my town, and my store has pretty poor management. We have had 7 people quit and ot resign at our store, and now we are pretty shortstaffed.

I have worked pretty tirelessly these past two weeks, and have only had 1 day off for these past two weeks.

      "description": "Last Friday we got the 1:30 yell of: “my butt is itchy” from our toddler. Any parent dreads that yell and we are no different. A flashlight check later and yup, confirmed our kid has pinworms. The kicker? It’s the second time in 2 months. Spent the weekend dosing the household with medicine, intense cleaning and a frustrating “talk” with our daycare providers. \n\nI reached out on Saturday morning, apologetic for bothering them on a weekend, informed them of our predicament and asked what their policy was for these situations. Their response was to commiserate and basically say unless another parent notifies them nothing but a thorough cleaning of the facility will be done. \n\nNeedless to say we’ve had many a back and forth in texts and in person with my aggressively pushing that they notify the parents as this is highly contagious and I refuse to be back in this situation in another month. They seem to think it just comes from bathroom practices and aren’t making the connection on how it spreads. It doesn’t matter how much you clean if the kids are infected and interacting on a daily basis. It’s led to a very tense relationship. They just keep coming back to me with non responses and sympathy but no actual compromise. Their final message was: \n“We completely understand your frustration. If you would like to schedule a time to meet with us in person we are available. Thank you and our facility loves you”\nI stopped interacting at that point. I’m looking into a new daycare. \n\n\nI feel awful because they’ve really put the effort in to clean the classrooms on top of their full schedules and yet, I’m not mollified. I’m not willing to circumvent them and reach out to the parents myself as I think it will create a bigger issue. \n\n The added complication is that I am pregnant so I am unable to dose myself. We’ve been lucky in that its missed the adults both times but I am not willing to take that risk again.  I also know quite a few playmates who have newborn siblings. It just seems so lax of the daycare to have that policy. ",

Scheduling a mandatory meeting on a day that works best for you, without asking about any ones availability, and knowing said meeting will take about an hour is offensive and inconsiderate of your employees lives outside this building.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was taken aback. Went immediately on the offensive with, \"You think this was a waist of time!?\", \"This matter NEEDED to be addressed.\", \"What does it matter how long the meeting is, you're still getting paid!\", \"So all that matters is your paychecks, huh?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did my best to keep calm and explain to her that if you are going to make your employees drive from home, or another office, or from school, or stop WHATEVER they were doing, that was not this job, to be here: It must be worth their time. Just being 'punched-in' is not enough. There's a balance to knowing that an employees time, outside of work, does not go by their hourly wage. By saying, \"It doesn't matter if the meeting was 10 min or 10 hours,\" shows that you do not value your employees time or their personal lives. And that is a very big problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe argued a bit before I told her that I had to go. But am I the asshole for telling her all this? I'm asking because now the CC'd emails haven't stopped...",

He comes home from college and messages me an apology for not staying in contact better (him not responding is cyclical.. happens every semester for the last five years).

It’s a 20 min drive each way. Like I want to see him, but it sucks to be ignored for three months then ignored again when I volunteered my availability. And he’s having other people over tonight too. And I have a flexible work schedule and offered basically the whole week. This is a good friend- like someone you can just pick up with even after a few months. And I empathize that it stinks to be home from college and then driving around hometown to see friends a bunch.. but it’s also over a month long break so I feel like a more mutually pleasant time should be achievable. He is a busy person with family to visit and holidays and such, so a month long break goes fast.. but I just can’t help but feel frustrated by this. \n\nLastly, sorry for typos or formatting. I’m on mobile.\n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "A bit of backstory: I'm deployed to a foreign country for the Army. I have a fiancé back home. My fiancé has a friend, we'll call him John. John has been her friend for awhile and he seemed like a good friend until recently. About two weeks ago he tried to kiss my fiancé. Dick move. But she reacted the way she should have and I was all good with it. Until yesterday.\n\nYesterday I Facetimed my fiancé after she washed her dogs. She is going on a trip to see her parents (other side of America) and was talking about getting to the Airport. I suggested having John take her since she trusts him, even though I don't really care for me. She said \"I thought you didn't like him?\"\n\nI replied \"I don't, but I trust you\"\n\nShe then panned the camera around to him, shirtless in her bed. They were both fully clothed otherwise. I freaked out a bit. I hung up on her, and when she called back I was pretty upset. She apologized, sent him home, and explained that he was helping her wash the dogs (Shes 5' 100lbs, they are both pitbulls) and his shirt got wet, so she put it in the drier. I said \"Well, we have different morality of what's okay in a relationship.\" She tried to joke it off commenting on my having something to eat saying \"Well you have a snack in bed too\" and that's when I lost it. \n\nMy Fiance has problems sleeping. I often tell her little stories to get her to bed. I told her \"How about next time you can't sleep you call John too!\" and hung up. She called until I picked up and apologized after sending him home, and cried about how she acted. All was good until I went to work.\n\n\nDuring my work shift, it just ate at the back of my head. My fiancé usually calls about an hour after I get off before I go to bed. When she called I told her I needed a nights rest to really get over what happened. She called me a dick and hung up. That was two minutes ago. \n\n\nReddit, AITA?\n",

I am the best man in the wedding in the Midwest. The wedding in the Midwest is on Saturday and the one in Washington is on Monday. (Labor Day weekend)\n\nBoth are good friends. The one near Washington I don't see as often, but the distance has not diminished our relationship. Both are understanding of the dilemma. The wedding I'm standing up in is fine if I leave Sunday and the one in Washington is fine if I miss his wedding.\n\nThe dilemma is between my wife and I. She thinks I am being a jerk for not wanting to do both in a weekend. It is for a combination of reasons. \n\n1. Money. Money is a bit of an issue. We both have good jobs, but taxes for me were drastically raised this year. I already cancelled a planned vacation die to this and I have stopped spending money on my hobbies in order to build up my savings again. (I'm only worried about plane ticket costs and hotel rooms, not gifts. Those I have budgeted for)\n\n2. Time off work. I get a limited time off and I would be leaving during my busy seasons. \n\n3. Not being able to enjoy either wedding because I'm struggling to make it to both and fulfill my duties.\n\nI have no issue if my wife wants to go alone. If she can make the money situation work I'm fine with it. (Due to timing my mortgage, and the wedding bills are due around the same time. I can pay for this but it will wipe out my savings until my next pay check. (paid monthly)\n\nI don't think my wife is the asshole. Im just hoping I'm not. ",

Important thing to note here is that it was never a point of discussion pre-build that I would be paying him to help. \n\nAs we start on the project, he’s did nearly all the work besides grunt things my other friend and I did. He was very controlling over the whole build, but at the time I was just grateful he was helping me out. PC gets built, and I’m ecstatic. I start to feel bad he did mostly everything, and so I nonchalantly tell him I owe him for it and that I’d give him $20 for all the hard work at some point after I got my paycheck. A few days pass and while hanging out with friends he mocks me for not having “paid” him yet. I found this odd as the tip I mentioned was more of a gesture that I would get to at earliest convenience, rather than an “IOU.” Almost every time I talked to him after building the PC he berated me for the $20, and it quickly started to piss me off until I finally decided fuck em’ I’m not giving him $20. Slowly we became distant, but this didn’t stop him from nearly 2 months later bringing it up in a group chat that I had yet to pay him his “fee” for building my PC. I kept ignoring him until he started calling me a “jew” nearly every other sentence just because he was so butthurt I didn’t tip him for what was originally just inviting my buddies over to help me build my PC. Finally I snap and tell him “alright what’s your Paypal I’ll send it to you” and he obliges. I then sent him 20 payments of $1, knowing full well Paypal deducts per transaction, and he’d only get around $15 of it. He messages me “are you fucking serious” and then proceeds to breakdown what I did like I was 5 years old and didn’t understand what I had done. I play dumb, say I’m sorry and that I was just trolling him a bit, and offer for him to refund it and I’d send it in full, but he takes all 20 payments anyways. I finally start to think this bs is over with, until today, nearly 10 months from when we built the PC, 7 months from when I paypalled him, he brings it back up in a group chat after getting roasted about something completely unrelated (and not by me), stating that I had never paid him for building my PC, and again calling me a jew. At this point I recap about everything I’ve said in this post in the group chat, and that it was ridiculous that 7 months after I in fact paid him, with him only losing $5 of what I originally was going to tip him, he still proceeded to act like I was this grand cheap ass for thinking I had a friend who wanted to just help me build the PC at zero cost. We argue back and forth, with his core argument being that he shouldn’t have had to say he wanted to get paid for it, I just should have been a good “customer” and assume he was not doing it for free. Reddit, am I the asshole?",

When I walked into work early this morning I saw one of my coworkers who works as a receptionist at the front desk wearing a surgical mask and looking like absolute shit and immediately found myself annoyed that he deemed it necessary to come into work and put everyone at risk.  \n\nWhat really upsets me about the situation is that this type of behavior is encouraged by management, as they went on a 45 min tirade during our last company meeting about how we need to cut back on call outs and wearing masks ,“ like workers in South Korea, who are the most devoted employees in the world”while sick was their solution to the problem.   \n\nI’m of the mindset that people get sick, especially in the northeast during the winter months, and especially in a profession where we have daily physical contact with people and when said people are sick they should stay home. I’ve gotten sick three times over the last two months and I have a one year old daughter at home who’s been sick twice this winter. So AITA for getting pissed and asking for my coworker to be sent home as to not put our clients and fellow employees at risk of contracting his illness?\n\n\n",

I tend to be pretty busy. I always feel guilty taking time for myself and whenever I do I just want to spend it by myself on small road trips.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is of course hurting my social life, which is fine, but now it's hurting my inner circle of friends as well. They're pissed at me for rarely ever making time for them. I think the biggest issue is that many of my friends are also in their 20s, but with little responsibilities. If I do schedule time to be with them I always try to limit it to a 4 hour block in my schedule, but they always want to go over the time and turn it into an all day event. It makes me angry that they don't stay within their block of time so I just refuse to try making plans with them again for another few months... This includes my immediate family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not making more time for my loved ones?",

      "description": "So long story short I recently had an abortion fathered by a friend of mine. He was supportive during, he came down to see me for the two days I went through it and, though it was kind of painful, we managed quite well just eating chocolate in bed and watching movies. Now however, it’s taken a bit of a turn. Basically he wanted me to call up my abortion clinic and ask for an email confirmation of my abortion so he could use it to get extended time for essays. I told him I did not want to do that, that it made me feel sick and uncomfortable and reopened stuff I just wanted to forget about. He then started calling me selfish, that he was emotionally affected by it too and that he needed the evidence to get the time as the two days he spent with me were on the week everything was taught for his essays. We sort of left it last night with me agreeing to call them, even though I still really didn’t want to, then this morning I asked if he was going to apologise for shouting at me and calling me selfish. He point blank refused. He said that he stood by every word he said and that I was being selfish and not thinking about him. He then said ‘are we done? Cos I need to go sort my life out’ and we hung up. I’ve spoken to my housemate and she said I was well within my right to refuse to do something I didn’t want to. I’m glad she is sticking with me because otherwise I would probably feel like I had done something wrong. I love this guy and understand that he truly believes he needs this evidence and that he will fail if he doesn’t - I just don’t know how to feel, am I really being so ridiculously selfish? \n\n",

      "description": "**TL;DR - Pregnant wife and I both sick, I try to be verbally sympathetic, the sympathy is not reciprocated, wife does pregnancy announcement photo with her sister without me and attempted to upload to Facebook tonight, didn't upload upon my request.**\n\nMy guess is a loud and resounding \"yes,\" but let me walk through some quick contextual items:\n\nI (32M) am a gigantic pussy when I get sick. It only happens once (MAYBE twice) a year and usually it's a 24-48 hour thing. It is not terribly uncommon for my wife (35F, 14 weeks preganté) to get sick on a somewhat more frequent basis as she works with small children. Impossible to tell \"who-gets-sicker\" as I think it's like comparing apples and oranges.\n\nWhat I do know is that I left work early and have been bedridden since 4pm today except for a bath I just took. Usually I have the fan on full blast when I'm in bed and only take luke-warm baths, but today I am achey, congested, and can't get hot enough. \n\nSent wife the following text when I got home:\n\n\"Afternoon sweetness. Just got home and let dogs out. Feeling substantially sick so I'm going to try and take a nap...I love you forever and always, looking forward to seeing you tonight because seeing your happy face is my favorite medicine.\"\n\nI fall asleep. She calls my cell 30 minutes later, saying she didn't read my text because she's driving. I said I was feeling much worse since the morning and was trying to take a nap. She says ok, I'll be home in an hour.\n\nDidn't sleep at all. Heard her come in, walk in the bedroom and start going through her closet. I said hi, she said I'm just changing my shirt, I say how was your day, sorry you're feeling sick, that sucks, etc. She says it's fine, closes bedroom door, starts watching TV in the living room (quietly).\n\nAfter another half hour I can't stand how cold I am, I come out to living room and say I'm going to take a bath, she says ok. As I'm taking a bath, I hear my wife's sister (26F) come in the house. NBD, not out of the usual, wife probably invited her over to hang out. I wrap up my bath, silently curse the entire winter season under my breath, put on pajamas, and walk out into living room.\n\nWife and wife's sister are doing a baby announcement photoshoot with the dogs. It's something we had talked about on and off this week about but never solidified plans. Wife is spontaneous so it's not completely out of the question, just surprised and a tiny bit hurt that it happened to occur when I'm out of commission. Possibility that my wife could have mistaken my lackadaisical attitude about the announcement earlier in the week as disinterest. I retreat to bed.\n\nWife comes in bedroom 15 minutes later to show me the announcement photo, asks if she can post it to Facebook. I ask if we could wait until tomorrow if at all possible, she seems taken aback slightly, but says ok. My thinking was that I wanted to share that moment with her and watch the replies live with her. Again, my request may have come off dismissive.\n\nWife comes in 15 minutes later, asks if I need water or vitamins, I say vitamins would be very nice. She goes into the kitchen, grabs pills (?), brings them to me, I say thank you, she says you're welcome, leaves bedroom.\n\nAITA for feeling upset that at no point during the day did she acknowledge that I was feeling really shitty, like \"that sucks,\" or \"I'm sorry,\" or \"is there anything that I can do?\" when she is one of the most caring people I know and I know for a fact that there were 3 separate times today that I offered these / similar sentiments? I think between that and the pregnancy announcement I'm just feeling a bit (selfishly) unloved.\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "title": "AITA for criticizing the way my mom homeschooled me?",
      "description": "When I was in third grade, my mom started homeschooling me at my request. I was a sensitive kid, and, while I wasn’t being bullied, I felt like all the other kids hated me and I’d come home crying most days. \n\nI’d also tested at a 6th grade reading level in the first grade, and the school wasn’t doing anything to help me progress. My scores would get worse throughout the year and only pick up again after the summer when I’d been at home with my mom, reading and doing workbooks.\n\nIn the beginning, we tried K-12. I did well with it, but, according to my mom, I’d forget everything I’d learned almost right away. She decided we’d take an unschooling approach, meaning I’d learn what I wanted when I wanted to. I was taking horsemanship lessons for a while because I was interested in horses, we joined a couple homeschool groups where we were able to take classes taught by parents of other homeschooled who were somewhat well-versed in those subjects. \n\nI’ve  always hated math. My dad is diagnosed with dyscalculia, and so my parents figured that I also had it, since I hated math so much. I got myself so worked up about it that eventually even just someone saying the word math would make me freak out. My mom let me just not do it. The most she ever did was teach me fractions through cooking and measurements. \n\nMy day-to-day was spent on the internet, doing god knows what. Watching funny YouTube videos and looking at cringey 2010-2015-era memes, probably, and reading the occasional fantasy fiction book. Sometimes, if I was feeling crazy, I’d watch a documentary on Netflix. The homeschool group was only once a week and I was mainly taking acting classes, and a couple of random science classes. One was taught by my mom and we’d watch Mythbusters videos and do experiments. I think I took a USA geography class where we read a book about Lewis and Clark. My mom also taught an Intro to Psychology class that I took. \n\nIn about 2015, my freshman year, we moved away from where we had that homeschool group. At this point, I had not progressed in math whatsoever. Had not even tried to learn more math for years, simply because I’d convinced myself I couldn’t do it and my mom reinforced that by not pushing me to do it. \n\nRemember, unschooling. \nIf she said, “hey it might be a good idea for you to learn this,” and I said I didn’t want to, that was the end of it. She wouldn’t push any further. And so I was allowed to just not do anything.  I also struggled with mental illness from 2013 to 2017. I went through a range of eating disorders and depression, and I never wanted to do anything, school-wise. So my mom just let me. \n\n\nI was also very socially stunted. It has taken a lot of effort and self-reflection to teach myself how to maturely interact with people my own age. I actually used to have a fear of people my own age. I’m still overly sensitive, and still put my foot in my mouth quite often, and I feel that I wouldn’t have had so much of a problem with this if I hadn’t been homeschooled. \n\nIn 2016, I started taking online high school classes that my new state’s public school system provided. I took Biology, World History, English, Spanish I, II, and III, a Personal Finance class, a Marine Bio class, and I was enrolled in an Algebra class for a couple of weeks, but I couldn’t understand any of it and had to drop out. \n\nWhich brings me to now. I was on the phone with my mom and she began telling me about how well my younger siblings are doing at this Montessori school they’ve just been enrolled in after being homeschooled for years. (They asked to be homeschooled about a year after I did.) She was telling me about how people have asked her if they’ll want to be homeschooled again after this year, and how she responded that while my siblings like to complain about the workload and the other students, they don’t want to be homeschooled again. I said at this point that I wished I’d gone to a Montessori school, too. My mom was slightly offended at this. She began to tell me what she’d always told me about public schools and private schools when I’d expressed doubt about my education, which was, “You think your sister is going to remember anything about the project she spent 4 hours on about a cell? No one learns anything by being forced to learn it. Even if you’d gone to a Montessori school you’d have forgotten everything anyway, because you weren’t choosing to learn it. Most people don’t remember anything from their middle school or high school educations. Besides, I tried to force you to learn stuff, and you wouldn’t! I signed you up for an algebra class and you dropped out!”\n\nYes, Mom, because I didn’t even know my times tables at that point! Or division! Or subtracting any numbers with more than 2 digits! You can’t expect me to know how to do algebra when you haven’t taught me basic math and then tell me it’s my fault when I have to drop out. \n\nCurrently, I’m in a European country as an exchange student. I don’t need grades, though this is my senior year, because I’m still technically “homeschooled” and my mom writes my transcript. I’ve noticed how much harder the classes here are than anything I’ve done before. I’m in the 11th grade here because the 12th is preparing for their exams, but I’m still having trouble keeping up. Granted the classes are in a language I don’t speak, but I know I wouldn’t understand the subject matter if it were in English anyway. \n\nSo I now have proof that my mom’s style of homeschooling has not gotten me to where I should be in my education. I’ve never taken an standardized test, or really any test, aside from the ones included in my state’s shitty online classes. I have no prospects for college. My mom used to tell me that I was just as smart as or smarter than the average high schooler whenever I’d tell her that I was worried about my education, which was frequent. She’d tell me that yeah, I could start going to the local high school, but that I’d probably hate it and beg to be homeschooled again because I was the only one there trying to learn anything. And she’d tell me that college was overrated and all it does is rack up debt, and that there are plenty of smart people who don’t go to college. \n\nI guess I just feel like I’ve been dealt an unfair hand, but also that I brought it on myself at the same time. I feel like it should have been my mom’s responsibility to make me learn things I didn’t want to learn, her being the parent and teacher, instead of just letting me slough it off due to fear of failure and apathy brought on by my mental illnesses (that went untreated for way too long, by the way— I said I didn’t want to be treated so my mom didn’t have me go to therapy or anything like that. Just because I said I didn’t want to. Of course I didn’t want to! That’s kind of how anorexia/bulimia work!) \nBut in my mom’s eyes, it’s my fault for not doing more, for asking for more curriculum, for trying harder. And since she’s my mom, she usually is able to convince me of it too. \n\nOn the phone call I just had with her, after I said I wished I’d had the opportunity to go to this Montessori school, she said, “I feel like you’re always criticizing me for the way I’ve homeschooled you!” I said that I was. She argued with me some more about how I was the one who dropped out of the algebra class, and then she hung up on me. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for not letting my boyfriend use my car anymore?",
      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for over 6 years. And living together for the last 2.5. \n\nAbout 2 years ago I had bad luck with cars. I had 2 cars get totaled within 7 months of each other.  Neither accident was my fault, and the only reason both cars were totaled was because they were not worth enough. \n\nOne car was my mom’s old car she passed on to me that had over 200k miles on it. I was hit from behind at a red light and the guys drove off. The other I bought used with the money from the insurance money, my savings, and a small loan from my parents. \n\nAfter the second car in less then a year was totaled from a deer running across the highway I felt I had to buy new this time. That way I get what I want in a car and if something else happens it will more then likely be covered to get fixed not automatically totaled. \n\nMy boyfriend is against buying new cars. He sees them as a bad investment that just depreciate quickly over time. He would rather buy a clunker with +150k miles on it with no heat or a/c, and terrible suspension for $3k then pay +$30k for a brand new car with all the bells and whistles. I understand his logic but respectfully disagree with him and he does the same with me. \n\nHe told me he would not be contributing/cosign with me on a loan when buying a brand new car. I said that’s fine. It’s my money, it’s my credit on the line, and it’s my car payment. My responsibility. \n\nI ended up getting a loan for only 1.6% with my work’s credit union and bought a brand new 2017 Toyota RAV4. And I love my car. I still stand by my decision to buy new. Very happy. We use my car all the time and my boyfriend only uses his to drive himself to and from work. He will often ask me to use it instead of his car. And I always say yes.\n\nFast forward to this past weekend. My boyfriend and I have bought a house together and we have been working on it. Fixing it up and whatnot. And I am the one with the big enough/reliable car that can do the hauling to the dump. That makes my car so dirty and I have started to notice more and more wear and tear on my 2 year old car. \n\nWe had cut down a tree and that left a lot of wood shavings all over the place and my boyfriend wanted to use my car to haul it to the dump. I told him I really don’t want to use my car to haul stuff like this anymore because of the damage it’s doing and I ask him to please ask to borrow a friends pickup truck to do the run. \n\nOur friend isn’t available when my boyfriend wants to do this dump run and we have to get it done.  So we start loading my car up with the wood shavings and the bags are breaking, making a mess everywhere. \n\nWe get the first load done and head home to get the last load. While loading up the second haul I notice there was damage done to the driver side rear wheel well. I flip out. I’m so mad that my car has damage on it and all the mess from the wood chips doesn’t help. I’m beyond pissed. My boyfriend doesn’t like to put up with my “fits” as he puts it and told me he will make the last dump run by himself. \n\nI realize from the beginning the damage on the outside was neither of our faults. It looks like a car cut too close and side swiped the back while I was parked in front of my house. It must have happened during the snow storm we had earlier this week. \n\nHe leaves to finish the dump run and I go cool down and clean myself up. Once he is back, I’ve already filed a claim with my insurance to get the damage looked at. I explain to him later that the reason I was so upset was the fact we always use my car and it is causing so much damage to it. I tell him I’m going to need him to start helping me with taking care of my car or we don’t use it anymore. He instantly starts going off about how he never supported me getting a brand new car and it’s not his responsibility. \n\nI was more referring to him cleaning my car after using it to haul stuff in it. From my perspective, it’s like if you lend someone you trust your laptop and they return it with the fingerprints all over the screen and crumbs in the keyboard. \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\n",

He just bought a condo and moved in on friday, I came over today to help him unpack as he had to go into work for an emergency. I was unpacking his clothes to put into his closet and drawers when I came across a pretty heavy box with just boxers in them. I thought to myself that no way are some boxers this heavy and moved them out of the way to find a small duffle bag in there. I thought he packed more underwear in there so I opened it up to put away but I found some things that confused me a lot. I found a shitty flip phone, 20k cash (which was the most shocking), a full change of clothes, Magnum Condoms (he can't fit into these for sure, so that was confusing) and a swiss army knife. I was weirded out by these things so I confronted him about it and he was pissed that I went through his things and said that the cash was for playing poker, he does play a lot. He didn't offer a explanation for the rest and I left hurt and he was mad at me. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I re-activated my OKC account and started talking to some people that seemed interested and wanted to meet to do something fun, like bowling or drinks and movie, etc. This dude was funny and quick to respond, and we made a plan for last Thursday at 9:15pm for drinks and potentially dancing.\n\nHe later mentions that he only wants to dance, and tries to change the meeting point from somewhere neutral to somewhere with a dance floor and not much of a vibe for talking. I talk him back to accepting a quieter spot where we can decide to dance after introductions and talking. I didn't want to immediately getting touchy and grope-y without feeling the vibe and seeing if he was nice. At first, didn't think much of this part, except that he must love dancing. So we plan for 9:15, and I tell him that I'll be at an event from around 6:30-8:30, but I'm excited to meet and will see him there.\n\nDuring the time he knows I was busy, he messaged that his grandma was sick. No mention of canceling, postponing, or anything. Just \"My grandma isn't doing well today.\" I manage to glance at my phone in the bathroom and could respond a bit later, asking him \"what happened?\" and if he was feeling okay, plus if he was still free. I  wanted to know and make sure he was okay. He talks about her health deteriorating, but nothing about our plan to meet in 30 minutes. Later, I still ask \"want to still hang? \" No response. He selectively answered my questions.\n\nThe next day, he says that if I had said I wanted to dance first, he would've wanted to hang since that is how he copes with things. But instead, he just ignored me. I'm thinking, he could've messaged me that he was sad and wanted to dance out the sads, I would be so down! Now, I'm noticing that  when there was doubt that dancing might happen, he got lazy and blamed it on a sick grandparent. Even if she is sick, isn't it sort of a courtesy to cancel something if you know that you won't be able to make it, or you're feeling depressed and don't want to see other people for a minute? He was comfortable enough to divulge his life story the next day, but the night of, he couldn't send a raincheck? So I addressed it the next day, said sorry about your grandparent, hope it all works out and you feel better soon. He apologizes for not being straightforward. We say happy holidays and move on. So cool, I'm over it.\n\nThen 5 days later, he asks me about my holiday plans, what I was cooking, nice things in general. Mentions that he'd cook eggplant parm for me one day, and that's when I just say  \"I'm not interested anymore.\" On my side, it seemed like a bad sign that for a first date, he didn't feel comfortable enough to postpone for something that I'd understand. I know some other girls are flakey online, but I value my time and other people's time as well, and I make that clear in my profile and with my words. My friends were telling me to ignore him, as that's what people usually do nowadays, but being ghosted and ghosting never really feels good, so I was straightforward.\n\nHe goes into depth about how he didn't want to skip the date, he just didn't feel up to it and that life was hard lately. He says that I don't know anything about his life and can't judge him by the fact that he stood me up, and that he thinks we have so much in common, including our humor. Not sure we really even talked enough for him to know that, but maybe he felt that way, sure. Of course, I feel a little bad, but also, this is just a first date. Shouldn't be so complicated. I told him, respectfully, that I feel for his hard time during the holidays, and hope he stays strong for his grandma.\n\nThen he called me an insecure bitch.\n\nI didn't respond.\n\nAITA for telling him that I didn't like being stood up, and wasn't interested in pursuing another date after that even though he said his grandma was sick?\n\nThis isn't the light fun that online dating is supposed to be!",

      "description": "Throwaway for personal reasons- some details omitted for anonymity reasons.\n\nI’ve been seeing someone for about 5 months at this point- LDR. Started as friends and almost immediately hit it off on a deeper level. We began spending HOURS every day texting back and forth and talking about our lives. I’ve shared personal things that no one else knows and the same with him to me.\n\nEventually it starts to escalate into more romantic feelings and we both express how we feel. There’s a strong desire to move forward to next steps and with intense flirting came other things - phone sex and sexting. \n\nNow he did send the classic dick pic (not necessarily unsolicited but I wasn’t begging for it either) along with some really sexy photos. I sent fewer back - really only flashing myself a bit. \n\nHe began asking for more ( I have to stress it was over time not necessarily demanding it or putting a ton or pressure)\n\nBut I don’t feel comfortable with that honestly. I had an ex who videotaped me and had repercussions for letting that happen so I’m extra sensitive on what I give out.\n\nI’d much rather just commit to getting together in person and making it happen...\n\nThe only TOTALLY justified point for him ( I don’t deny the unfairness) is that he currently has a webcam for Skype and I don’t (or haven’t in the past at least) so while I get to see him he hasn’t gotten to see me. I let him know I was buying a webcam and it’ll actually be here tomorrow!\n\nI’m just worried that even on Skype he’ll be wanting me to show myself and do things with / for him. I understand in fully committed healthy relationships it’s a normal thing and if I fully trusted him I probably would have ended up doing it anyways but... \n\nbut the conversation never got to that point sadly. Him being fed up with me not sending him pics of my body asked me to delete everything I have of his and has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since. We’ve completely stopped talking and he has said some hurtful things that are VERY uncharacteristic of who I believed he was as a person.\n\nTl;dr - fall for an amazing guy online who overtime begins asking for nudes and I don’t return the favor - he’s pretty much over it\n\nAITA? :(\n",

      "description": "What I am about to describe is extremely odd and pretty gross so you've been warned.\n\nMy girlfriend is an amazing girl, and we get a long super well. We rarely fight and have been together for ages. However, she has this one really strange habit that disturbs me. Every single time she goes to take a shit she feels the need to inform me. I'll randomly get texts like, \"holy babe I just took the biggest dump\". Great for her, but this is not information that I need or wanted to know. I'll get texts like this a couple times a week.\n\nI told her it was moderately disturbing to hear about her bowel movements and asked her to stop. She agreed, but went right back to doing it. I asked her to stop again, and once again she said she would but never did. I think she legitimately forgets and isn't trying to disturb me. I have no idea where this weird habit comes from but I wanted it to stop.\n\nI took things into my own hands. Whenever she started telling me about her bathroom activities, I would respond back with gross stuff along the lines of, \"that's so hot, send me a video of you doing it\". Now I don't actually want a video or find that remotely attractive, but I figured if I started disturbing her right back she would stop. It was working, I progressively got more and more gross until finally she stopped.\n\nI got what I wanted in the end but I feel like the way I went about it may have been a dick move, AITA?",

      "description": "So, here's some context.  I was previously married.  My wife passed away leaving me with 3 boys.  I tried staying in touch with my mother-in-law (nana) and sister-in-law (aunt), and I didn't do a good job.  Fast forward, and I'm re-married.  My current wife was mad at me my piss poor job.  She takes over and started coordinating visits.  This was tough since we lived in different states over 300 miles.  But she made it work and all was good until 2016.  \n\nBetween the summer of 2016 and the holidays of 2017, my wife coordinated 9 different visit, and 8 times their nana and aunt backed out the very last minute sometimes without letting us know.  This upset my wife because she is very family oriented.  The last time she coordinated in January she said to me, \"I'm not telling the boys this time.\" She was tired of being the one to build up the boys' hopes and crushing them when they backed out.  When the time came we got nothing. Text, Phone call, FB nothing.  This was the last straw for my wife, so she stopped \"trying\".\n\nYesterday, 11 months after the last failed coordinate, my wife finally got a message from the boys' aunt.  They wanted to coordinate a visit for the holiday's.  My wife was pissed. Although she stopped trying, periodically she kept sending messages with no replies.  Now, out of the blue, they want to see the boys at a time when my wife already has plans to take our kids to visit our families in another state.  She is planning on telling them no, and I agree with her.\n\nAITA for agreeing with my wife to not letting the boys see their nana and aunt?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I wasn't going to sell it still but I'm now seeing that my store is offering €50 for the game and that's a pretty sweet deal. So I want to bring it to the store tomorrow but my brother is saying that I can't sell it and it's not fair even though I'm the one who bought it with my own money. He wants to play online with his friends but it's not like he is paying for the online on the PS4. I'm the one who is paying for it. Every single year. He never helps pay for PS Plus ever. \n\n I'm still going to sell it since I bought it but I feel guilty and bad about it but the €50 deal seems to good to pass up on. The last time this happened was with a game called Injustice 2. He begged me not to sell it (I hated the game) and I listened to him and eventually when he said I could sell it because his friends moved on to a new game the game had gone down in value and I only got €13 from it after paying €60 for it. \n\nI'm 17 and he is 16. We both get money weekly but he spends his money on other things. ",

I've always liked chubbier men, I like the whole \"dad bod\" thing lol, but my boyfriend wasn't happy with himself so I encouraged him to maybe lose some weight if that would help him. It honestly is helping, he seems much more content with himself and life, the only issue is I just don't want to have sex every single day like I used to. I know I'm a massive dickhead and a bit weird for being like this, but I can't help it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like fit bodies too like any woman would, but I fell in love with my tubby man and I miss it!

      "description": "My cat went missing on January 6th and a few days later I told my 6 year old we could put up some missing posters around our neighborhood after school on our way home. I pick her up on my bicycle, and we took a different route home that day. The first place I thought would be ok was a telephone pole about a block away from the school.\n\nI had a staple gun and as I was putting the poster up, I hear a man talking to me. I turn around and see a man in a truck staring at me. Our conversation went like this:\n\nHim: do you have permission to put that there?\nMe: umm...no, do I need permission?\nHim: yes. You do.\nMe: okay, from who?\nHim: from me\n\nAt that point I thought he was just messing with me.\n\nMe: oh ok. Can I have your permission then?\nHim: No. Take it down right now \n\nHe then drove towards the culdesac on the street, turned around, and parked in front of the house on the corner. I realized the telephone pole was in the corner if his yard, though it was closer to the street than his house. \n\nI was dumbfounded as to why he had to do that. My daughter was standing right there and she was confused, asking me \"why is he telling you to take it down mommy?\". Instead of just leaving I confronted him. I was really emotional because i fucking love that cat. I asked him why he felt he had the authority to keep me from putting it up? What could it possibly do to inconvenience him? What kind of a lesson is that for my daughter? I told her if we put up posters, more people would know he was missing and we would have a better chance at getting him back. She doesnt understand why the man didnt want us to find our cat. I called him an asshole and a pathetic excuse of a human being with absolutely no empathy for other people. That was probably over the line, but I was so upset. I had cried everyday because I just wanted my cat back, and that day I felt like not randomly bursting into tears was a good thing. I had to stop riding my bike a few times on the way home because I had started ugly crying again and couldn't stop.\n\nI went home and emailed the city, asking if he really had the authority to make me take my sign down because it was in the corner of his yard. They eventually told me it was a violation of some city ordinance to put any signs along the road. I still put some up on people's fences along some busy roads nearby, but I made sure to get the homeowners permission to do so. Their fence is not on city property and as long as I have their permission, putting them on the fence is fine. \n\nStill though, I feel like he was just being mean because he felt he could intimidate me. But then again, I could have handled it better and not let my emotions cloud my judgement.",

      "description": "Perhaps the title is a bit (purposefully) misleading but Ill try to make this short.\n\nI am a girl and I live with boys. I live with my boyfriend and a long time mutual friend. In the unit below us is my bf's twin brother and one of their lifelong friends.\n\nThese boys spend ALL of their free time playing video games. All of my female friends have moved too far away to visit very often and I don't have very many opportunities to/am not very good at making new ones.\n\nBecause of this, I have sacrificed a lot of the things I used to do and stopped writing my novel in order to learn about videogames and participate. I think this was mostly subconscious, and it might just be taking a toll.\n\nIts difficult for me to find games I can be somewhat good at, mostly because I have vision problems and have trouble seeing things correctly on the tv but also straight up because they have more experience than me and I dont exactly find it fun to get my ass whooped repeatedly.\n\nBut every time I find a co-op game I think everyone will like, something happens. A new game comes out, they go back to replaying Halo for the 50th time, someone doesnt feel like it, or we play once and never again.\n\nTonight I kinda snapped a little bit. Ive been playing Destiny 2 lately and it turns out I really like it and am actually good at it. Even better, theyve all been playing it obsessively! Score! Im halfway to max level but I thought it would be fun for everyone to do a playthrough together starting from scratch, since Ive been on my bf's account and want to buy the game and build up my own characters by myself.\n\nHere's where the problem came in. My bf was unwilling to start over, saying he could just help me catch up by giving my character OP gear. That TOTALLY defeats the purpose of what I wanted to do. His brother \"actually doesnt really like that game\" and our roommate \"is going to immediately reacquire all his OP gear no matter what.\"\n\nI couldnt help it. I started crying a little. I excused myself and went to bed before causing a scene, and now Im writing this.\n\nI try so hard to find ways to spend time with my friends and its just fruitless. Im practically desperate for human interaction and Im worried its clouding my judgement.\n\nIs it unfair of me to be upset?",

      "description": "I’m on mobile so sorry for formatting. \n\nTL;DR: My best friend of 18 years was really toxic. I was supposed to be the maid of honor in her wedding. The day before her wedding she had pushed me to my breaking point and I “broke up” with her. AITA?\n\nExtended version: I grew up in a small town with only one other kid in the whole neighborhood. That kid was my cousin, JC. She was one year older than me and we lived less than a block away from each other. Unfortunately, JC was very unstable and insecure because of a traumatic experience. JC started to change when that happened. She was no longer the happy go lucky kid I had become friends with. She became very possessive of her friends and family members. She would often get jealous and extremely upset when I made a new friend, she would ask on a daily basis “you love me, right?”. It was becoming clear to me that JC had some serious trust issues because of her traumatic experience. JC could never keep new friends around for very long because of her insecurities. I soon realized that my relationship with JC was unhealthy for me. I considered breaking it off but I didn’t know how or when. I told myself I should stay with her because I was her family. I sacrificed my own mental health to keep JC happy. In my senior year of high school.  I had just gotten accepted to a somewhat far away 4 year college. I was so excited! JC was furious. In the next few months, money became very tight in my family and I couldn’t afford to attend that college even with scholarships and financial aid. I would have to attend the community tech school just like JC. I was heartbroken, but JC was ecstatic. JC had met this guy named Dan on tinder.  While Dan had been away on some kind of deployment or something in the Marine Corps, JC’s dad was suddenly killed in a work accident. As much I had wanted to leave JC before, I knew I had to stay with her in this time of need. JC leaned on me very heavily for emotional support since we had been friends for so long and her boyfriend wasn’t around. I was determined to not let her down, at least not yet. In late April Dan came back. JC and Dan started planning their wedding. I was supposed to be the maid of honor. The day before the wedding, JC was more insecure than usual and was asking me “you love, me right?” way more than usual that day. I couldn’t take it anymore! I couldn’t believe she didn’t trust me. I told her that she was unstable and very insecure and that our relationship was toxic and was starting to affect my mental very negatively. She was raging mad, as I figured she would be but I couldn’t take it anymore. AITA?",

It's been 2 months since we broke up now and she's messaged me asking if I still have her nudes.\n\nI told her that I still have them backed up on my PC but not on my phone. They were on my PC encrypted and password protected with an extremely secure password, along with all my other private files.\n\nShe then asked me to completely delete them, which I did straight away, no arguing or anything.\n\nOnce I told her I deleted them she blew up on me and called me a huge arsehole for not deleting them as soon as we broke up.

Thats why I deleted them straight away when she requested.\n\nBut I'd argue that if she sent them to me in the first place they're mine to keep for myself. Obviously sharing them is not acceptable.\n\nAITA for not just deleting them straight away?",

      "description": "I’ve been with my boyfriend for years and we’ve been living together for the better part of 3 years. We’re having a baby in two months so we’ve decided to cut back on eating out, which we did often. We eat almost all of our meals at home now. We’re both usually gone all day and make our own meals. The way my boyfriend uses up the groceries makes me angry. I find it rude and inconsiderate. He will eat an item and continue to eat the same item for however many days until it’s finished, leaving me with none. For instance, eat 2 eggs every morning for breakfast until all 12 are finished. Or have a bowl of ice cream every night until the entire thing is finished. I told him how inconsiderate this is and that maybe he should eat a variety of things so we can both have a wide range of food to chose from but he said I should *just eat it too*. I said I want to eat foods at my pace, not simply because I see him dwindling them down. The reason he does this is because he’s too lazy to look through the fridge and latches on to certain foods or meals when he learns they’re there. It’s annoying because he eats most of our frozen selection, and fails to eat the produce until he’s polished off everything easy to make. Produce goes bad fast and should be consumed first. He always likes my lunches—I take fruits and vegetables to work—but doesn’t want to prepare himself the same sort of lunches. I find it annoying that on days where I can’t be bothered to make myself a lunch, there are no fast frozen options because he’s eaten them all before I have the chance to have any. AITA?",

      "description": "A little context, I have been dating my girlfriend for 4 years now and we always discuss about when we’re gonna get married among other serious plans. We’re just waiting for a better point in our lives but we know it’s going to happen when we are more financially stable and ready. She’s always been there for me and vice versa and she is just plain wonderful. We both wanted a big family taking about having three to four kids when the time comes.\n\nHer anatomical issue is resulting from the fact that my gf had Cancer when she was a child and went through multiple rounds of chemo. She has been in remission for over 10 years and while that is not a current threat she was told that she might have some issues with fertility later on in life. These are circumstances I have long been aware of and we have talked about it because I’ve always wanted my own kids and my own family one day. After a long discussion the conclusion we came down to was worst comes to worst we would use a surrogate as I wanted a child from my blood and she initially said she would love the kid to have my DNA. I was relieved and felt more secure that even if we couldn’t have kids together I could still have this option.\n\nFlash forward to today’s conflict where she said she’s had a change of heart and would feel weird like she was raising someone else’s child. This was hurtful to hear because we had already discussed this and she knows where I’ve always stood on wanting my own family someday. We spent awhile arguing but couldn’t make a compromise either way. Finally a he asked me if this was a dealbreaker and I told her potentially it was. She said I was the asshole for not recognizing her feelings and seeing how hard this was for her. I feel like I understand it is difficult and she doesn’t understand that this is something I’ve always wanted. I’m trying to straighten it all out myself so I turn to you for judgement reddit, am I being selfish ...AITA here?",

      "description": "Basically, my fiancé has severe anxiety and OCD. He doesn’t like being late to places, as he hates wasting people’s time, and doesn’t like having to explain why he’s  late. \n\nWe live with my parents (paying rent, don’t know if that’s important or not), and there have been at least a dozen instances where my fiancé has said he’d make his own way to an appointment or to work and my parents have insisted they take him (we can’t drive), and won’t take no for an answer. Only to then, a short time before his appointment (I mean at most 15 minutes), tell him they can’t take him any longer. This means he’s then stressing making his own way somewhere. \n\n2 months ago, he had a series of worrying anxiety attacks that came with heart palpitations. He ended up in hospital because he was so unwell. They told him they needed to send him to have a heart monitor fitted, and that appointment was scheduled for today. \n\nThis morning, I asked my dad if he could take him to his appointment, and he said sure. My fiancé kept telling him it wasn’t necessary, as he could walk as we only live a 20-25 minute walk away from the doctors, and my parents were going out this morning. But my parents, again, insisted they’d be back in time to take him. \n\nIt got to 15 minutes before his appointment, and my mum texted him telling him he has to walk. He panics his entire way there, practically running, sweating (which isn’t ideal when you’re getting a heart monitor fitted), and shows up just in time for the receptionist to stop the nurse from getting in her car (that she’d already put all the equipment into). Which means he’s given down the banks by the receptionist for being late to his appointment.\n\nHe texts me all this. Knowing how upset he was by all the prior instances (that he begged me not to mention anything to them about), I get pretty angry with my parents for doing this. I tell him to say something, and he refuses because they do a lot for us, which they do. But when they make him feel guilty for not letting them help him and then make him late - and even miss an appointment over upping his medication - by cancelling on him, I see it as ridiculously unfair.\n\nHe begs me not to say anything, and I say that I won’t if he says something first. He says “I’ll tell them what happened” I know he won’t, so I tell him that he either politely tells them he needs more time to make his own way there if they can’t take him, or I will. Now he’s upset with me, and I feel guilty for giving him an ultimatum as I hate being controlling. \n\nAm I the asshole for this? Is there a better way I could have gone about this? ",

I was yelled at if I spilled some milk, went on the grass while wearing good shoes or even if she was just in a bad mood. Also, I used to be quite close to my grandmother and my mom would also yell at me (well mostly at her) because I would spend too much time with her.  But as I got older I started ignoring her more and more and also started yelling at her instead when I felt like she would yell at me. But the thing is, I'm now 17 and she more or less stopped yelling at me (she instead yells at my sister since she isn't doing at school that great), while I still ignore her and act hostile to her. Even when  she wants to have a normal conversation with me I tend to be uninterested, don't talk back or talk badly about her if she tries to say something bad to me. I'm however fairly neutral to my father, not close to him (am probably closer to some friends at school)  but I often have normal conversations with him. Am I an asshole for not trying to improve my relationship with my mother who isn't abusive against me anymore? One thing that I should however also note is that her parents are even worse than her (stole a dog for fun) so I can see were she picked up some toxic behaviour. ",

Anyways, subscribe to Pewdiepie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was invited to have dinner with my aunt and grandmother at a restaurant, where we were just having a casual conversation about phones. My aunt brought up that she had an addiction to reading too much news, notably saying that she read the Wall Street Journal. I, being the idiot that I am, brought up how the WSJ was trying to make Pewdiepie look like a Nazi. I guess my intention of saying that was to make a point that the WSJ are a dis-credible news source (I guess?) She thought it wasn't funny to make Nazi jokes, in which I said that dark humor isn't for everybody. So we had this argument about dark humor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I was arguing that what we find funny doesn't mean we support what the joke states. If someone makes a joke about the holocaust, it doesn't mean that person believes the holocaust was right. My aunt disagreed and was offended that I thought \"six million Jews died\" was funny. She says that dark humor jokes are malicious and discriminatory, and I repeatedly disagreed. I think that context matters when a joke is told. Which leads me into my next point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything has a potential to be funny. I said that subjects such as the holocaust or 9/11 *can* be funny, regardless of what we think of it at face-value. She thought I was insane for saying that and I, with regret, told her that she doesn't know what a joke is. I told her we can't control what we think is funny because we're all human. She responded by telling me it was immoral to support anyone who thinks it's funny to make jokes on the holocaust. And we kind of left it at that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize now that I shouldn't have brought up the Pewdiepie/media drama. Looking back, it was kind of a stupid topic to begin with, but I'm just sitting here, typing this, and questioning why I have a tendency to make people cry. Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Mike is normally never the type to ask for help with anything, he is very much a \"I can handle it myself\" type of person. \n\nBUT, very shortly after high school he got his gf pregnant. They struggled to pay for the pregnancy alone but now that the baby is born it's even harder. He has been having issues keeping a job and so has she.  A few months ago he called my husband and I and asked to send him gas money because he couldn't even get to work. We sent him gas money and a little extra for food and baby stuff (we live in a different state now so we PayPal). We knew he wouldn't ask unless he really needed it. A little while later we ended up sending a few hundred for some medical expenses. My parents still live near Mike and they heard about the money issues and put together a huge gift basket of baby stuff and $300 in cash. \n\nSince then Mike only gets in touch with us to ask for money. A few months back he asked for $200 for work boots which we said no to because we didn't have the money. But I'm a little offended that we were so close before and now he only calls to ask for money. I want to help but I also don't want him depending on my husband and I for money everytime he needs it. He even asked about moving in with us to help him save money which...is a no go. Not only will our lease not allow it but 4 adults, a newborn, a dog and 3 cats in a two bedroom apartment would not work. Yet he still insisted we talk to the land lord to work something out.\n\nHe asked for money again today and I told my husband no, I wouldn't be okay with giving him any more. I don't want him to change the relationship from friends to using us for money and it feels like that's what's happening. AITA? ",

      "description": "I’ve been working for this family for nearly 4 years now as a nanny. I’ve been there for them through some of their financial issues, at one point taking a pay-cut to keep looking after their kids when one of them lost their job, stayed overnight while the parents had to travel for over a week, even taking their dog to the hospital on multiple occasions. \n\nBut tonight I had enough...I don’t know what it was, but I just snapped..\n\nI told the youngest daughter (let’s call her Jane), 10, to go put on long pants for practice since it’s cold outside. Her response was to throw herself on the ground, scream and cry, “We’re practicing inside!!!” I told her that even if it was indoors, the building isn’t heated so it would most likely still be cold. She then went to her dad (who was working from home today but still needed me to run the girls to practice, help with homework and cook) and started sobbing hysterically, yelling “u/tiinypenguin keeps telling me to put on pants!! I don’t want to!!”\n\nThe dad comes in the kitchen where I was making dinner and asks, “Why does Jane need to wear long pants?” I told him it’s cold outside and it’s forecasted to rain tonight + the temps dipping. He kept saying, “well the practice is indoors.” To which Jane replies to sticking her tongue out at me and screaming “I TOLD YOU!!” \n\nThe oldest daughter, 13, was explaining to her dad that the building does get cold. She was just trying to help me out, which I appreciated so much. But the dad kept telling me there was no reason and I could leave and he’d take the girls to practice. \n\nMaybe I’m being overemotional and sensitive but I got in my car and started crying. I expected the other adult to be there and have my back and understand. Instead he made me look like a fucking idiot and allowed the youngest to get away with her disrespectful tantrum. The youngest one has a habit of doing these things. I’ve tried to just handle her behavior the best I can, but after years of the same shit I’m kind of just fed up. I don’t see why the dad couldn’t have understood I was doing what was best for her, not wanting her to go out in the cold. Even if the practice was indoors, you just never know. \n\nI’ve had enough and I’m contemplating quitting on Friday after getting my paycheck. The mom works all next week and needs someone to watch the kids but at this point, I don’t even care anymore about their wants and needs. I’m not under a contract with them, I didn’t make any promises. ",

      "description": "I'm basically the resident IT guy at home and everyone knows it. I love tinkering and building computers, I have a Diploma in IT Networking and I'm currently finishing up a Bachelor's degree in IT. I'm usually pretty great at fixing all manner of IT related problems, especially when it comes to computers. I think to those more uninformed when it comes to technology, I appear to be like some god like hacker Neo from the Matrix, when in reality I just try a bunch of fairly generic solutions until one fits. \n\nAnyway, this morning my mum's friend reached out saying that last night she had a power outage while her PC was performing Windows updates (gotta love Windows 10) and of course it completely fucked her computer. I had a similar problem before where a PC I had refurbished was updating when my mum yanked the power cord out halfway through. It ended up being a real pain in the ass to fix and I ended up just reinstalling Windows. Between work, university, gym and my daily mental breakdowns, I find there's not much room to schedule a whole lot else, especially with my downright superhuman procrastination. Today though I have most of the afternoon free and I finally made myself a horrid keto coffee (yay weightloss) when I replied to her message, asking her to describe the issue in more detail and I asked if she could still access Windows. She proceeds to ignore that question and send a bunch of utterly useless messages like \"I can't get into it\" and \"I dunno Its not working\". She sends me some pictures and I ask her if she's able to run Windows Updates again to possibly rectify the issue. She calls me and asks me to come in to fix it. I know for a fact that it'll probably eat up a good couple hours or so of my time at least, especially since its an OEM machine that's more locked down and the BIOS can be a pain in the ass on them. If I have to reinstall Windows for her, I'd have to prepare an install disk and go through the entire process which would take hourssssss. Am I the asshole for deciding not to help her out, even though realistically I probably could rectify the issue eventually?",

      "description": "A few days ago I was about to enter my tuition class. As I was at the door I saw that my friend’s table was blocking the door (it had a window above half of the door so that I can see what’s blocking the door). I pushed the door a little and my Friend didn’t move his table, so I pushed the door harder and the door opened, which also caused his table to move aside. But suddenly I heard something fell, it was his phone. I helped him pick his phone up and then I went to my seat in class.\n\nWhen tuition ended, I went to my Friend to see if his phone was okay and saw a cracked corner on the front glass of the phone. I felt sorry so I said that I would pay for the damages. And for a few days after that I thought that it was my fault.\n\nYesterday I asked him for the repairment fee and he said 900 dollars. I was like, 900 dollars for replacing the front glass?! Then he said I only had to pay 400 dollars, he also stated that his dad was furious about it. This led me to think if it was actually my fault that I broke his phone. We quarrelled through Messenger and both of us exchanged arguments on why I should/shouldn’t pay for the fee.\n\nMy points for defending were:\n1. I didn’t know/saw his phone was on the table\n2. Why was he blocking the door in the first place (after I said this he then stated that he didn’t know that he was blocking the door, which honestly just sounds idiotic)\n3. The repairment fee could not be that high. His phone is a Samsung S6 Edge, and the only thing that needs replacing is the front glass\n\nI have not given my money yet, because I’m not sure if it’s entirely my fault or not. Please help!",

She kept reaching for my crotch and then asks if I'd like to see her with her coworker. By this point im off the bed and getting dressed asking her what the fuck her problem is and why she'd ask something so specific and spring it on me, she started getting defensive and telling me she wanted to spice things up. I asked her if she had anything going on with this coworker and why she mentioned him specifically and she told me I was being ridiculous, so I left and haven't been answering her calls.\n\nsome very important details. I was cheated on in past relationships and I am 100% monogamous as a result. She has known for a long time I am not ok with opening our relationship at all and any threesome talk would be a hard no, so why she'd even ask is beyond me. second, this coworker she mentioned is a guy who works in her department and is friends with. They text sometimes and hang out with other coworkers outside of work, and im just now realizing i've never met the guy. i worry she may be cheating on me with him, or have feelings for him, because of how sudden this was and the fact she mentioned him by name specifically. I mean if you already have someone picked out it means you at least think about them, right? im now uneasy about her going back to work with this guy and how i can ever trust her around him again. \n\nThird, i feel very upset she keeps telling me I'm ridiculous and not explaining to me why she said that when i keep trying to ask, I dont feel heard.

Basically if I \"win\" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he \"wins\" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. \n\nSo last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. \n\nHe didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice \"heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake\" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. \n\nMy side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. \n\nHis side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first. \n\nSince so much is riding on this...am I the asshole here?

Due to their jobs they live about 3hrs apart but this was a decision only taken in the last year. Recently, he has been staying over more and more and whilst I don't mind this when she is home, it has now come to a point where in the last 3 weeks I am coming home to him alone as opposed to them together. This is because she has other things planned etc. and it is not like 20 minutes - we're talking (like tonight) a whole evening where he is lying in my living room, on my couch and I've had to hide in my room. Don't get me wrong, I like the guy, he's funny, interesting and a good chat but I think that I see him enough when they are together.\n\nI feel like I am living with a third person that I never signed up to live for, and it's not like he's contributing to the bills.  \nMy real question is - am I being oversensitive?  \nI also have a boyfriend who stays over a maximum of 3 nights a week, and whilst both of our partners have keys to the flat, he has never dreamed of entering without me.\n\nI'd just like her to show me the same respect that I show her. I am planning on bringing it up over the weekend, and making it clear that he shouldn't be here unless she is home herself. ",

      "description": "I spent the first 16years of my life wanting to be just like my older brother, he was kind, intelligent,  and took none of my shit, he was what i inspired to strive for better.\n\nAnyway, about 2 and a half years ago, he left an ominous note on his desk, due to him suffering from mental illness during his senior year of high school. This note sends my parents into panic. In that note he presented the idea of him thinking that he is trans. \n\nThis is where my problem starts, I know that, he is my brother, he showed no signs of being a girl at all, especially after attending an all male school, he has every male Characteristic under the sun and the last thing anyone thinks of when looking at him is that he is not a girl. He steals money from me, my parents and my sister, he's a pathological liar. And claims that the brother I grew up with, my role model, no longer exists.\n\nThis is my snapping point, the psycohlogist he was seeing about being trans, tried to tell him he isn't a girl(the only reason why I know this is because he stopped going after the psychologist disagreed with his idea of being trans). He's lied to the psychologist about appointments and he's been caught out on many lies about how he thinks he feels. He's torn apart our family and thinks everyone in our house are more or less \"incels\"\n\nI know how everyone says we should try and be accepting. I have no problem with sexuality and sexual preference. I hate him, I just don't know wether or not I'm justified for it\n\n",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm at college in a triple dorm and before moving in we all agreed we would work out the bunking and closet situation once we got there but of course that fell through and as the last one to move in, I was defaulted to top bunk and all the other non-preferential options for desk and closet space. Whatever, I don't really care that much about any of it except for the bunk, which we had agreed would be contentious and require working out. It's a week from the end of the first (fall) quarter, and for the quarter I have been mentioning to my roommate that I would take bottom bunk winter quarter since he just presumed it for fall. Every-time I say it he just says \"no, not happening\" but I have never been in the mood to argue or really discuss it until now when it's coming down to the wire. Of course when I told him again the reaction was the same but this time I told him I thought it was a more fair compromise than first come first serve tough luck. As far as I can tell his only arguments for not swapping bunks are \"life's not always fair\", \"most people don't switch\", and \"all my things are set up already\" but the only thing on the beds are sheets so I don't think that argument is very legit. I'm even conceding that he can have bottom again in Spring, meaning he'll have the bottom for two quarters and me only one. I really don't understand how I can be in the wrong on this one but that's why I'm asking you guys if it's possible that I am the asshole here. I'm also out of options on how to deal with this because he is saying there's now way he'll leave and if I try to sleep in the bed he'll just get in and sleep with me.  Any advice would be appreciated on how to deal with my spoiled stubborn roommate.",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my boyfriend who has mental health issues?",
      "description": "So I recently broke up with my boyfriend and we’ve been on and off for about 6 years. Around two years ago, he found out that he was suffering from severe depression, anxiety and he was bipolar and I wanted to fully support him and be there for him since I was also going through the same thing so I could empathise. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was pretty rocky after that. There were a lot of days where he’d just break down crying for no reason (and he’d say that he doesn’t know why either. He just felt shitty) or him having a nervous breakdown. And I mean, these were basically a daily occurrence. But simultaneously, we’d have really good days where we’d hang out and have such a great time. On those days, he was just a really happy, positive person who loved to mess around and I loved that side of him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt one point he said that he was fine if we broke up because of all the issues and the stress that he put on us and me, but I said that it was okay because at the time I really believed that things would get better. I really did love him at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then several months went by and nothing really changed. I felt really conflicted because I didn’t want to come off as an asshole for not caring about his mental health issues, but simultaneously I was so stressed out because on top of the troubles I had with him, I had to deal with school and it was a really heavy workload at the time as well as family issues. So, having him around and trying to make him feel better always stressed me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe'd make a big deal out of the smallest things. If I didn’t say ‘I love you’ back because I was preoccupied, he’d get mad. He wanted to have serious conversations all the time, and he'd take me away from my work and saying “it’ll only take like 5 minutes” with teary eyes but then after I came back, I realised it took half an hour. If I met up with my friends he’d say that I was putting my friends before him. But I couldn’t really break up with him because the moment I left, something bad always happened to him. He also used to say things like “You’re the best thing that’s happened to me in the last six years and I can’t see my life without you”, so I felt like I had to say. And throughout all of this, he’d have visible cut marks all across his arms and he’d be really skinny and underweight from undereating. He also couldn’t get out of bed most days and he basically stopped interacting with his friends (who, at the time did basically nothing to help him out). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust yesterday, I went out for a friend’s birthday and we were out pretty late. I saw that he had called me and texted me a couple of times and I missed a couple of them. Others, I missed on purpose because I honestly needed a break from him. He also sent me numerous texts during the day but I also ignored them. I still don’t really regret because I honestly didn’t want to talk to him at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe had realised that I was ignoring him because on messenger, I'd say that I was active (since I needed to respond to my friends about what we were doing that night) but I didn’t read or respond to his messages at all. Anyways, I went out that night, had a great time and I basically forgot about him until I got home when I was bombarded with text messages and missed calls. He was going on and on about whether I cared about him and said that I wasn’t pulling my weight in the relationship. He said that I needed to try harder in the relationship and put as much effort as he was. I explained that I wasn't going to put any more effort into him than any other aspect of my life, and that I was stressed enough. Also I said that relationships shouldn't be this much work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe told me that if that was how I viewed relationships, *I wasn't capable of love.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI. WAS. SO. BLOODY. **PISSED**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho the fuck says that after years of a stressful relationship? I was basically the only person there for him for years and I had to deal with all the stress he put on me for ages and he still thought that I wasn't trying. For years I had to look after him and make sure that he was okay and it completely wore me down. I just broke up with him. Even though it was over text and some people hate that and think it's rude, I just had to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs of now I don't actually feel upset at all. Maybe it's because I haven't fully comprehended what happened yet, but I also feel kinda free from letting go of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now I'm getting messages from all his friends basically yelling at me, saying that he's really upset and heartbroken. I'm also a bit scared about whether something bad is going to happen with him. But in saying that, I'm still really happy that I left it. AITA?",

We live on a reasonable size property and we'd thought about getting layers a few times so I said sure. I got a heat lamp and used a large indoor cat enclosure we had. The 5 little chicks quite happily moved in to our lounge room.\n\nI was casually talking at work about making or buying a chicken coop when a co-worker said to me \"I have a half built coop at home that I never ended up needing, I'll finish it off and you pay for the materials. I'll actually be glad to get rid of it from behind my garage.\" Cool, I think, this co-worker is very hands on and I've seen heaps of his work in the past. He makes great stuff and takes pride in his work.\n\nSo this is where everything falls apart, weeks go by, I mention it to my workmate a few times but I don't want to harass him for doing me a favour. He keeps telling me he's working on it, even goes as far as saying he'll finish it on Friday and offers to deliver it on the weekend. He flakes, then he's on annual leave and tells me he'll work on it then. Bit he flakes again the following weekend. All the while the chickens are getting bigger and still living inside my house.\n\nAfter about 2 monthhs of my wife yelling at me, i finally I have to pull the pin and buy a chicken coop. Now my workmate is upset that he's put more money into a coop he doesn't need (it's still not finished.)\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "This one needs a little back story. \n\nMy father is an alcoholic. He drinks a lot on weekends, but somehow manages to sober up before work during the week. \n\nHis drinking has affected me very negatively over the years, as I've bottled up my thoughts and feelings while listening to his drunk tirades and verbal abuse, which in some cases has turned physical. \n\nDespite his drinking, he does try. He helped me buy my first car by covering half the cost, helped me enroll in college and many other things. \n\nHowever, the straw that broke the camel's back was when we ended up moving the phone bill to my credit card. He promised to pay me back each month, but missed the payment twice, which ultimately ended up costing me when I was unable to purchase lab supplies. \n\nI ended up losing my head, and for the first time in my life, yelled at him over the phone. This was in September, and I haven't spoken to him since as I live with my mother (and will be moving in to my own apartment very soon). \n\nHe's tried calling me several times in the past months, and has tried twice just today. I've ignored all of his calls. \n\nAITA for not answering?",

      "description": "So I'm in college out of state, and one of the things I had to do as a result of being an out of state student, and just because it's college, was make new friends. So among one of my first new friends I made friends with this girl, let's call her Sophie.\n\nSo Sophie was a decent person (I thought) and was also really good at the chem class we both had together that I struggled with. So I started studying with her on a semi frequent basis. However, as things went on she slowly became less of a person I wanted to hang out with.\n\nFirst thing that started happening was she started messaging me while I was busy. First it was once, then it was multiple times. Then it would be even when I told her in advance that I would be busy from time X to time Y she would still message me MULTIPLE times, looking for help that I didn't want to provide because I was BUSY. However, being the nice human that I am, I decided to answer her anyway (my mistake) which meant that this messaging got WORSE even when I told her I was busy in advance.\n\nThen she started asking me for answers instead of help, which I didn't provide because academic integrity is something I take seriously in college, but still, that was red flag #2. Then after that, as I started making more friends, even more shit happened.\n\nSo I started making friends with other people through clubs and classes, and as it so happened one of my new friends also had chem with the same professor Sophie and I had. So, he and I began to study together sometimes because we just took a general liking to each other. This is when things start to get worse, because everytime I told her I was studying with someone else, she'd get angry at me for studying with someone else (I don't get it? Anybody have an explanation for someone who isn't the best socially?).\n\nBecause at this point she just all around wasn't really someone I wanted to continue spending time with, I ghosted on her, and have avoided seeing her (for the most part) for the last two weeks. AITA? Should I have not ghosted?",

Being an HR representative, and serving 15 different clients, with employment wallets well over the thousands, I strongly believe that I've been around long enough to say that I know my job very well. That said, some of my colleagues have been here much longer than I have. In fact, I've only been in my position for 3 years, whereas a good friend of mine has been for 7 years. What I fear the most, is being the supervisor for people that have more experience than me, when I know very well that they are problematic employees. I can already feel them staring daggers at me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy personal opinion on this one is that she should not care what other people think, and should instead show them that she can be an excellent, reasonable, understanding and accommodating team leader. That way she will earn they're respect in a professional way, and maybe even teach them a thing or two along the way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So today is my gfs birthday and I didn't go to school so I could be with her the whole day. None of us really celebrate birthdays so I had nothing crazy planned and asked her for the last month what she would like to do, to which she never replied.\n\nTuesday I had woken up at 5pm after gaming a whole night so of course leading up to today I didn't sleep. And I told her from the beginning that if there was anything she wanted to do today, making me lay down with her all day like she normally does is going to make me go to sleep. So after about 2 hours of eating and talking she basically forced me to sleep, like she put covers over me and told me to go to sleep as we laid down.\n\nSo then I wake up around like 7 and her family is in the kitchen. They mainly speak Spanish so theres not really much conversation to be had. So I come out and made a joke to her brother about him calling me a day ago which he ignored so i just went to the living room and started playing the game to pass time. Her brothers are just lazing around and they don't really talk much so it's just her and her mom speaking.\n\nShe brings cake in the living to me and I asked \"are we not going to sing happy birthday?\" To which she replied \" I guess you wouldn't know\"and then walked away. I could hear them perfectly fine, no one sang happy birthday.\n\nAfter they leave, I wanted to do one last game and asked her if she wanted to watch a movie to which she replies \"you haven't paid attention to me the whole day, you just keep playing the game\"\n\nI'm pretty defensive when it comes to accusatory statements like that so it immediately put me in a bad mood. I just turned off the game and now I'm about to take a shower.\n\nTLDR: Gf birthday today which I stayed home from school for. Hadn't slept the whole night due to waking up late the day prior. Told gf that if she makes me lay down in the bed with her and do nothing, I'm going to fall asleep. After an hour or 2 she basically tells me to go to sleep with her. Wake in the evening to her nonconversive family in the kitchen so I play games to pass time. After they leave she says I haven't paid attention to her the whole day",

      "description": "Hi, so first of all this is my first-ever Reddit post. Hope I'm doing this right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was \"homeschooled.\" My older siblings got much more attention than I did because they're 7+ years older than me and grouped together, my parents were younger and more patient.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was never taught how to do more than very basic division and to this day am very bad at multiplication. Now, I do think I may be ADD or some other type of attention disorder because I can't find myself able to focus on anything for long, including things I enjoy. I tried a pre-algebra class between college and \"highschool\" but found myself staying up until 2 am nearly every night, often in tears because I was tired or frustrated. My dad tried to help me a few times but would yell in frustration when I couldn't wrap my head around something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also had to teach myself to spell and was never properly taught handwriting. My mother would get frustrated with me being distracted or unwilling and gave up after just a few times as I remember it. I learned to spell because I wrote creatively online around age 11 and still do to this day, a decade later, and to this day my handwriting looks very childish and squashed, though I'm trying to fix that. Most of the time I was taught with those comprehensive curriculum books you see at Sam's Club.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did try to fill in the gaps of my education a few times, but got frustrated or bored and ended up quitting. My parents really gave up on my education when I was about eight years old after many, many threats of sending me to public school and telling me I'd be a failure in life if I didn't learn. These days if I bring up my failed elementary education my parents simply tell me, \"you were too stubborn.\" Now could I have done more? Yeah. At the same time I feel like it would have been a pretty big thing for someone with only basic math under her belt to somehow learn the basics of algebra without any real life human to help. I'm doing pretty ok right now in my college algebra class but I think that's because I'm too tired to be anxious and my teacher is great. I'm good in other classes though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow on my parent's side, we're religious folks. I've got no qualms with my religion at all, but it was part of why they started homeschooling us, and also because I guess my oldest sister had a bad experience with public school when she was little? It's been years since I've heard the reasoning, but my mom likes to boast about how smart homeschooled kids are. All of my older siblings got into an incredibly exclusive college and I did too (but got kicked out over failing math), though I suspect it was based off their success and not my own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: parents decide to homeschool bc of religion and control over material, teach siblings but get tired by the time they need to teach me but never put me in school, and I struggle academically now bc of it.",

      "description": "So this happened a few years ago when I was 17 (I’m 20 now but this has always bothered me and I’m curious what other people think). \n\nSo me and my little brother who is 4 years younger than me, were horsing around and wrestling in the living room and I went to throw him onto the couch . I wasn’t paying attention and my sister was sitting on the couch and he went flying into her knee face first and busted his lip and it bled pretty bad. My brother is a lot smaller than me I probably have at least 60-70 pounds on him but I really wasn’t trying to hurt him, to me it was an honest mistake. His lip was busted pretty bad it swelled and was bleeding a lot but we got him some ice and it didn’t seem like it was serious or anything. After a little bit the bleeding stopped and he seemed fine except for a fat lip. It was late at night when it happened and my parents didn’t wake up so I didn’t think it was a huge deal and went to sleep. The next morning my dad found out and was furious he yelled at me and called me a coward and a bully because he is so much smaller than me and I needed to be more careful. He said in his big brother and need to watch out for him and not be the one hurting him. I really wasn’t trying to hurt him but I don’t think my dads ever really let it go and I think the rest of my family is mostly pissed at me because of him constantly telling them what a coward/bully i am rather than seeing it from my point of view. My brother wasn’t really even that mad at first until until my dad got involved now he thinks I was being a bully as well and didn’t just make a mistake. Anyways I was just curious if everyone else think I’m the asshole in this situation or not. ",

      "description": "I’ve been with my girlfriend now for a little bit over a year and about 2 months ago she moved in with me. Before I met her I was in my best shape, going to the gym about 6 times a week and eating healthy. Since meeting her my gym time began to dwindle and my eating habits got worse. A part of it was spending more time with her and less at the gym, and she doesn’t have the best eating habits so I felt it was ok to loosen up my own eating habits. \n\nWhen we first began dating I explained to her that my next goal in my profession was to obtain a license. The licensing process for my profession is incredibly difficult and can often take up to 3 years to complete with study time and all. I took 2 of the exams before meeting her, but failed, and it discouraged me which is why I began getting really into fitness. Throughout our relationship she always encouraged me to study and begin taking the exams again. It was hard to find the motivation to study because I already work 45 hours a week and studying for another 2 hours every day for the exams was the last thing I wanted to do. Once she moved in and I realized our relationship is progressing, I felt now is the time to study again as I want to pass these exams before we start a family. \n\nFor the last month I’ve been studying every day for about 1-2 hours a day. At the same time my responsibilities at my job grew and they have requested I put in a little extra time. On any given weekday I’m spending about 10-12 hours within my profession, this includes my actual job and studying for the exams (which she’s encouraged me to do). I am also trying to find a schedule that will let me get back into the gym because I am not happy with my body. \n\nMy gf has been unemployed since moving in 2 months ago and has just now began the process of job searching. So most of the day she stays inside cooking or cleaning. Last night I came home after a 12 hour day of work and studying and I mentioned how studying after work is better for me so I am going to try to incorporate the gym into my schedule before work. She got upset and said that I don’t spend time with her anymore and that all this studying, work, and now possibly gym is taking up my time and I’m not scheduling time for her.\n\nI had a feeling this would happen eventually once she realized how incredibly time consuming it is to study for these exams. I explained that to block out time for her we should dedicate a day in the week for a date night. We also spend the last couple hours of the day watching her tv shows together. I have no interest in her tv shows so I sit with her in the living room so that we are at least together. \n\nI told her this is how it’s going to be for a little while as I want to pass these exams and find time to get back into my hobbies, such as fitness, because it helps keep me happy. Am I the asshole for wanting to spend all this time to work on myself?  ",

I just let it be known that I'm not interested in their stuff.\n\nI began to realize a couple of years ago that I was not assertive at all and that I've literally never needed any of the shit that these people try to give me. I will usually just smile and say no thanks and walk away. Here's some examples.\n\n-Telemarketer calls for survey or to sell something. I usually just hang up\n\n-Pabhandler outside store asks for change. I usually just say don't have cash or no and continue walking\n\n-Guy tries to give me religious flyer for his Church and I say no thanks. He insists and I tell him that I'm not going to his church\n\n-Charity people on the street asking for donations. I say no and walk away\n\nMost people do this and it may seem normal but I usually say it with a straight face and very sternly. I usually feel bad about this and feel like I should help out with panhandlers sometimes. On the other hand, there's lots of scanners out there and I just don't want to give money to frauds or bad charities.

Just delaying the inevitable. Most people with leukemia die after 5 years. Mine is even worse.\n\nI feel sick everyday. I used to lift regularly and now all my muscles are basically gone with excess grandma skin on my arms and legs.\n\nI lost so much hair at the top of my head i just started shaving it off.\n\nI cant have sex with my wife anymore, when i try i cant maintain erections. I have pissed myself multiple times over the years in my sleep. I cant eat steaks anymore because of my stomach.\n\nI cant play with my daughters and everytime i go to one of their soccer matches i get weird looks and take all the attention off of them.\n\nI just dont have any fight left anymore. I repeat to myself everyday, \"its over, and thats ok\".\n\nThe truth is i haven't accomplished much in my life. I wanted to be a writer when i was younger but i ended up as an office manager at a car dealership. I always said i would do it later but then the years sort of piled on. I had one life and i wasted it, but so do most people i guess.\n\nI am proud of my wife and daughters. They make me very happy. They haven't accepted that its over yet but i have. My wife means well but she wants me to stay in treatment long enough to put it back into remission again. I dont see it. I just think we need to come to terms with this.\n\nI do not just want to lay in bed all day. I want to travel for these years i have left. See the country. Maybe go to italy or japan or the uk. I want to experience this planet in ways i never thought about before.\n\nI told my wife this and she says im being selfish and im giving up. I dont see it that way, i feel more alive now than ive felt in a long time.

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay to repair my wife’s car that her dad owns?",
      "description": "So about a month ago, my father in law got into a car accident. He bought her the car about 3 years ago for $4000, a 2010 Scion XB. Since he owns my wife’s car (we live with my family) my wife gave the car to him willingly so he could get to work and we could just use my car (that my mom owns). It was only until he could get a new car and we were okay accommodating him.\n\nAnyhow, about three weeks ago on the day that he was supposed to give us the car back he calls my wife and tells her that the car isn’t running anymore. It doesn’t go in Drive but it goes in Reverse but he was in the middle of the road and we needed to get him. So we drove down and get him, my wife takes him to work and I wait for the tow truck. We take it to the shop and an axle was broken and overall we came out paying $650 for the tow and repairs. Because we drive the car and Chicago is full of potholes, my wife and I paid it. I was reluctant but I wasn’t going to not pay for it.\n\nA few days ago, my wife tells me that the check engine light came on so we took it to a shop and they’re telling us that the transmission is shot and to replace it. $1500 to have it done by Saturday.\n\nSo my wife and I had a back and forth this morning about how to and if we’re paying for the car. I don’t think it’s wise to have spent over half the value of the car in order to fix it, and I don’t want to pay for repairs for a car we don’t own. Repairs are basically an investment and $2000 to fix something whose value isn’t ours I don’t agree with. I told her I don’t want to pay more than 50% of the cars value in repairs since the car was already on its last legs. This is my wife’s “first” cars  that’s hers so I understand the sentimentality behind it. She needs the car because her commute is 45 minutes while mine is 10 minutes. I could absolutely take the bus or ride my bike to work when the weather clears up. But she 100% needs the car, but we can’t exactly afford a new car right now. My wife and I are about to both get promoted but we’re not sure when.\n\nThe thing is I’m kind of being held at a double standard. My car is from the same year, same mileage, and also had transmission problems last year but because my mom gave me the car after 130,000 miles my mom paid for the new transmission since I couldn’t at the time (I was going through cancer treatments at the time and needed to pay for that). My wife pointed out that my car has the same problems as her car so we should fix her car, but at least we own my car since my mom gave me ownership of it after the transmission.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting to pay for further repairs?\n\n",

Apparently, they say it’s going to be oh so great with good music (which I don’t mind) and smoking while driving, as if driving is an ideal occasion. Now, the last part I do mind - the second hand smoke makes me feel physically sick and I can feel the smoke’s visit to my lungs the following day - same goes for the other non-smokers. \n\nWhen we ask them if they could do it while we stop to stretch our legs outside, they ask why, tell us non-smokers “it won’t be that bad” (yes it will, with 4 people smoking, you won’t be able to see through the damn windshield), and we should just deal with it since the majority wants to smoke. \n\nI personally find it discourteous AF and unfair. They just won’t budge. \n\nAITA for not wanting to deal with some second-hand smoke? Thanks. ",

      "description": "Background info:\n\nI workout 6-7 days a week. I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**",

      "description": "So my gf and I will be together for 6 months on the 4th of Mars. We are in the same class in college (We are French, so it probably doesn't work like in the other countries; sorry for my english too), and we only dated for a week before becoming a couple. She's extremely cute and funny, and I really think that I love her.   \nBut we don't live together and for the moment, we can't, as we are living in student appartments (cheap, 9m² rooms), not in the same zone (she lives like 5 minutes from me though).   \nAnd she always want me to go spend the evening with her and sleep at her place, which was okay, until i started going to the gym. You see, i'm a little overweight and while I easily joke about it with friends, my belly is kind of my sensitive spot. I'm going to the gym with the two other guys of our group of friend, and we're often going in the morning because one of my friend works on the afternoon. And every single time I sleep at my GF's place, she asks me \"You're sure you wanna go ?\" which pisses me off, as she doesn't seem to understand that i'm doing this for my health, not to escape from her.  \nShe also complained that I visited her less often that before, which is true. But everytime i go to her place, we sit in her bed watching movies, laugh a little and barely have any sex, and we're starting to argue more and more about crap. And the problem is that we're seeing eachother every single day of college, every single class. And she alwas has to sit next to me (I don't care, I mean, I still love her weither she's next to me or 10 row away).   \nSo sometimes, I just want to spend time alone or with friends over discord, playing, drawing or writing stuff, instead of doing virtually nothing at her place.   \nSo, am I the asshole for not wanting to spend all of my free time with her ?",

      "description": "A little background: I'm 33, my kids mother is 35, my son is 3 and he'll be 4 in July.  We barely even knew each other when she got pregnant.  She was a hook up.  It was irresponsible and I regret it but I love my son.  \n\nI've been pretty distant off and on since his birth because we can't manage to get along.  Lately I've made a huge attempt to get my life straight and the result is I get to stay at her apartment on my days off just to spend time with him.  I do work around her house and we watch movies together.  Things are actually going really well.  \n\nFor the last three months I've been keeping my mouth shut so as to not start fights.  Last year she decided to punish me by skipping every holiday.  Around Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, she refused to pick up her phone.  Starting in January I pretended it didn't happen and we \"started over\".  \n\nSo here's the problem: all he ever wants to do is watch YouTube.  And she let's him.  It is literally his babysitter.  I waited a long time to do anything about it but it has just gotten worse.  I wanted to avoid the argument.  I want to see him on his birthday.  But I have finally had enough.  He woke up from a nap the other day and immediately picked up her phone.  I said it was enough and took it away.  Que the screaming tantrum.  She said \"just give it to him I have a headache and I have homework\".  I put my foot down and said he needs social interaction and exercise.  She comes back with \"he gets both of those at school. He is student of the month, has the highest grades in his class, and if he wants YouTube he can have it, besides, I limit him to 3 hours a day\".  I was at a loss for words.  Three.  Fucking.  Hours.  Around this time her father walks in and wants to know why my son is freaking out and we're arguing.  I explained that I took the phone away and why and he actually agreed with me.  He even admitted that he was guilty of it, too.  I stole a glance at his mother and she was giving me the shittiest death glare I've ever seen.  Now she's punishing her father by limiting his time with my son and she's been speaking to him like he's retarded.  He and I both know why.  So now my son gets out of school at 3pm.  Watches YouTube for an hour or two, takes a nap, does it again, then goes to bed.  Once in a while he'll play with toys or ask to go to the playground.  I have started taking the phone away.  Every single time he kicks and screams and throws himself on the ground.  He's even said \"daddy isn't my friend anymore\" which I laughed about and said I love you anyway but honestly it fucking hurt.  \n\nSo now I'm back in the doghouse, the father is suffering for it, and my son doesn't even like spending time with me.  \n\nShould I just let him enjoy his cartoons?  Am I going overboard with parenting when I haven't really been in the picture?  Am I the asshole?",

We kinda lost touch during 6th and 7th grade but got back together during 8th. After Graduation, we started talking to each other everyday since October. Instagram, Snapchat, Google Hangouts, Discord and all that Jazz. I thought we were inseparable. Sure we would have our falling outs from time to time and I would do/say things that made her upset and she would do the same, we’ve had our fair share of arguments together, it’s apart of life. But recently I got back into HTTYD (How to train your dragon) because of the third movie. And me being me just had my thoughts all over it. I’m very prone to Hyper-fixation. See she doesn’t hate HTTYD, she just hates when I get overly fixated on stuff. She asked me why I was crazy over it and I explained that it’s my childhood and that I was sad that the franchise was ending and the fact that I was never going to see Hiccup and Toothless again. She told me to be a realist and that I could just re-watch the movies, I agreed with her but I also told her that I felt that I should be able to grieve in my own time. She started making fun of me for it and personally I didn’t appreciate it but I just brushed it off. Sunday, we were having a conversation about cartoons and I mentioned How to train your dragon and how I felt that she shouldn’t mock me because I felt emotional about the series and how it’s my opinion and she should respect that like I respect hers. She then promptly hung up on me and told me that this was utter trash and then started spewing personal things that had nothing to do with it and how I’m a ditz who thinks she’s better than her and how she wasn’t going to talk to me later. So I vented to our mutual friend about how I felt about the whole ordeal and he told her that I came to him (I’m not mad at him, I think he was just trying to be helpful) So she said that she was even more pissed at me and not to expect her to talk to me tonight. So I said “M’kay, see you tomorrow.” A few hours later, I’m with my dad, going to Portillo’s (A local restaurant chain in my state) So I check my insta while we’re driving and I’m met with a paragraph explaining that I stress her out and that she didn’t want to talk to me anymore and that she blocked me on every social media we had together. So I eat with my dad, he takes me home, and I start crying in my room. I’m still flip-flopping between feeling guilty and feeling betrayed. ",

They had been together for many years, so I assumed everything would be fine. A few months in, it comes out that he's been cheating on her. They break up, she installs a lock on her door and throws all his stuff out in the common area. \n\nThey both approach me about living without the other and paying for the others rent for the remainder of the lease, and I'm conflicted. On the one hand, he's my friend and has been for a while. On the other, I have a strong stance on cheating (which I've told him about before). I've been cheated on and it sucks. I could imagine it sucking even more if you're getting kicked out of your place. So I try to stay as neutral as possible. I tell them that who moves out is between them, but I'm not moving because of someone else's relationship ending.\n\nAfter sleeping on the couch for a few weeks, he finds a new place and moves out. I help him move out, still talk to him and hang out, but he feels like I've betrayed him. This was a really complicated situation, and I tried to stay neutral. But was I the asshole?",

For most people, this is about as much as they spend a month for weekends when we go out and for food etc. I limit myself to about $200 a moth, $100 goes into my savings. Before I started my service I saved up about $4K, and I’m keeping that in my savings because I have plans for after my service that I’d like to do as soon as possible, and that won’t be possible without a decent amount of money. I have had months where I went a bit over budget so that I could go out and do things, but I’ve mostly stuck to it very well. \n\nTowards the last week of every month, I’m always a little tight on budget, so I always say that I’m broke or that I’ve spent too much money this month, or that I can go out but I don’t want to drink or spend too much money. \n\nOne of my friends found out how much money I have in my savings, and apparently it’s probably more than any of my other friends, so now they all say that me saying I don’t have money to spend is me being stingy or bragging, because I have more than them. Obviously it’s my money and I get to do what I like with it, but am I wrong that I’m stopping myself so strictly?  I’d also like to add that I’m an impulsive buyer so the struct budget helps me not buy too many unnecessary things. ",

      "description": "I’ve moved into a home for the first time that is truly nice, after getting married. It has been my dream to entertain at home for a long time, we take it seriously and it is a real joy to share what we have and have a nice time with people we love.\n\nOne of my closest friends and his wife (I’ve been close with them both for over a decade, him for much longer) came to visit. They also love to entertain. They’ve had us over for dinner and to stay in their home countless times. They know what it means to host. Actually, I learned a lot of what I know about hosting from them.\n\nWhen I said “let us cook you dinner” on the phone while setting it up earlier that day, my friend said “no, let us just bring Thai.” My wife has a sensitive stomach and eating prepared food doesn’t always agree with her, so cooking at home is always the preference. I replied that we have a lot of food that fits their dietary restrictions, it would be our pleasure to make them a meal and have a nice night in our home. He said his wife would not eat anything  we prepared, that it’s a weird thing with her, we just need to order Thai.\n\nA good host respects their guests needs. So at first I agreed. I didn’t know this quirk, but ok. Thai, then.\n\nBut then I started thinking about all the dinner parties in houses these people have told me about. They eat at other people’s houses almost weekly. \n\nThey arrived, we provided appetizers with drinks, she ate them. We ordered Thai. Waited an hour and were starving. There was a mistake with Grubhub, and we would not be delivered the food. My wife threw together a quick and simple meal, which my friend ate and loved. His wife, literally stumbling drunk at this point from drinking cocktails with no food since lunch (which she ate out—she does restaurants, and other peoples’ houses), refused to eat, and became hangry and snappy at her husband, who was hurt and embarrassed. They left.\n\nAnd I’m left feeling really offended. We’re clean people. We have food for every diet. We wanted to share our one of our simplest pleasures with people who know exactly how nice it is to host your friends. What am I missing here? Am I the asshole for feeling like maybe these people aren’t really friends at all, or at least not the kind of friends you invite to your home? Help me let go of this grudge, or of them.",

      "description": "I would like to preface this post by saying, I get don’t get very angry and try not to but when I am angry I am super angry. My uncle loved cars and owned a golf kart when he was alive. He gave it to us when he died and it means a lot to my dad and me. We “tricked it out”, we really just took off the governors to make to go faster and some other visual modifications. Yesterday was the first warm day we’ve had in a while and I decided to drive it around the neighborhood. This couple  lives 4 houses down from me with 4 kids, 3 boys and 1 girl all below 10 years old but not by much. The girl is really sweet and wouldn’t hurt a fly but the boys are obnoxious and annoying. Something to keep in mind, the golf cart’s seats are leather and should never get wet. I was driving along their side of the road when the three boys come out and throw snowballs at me, they miss and I pull over to say stop and it’s not safe. I drive by their house again and they throw snowballs again. I tell them to stop a little more firmly and drive off again. I drive by once more and they throw snowballs AGAIN. At this point I’m plenty pissed and pull over to hurriedly wipe the snow off the wind shield and the seats. The parents were watching them do this and as I pull over this transaction occurs\n\nParents: you sure are brave\nMe: *visibly pissed* yeah okay\nParents proceeded to throw snowballs purposely hit me and the seats. I can forgive the kids because kids are kids and their attitude depends on how they were raised. But the parents should have acted like adults, apologized for their kids and not thrown snowballs. I drive off, flipping them the bird and drive home. So, am I the asshole?",

I understand that life comes first, look I get that. But skipping the sessions to play fortnite?( I have hard evidence of that)... and when he does show up he does not roleplay, and just tried to screw my story, maybe unintentionally but still. This problem has been going on for 2 months now and I have discussed this with him. He told me would comeback when we finished this story arc. Guess what. He skipped the session aswell. And, as you can imagine, it gets kinda bothersome for me having to make up excuses for him going in and out of sessions, story wise. I have discussed this with the players, they sort of agree with me, but don't want to take decisive steps.

      "description": "Background info: I work at McDonald’s and at our McDonald’s we give out courtesy water cups. Obviously you can’t put soda in these water cups and we can take the cups away for stealing said soda. However, I’ve never enforced the rule before because frankly I don’t care that much and the cups are so small that you’re hardly stealing anything.\n\nYesterday, on the other hand, I was in a particularly bad mood and was taking orders on front counter when some old-ish lady came up and made a really big order, was super slow (holding up the line,) and was pretty rude. She also asked for a water cup and I gave it to her but when she came back I noticed that it was bright green “water.” I was pissed off this time, I took a minute to decide if I really wanted to do this and I decided I really wanted to.\n\nI walked over to her and said the cups are only for water and she was resistant at first. “I accidentally put a bit of lime in my water,” she responded with (which was a bold-faced lie.) “Ok... you’re still not supposed to do that.” I said, trying to be polite. She didn’t respond and I took the cup and dumped it out. \n\nLater, she came back for a water cup while someone else was working front counter but fortunately I noticed her. I said, “I’m sorry, but you cannot have a water cup.” “Why not?” “You lost the privilege to have a water cup. Thank you, bye.” That was the end of it. \n\n\nHonestly, I felt great but I was thinking today, was I actually the one being the asshole?",

      "description": " \n\n## Sought counsel against a professor am I the asshole?\n\n📷\n\nI'm a graduate student in computer science in United States.\n\nMy institution has a professor who is known for being less than cordial when dealing with students.\n\nLet me put this into perspective.\n\nAt my institution, it is required that a professor offer at least 4 hours a week to answer questions and to offer assistance when needed. One on one time, professor to student.\n\nHe complies with this yes, but states that he will only offer a 15 min maximum for helping students, even if there is no queue outside of his office. Not breaking the rules, but not helping either.\n\nIf you somehow find yourself in these to the fifteen minutes, or happen to take one of the classes that only he teaches for the entire department, his personality makes him *literally* unapproachable.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n1. During office hours, a student from my class asked him several questions regarding an assignment. He belittled her for not understanding a concept then sent out without a proper explanation. She left in tears.\n2. During presentations, he will go out of his was to humiliate you in front of your peers and dismiss any counter- arguments you may have against his claim without given reason.\n\nIn conjunction with this, he puts students at jeopardy with his grading:\n\n1. The content of the assignment noted previously was used as a basis for a prototype that we had to present in class. It was assigned early into the semester and still has yet to been graded, meaning that feedback for a prototype that took weeks to produce is nonexistent (Double Jeopardy for that grade).\n2. This assignment was also the basis for advanced documentation that too has yet to be graded (Triple jeopardy for that grade due to not being able to make corrections).\n\nThis is something that I could not take lightly. I am a good student (above a 3.6 GPA) and anything that will put my scholarship in jeopardy has me seething.\n\nSo I snapped, I met with several of my professors and told them my case. I used them as a sounding board to see if my frustration held any clout and if they were in agreement with my finds (Several of my classmates also joined me to voice their claim).\n\nAn email was sent to the dean of my department by both my professors so that I could remain anonymous.\n\nI feel like I may have cost him his job and I am remorseful.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Throwaway account for this one :)\n\nOkay so a bit of context here. I was at my friend's (let's call him Friend 1) house last week for 3 days and we were both working these 3 days (he works in a grocery store and I work online so I can take my work with me when I travel). He lives 4 hours away by car which is considered a very long journey in my culture but I visit him every other week and the odd time he will come see me. One of our mutual friends (let's call him Friend 2) was also there as he also had work in this particular area.\n\nOne of the nights, me and Friend 2 decide to travel into the city to visit another friend (he's not involved but you can call him friend 3 if you like :)) as Friend 2 and I had both finished work early. Friend 1 was still in work but I invited him to come with us despite this. The city is an hour away so it's not impossible for Friend 1 to get the bus if he wanted to join. (Perhaps this is an ass hole thing to do?)\nI told him we would be in the city for 6pm and he finished work at 6.30pm. He told me not to worry about it and we should just go on ahead. So I thought no problem and we did that. When we arrived in the city it was 6pm and I got call from his dad (Friend 1) asking if I could pick him up at 6.30. I told him I wouldn't be there in time to get him, as it was an hour drive and that I wanted to stay to see Friend 3 but I could make the drive back if he needed the lift. But his dad said it wasn't a problem.\n\nMoving on, we had a great time in the city and then arrived back at Friend 1's house at 12.30am. So not super late but I can understand that we were late back. I should point out at this point that neither Friend 1s Mum or Dad work, they are a little old but by no means elderly. And Friend 1 did have work at 10.30am so he would still be getting a very decent sleep but again I can understand that this may have been an ass hole thing to do on my part.\n\nAnyway, me and Friend 2 get some food and try to be as quiet as we can (which in fairness was probably still pretty loud) and head to bed. Me and Friend 2 are in the same room while Friend 1 slept in the couch, which was nice of him. But friend 2 snores an awful lot but that's beside the point :) We decided to watch some Spongebob.\nAbout 30 seconds in, Friend 1 storms into the room, jumps on the bed and turns off the projector and PlayStation (which we were using to watch Spongebob) then jumps off the bed and tells us to \"Never use his shit again without his permission\". We were a little shaken up by this but thought \"fair enough, he's tired, let's keep the noise down.\"\nAt this point, I wanted to stuff it and just drive home. Either way we decided to tidy the room a little and began to pack our belongings.\nFriend 1 bursts in again and says \"I'm up at 9.30 tomorrow... I want you both gone before I leave.\" then leaves the room.\nAt this point I'm thinking \"Screw this, we're leaving.\"\n\nWe're both half way out the door then friend 1 stops us and apologises. There's a lot of emotions flying around the room but I still want to leave. Friend 2 wanted to stay and he convinced me that maybe we should stay for the sake of Friend 1. So we stayed.\n\nNow make of that what you will but, I do think it was an overreaction and he did apologise. We've been good friends for a number of years and it was very unexpected. But I am struggling to trust him again and I'm not sure if I ever will.\nI have tried texting him a couple of times but he has left me on read and hasn't replied to any of my messages.\n\nIn friends 1 defence, he said he felt he was being used by us for staying over and stuff. Which I can understand but it was all because of our trip to the city which I had told him about a week before we even arrived.\nIt's difficult for me because I have consistently made the journey to visit him when he needed help with one thing or another and not it is apparent that that isn't going to be reciprocated or even acknowledged perhaps.\n\nSo am I the ass hole for feeling a little betrayed and even a little used myself and wanting to distance myself a little for a while? Or our my actions completely unreasonable?\n\nThanks guys :) ",

      "description": "AITA?\n\nI'm on a college sports team.\n\nA few months ago, I came out as gay when we were playing Truth or Dare. Everyone seemed pretty ok about it at first and reacted positively because I'm fairly reserved and don't share much about my personal life, so they were happy that I was opening up to them. On the same night, one of my teammates, let's call her Annie, came out as bi. She exclusively talks about her attraction to men when she's around other people on the team but does stuff like take selfies licking straight team members and pantomime kissing them.\n\nAfter I came out, things were weird between me and Annie. She will greet half the team with a hug but when I offered her a hug, she refused and said \"I'm not a hugger.\" She once asked if anyone wanted to do partner stretching and when I offered, she said that she felt \"uncomfortable.\" When she would go to hand me something, she would drop it before I could get hold of it and then apologize too much. I tried to ignore this because it was small enough that I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOn the bus ride back from a competition, Annie was \"educating\" another teammate about what it was like to be bi. I heard her saying \"When a straight guy and a straight girl make out, that has to mean something, but when a lesbian makes out with a straight girl or two bi girls make out, that doesn't have to mean anything. They can just be friends.\" and then \"Lesbians don't have types.\"  I approached her and said, \"Hey, I think you might have some misconceptions.\" and she accused me of eavesdropping on her and she said that she could never say anything offensive because she was bi.\n\nThe next day, I texted her and asked if we could talk. I wanted to explain why I was hurt by what she said. She kept pushing the meeting later and later, then said \"this situation is making me very anxious\" and reported me to the captain. We met with the captain and Annie refused to apologize. She blamed me for \"being too insecure\" and said that she was angry with how I handled the situation. She said that I was taking things completely out of context and that she was offended that I would say that she had said something offensive. She refused to talk to me or practice with me for a week. (I've been having to train with the men's team because of this). Then, when we did practice together, she accused me of trying to hurt her (it's a contact sport). She is now back to refusing to talk to me.\n\nOne of my other teammates has also heard Annie saying things about how relationships between women don't count. This other teammate reported these comments to the captain, who said she would do something after the championships.  The championships are over, but our captain hasn't done anything and Annie is still acting like I don't exist. Who's in the wrong here?",

      "description": "So i'm a senior CS major who is on track to graduate this spring. One of the classes I took this year was an advanced computer operating systems class that required us to build a OS for our final project. The class has been a good experience and while it was extremely tough, I enjoyed it. This is where Karen comes in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met Karen a year ago in a computer architecture class and I've disliked her since. She is lazy and barely passes every class she takes. I took a class with her last summer and from what her lab partners said about her, she did nothing on their projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when our final projects were coming the teacher decided to have us work in pairs on our OS's and present them together. I was unfortunately assigned Karen as my partner. I asked the teacher if I could work alone but she insisted I try and make it work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I expected, Karen did nothing. For the past month I have worked my ass off while she has blown me off countless times and refused to do anything. Towards the due date I decided to remove all the code I did from the shared drive and she freaked out. She sent me harassing texts and calls. She also left a very threatening voice mail saying she would report me to the teacher and claim she did all the work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, the day after I went to the teacher and showed her all the work I had done and the texts/voicemail. I gave her copies of all of them and she told me I could remove her name from the project and present it myself. Well, last week Karen learned she would be receiving a 0 on the project and failing the class. Since then she has been trash talking me to everyone claiming I \"cheated her.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlong with that, today I was informed that my teacher went to the administration with the texts and voicemail. Along with this, another student has reported her for degrading posts on social media. I was called in today to talk to the head of the department. I told him I didn't want her to get in trouble but apparently she is going to get kicked out now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite what I think about her I feel really bad. I pretty much ruined her life now. I really don\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nt think she should be kicked out of school for this stupid this. Am I wrong though? Did I do the right thing going to the teacher? Is there anything I can do to maybe stop her from getting kicked out if I am wrong?",

It's not a genre I'd normally pick up and it's long (which is great for a book that interests me, but isn't appealing in this case) and the first in a series and I just don't really want to read it...\n\nI can tell my friend is kind of hoping for feedback (hasn't asked outright) but would really probably like it.. Though my friend has gotten plenty of great feedback from family and other friends etc already, so it's not like I'm the only person and they're waiting for my insight. \n\nI feel bad about this and like I am being lame for not just sucking it up and reading it.. But I mean, we're all busy and I have so many books I actually have chosen to read already.",

      "description": "Small backstory, I'm in high school, and my school has about a 5-7:1 driving students to parking spot ratio, so when you see a parking spot, you take it. I do drive, and my car is an SUV of sorts and larger than most other cars at my school.\n\nThis morning when I got to school, I went to see if there were any parking spots available, and I did manage to find one. On one side there is someone parked perfectly fine, and on the other there is somebody who decided it would be a good idea to park at an angle and take up about a quarter of the parking space I was about to try and get into. I tried to back in, so I could make sure I could still get out, and I got my trunk about an inch away from the angled car. My car ended up being on the line on the other side; the only part that sticks out from the parking spot is my mirror, but my tires are covering about half of the line. The car that's parked fine has only the driver in it, no passengers. I also have not parked on the line before, and have never seen either driver or car before.\n\nWhen I got back to my car at the end of the day both cars were gone and there was a note on my windshield that reads, \"Park inside the lines next time asshole!!!!\" (Yes, they did put four exclamation points)\n\nSo am I the asshole for parking on the line when that was the best anyone could do?",

      "description": "    Here is some well needed background infomation; me and my boyfriend at the time have been dating for 2 years near the end of our relationship i felt like we stopped texting alot and when i brought the issue up with him he would always brush it off, it came to a point where i sent him a playlist of chill beats with titles such as We dont talk anymore, lost in touch, ect. And other song titles like that.  A part of the reason we brokw up is because we barley talked anymore(we go to the same school). We both agreed we would be friends thought.\n\n      Since september of last year till a few days ago i have been ignoring my ex boyfriend because he doesnt text me, he said that everything was cool between us but to me there wasnt. I would tell him and he would say everything is fine, i would talk to him in the halls but he would ignore me and i would shoot him a text and he would just see it and not replay for hours later but i would see he had been online at or a few momments before. It hurt me because he knew a part of the reason we broke up was because of communication and than he would say everything is fine.\n  Anyway i would get ignored so i decided to give him a tast of his own medition by ignoring him at school and not texting him, i do this for a while and my friend told me that my ex was confused why i was ignoring him. Me and my ex talked about it and agreed everything was fine but the same thing would happen, i would get ignored so i would ignore back.\n     Anyway FF to a week ago, everything is a bit better now. I was eating lunch with my ex and our friend and my friend ask if i seen his art recently and i havnt (we are all artist and showing each other our art is a normal thing to do so i was hurt i didnt see any of his) and than he says to my friend \"oh hey wanna go to my house later\" and im in tears because 1) he knows i want to text him and he doesnt text me 2) im kinda sad we arent close anymore. My friend ask if im okay cause tears are kinda running down my eyes and my ex does nothing. \n     Ff yesterday i stopped ignoring my ex because i wanna be his friend and act like eveything is okay because i want to be friends again, am i an asshole for what i did?\n( also sorry i have bad punctuation and grammer/spelling)",

      "description": "I spent a week about four hours away from our home city with a friend. We’ll call her Sara. We took her car and she drove. We spent an amazing week together.\n\nBut the last two nights she forced me to go to clubs while I was tired and all I wanted to do was going back to the hotel to sleep. Since we only had one key and she was being so insistant, i finally agreed to go with her. But because of it we only slept about 2-3 hours each night for the last two nights, which resulted in me being really tired especially the last day (I’ll add that she is used to not sleeping a lot when I always sleep at least 8 hours). As it was the last day of our holiday we had to go away from our hotel and go home.\n\nBut when we got to the car, Sara gave me her car keys and said “You drive this time because I have a cold”. I told her that I didn’t want to drive because I didn’t sleep enough and I was really tired and didn’t want to put ourselves in danger. She started to yell at me that I was being really selfish and didn’t make any effort to understand her, that I was lying and just being lazy.\n\nI answered that I would never lie to her because she is my friend and I was afraid to fall asleep while driving and didn’t want to put us (and the other cars) in danger. I offered two options: we stay in the car, sleep 2-3 hours, have a coffee and then I’ll drive home or she starts driving for 2 hours while I sleep then she stops and I drive the last two hours. But she was still mad and yelled at me to get in the car and that she was driving home but it was the last time we would see each other.\n\nSince she had decided to finally drive and I was so tired, I fell asleep during about one and a half hours. When I woke up I offered to stop so I could take her place and drive until we got home but she didn’t ever answer. When we arrived in our city she dropped me at my house and I said goodbye but she didn’t answer. It’s been two weeks and we have indeed not seen each other since.\n\nI feel like she was really unfair towards me when all I was thinking about was our safety. But do you think that I was the asshole for refusing to drive and that Sara is right to be mad at me and say that I have been selfish?\n\nPs: This is obviously a throwaway account",

      "description": "So last night my roomie called me out onto the deck. A 45ish year old man we’ve never seen before ( very small complex and we’ve lived here for five years) was standing in a very dark part of the bushes adjacent to our apartment and wasn’t moving for 30 minutes. It was sketchy and our west Austin complex is usually pretty docile and quiet. Christine is a tough, not easily rattled NY girl and when her hackles were raised and she asked me to call 311 for a courtesy drive by, I did it immediately. \nHe went to his van,  then ran into another building. It was the same van I saw a dog sleeping in around 3 that afternoon. The dog was still there.\nLong story short- the Windows were covered with cardboard and the van was a wreck-  broken down, smelled like decay, ect. The cops came and checked it out and when looking into the cracked windows, they all immediately started dancing around wiping their bodies and shaking out their pants. At least 40 roaches were on them and many more little ones were flooding out of the car. They said they couldn’t do anything because the plates were from out of state. \n    I was just out of my deck when homeboy came and put in a new battery. The van started and a few minutes later he came back with his woman person and they loaded up their stuff. They very quickly pulled up to the other building and loaded up three super small (5-6 being the oldest) dirty crying little girls. \n    Did I just unwittingly cause these little girls to go back to living in their van?!? I’m absolutely heart broken right now..I’m at a complete and utter loss. \n\nDid I screw up a warm, safe and clean place for these children to stay?? The officers literally wouldn’t investigate ",

      "description": "Hello, first time poster here. Been in a relationship for about 3 years now (both mid 20s). In the past, my partner and I were long distance and would sext via Skype/messenger/etc. At that time I was not as comfortable with it as my partner was, but it was what I wanted to do at that time due to missing that connection with them. Now we live in the same area, and sending/receiving naked photos isn't something I'm comfortable with anymore and something I don't feel is necessary to maintain our intimate relationship.\n\n However, there have been a few times while getting dressed or changing clothes or coming out of the shower, my partner has taken photos of me on their phone and told me they were doing so. Each time it happens, I try to tell them I am not comfortable with that, but they say it is just doing it because they find me attractive and want to have pictures of me to look at. Because I don't want to start a fight, I usually drop it because they convince me I am overreacting and it is not a big deal. But every time, after the fact it continues to make me really uncomfortable knowing that they have those pictures of me. Not because I think they would send them to another person, but just knowing that they are out there like backed up to the cloud - I don't like it. It causes me a good deal of anxiety to think about. \n\nAnd every time I ask them to delete the photos, they don't want to. Their reasons are: the photos aren't full nudes so I shouldn't be so worried, I am decreasing the intimacy of the relationship by not allowing this, and that I should find it flattering that they want to keep pictures of me. They also told me tonight that they think it is a body image issue of mine that I need to get over, which isn't the case at all. I have no problem with how I look in the photos, I have a problem with the fact that I don't have control over who gets to see me like that. Very easily could someone stumble upon them while looking at my partners gallery, and I am not comfortable with friends or family seeing me practically naked.\n\nI feel that even though we might disagree, they are my partner and I would want them to understand and delete them if it would make me more comfortable - I would do that for them in a heartbeat. But every time we talk, they refuse to do it and instead say that I am overreacting. Is it fair of me to ask them to delete these photos (because I was never comfortable with them in the first place and expressed it while they were being taken)?\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "description": "I am on mobile and this is my first post on this sub, sorry for any mistakes.\n\nMy girlfriend and I FaceTime quite often throughout the week when we can’t see each other. During these calls we play games, watch movies, and talk about our day. About a month ago my girlfriend stopped talking to her best friend, since then she’s been very lonely socially. I noticed that she was feeling down and introduced her to one of my online friends. They hit it off and they’re decent talking buddies, I don’t mind or feel threatened, I’m confident that she wouldn’t leave me for him. However recently since talking to this mutual friend of ours, he will text her while we face time and my girlfriend will pause the call to respond. I wouldn’t mind if she only did this during breaks in our conversation, but sometimes she’ll stop mid-sentence when she sees the notification and text him back. I told her that this makes me unhappy and she said that she somewhat understood, but thought it would be okay since she told me what he was saying and tried to involve me in the conversation (I never drilled her for information about her convos) . She would bring up what they talked about after texting back and sometimes he’ll say something funny and we’ll both laugh about it, but I don’t want to FaceTime HER to know what THEY are talking about. Since I initially told her how I felt (about two weeks ago) she said she would stop texting during our calls, however last night she began doing it again and It has kinda made me mad that she promised to stop and hasn’t. I’m not sure if I’m being a controlling asshole by wanting her to stop socializing during our calls. I should also add that our FaceTime calls do not take up all of her free time.\n\nTLDR; Am I the asshole for wanting my girlfriend to stop texting people during our FaceTime calls, regardless of whether she tells me about the conversations?\n",

      "description": "So, a bit of background, I guess:\n\nI'm on the autistic spectrum. I've faced years of bullying at school because I was being myself, and I had a very confusing and anger-filled time growing up. It really wasn't easy. I'm now a depressed, anxious, insecure adult because of it. A lot of the stuff I faced was due to being autistic, and how I was treated by others.\n\nI get annoyed every time I see those videos on social media where a kid with some kind of disability gets asked to prom, and then a post is shared around about it, and people see the non-disabled person as 'an inspiration'. In the UK, there's a show named The Undateables, and it's based around people with various disabilities finding love. That's fine, right up until they named it that. We're disabled, and we're seen as 'undateable' by the general public, and when we do get into relationships (Which is a normal thing), it's suddenly 'aww how sweet'. It's not seen the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy point is that I feel these acts are based totally around pity and condescension. The girl in a wheelchair with cerebral palsy, or the guy with down syndrome, or the autistic classmate, they're lied to and used by the other kids for 'kind points' on social media. I've spoke up about this a few times in the past, and I've been called heartless, hateful, and cynical because I disagreed. Damn it, they deserve to be invited to all the things, just like everybody else. It didn't NEED a media circus!  \n\n\nAnother example is when someone films them self giving food or money to homeless people. I find it incredibly telling how there's a camera rolling right before the act. They frankly don't give a shit about the homeless guy, they're just trying to portray themselves as kind and benevolent, when they're clearly just trying to get likes.  \n\nI'm really sad and angry that this is happening.\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Last summer I decided to take my girlfriend to the outdoor school that I attended for a year, when we got there the official parking booth was closed and the gates were raised but there were these 2 old ladies standing there.\n\nI stopped my car for the first lady and rolled down my window and she asked if I was here to do a summer camp (daytime only), I said no and explained what I was doing. The first lady told me I would have to pay $5 to park there, now I'm not sure if she actually had the authority to charge me parking but I decided it wasn't worth it, I politely said no thank you and informed her that I was pulling through just to turn around. I was driving my girlfriend's little econobox at the time and you can hit 3k rpm and the thing barley moves.\n\nThe second old lady was standing further in the lot but out of ear shot of the first lady and I, when I went to drive in I was admittedly a little heavy on the pedal but all I managed to do was make the car loud (still goes nowhere) and kick up a couple pieces of gravel before I released the gas to do my turn. I never went over 15kph. Almost instantly the second lady yells at me to slow down, i was close enough that there was no reason to yell and I definitely was going slow enough that there was no reason. I guess not getting to show my SO the very nice place and the lady yelling at me upset me and I grabbed the E brake and did a 180 (more like 145 due to the speed haha). The lady then yelled at me asking if I was an idiot so I just yelled back \"No\". Then she yelled something else as she turn around so I couldn't hear her. I yelled out \"what??\" And she didn't reply so I yelled out again \"I couldn't hear ya, speak up Hun\" in a pretty condescending tone. Then I drove away pretty fast at first but not fast enough to kick up much gravel.\n\nThis was an all gravel lot, the ladies were at least 60 years old each and it's on a provincial park. There were no kids around the area and I had good visibility. I love driving and drifting (my car is much better suited for it) and I had the car under complete control at all times. AITA?",

      "description": "Okay so this all went down a few months ago but I need to give background information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I live with my two roommates( they both have very unique names so I will call them Laura and Eleanor.) We have all been friends for about a year, and we got an apartment together this year. So one day my boyfriend( who I will call Mark) and I want to watch a movie. Laura left her laptop( which is a super old dell) on the floor with the HDMI cable left in, so I gently take it out and then put her laptop on the table so that it won't get stepped on or break. After a while Mark and I go out to grab some food, and come back a few hours later. As soon as I open the door Laura starts yelling at me, saying that I broke her laptop. I look at it and the HDMI port is a little bent. I don't remember hearing anything break or snap, so I told her I don't think that I broke it because I was really gentle taking it out.\n\nI ask her if I can take a look at it to see it and she freaks out, curses and screams at me, and goes into her room. I was really shocked that she treated me this way but I can get that she's angry so I asked her if there's anything I can do to help. Well over a month goes by and she won't talk to me. I texted her asking her to talk, have asked her when I see her in the apartment if anything is wrong, but she just snears at me and walks away. It's like talking to a wall. This really upsets me because I didn't think it was that big of a deal. I start feeling really upset that she won't talk to me and I've cried several times about it. Over the month I asked her 6 or 7 times if we could talk, and she just ignores me and walks away or says she is too busy. Mark even tries to talk to her because he sees how upset it is making me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I finally have enough and go to the RD( we live in off campus university apartments) and ask if she can set up a meeting between Laura and me with her mediating it. I had originally asked Eleanor but she said she didn't want to get in the middle of it, which is fine, I respect that. In the meeting I start crying( I cry a lot, finals had stressed me out and this had to) but pick myself up and ask her whats wrong. Laura is still pissed at the laptop ordeal. I ask her why she hasn't talked o me or anything and she said it's how she deals with being angry. I apologized but I told her how much she had hurt me by cursing and screaming at me and not talking to me; Laura use to be one of my best friends. She won't even look at me in the meeting. I decide that after the way she treated me I don't want to pay for her laptop. I still don't think I broke it, but if I did and it was an accident I would have if she hadn't have treated me like shit. I tried putting myself in her shoes, but I wouldn't have reacted like that even if a random stranger had broken my HDMI port.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel a little bad about not paying for it, but then I remember how she treated me. AIAH for this?\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n ",

      "description": "I (15M) always sit with my friend, (15F) at the school lunch. We've known each other for a bit more than a year and are good friends. The problem is, she has times where she just doesnt talk.\n\nI try to engage conversation and will she just kinda listens without saying anything, she will listen to music sometimes. I know she isnt angry or upset or anything, because she would tell me that (I know from past experiences with her). \n\nSo why dont I just go sit with other friends somewhere else? Well, I have before, and she gets very upset. I guess she doesnt know anyone else in the lunch and doesnt have any friends besides me to sit with. I've known that she is pretty anti social and shy. Theres a friend who sits near to us but with a girl that the one I sit with doesnt like (I know I should have given them names, too many girls).\n\nWhen my friend will talk, I enjoy our conversations but I'm don't want to just sit there with the both of us just in our phones when she doesnt talk. On the other hand, she'll be offended if I eat with some other friends somewhere else.\n\nSo WIBTA for going to sit with some other friends of mine?",

My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. \n\nI didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. \n\nI'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week.

I really love those rehearsals, since I want to become a theatre director and the rehearsals provide very adequate feedback to most of my questions. \n\nI agreed to participate in a video shoot for another theatres audiovisual play, thus missing one of the rehearsals I really love. Was not a big part, but background. They announced it in a facebook group for hobbyist actors. I forgot the target audience of that group and when I got to the video shoot and saw the room filled with hobbyist, schoolgirls and elderly theatre hobbyist. I felt like I was back in my theatre-hobby-days and I don't like it at all. I sat for a second, stood up and walked away. I did not see the producer, so I could not tell him directly I do not want to be there. On my way to the theatre rehearsal I wrote a message to the producer saying I mixed things up in my schedule and had to run. Apologised. Slightly.\n\nAITA for leaving the shoot? In my head I prioritized the theatre rehearsal higher than the video shoot. Tho I understand, breaking a \"promise\" like that. There were no contracts involved.",

      "description": "I wasn't trying to \"push him away\" in an emotional sense, but my husband has a habit of walking up to me when I'm on the couch and standing over me to talk. \n\nHe speaks to me, but I must either sign or text to him. Sometimes he will rant about something like politics or discussion of diet etc. for more than a minute. Usually lasting 5-30 minutes.  Sometimes these conversations turn one way where I will let him speak and sometimes say 2 or 3 words in the span of time.\n\nIt makes me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. Anyone else doing the same would make me feel the same way. I've started trying to get him to sit down when I realize it's going to be a lengthy conversation and sometimes he does. \n\nI suffer from anxiety (extreme) and last night I couldn't sleep, so I am a bit crabby today. When he came up to me, I pushed him away gently with my foot and asked/told him to respect my personal space. It went like this: \n\nHim:  Don't push me away \n\nMe:  Don't stand over me, it makes me super fucking anxious. \n\nHim:  I guess you'll just have to get used to it then. \n\nMe:  No, I don't, you can get used to respecting my personal space \n\nHim:  Ok \n\nThen he walked away without another word. I love my hubby and I want us to be emotionally close like we always have been, but I feel bad that pushing him away seemed to shock him and then the \"ok\" - I could tell he was pissed off. \n\nMy husband is NTA. I'm not here to demonize him and make me seem flawless. But I feel guilty still and he's giving me the cold shoulder. AITA? ",

      "description": "So, to start off, none of my family members are very close, and some don't even live near me. \n\nMy sister in law has two kids, as does my half-sister who I only met a few years ago for the first time. \n\nWhen each kid from my SIL was born, I sent a card, a little plushie toy and a $100 gift card. But I also hid her from my social media feeds because she has gone from a rebellious, witty chick to a breastfeeding mommy SJW crusader and I just don't care about that kind of thing. As for my half-sister, she lives about an hour away and we've only met up a few times since we learned of each other's existence. Both times she brought her very loud and hyper kids with her and I have been avoiding meeting her again ever since.\n\nI grew up an only child and have never cared much for kids, even when I was one. I would sit near the teacher/guardian that was watching the kids and talk to them rather than play with kids on the playground. As an adult I am childfree (I'm even sterilized), however I am still nice to kids whenever I have to be around them, and I am polite to people when they talk about their kids to me. I'm not really open about not liking kids, because as a woman over 30 that makes me look like a monster, or defective, to the vast majority of people. I can handle when they are around, I just don't prefer it and will usually make up some cheesy excuse to leave if someone brings loud kids around me.\n\nRecently I got some shit for never liking/commenting on pictures of the kids. I don't remember any of their birthdays, and aside from a family care package around Xmas season, I don't do anything for them. \n\nI never had a big family, grew up with just a mom and dad and everyone else lived too far away to see more than once every decade or so. \"Family\" is not as big a deal to me as other people, yet I feel like I'm still expected to fulfill the same obligations as people from big families that were close growing up.\n\nAm I an asshole? I don't dislike anyone, I just don't care that much.\n",

      "description": "I normally want neighbours to resolve conflict among ourselves. \n\nThe history\nMy neighbour downstairs bangs on my floor aka his ceiling once or twice a month presumably because I’m making too much noise. My neighbour also smokes cigarettes. It’s unclear whether he’s allowed to, I choose to give him the benefit of the doubt as it’s possible he was grandfathered in before the no smoking policy. Whenever I smell smoke wafting up into my suite I simply close my patio door or bedroom window and it prevents stinking up my suite.\n\nThe incident \nI was assembling IKEA furniture at 5PM. I hear a ton of banging on the floor. I adjust to work more quietly and finish entirely within 20 minutes. \n\nThe fallout \nThe next day I come home to a mild smell of cigarette smoke in the entrance to my apartment. I see an envelope on the floor under my doors mail slot, and when I pick it up it reeks of cigarette smoke. I open it and read a strongly word letter from the tenant downstairs, complaining of loud banging at 5PM the day before, threatening to contact the tenancy board and pursue further action of this nature. I put the letter in a zip lock to contain the smell. My apartment smells nice and my air freshener doesn’t need competition. \n\nMy take \nThis dude is over sensitive to noise, irritable in general and gross. I wait on it a few days and think on how to respond.\n\nI decided:\n- I really don’t want to interact with this person. It will be very very unpleasant between the predictable stink and the likelihood of a unpleasant exchange. \n- instead, after a week, I wrote a note to the landlord saying I normally ignore the eccentric irritability of the person downstairs but now that they are leaving stinky letters in my entrance I have to address it. \n- I included the stinky letter in the ziplock bag for the landlord to read and presumably smell.\n- I told the landlord I will be ignoring this tenant going forward as best I can. I also mentioned that my neighbour to my right has never complained of noise and even told me he likes living next to me because I’m not loud or obnoxious and as a bonus I’m not a smoker.\n- my call to action with the landlord was that he simply ask the tenant downstairs to be more tolerant of noise during daytime hours and to cease putting anything in my mail slot.\n\nJudge me \n\nAm I the asshole for:\n- avoiding the tenant downstairs entirely and just tattling to the landlord\n- avoiding conflict not because I’m afraid but because I just genuinely think the tenant downstairs is stinky and passive aggressive and his letter gave me all the insight I needed on both. I judged that no good could come of engaging him.\n\n",

She’s made friends with a girl who lives in this area and she’s asked me if she can stay over her house. When she told me where she was from I said I’d rather she didn’t go there. She asked me why and I said because it’s not a very nice area. I said her friend could come stay with us instead if she wanted but my daughter said a couple of other girls were going too and she can’t tell them to come to ours. My daughter got pretty upset with me and told me I was being unfair and that the girl is nice and I shouldn’t judge her because she’s from there. I said that I was sure she was nice and it wasn’t about her it was just I’ve heard bad things about that neighbourhood and I’m not comfortable with her going. I said she’d have to make up that she was busy and then maybe invite the girls over to ours the next week. She said no and I was ruining her friendship and is refusing to talk to me. \n\nSo let me ask, AITA for not wanting her to go? ",

      "description": "So some back story first. I got a verbal offer from a dream job. I’m still waiting for the formal offer and until then I’m trying not to be happy or confident about it. We’ve all heard stories about things falling through and until I sign anything I consider it not being an offer.\n\nThe industry and city I work in has a tendency to gossip and talk a lot. Everyone knows each other. So it’s very easy for things to come to my boss or the new company.\n\nI’ve told a total of 4 friends about the possibility because I wanted some advice and support during the interview process. I’ve told none of them except 1 about the name of the company.\n\nSo the one friend I told the name is also my colleague. It started of with him telling me that he “subtly” asked my boss if he thought I would be leaving soon. Upon hearing about this I immediately told my friend: please don’t do this. It’s my career, you can’t interfere with this. Upon which he said oh but it was really subtle, boss doesn’t even realize this was a real question.\n\nFast forward, the week after I’m going out and about 5 of our mutual friend come to me to congratulate me. Again I tell my friend, stop telling people. It’s not certain yet and I don’t want the company to find out yet. Again he laughs it off as if it’s nothing.\n\nSo, a couple days later my boss pulls me apart and told me she heard some rumors. Since he is also my friend I didn’t want to lie. So I basically told him the short of it without telling the name of the company. (My boss has a friend in said company and I don’t want anybody to interfere)\n\nThen today was the last drop. I ran into 2 people I know (friends but not really close) who started asking me about the new job and mentioned the company name (which I’ve been keeping secret). So when I asked them how do they know they said it’s because of my friends friend. Who doesn’t live in the same country and who I’ve never even met. \n\nSo I texted my friend again to say. Can you please ask your friend to stop talking about me and especially the name of the company. \n\nSo AITA for getting upset over this? Honestly I thought I’m not. But every time I tell my friend off it gets laughed away. So now I’m starting to wonder if I’m being overly sensitive for feeling like somebody is interfering with my career\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for threatening to file a lawsuit on someone who exposed my nudes?",
      "description": "Here’s the full story. A tl;dr is below if this is too long. About a month ago I was desperate for any attention/affection. I would do very risky and dumb things. But one specific moment is this one person who messaged me. They didn’t have any pfp (a huge red flag) but I was just hoping and wishing for the best result since she seemed interested in me \n\nAnd so I sent some pictures and said some very vile things because I don’t like saying no to people. After the nudes and flurry of role play messages passed, she revealed that this was a shared account. I thought it was a joke or something so I played along and stuff. But the next day during lunch I was told people were airdropped my nudes.\n\nI was incredibly ashamed and scared because I don’t know how to handle this sort of stuff and the main guy (let’s call him Dave) kept harassing me about it for about a month. Then the 20th came. I had a failed suicide attempt because of the constant harassment (I used nutmeg because I heard it could cause death)\n \nWhen school started again (winter break) I didn’t hear much from him until yesterday when I heard from a friend that my nude was uploaded to a spam account. I was embarrassed so I requested to go home early. When this happened I started looking up if I could file a case about this or get him arrested for distributing CP. \n\nThen comes today. I was already feeling like shit so I couldn’t handle much. When 5th period came I wanted to use the elevator to go up to my class but when I walked in, I noticed the two people who are mainly causing me trouble (Dave and the girl who’s account he used). They started loudly announcing that my ass was “ugly” and that my dick was “flexible” . Other people were in the elevator and I couldn’t handle this constant shit so I just walked up the stairs to my class\n\nI started crying because it was too much for me at the time. My friend noticed and when class ended he came up to me and asked to talk. I told him that after I get myself together I’ll talk to him. I then saw Dave and had the idea to confront him about it and ask him to stop. Most likely not the brightest idea. I told him to stop talking about me and he claimed he didn’t do it even though I have evidence. After that ordeal I felt so angry and depressed that I made a post saying “you people need to leave me alone. Stop spreading shit about me”. I walked up to my friend and I told my friend to go into the bathroom with me and then I broke down in front of him saying that I am trying to ignore him but that he keeps getting bolder and more creative with this shit. He told me to go to the social worker and that’s what I did.\n\nWhen I was there I told her everything but not saying I gave out nudes but saying “I did something shameful that I am not ready to talk about with the school yet. I will tell you what exactly happened on Monday” they understood and said I didn’t have to specify right now if I didn’t feel comfortable. We then talked about all of the things bothering me here. They called my mom and I left.\n\nWhen I got to my grandmas house (we were picking something up) I told my mom all of the details about what happened. She recommended that I take this to the court of law, which I’ll begrudginglydo. About 30 or so minutes later I got a message from one of my ‘friends’.  She asked what was wrong and since we were cool I told her what happened. She then proceeded to tell Dave that I messaged her about this and he messaged me saying he was sorry and not to do this.\n\nI told him I don’t forgive him and that we’ll deal with this when I talk to the Vice Principal or the police. He then swore up and down that he didn’t spread this stuff and that I was wrong. I told him that we’ll see. He then sent me a wall of messages begging me not to do it and that he’s innocent. I ignored and blocked him. \n\nThe ‘friend’ that messaged me saying that it’s my fault that I sent it and that I’ll be an asshole for getting the police and the school involved. I left her on read because i didn’t know what to say, as I wasn’t sure how to react to this.\n\n\n**tl;dr** A shared account catfished me and spread my nudes across my school. When I brought it to the main guy who did this attention he said he didn’t do it even though I have proof. I was also told by a ‘friend’ of mine that she thinks it all my fault and that I shouldn’t talk to the Vice Principal or go through with a lawsuit that I am planning to file.\n\n\n**AITA** for proceeding to file a lawsuit for this? I just need to know before I go through with it and I need to make sure that I am mostly in the right, since he technically he spread CP and that’s a crime and a breach of privacy. At least I think it is. I don’t wanna be another one of those frivolous cases that America has so much of. \n\n\n",

      "description": "I share an apartment with another young woman. I don't know her exact age, I believe she's probably 23. Just about every weekend she goes out and gets dead drunk with her friends, which I don't care about. She's an adult, she can make her own decisions.\n\nHowever, around 11pm last night she came in, went to the bathroom and went to bed. At 5am I woke up to use the bathroom and found she had thrown up on the bathmat, and hadn't cleaned it up. She had also thrown up in the toilet and hadn't flushed. Not wanting to leave fresh vomit to dry in the shared bathroom, I threw it on the washing machine, and did a load when I got up at about 6am. When I went out to get milk at the store, I found blood on the downstairs doorknob, which I was too grossed out to clean.\n\nThis is the third time I've cleaned up her drunken vomit, and to be honest I'm getting tired of it. We're not good friends, I don't drink ever, and I'm not happy about being consigned to being the only person who cleans up her bodily fluid messes. \n\nAfaik she's never cleaned the bathroom, even when she has left obvious blood on and behind the sink taps. \n\nWIBTA if I told her I'm sick of cleaning up her drunken vomit, and asking her to clean the bathroom after a night of throwing up in it?",

      "description": "Just to let you know how long this has bothered me, it's been about 4 months and I STILL think about this situation to this day. \n\nOne day I was shopping at a supermarket and when I went to checkout, I stood in line behind this elderly woman. We were both in the \"less than 10 items\" line but apparently, since it was nearing closing, they closed the line and told us to redirect to the other available cashiers. \n\nSo naturally, I went to the next shortest line right beside this checkout. It turns out that the elderly woman followed suit and lined up behind me. \n\nHowever, she then proceeded to ask me if we could switch places. Normally, since I'm a pretty passive person, I probably would've conceded, but that day, I was in a rush and I already had a friend waiting for me for over 10 minutes. So I told her that I couldn't that I promised to be \"as fast as I could\" with bagging my stuff and leaving. She then said, kind of passive-aggressively that the speed at which I checkout is not dependent on me but rather the cashier. And then she remarked that the fact that I was ahead of her in this line, it was if I was cutting in front HER. \n\nI didn't know what to do next but I didn't want to give up my spot so I just shrugged and stayed in line. She then moved to a different line, in frustration I imagine. \n\nIn my mind, I justify my choice by telling myself that I was in the right because this was a NEW LINE and she didn't have to follow me; there were other cashiers. And since in new lines, no matter what order you were in previously, the old positioning doesn't apply. But she was elderly though...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? ",

I thought it was me at first so i asked him and he started to break down a bit before crying. Hes just started seeing a therapist or \"counselor\" about his childhood.\n\nThen he tells me that he was raped as an 11 year old by his stepbrother, multiple times when he was young. This floored me as up until this point he seemed so macho and sort of like a \"tough guy\" and nows hes confessing to being raped by another man while completely being in tears and holding me.\n\nI held him back and let him vent but i ended up leaving (we were at his apartment).\n\nI completely understand that its horrible being a rape victim but honestly i dont know if i could see him the same way again. I had this image of him thats completely shattered and honestly everytime i see him text me I just feel weird now.\n\nMy best friend thinks i should try to keep dating him for a bit but im really not attracted to him like i was before.

      "description": "About a month ago I saw a FB post listed as “Lost kitten needs home” and I replied to it and went to see the kitten (1 mo. old). The poster said she was a stray they found in the woods. And after I saw the kitten I instantly fell in love with her and decided I would take her home!\n\nI went out and got her all the supplies/food/toys she needed and even her own cat collar. And after a few weeks got her spayed and vaccinated. So far we’ve gotten along amazingly, she’s like my little shadow and follows me around everywhere and sleeps by my side every night. \n\nHowever, in the back of my mind I’ve had a nagging thought: what if she’s not a stray and she’s actually missing. \n\nSo for the last few weeks I’ve checked all the community ads and posts about missing cats and so far nothing. Which I’m relieved about. \n\nHowever, I’ve been considering getting her microchipped and am worried that if I take her in she may already have one and I’ll have to give her up. \n\nMy logic is that someone let a kitten (who needs constant supervision) out and let her become a stray. So in my mind, she’s better off with me who can care for her and keep her safer. Additionally, she has spent the majority of her life with me and I don’t see how it would be fair to relocate her. \n\nAITA for not wanting to risk it, and even if I find out she is missing to not return her.

      "description": "I live in a condo. My building has 24 units housing singles, couples and young families. Many unfamiliar renters. The laundry room only has 2 washers and 2 dryers.

Rarely, when I take my washed, wet items to the laundry room, someone has obviously put two loads in the washers with the intent to dry them when the wash cycle is done. When I use the dryer this way, they come down to find they have to wait for my stuff to finish. If the dryer is available, I put my stuff in regardless of whether or not the washers are running. Trying to wait out the neighbors in the past has shown me a bunch of people think it's ok to just leave their shit in the machines sometimes hours after the cycle is done, so I just use the machine if it's free. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I went down for my sheets today I found my damp sheets on top of the dryer with a nastygram from an anonymous neighbor essentially saying since I wanted to butt in line for the machines, they're going to take my paid cycle and waste my time since I tried wasting theirs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow obviously it was an asshole move to take my paid cycle. Also arguably an asshole move to monopolize the laundry room for \\~2 hours to wash and dry two loads simultaneously (which is common practice in our building, sometimes chained for 4, 6 or even 8 loads.)

      "title": "AITA For Being Upset At My Father?",
      "description": "A little backstory here: my father has been unemployed for the last four years in pursuit of an independent directing career. In those four years, he has made things here and there but hasn’t generated any income for our family. He does other things like cook, clean, and laundry, which are much appreciated by my mother and I. Currently, my mom pays the rent for the family and I help with things like groceries, gas, etc. We both have 40 hour/week jobs. \n\nOver the summer, both my parents weren’t working and I had to pay the lion share of our rent (which is a decent amount of money). This upset me because I am trying to move out of my parents house and find an apartment for myself. The area I live is very expensive and I have to save a lot of money in order to afford something. Once my mom started working again, things were going ok. I was able to start saving up. However, my account never got that big. \n\nMy dad is notorious for borrowing money from people and manipulating them into giving him said money. He’s been doing it all my life. When he borrowed money from my grandfather, he would justify it by saying he deserves it after all the shit his father put him through. I hate borrowing money and prefer to work and make a living that way. We have a family friend whom my dad sometimes goes to for money, but he didn’t like how the friend would constantly hassle him for a check when it was due. So he started going to me because he knows I have a hard time refusing to help my parents financially. I have been trying to set a boundary and limit the amount of money I give to my parents. When I do this, my dad accuses me of not wanting to help the family. His mentality is that any money that comes into the family belongs to everyone. \n\nRecently, I found out that I am going to have to pay the majority of next month’s rent and I am pretty upset about it. I feel like my father is now just borrowing money from me like he did his father. I am the asshole for being upset at my father about this? He claims he is going to start driving Lyft but I don’t know how long that could last for. I just don’t want to be used as a well of constant resource for my father when he doesn’t even work himself. I value my independence and every time my father borrows a large sum of money from me it takes away from my ability to move out. Please advise me what to do about this situation. ",

      "description": "So this friend of mine, but I use the term loosely cause we've been more acquaintances since we have friends in common but since I had a friend break up and told him about it since he told me to pass on his story to said friend.\n\nAnyway, he was all what do I get you and said friend? And he was insistent on me telling him on what I wanted even though I tried to politely say nothing because I don't feel like we are a close enough of a friendship to buy each other gifts. Anyway, he kept asking about my perfect gift ( which is a dog and not realistic as I live in an apartment, and will be moving to pursue more schooling and don't want one until I have a house and time to take care of one) so then I asked him what he wanted and he was all I don't like materialistic gifts and so on. So I said why don't we pick an activity or someday to hang out instead of doing gifts? So he agreed.\n\nNow a few days later, he tells me he bought me something because it reminds him of me, but I don't need to get him anything. But if course, I have to buy him some thing so I don't look like an asshole. So I ended buying him the what do you meme game a few days ago. Now he's back from school and is all we can go out to eat at this place, maybe go see this movie, go ice skating and so on. Which at the time I agreed to. \n\nSo now I want to break it to him that I don't really have the money. At the time, I was trying at the time to get a subleaser which has a $150 fee- but shortly after, my first subleaser bailed and I lost the $150, then I paid another $150 for another one who is currently not responding to me and if he doesn't, I will have to find another and pay the fee again ( my living situation is hell with petty roommates so I NEED to leave). Plus I paid another $100 to get myself out of a lease next year. I didn't expect to have this problem which I've dropped $400 on this already, and may have to pay more. \n\nHe knows I'm having trouble with said roommates but not all the details as he's friends with them too, but I feel bad for cancelling since I can't keep taking money out of my savings as I've already taken out more than I'm comfortable with. But I also know that he'll offer to pay for everything but I don't know him well enough to accept that without feeling super uncomfortable.\n\nSo WIBTA for canceling the agreed plans and still saying no when he ( most likely ) offers to pay?

My step-brother smokes weed in the house all of the time, despite my mom and I asking him to please not do so. I personally just hate the smell, while my mom not only hates the smell, but gets her asthma aggravated by it at times. Time and time again we’ve confronted him and his dad trying for a change, with no budge. \n\nTonight, I confronted him yet again, but he insists he’s doing nothing wrong and shouldn’t have to leave the house to smoke, despite our objections. It seemed so easy for him to just insist it was fine, which makes me question myself. \n\nTo me personally this is a no-brainer to fix. Either he moves out, stops smoking in the house, or gets a pen/vape to reduce the smell. But AITA for thinking this? Should he be able to just smoke in the house? I just want to make sure I’m justified before our final confrontation, and before completely ruining our relationship. ",

I generally get along with, let's call him A. \n\nHowever, A is dating this woman a few years older than him, shes 36 he's 27 who is very emotionally immature. The first night I met her she wanted to fight me for FUN while drunk saying I didnt look that tough (never claimed to be). Needless to say I didnt fight her because even though I was only 23 at the time I thought it was a terrible idea. \n\nA's girlfriend has a child with another man who she just plops in front of the game counsel every time shes over so that she can get drunk. \n\nA's girlfriend told my husband that \"woman who get raped should be thankful because they come out of it stronger and rape has been around since cavemen days and isnt that bad\" a week after she found out I had been assaulted. \n\nI tried to be friends with her, try and find a side to her I could tolerate but I simply cant. Shes drunk all the time, threatening all the time, and needlessly offensive. \n\nWe've tried to just hang out with A but she is always there. I tried to get my husband to go alone to see A but he either feels bad for leaving me home or things get out of hand with the girlfriend and I have to show up anyway. \n\n\nThere are a lot more examples of her behavior but I dont feel like writing them all, hopefully you'll get the point. \n\n\nSo, my husbands friendship has suffered because of my hatred for his best friends girlfriend. Luckily he hates her also. \n\nBut AITA for not \"sucking it up\" and spending time with them anyway? For my husband's sakes? \n\n",

      "description": "So this is my first ever post on a new account since I totally forgot I even had an account on here before, so sorry if this is a bit awkward. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe background of my relationship with this friend is that we've known each other since middle school, and we've always been pretty close. We're both goofballs and we naturally stuck together over the years. I love him to death, he's one of my best friends, but he's wearing me down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery time we talk, all we do is talk about his problems, and there's a lot. It's either about his ex, his lack of love life, his financial status, or his own mental issues. And I don't mind talking to him every now and then about this stuff, I love being there for my friends in that way, I know how much going through all of that sucks. I have a lot of issues with some pretty serious depression and anxiety to the point where it's hard for me to hold down a job, but that is beside the point. Any time I try to talk to him about my own stuff, it's for like five minutes before it's brought back to him. I'm expected to carry the whole of the emotional baggage, and we're not even dating, we're just good friends. If we talk it's either about his problems, or D&amp;D. I don't mind talking about that stuff, but when it's all I'm good for, it really wears me down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I reached a breaking point with it, and had to stop talking to him. I called him crying and had to explain that I needed to take a break from him, and from talking to him, and went over. I was bawling my eyes out because he's one of my best friends, and here I am just trying to get ANY sort of response from him that wasn't just a 'mmhmm' or an 'okay'. I gave him back the key to his apartment, and he just shrugged and went back inside, and I just sobbed in my car. And then later I had other friends tell me that he told them what was going on and that I was out of line and they were accusing me of abandoning my friend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for telling my friend that I can't carry his whole life on my shoulders and suggesting he get professional help instead of dumping his problems on me? Am I in the wrong and being a bad friend? I really just don't know what to do.",

      "description": "Ill try and make this as short as possible.\n\nA while back i (22) was on holiday in Thailand with family and my boyfriend (23) stayed home. He offered to pick me up at the airport the day i arrived back home.\n\nHowever, the night before i was meant to fly back he notified me that his old friend (and also old FWB) was in the state and she asked if he wanted go visit her, he accepted.(note: he is originally from another state and met her there a few years back. She has family in the same state we currently live in. With that said, her place is still a good 2-3 hours from his place)Anyway he tells me he is going for the 2-3hour drive down to catch up with her, to which i was fine with and said i hoped he had a good time catching up and whatever BUT it was the middle of the afternoon when he started the drive, i figured he would be there kinda late so i nicely asked that if this catch up went into the night, could he please not stay over at her house.. he agreed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nffw a few hours, im at the airport nearly ready to board my flight and i get a phone call from him, completely drunk and telling me he has no choice but to stay at her place, but he assures me hes staying on the couch. I lose my shit (tbh i really think i had a valid reason to lose my shit at him for being drunk and staying with a girl he used to sleep with). He says he cant do anything about it and that is just going to have to be that way but he has set an early alarm so that he can still make it to the airport in time to get me in the morning.\n\nThe argument/all contact got cut off because i had to board my flight so i was stuck with a disgusting sick feeling in my stomach the whole 9hour flight back and honestly was in no mood to even deal with him once i had landed.\n\nSo i arrive home and true to his word he was waiting at my arrival gate to greet me, i however gave him a wave and just proceeded to follow him towards where he parked the car. The entire ride home was awkward, he was making small talk asking how i enjoyed the trip but i couldn't bring myself to pretend nothing was wrong. So not yelling or anything i asked how he thinks i'm expected to be happy to see him when the night before he was drunk sleeping over with his old FWB after i specifically asked him not to and he had agreed. I confessed the whole 2 weeks i was away i really looking forward to being back with him as i had missed him a lot but this whole situation had ruined that. He proceeds to argue that im overreacting and that i should have more trust in him than that. Says hes sick of repeating that he didn't do anything with her and that he crashed on the couch. He says that its my fault our reunion was ruined because he has done nothing wrong and he was hurt i didn't give him a hug or kiss at the gate when i arrived.\n\nIn the end i honestly was not bothered fighting with him especially since i was insanely tired after the flight so i just apologised to end it. But to be honest i really don't feel i was the one that was meant to say sorry though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend after he got drunk and slept over at his old FWB house after he said he wouldnt.",

It felt like I was forcing myself to like her when I only really wanted to be friends. So I talked to her and it ended with both of us seeming to be okay. We still wanted to be friends (we played games together with other friends and didn’t want to ruin that) we are both uni students, everything seemed to be fine. We have this mutual ‘friend’ who doesn’t live near us however he’s a little older than us by about 3 years and has a job and doesn’t live so far that he can’t drive up. I found out earlier today that they met up with another gaming friend of ours in the same town last weekend, a meet up which I wasn’t invited too (apparently because they didn’t think I’d be interested) during the meet up this “friend” slept with my ex. He seems to feel no remorse and she seems to think it wouldn’t bother me. Am I justifiably angry at the both of them for this less than 2 weeks after the break up or am I being unjust as I ended it and I’m not together with her anymore. After I was told I blew up at them and sent a few rude messages which probably wasn’t the best way to handle it. But it felt like I was betrayed by 2 of the few friends I actually have. AITA for being mad at them or should I just apologise and try and continue being friends? ",

Until they suddenly break up and he immediately moves on to 2nd woman/side-chick (We’ll call her Kate) in question. \n\nNancy and John were great together, or so I thought. They’d been together for about 4 or 5 years now. I’ve heard it got rough behind closed doors but rumors run rampant today and they seemed happy so I thought little of it. When they suddenly broke up I was a little surprised but they both rebounded quickly and that’s when he met Kate. It was clearly rebound but he led her to believe he wanted to stay with her. The whole time they’ve been together he’s been plotting to get Nancy again behind Kate’s back. \n\nJohn and Kate were together for about a month before he introduced me to his now ‘girlfriend’ (he did tell me not to call her that on the phone one time though so ?.) Here’s the thing though. Kate is just an angel. She’s classy, she’s beautiful, in shape and just trying to get out there in the dating world. We really hit it off and (as a group) went to bar hop and play pool a few times. It was all platonic up until Valentine’s Day when he dumps Kate at 3am because “I choose Nancy.).\n\nI kind of said “what the fuck” to myself. So John calls me at about 10am and says “I broke it off with Kate today. Nancy’s just the one for me.” I said “That sucks, I’m spending the day alone and you had a choice.” I chuckled, it was really just a joke. John says “why don’t you invite Kate over?” I’m thinking to myself immediately that it’s a good idea, and my friend gave me permission, right? I told him “You know, I’m going to do that.” And he actually said “Okay cool” and we made our goodbyes like normal. “Have a good one man” or something I don’t remember.\n\nA little backstory on Kate. We’ve talked a lot when we go out. We always end up talking about something random and it’s about never ever that I find an attractive woman I actually click with. She’s got two kids and even though I don’t want any of my own it didn’t matter. That’s usually a dealbreaker but this time it was worth it. I knew I could get used to that face every morning and it hurt seeing John plot behind her back and downplay how much of a catch she is to me on the phone. \n\nSo I call her. I say “Hey, I was just talking to John.” She immediately interrupts and says “He dumped me at 3am this morning.” It kind of made me mad too, like dude, on Valentine’s Day?! So I said “I actually talked to him a little while ago, he told me about it. He also told me to invite you over. Maybe we can order some food and watch movies or something?” She told me she would love to the rest you can guess. \n\nNow John is furious. Kate and I just want to give it a try, see if we work since they clearly don’t. &amp; Now he’s all crying, telling me he doesn’t want me to keep doing this because he loves her. He came over today and they left to go have a talk, or do the nasty. Not quite sure 🤔. I know she’s super pissed at him. So here it is, AITA for sleeping with my friends amazing new girlfriend he dumped on Valentine’s Day? \n\nTL;DR: Best friend got a new girlfriend and left her for his long time ex on Valentine’s Day. He loosely gave me permission to get with her and we’ve been into each other since but now he’s upset and crying because he still loves her and bro-code whatever. AITA for wanting to give it a shot with her despite his feelings. \n\nThanks reddit, it’s been eating at me. ",

      "description": "I fly often.  I prefer aisle seats.  And I support a firm rule:  You stay in or by your seat when exiting a plane.  Because people exit *in the order of seating, from the front to the back.*\n\nI remain in my seat until the people in the rows 1 or 2 in front of me begin leaving.  Then I stand and get my carryon out of the overhead bin.  And I always let the people across from me go first.\n\nUnfortunately a common occurrence is that people further back jump up when the plane lands and push up in the aisle.  Meaning when I'm ready to get up the aisle is clogged--not by the people across from me, but people from the back.  \n\nThat does not deter me.  I'm standing up, no matter how crowded it is.  Sure, I'll give an *excuse me.*  Sometimes the crowd is light and it works easy..  \n\nBut often not.  Sometimes it's real packed by people from the back.  And the people in the aisle right by my seat (from further back) can't really back up well because of the crowd behind them.\n\nTough.  I'm getting up into the aisle.   I'm 6'4 so it's usually not a challenge for me.  Make a space.   And if  I see a bunch of knuckleheads from the back have tried to snake their way up, I can get pretty pushy. \n\nCramped, discomfited by the situation?  *You should have stayed in or by your seat further back and waited your turn.*\n\n(On those rarely occasions someone announces they are late for a connecting flight and appeal to be let through, of course I accommodate.)\n\n",

It's a really nice place and they have great coffee, so I decided to sit in there and work on my laptop.\n\nI was sitting at a low bar seat next to the window, and to avoid taking space of the person next to my right, the best place for me to put my coat happened to be the floor wedged between myself and a book shelf. It was a new place and the floor wasn't too dirty dirty, and I figured I'd make the sacrifice of potentially dirtying my coat so the space next to me wouldn't be obstructed.\n\n4 hours later, my coat had worked it's way in to the general space without me noticing. The manager must have noticed this, because he stormed over to me, and with a hurried and aggravated demeanor, stuffed my coat in to the now empty chair next to me and pushed the chair in to the bar, then walked back behind the counter. Not a word.\n\nI figured I had outstayed my welcome, maybe he was mad because I was sitting there so long? I bought a coffee and a sandwich, it's not like I was freeloading.\n\nIn my experience, that's what people do at coffee shops, camp out on their laptops. I was a barista at three different coffee shops, I was never bothered by people who stayed there all day. They tipped the best and were usually very friendly.\n\nIn this case, the coffee shop is right next to the library, so I could have worked there instead.\n\nWhatever the case, I didn't say anything, I just packed up my things and left since it seems like they wanted me gone. I'm pissed about it, but still not sure if I was in the wrong.",

      "description": "I (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. ",

Complained when I said I was drunk and couldn’t be of any help. \n\nHe continues to be not emotionally supportive or understanding. When I was having a bad day &amp; we were supposed to hang out, he opted to cancel if I was gonna “be like that” as in not being in a good mood. \n\nAnytime I would tell him things I didn’t appreciate (for example flaking on plans with no texts or calls to cancel) he just threatens to bring up past things I have done wrong in the friendship. \n\nDid not even attempt to say bye to me when I was leaving across the world for 5 weeks.\n\nI’ve had a hard time feeling justified in ending this friendship for many reasons, but I’ve opted to just not reach out anymore. \nMe and my roommates are having a party and one of them invited him (not knowing I’m not talking to him).

I pay part of the rent every month and am living at home with everyone until I go to Uni in Spetember.\n\nWe lived in a cramped house atm, only 3 rooms between all of us. Dad doesn't live with us and I should be going to uni in September. I work most days of the weeks but the days I am home she gets me to babysit my 3 year old brother. Every. Single. Time.\n\nAnd when I say I'm going out on my days off, which isn't often, she says \"oh\" and has this look of almost annoyance on her and it makes me feel bad. It just feels like all I am here for is to be a second parent to my little brother, it's gotten to the point where he's accidentally calling me mum which is sweet but concerning. He's my brother, not my child. It just frustrates me because I know she won't be able to get me to babysit once I'm at Uni, so it just feels like shes taking advantage of me whilst I'm here. My brother goes to preschool in the mornings as well from 8-1 so it's not like hes constantly home either. \n\nShe doesn't ask my 16 year old brother, because he's just gets annoyed with her and it's against the law to leave minors alone with him because of his age. But it just puts more pressure on me to say yes because in her mind I have no reason to say no to babysitting. So if I do say no shes bound to get annoyed at me.\n\nDont get me wrong I didn't used to mind the odd time I needed to babysit, because he can be a handful and she deserves a break from him for a few hours. But it's just gotten to the point where I can predict when she's gonna ask me to babysit. I know it's more convenient for her to leave him with me whilst she does her shopping or goes to pick up my other siblings from school, but she makes me feel like she can't do those things unless I babysit, which I know she can because she does it when I'm working.\n\nI guess it's not the babysitting itself I'm annoyed with, it's the fact that she expects me to at this point and it's making me angry with her.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?",

Leading up to the holidays season she mentioned how nice it would be to be engaged to bring some good news to her family when they convene for Christmas. I am in the military and I will not be back until Mid March. But it seemed like she really wanted to be engaged. \n\nSo on 21 December I decided to propose to her over our biweekly video chat. I told her how much I loved her how much she meant to me and how I was sorry that I couldn’t be there in person to do this. I promised to get her a ring as soon as I returned as I have been saving up for one for quite some time. She accepted. \n\nBut when we talked recently she told me that she was really upset that I decided to propose over video chat. She said she was just thinking out loud because her younger sister recently got engaged. She said the proposal could have waited until March. She said her family thinks I have no manners and that I’m very rude for doing this. Her dad seems particularly upset that I didn’t ask for his permission. I do remember she mentioned once that she wanted me to ask him but I thought this requirement went out the window when she started giving hints that she wanted to be engaged by Christmas. \n\nI think Sally and I are still engaged but she is still very upset about how I did it. I don’t know how to make this better because I thought I did exactly what she asked me to do and I thought I would make her happy. But I don’t know if I should be feeling this upset because it seems and communicated badly. \n\nI don’t know how to feel Reddit. Am I the asshole? \n\nTL;DR I’m deployed but my girlfriend threw hints that she wanted to be engaged. I asked her over video chat and now she is angry but I don’t know what I could’ve done better. ",

That's just a bump that I would want to resolve. He was never violent, never hit me or called me names.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis post isn't about arguing but rather about a situation where he gets angry at something that has nothing to do with me. Like getting into a fight with his dad and stuff like that. He can raise his voice and swaer a lot when angry (which he doesnt do any other time) but nothing that would make me feel geniuely threathened. Yet I still find myself intimidated by him when he is losing his temper. I usually don't know how to react and stay quiet. That doesn't sit well with my bf. In his opinion I should be there to calm him down and talking to him is the best way to do that.The reason I dont want to do it is well:\n\n* I really dont know what to do in situations like this and like I said feel intimidated by him. He wants me to just pick a topic and talk about it but its hard when I see him clearly angry.\n* He tends to redirect his anger towards me even if Im not involved in this situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe talked about it and we both firmly stand our ground - I think that he should calm down on his own, he thinks I should be there to help him. Im more than happy to console him if he's sad but I feel like its a different situation. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I have a neighbor who is a nice enough guy but is constantly calling me or knocking on my door to vent about his problems. He's absolutely convinced that 2 of his downstairs neighbors are conspiring against him. Telling me that they are listening in on his phone &amp; that they are trying to get information against him. He's also asked me to come to his apartment &amp; file the callouses off his feet several times and will badger me when I decline. Last month we had to put our 14 year old dog down when he got sick. A week later I saw my neighbor and he asked how I was. I told him I was feeling pretty down and he asked why. When I told him how much I missed my dog his response was \"You're not over that yet?\". He said it like I shouldn't still be upset over losing my pet. Between that and being tired of listening to him gripping about his other neighbors obsessively, I've found myself trying to avoid him. I feel kinda bad about it because he has helped me out in the past. Taking me to the grocery store when our car broke down and loaning me money once, but honestly, I've heard his rant about the neighbors more times than I can count. I don't know what he expects me to do or say. I don't believe in getting involved in other people's drama. I have enough going on in my own life. Am I wrong in feeling this way?",

      "description": "My best friend and I have planned a fishing trip for this weekend with 3 of his kids a few hours away from home. My friend, and I have known each other for 14 years, I go to his house every weekend, and we are really close. He has 4 kids, but the mother of the last one left him a little over a year ago because she caught him cheating, and for unrelated reasons doesn't let the child see him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend quickly found another girlfriend, and after about a half a year they split up. Last week around monday he told me he was talking to the woman he cheated with again, that she is married but leaving her husband, and he was going to take it slow with her. The very next day she told him she told her husband to get out.  Sunday they started staying at her house. Now she wants to go on the fishing trip with us, and his 3 boys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI helped raise the child he doesn't get to see a little more than the other 4. From the time she was 4 months old until around 2 years old I watched her during waking hours for the most part as I was staying with them, and they worked 3rd shift, and slept until the evening. I grew a really  big attachment to the baby. I just don't think I can meet the new girlfriend for the first time without being bombarded with the thought that she was part of the reason I don't get to see that baby anymore. When I do meet her I want to be able to have an escape plan, and we'll  be using my SUV to get us all to the fishing spot, so if I couldn't take dealing with her, and left then they wouldn't have a ride back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if I am being petty, but I definitely feel guilty for pressuring him to decide whether to have me go, or her. It really doesn't matter to me if he picks her, because I have a shit ton of housework to get caught up on. But am I being a petty asshole?",

We have other issues in our relationship though that r kind of relevant, like him sometimes yelling at me or getting loud when i dont do as he says things like that. I work a 9-5:30 monday through friday and i do not have a car, so he takes me to work almost every morning and picks me up. He only works 3 MAYBE 4x a week (which r weekends) since he is a barber. \n\nNow i work in sales and its pretty busy in the office during working hours, (given we get three 10-15 minute breaks thru out the day depending if we hit our goal or not) especially simce we have a bunch of new hires they need to train and theres only like 3 managers right now. Ive worked there for a little over 6 months and today i made a few sales so they had me working the floor helping the rookies. \n\nMy SO texts me earlier in the day telling me he feels sick and hes been throwing up and excessively using the bathroom, we think he got food poisoning somehow. Pretty much i called him wrote him when i coukd making sure he was okay and letting him know i was doing pretty good for the day and there was a possibility that i could leave early. Well he took that possibility and turned it into a \"get out early i dont feel good\" type deal. I bend over backwards for this man on a regular basis, have even skipped work to take care of him and a handful of other shit. Pretty much when i got on the floor to help i left my phone at my desk, (we arent allowed to use our phones at all) and he then proceeded to send me the following messages;\n\n\" I cnt fuckingbelieve u\" \"You're f****** inconsiderate\" \"I clearly see you don't give two fux about me I appreciate you so f****** much but it took you and pick up in my girl f****** week matter leash and you can't do me in this f****** simple favor cuz you want to make 1/3 f****** self when I'm f****** feeling horrible I'm sitting on myself and throwing up on myself now man I got you\". \n\nAs soon as 5:30 hit i reached for my phone and couldnt believe he spazzed like that at me, I could understand if you would have left and let me know that he was too sick to come get me I completely understand and I even told him that on the phone.\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?????? \n\nTLDR; boyfriend spazzed crazy to me on the phone and once i got off work in the car because i didnt reply to his messages while i was working and hes sick.",

      "title": "AITA for getting mad at my sister being late to getting picked up?",
      "description": "I have been pondering a bit about this over the weekend, but felt like I wanted to hear about other peoples opinion for insight\n\nSo ever since I (23 years old) recently got my driver licence, I have been driving my sister (15) around to her friends and family cottage as it is too far for her to walk to those places. That I am fine with as long as it is asked about instead of just being suddenly sprung on me, which usually doesn't happen. But the other day I got a bit annoyed when I was going to pick her up after her friends birthday party.\n\nI was asked the day before if I could drive my mom to the cottage, and take back the car since it's battery has been having issues with the cold here and dying on her, so she wanted it in a safe place, and if I later could both drive my sister and our cousin to the party, pick her up around the time it was done, get her and drive her to the family cottage. I accepted and said fine, I can do that as it's the least I can do to have the house to myself, and it's only a 10-15 min drive each way. \n\nNext day comes and I have had a long day at work and are a bit exhausted, but can't really take a nap as I have the drives I need to do. When they come home, my sister asks if I also could drive her to her cousins house an hour before the party, a house which is a 2 minute drive. I say fine and decide to do that after driving my mom. when returning, I tell her to get ready to be picked up, and I have to wait 5 minutes until she actually get's in the car after arriving home and drive her over, an hour pass, I drive to our cousins place, pick them up and drive them to the party, and I say I will call when I am on my way and they need to get ready.\n\ntime passes again and I go to pick them up, I get a message from my cousin that my sisters phone has run out of battery (which is a common occurrence much to our dismay when trying to contact her) and tells me to tell her when I'm nearby. I do so about 2 minutes before I get there so they have time to change to cottage clothing, and get the message to wait a few minutes. After 5 minutes passed after the appointed time, I send a new message to my cousin \"Are you guys ready soon?\" as to which I get no responses. Another 5 minutes pass until I finally see them walking to the car. A bit annoyed I tell them to hurry up so that we could go. After driving for a little bit and my sister does a bit of small talk and I respond, albeit not the best of moods, which makes her go \"Why are you mad?\"\n\nFor context, this is a sentence I hear so often from her that it actually drives me mad. My sister loves small talk too much, while I in general are a very reclusive person. Which tends to make me a bit annoyed when she talks for way too long. and that usually prompt her to ask me that. it has gotten to the point where even me and my parents have to tell her to stop saying it since just because people aren't \"happy\" they aren't necessarily \"mad\", and then she get's a little offended when we get annoyed because \"she was just asking\". \n\nSo prompting that question, I frankly just responded \"because you two spend a lot of time when we had an appointed time, and didn't tell me when you where done, while also leaving me in the dark about when you where done\", where she argues that the party didn't end until I arrived and they had to spend the 10 minutes getting ready, which actually means they are taking their sweet time, and that I have no reason to being annoyed/mad. Me just wanting to get home again, drove the rest of the ride quietly, left them off where they needed to be, and went home\n\nTL;DR Had to drive my sister to and from a party, had an appointed time that they overstayed, did not clarify when they started getting ready, which prompted me getting annoyed, and telling my displeasure when she questioned it.

      "description": "My girlfriend works out and diets, she has been trying very hard to lose weight, and I sincerely admire how much effort she puts forth, but she eats throughout the day and doesn't account for the calories eaten as snacks. Her weight loss has stagnated for the past 6-8 months. She hasn't gained any weight, though.\n\nShe has a calorie counter, and she strictly adheres to a 1500 calorie diet every day. But once I calculated how much she was eating as snacks/soda, and it was almost an extra 1000 calories. I told her that, and I think she was just having a really bad day because she started crying and said that she was fat, that she's ugly and so on (she's only a little overweight, and a very beautiful woman). \n\nAnyway, she keeps drinking soda and wine, and eating in between meals, and then she keeps getting frustrated that she's not losing weight. When she does, sometimes I'll bring this up. She started getting mad at me when I talk about it. \n\nI just think that if she accounted for the calories that she's eating between meals, she would see that she's not eating as healthy as she thinks. \n\nI'm wondering if I'm being an asshole by bringing it up when she gets frustrated, and I think I need an outsider's perspective.

      "description": "I started dating a friend of mine about a year and a half ago. Before we even started dating we were talking a lot about pretty much everything, and sexual preference, desires, and fantasies was part of it. I had told him that I cannot get off via penetration alone and that I used toys. I also told him that I'm not really into kissing or romance, but sometimes it's good, all depends on the mood. Anyways he started to develop feelings for me, and we ended up getting together. Our sex life was ok in the beginning because I was under the assumption that he was nervous. After a few months I brought up the idea of getting some toys for the bedroom ( I threw mine away because I had used them with a previous partner and I don't think that's hygienic to keep them). He said no, and that I couldn't have any for myself because \"he is there, and always willing to have sex\" and that \"he can satisfy my needs\" this was partially true. He was also complaining about the lack of sex we were having around that time because my sex drive was low. This was due to moving houses, moving colleges, a college strike, and also because I wasn't excited about having sex with him because I was NEVER getting off. At this point I was giving him blowjobs once in a while and he did try to reciprocate, but to be honest he was AWFUL at it. Also to add the sex wasn't even good. Like it's always the same, and I can't really get on top and make it exciting because his dick isn't big enough, it always falls out (I like his size, it feels good for me, but on top is like a constant battle)\n\nSo another month goes by and he is losing his shit on me about the lack of sex we are having. I didn't know what to say because I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I said hey maybe we could get some toys or something and spice it up again, and he basically says that I don't need toys because he is there, and I'm the one not initiating, or not having sex with him. \n\nSo this is where I told him the truth. I told him that I do want sex it's just that I'm not satisfied with the sex we have. I told him I never get off and it's not exciting for me. I told him that the toys help to get me off after he does or before. I told him maybe more foreplay is where we need to focus to make it enjoyable for both of us. I could tell he was hurt by everything, but he said ok and that he was willing to try. This was about 6 or 7 months ago. We have had sex like 3 times since then, and I am extremely frustrated. None of those times I got off either.\n\nSo I bring it up last night asking him why he doesn't want to have sex? We were already arguing about something else anyways, and he says angrily \"I have been with A LOT of women and none of them had any sexual problems, you make me feel so inadequate\" i asked him how and he said that I have this ability to make people feel like shit unconsciously. \n\nAm I the asshole here? Like should I have just had boring, unsatisfying sex to make him feel better? ",

      "description": "My wife and I were out at a casino with her mother, aunt and uncle.  I sat down at a slot machine after dinner and put a few hundred dollars in and was just casually tapping max bets. Everyone was just huddled behind me watching and chatting or whatever.  \n\nI turned to my wife and said “hit the button for good luck.”  She hit it, no win (or nothing worth remembering) and just kind of rotated through all spectators, just hitting the button.  Her mother always makes some funny psuedo-ritualistic hand wave before tapping it, it’s playful.  \n\nWell her uncle hit it and it hit for a few hundred dollars, we all cheered and I cashed out.  Thinking nothing of it I was walking to the cashier and her aunt said to her uncle “what are you going to do with the money?”  I instantly halted and said “What?”  —keep in mind it’s all my money invested— and everyone said, well he hit the button, it’s his winnings “right?”  I said, I was just letting people hit it since they were idling.  Things got very awkward and no one seemed to agree with me and they had a hard time, actually an impossible time, rationalizing my reasoning. \n\nI paid him like 20% of the winnings for general purpose.  Still incongruent to their wishes but whatever.  \n\nAITA here?",

      "description": "My ex and I have a son, who is 10. About 2 years ago, my wife started going from doctor to doctor complaining about some symptom or another that my son was showing. It got to the point that certain doctors refused to see her. I never witnessed any of the symptoms, but I was never really home as I was working full time plus overtime and usually got home after my son was asleep.\n\nHowever, my wife’s insistence that something was wrong with our son in spite of the fact that every doctor was telling her it was nothing absolutely tanked our marriage and I left her. The court allowed her primary custody, but medical decisions had to go through me. I also called CPS on her to make sure she wasn’t continuing on with the doctor shopping. CPS closed the case, so I thought it was done with.\n\nHowever, my son recently broke his arm, and when the hospital did the xrays and such, they noticed some issues and started asking him questions, which resulted in a specialist coming in, and my son was diagnosed with a very uncommon disease that explained all the symptoms that my wife had claimed he had the years before. I was there for all of this, so I know my ex didn’t do anything to influence the diagnosis. In fact, she refused to go into the hospital room at all and made me do it instead.\n\nWhen they told us the diagnosis, I could tell my ex was feeling smug. I didn’t say anything in front of our son, but when he went into the bathroom, I told her she wasn’t getting an apology from me. She laughed in my face and left me feeling even more pissed, but I’m not going to pursue it for my sons sake. AITA in all this?",

      "description": "So I was chatting with her last night and she sent me a picture of something she had drawn. She had said in previous pictures that she couldn't quite get the eyes right. So I said that her current drawing has improved and the facial placements look better. In response she said I was being rude and that saying that she was getting much better was patronising because she didn't ask for an opinion and it makes it sound like she's not very good. She said she gets a bit touchy about her art and regretted not pursuing a career on it. And when people criticise it, she doesn't need it.\n\nI apologised for if it came off as negative as it wasn't what was intended, but thinking back on it, is it really my problem if someone is touchy about something? And especially if she criticised her own drawings to begin with. I don't know, I just think it was uncalled for and she made the worst assumption. She did say afterwards that it's hard to interpret what messages mean but I'm sure that could be taken the wrong way in person.\n\nThoughts?",

I said I didn’t know because they had already approved my time off for Friday. My sister happens to work where I work and we both work in the kitchen. My sister overheard the conversation and told my boss that’d she’d be able to cover my shift, the only thing was she had an appointment that morning she would have to leave for then come back later. My boss said that was okay. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, saw my sister at work again. Reminded her about Friday and she said “I don’t work Fridays”. I’m confused at this point and recite what she had told me and my boss last week. She then said she never said any of that and that she wouldn’t be working. I’ve exhausted all my other options of coverage. No one can cover me. I feel like I’m going crazy because my boss also clearly remembers her saying she’d cover for me. \n\nAITA for being upset with her?\n\nI don’t mind working on my birthday but it just bums me out since I had already asked for this day off three months in advance.

      "description": "I saw a post here recently and was discussing with a group of friends. The title is a bit misleading in that I said \"I wouldn't date a girl who doesn't regularly give me head\" (i.e. I would never pressure a girl into giving regular head, but I would only make a girl who gives regular head my girlfriend). I said this because it comes down to a matter of respect/selflessness. Whenever I'm in a relationship, I regularly go down on the girl (even though I technically don't get physical satisfaction) and would only be in a relationship with a girl who does the same. When I said this, someone called me misogynistic. I tried explaining that I never force anyone, would reciprocate and it's my choice who I want to date, but they still called me an asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit AITA?",

      "description": "Ok, so that title is a little misleading, but there will be a tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nThere are four people in the story, we’ll call them Johnny, Brett, Sam, and me. Johnny and Brett didn’t do anything too serious, but they do have a roll in the story. Sam is the one who was recording me.\n\nThe story begins with the four of us playing video games together. Like, a lot. We played almost everyday, and I thought my information was secure with them. Turns out, it wasn’t. Sam was saving every single bit of audio we had together and showing it to people. He even said that he was uploading it, which he later said was a joke, but I think that was just damage repair. So he was invading my privacy as far as I see it, but he sees it differently. Anyways, I blocked communication with him and didn’t speak with him for a year or two. Johnny and Brett pressured me to get over it and become friends with him, despite my anger. I eventually had to cut them all off because the constant peer pressure from Johnny and Brett and the verbal insults that started coming from Sam (I insulted him back when he did this, but he ended up crying once, so I thought it best to just stop all communication). Today I had to get a paper from him because we were put into a group in class, and he brought up the situation in a sort of “remember the time? That was so funny!” Kind of way. I got the paper and left. So my question is, AITA for cutting someone off for recording me? Am I just being melodramatic?\n\nTl;dr: friend shows people our conversations and I stop speaking to him. I have to cut him and two others off because they pressured me to forgive him.",

I usually worked overnight so closing time and my first day S was there and she started making conversation about like if I had a girl if I was still in school you know small talk. I started to make remarks about she looked pretty because in all honesty she did she was in her early 30s 32 I believe well we had a good talk and we became friends. So the next day I was off and I get a random picture I was like who is this and i get a response it's S she tell me sorry she sent that to the wrong number so I was like ok it's cool then she starts talking to me about what days I work or what ever and I told her asked her the same thing so we start texting more often we the next day we close again together and she told me to get something out the freezer in the back as I am going she fallows me hugs me and kisses me I am very surprised at this development so I kiss her back then she smiles and says we have to go before somebody suspects something so we start talking to each other more outside of the job for about like 3 weeks and in the job she was like second in command so assistant manager to store manager. So any chance she got to close she would always put me on the schedule one day she told me if I wanted a ride home and I complied so we get by outside my house and start talking and stuff as I'm about to leave she grabs me and kisses me and you know she ends up giving me a blowjob so yeah you know I am happy motherfucker and all as more time passes we start doing this every time we close but only the first time I got felacio the next couple of times I get felacio and sex. Since she was the 2 in command I got away with alot of shit at work I could drink on the job smoke weed at night when lobby was closed I'm pretty sure I even did cocaine a couple of times, I start asking her about if she has a husband and she says yes and they have 3 kids together I am baffled by such revelation and ask her why she's doing this. She says that her husband treats her like garbage and he cheats on her and that I make her happy because I always send he flowers chocolates etc. So one day the husband goes to the job and as I was talking yo her he calls her over and he starts yelling at her for old what reason but I can feel his eyes on the back of my head he was angry but I had no idea why. Well things start escalating so we start going to hotels and going out for food and we both seem to be having a good time. \n\n\n\nWell a couple of days pass and I start seeing him more and more at work maybe he wanted to fix the relationship idk. Then one day we go to a hotel and he calls her and tells her he is outside well fuck. We both start to panic don't know why. So he comes and knocks thankfully by that time we are done with everything we were there to do so she goes out first and the guy is yelling at her till she gets in her car then s back and knocks on the door and keeps knocking so I call one of my friends who was also a manager there to come to the hotel lets call her A well she gets there comes in\n\nA: what's going on\n\nMe: he kind of caught us\n\nA: damm he looks really pissed of\n\nMe: ima tell him we were having a meeting about work hopefully he will buy it and that you are my gf \n\nA: OK \n\nSO the ex husband don't know what the deal is keeps knocking I go and answer the door\n\nHim: so you are her new bf?\n\nMe: no not really just having a meeting\n\nA:I'm his girlfriend he has been waiting for me\n\nHim: OK pushed door in starts frantically looking for something\n\n I didn't know at the time but he was probably looking for condoms I kind of never used condoms with his wife tho \n\nHe keeps looking but doesn't find anything pulls out phone I guess he was revising the whole conversation tells me he has been following us for the last couple of weeks says he is going to put it on Facebook then leaves\n\nAs I was very nervous I sigh tell A I'm very thankfull for what she did then she drops me home after a couple of weeks I quit my job while she goes on vacation with her family for a week I guess I was her little ceasers hot and ready never saw her again\n\nSO am I the asshole for having sexual relationships with a woman who was married and was probably pushing them farther apart?\n\n\nSorry my story is all over the place.",

      "description": "Dear Reddit \n\nFirstly I apologise if I make any mistakes in my post, as over here we use a few different languages with English being one of them. Also this is my first post here, need some advice badly.\n\nI’ve been raised by my real birth mom since young, and my entire memory of her is just being beaten and scolded throughout my childhood. She hasn’t worked a single day ever since I was born, my dad is the sole breadwinner of my family and therefore didn’t spend a lot of time at home. So my mom just spends most of the time at home doing household chores and complaining about the fact that no one cares about her. She is also an alcoholic with depression.\n\nI remember as a child I always woke up in tears as she would verbally and physically abuse me on a daily basis from the time I wake up till I leave the house for school or some other activity. She often called me useless and said things like she wished that I had never been born, etc. Because of all these, I have attempted suicide when I was 13. Other than being well supported by my father financially, I really don’t think I was raised with love and nurtured well as a child. But that’s fine by me, I told myself that once I am self-sufficient I will be able to move out and lead my own life.\n\nOn the other hand, I have a very caring Godmother (my dad’s older sister aka my aunt) who is single and has no children of her own. So she treated me like her own, bringing me on holidays with her, gave me extra money and gifts for special occasions. But the most important part wasn’t just all these, she supported my through my childhood giving me advice in life and whenever I faced problems. She was the one who guided me on the right path as she knew that I wasn’t receiving all of these from my parents. Thanks to her, I prioritised my studies and made it through university. \n\nFast forward to present day, I am a working adult in my late 20s. I have also gotten married and shifted out from my parent’s home. Naturally I don’t see my mom as much and conflicts have been significantly  reduced. Nonetheless, we try to get together as a family on special occasions like birthdays or Mother’s Day, etc. On those days that I do see her, she gives me regular shit as well. \n\nLately I realised that no matter what I do to make her happy, she doesn’t appreciate nor reciprocate. Do bear in mind that I have tried very hard to make amends and communicate with my mother to improve our relations and while I do admit that she does get better at times, every few months she lashes back out at me and makes me feel like any improvement she has tried to make are all fake and deep inside she still hates me. Every time such an episode happens it affects me on a very deep level and I get emotionally affected for days and weeks.\n\nNow I do not make any more effort to visit her, I intend to only meet up with my dad separately to pass allowances and continue to treat my godmom as my real mother. I introduce my godmom as my mom to outsiders because that’s how I genuinely feel and I am grateful for how she has raised me up to what I am today. Many people who do not know my story has pointed out that I should continue to try harder with my mom as afterall, she is my real mother. \n\nHowever, I feel that I no longer have any capacity to try harder. Whatever extra time or money I have, I would very much prefer to spend it on my godmother or my father instead. I’ve received a lot of backlash from other family members as I am an Asian where we prioritise things like filial piety and children are expected to be respectful of our elders. I am also a struggling young adult with limited finances, I cannot afford to give a large enough sum of money to everyone so I am forced to decide between my mom and my godmom, and I have chosen the latter. \n\nI have chosen this path as I am tired of this toxic relationship and all the negativity and emotional blackmail that ensue just from dealing with my mother. \n\nAm I the asshole? Or is there something else I can try to do in this situation? ",

      "description": "I(M26) is currently in a relationship with my gf (F40). We known each other for about 8 months and have started dating each other for about 1 month. Over the course of the 1 month, I have been waiting for her to end her work and sending her back home via public transport. (I usually wait about 1 to 1.5 hrs for her to end work as she have to work overtime and I will take about 1 hr and 15 mins to send her home and another 1 hr and 15 mins to go back my house). Other than doing stuff like this, I would also frequently called her at night. Sometimes, the phone conversation can be silly things such as \"What did you have for dinner &amp; stuff.\" \n\nHence, due to our work and countless phone conversation that we had. We often have very little time as we will sleep late and wake up early in the morning to go to work. \\[Regular weekdays are something like this: 7 A.M. \\~ 7 P.M. (Work + Travelling to work) 7 P.M. \\~ 10 P.M. (Dinner + Travel back home) 10 P.M. \\~ 12 to 1 A.M. (Phone Conversation) 1 A.M. \\~ 7 A.M. (Sleep)\\]  \n\n\nYesterday, when I was sending her back home. I asked her if she would like me to call her at night once again. She then replied with something along the lines \"What is there to talk about? Do you still have things to talk about? Don't waste my time\" Upon hearing the 3 words like \"Don't waste my time\". I immediately was very angry and wanted her to take back those words as I felt that those countless times/night that I spent talking to her over the phone with no real agenda was wasting her time from her PoV. I had always thought those phone conversations that I had with her was spending time with each other.  \n\n\nThen, she refused to take back those words as she told me that she already said them. I subsequently tried to ask her whether she only said those words because she is tired from work or whether I did something wrong that might had made her angry earliar on. She then told me that she might be tired from work. Later on, she also mentioned to me that she had no time to do her stuff (You can see from the second paragraph that due to the phone conversation, she hardly have time for herself). So being me, I wanted to give her more room/breathing space so I suggested to her that we do no meet on 01 Jan 2019 (It is a public holiday and we already pre-planned to meet on 01 Jan 2019 &amp; 30 Dec 2018(Weekends)\\] and to only meet on 30 Dec 2018. Upon hearing this, she immediately got very angry at me and said that I am acting like a boy and she can't be with a boy who likes to throw tantrum. So, we broke up.  \n\n\nQuestion: AITA for i) being angry at what she said ii) cancelling the pre-planned appointment with her?",

I am building their phone system and they are my main customer at the moment, so I decided to take some time off when they are also taking time off. I did this so the project won’t be pushed out and take longer. \n\nI decided to take a couple days off and mentioned it to my husband. I told him what I wanted to do, visit my brothers. I asked if he was ok with that and he said yes. I THEN asked my one brother if I could stay with him while I was in town. \n\nI am calling off work during a school week, so it would impact one of our kids. I asked my husband if he could man the fort. He said yes. I have asked him a couple more times if he is ok with me leaving him for a couple of days. He is a stay at home dad and doesn’t get a break from the kids very often. I try my best at giving him a break, but his job is 24/7 and has it waaaaay harder than me. I know this and respect him immensely. \n\n\nNow I feel like the asshole for taking time off of work and going to visit my family, see some friends, and go to a club night without him.  I’m also doing some work stuff and having lunch with some engineers that are in my market that I don’t see very often.

      "description": "Here's some context. For the last year and a half, we've lived 100 miles away from each other because I study in a different city from where he worked. Recently, he got a job in my city. His birthday is also coming up. So I threw him a party and invited my friends (because he doesn't yet have friends who live here). I am fairly extroverted, and he is super duper introverted. I'm fairly social, and he prefers to stay home and play video games. Every party I've ever thrown for whatever reason, he has enjoyed. One thing to note is that every year his family and I go out for his birthday; he doesn't have birthday parties. I thought it was because his friends lived far, etc. My city is a small college town, so definitely not the case here. It turns out that yesterday when I brought up the birthday party he said he doesn't really like parties and that he doesn't really care for birthday parties. He knew I was throwing a party, but he didn't know it was for him. I was really sad; I wish he had told me before I got all the party items. I feel like I should've asked him before planning the party, though; I feel like kind of the butthole for not having checked with him. He said he appreciates everything I do, that he appreciates that I give him the world, that he will love this party because I planned it, and that he will enjoy it as much as possible. He is the most amazing person in the world; there was just a disconnect in communication between us. AITA for not having talked to him prior to sending out the party invites?",

      "description": "I broke up with my girlfriend a couple years ago, but this has stuck with me ever since. She had Borderline Personality Disorder and was extremely resistant to treatment. I tried to help her as much as I could, but I felt like there wasn't a lot I could do when she refused to find a therapist or take medication. She helped me through a very dark time in my life and was the only one I could talk to when I was in a rocky relationship before we'd started dating. She could be very sweet and thoughtful, and she's the only person I've ever been in love with. I opened up to her about a past relationship where I think I was sexually abused (I'm still not sure). I was vague about it at first because I'd told some people before who didn't take it well. My girlfriend encouraged me to talk about it whenever I could and tried to help me reclaim my sexuality by acting out consensual rape fantasies and showing me rape scenes in movies, but I was a total bitch to her and kept telling her I didn't want to. Her demeanor changed when I finally opened up more and told her how old I was when that relationship started. I was eight and the other person was twelve. I asked if I could be his girlfriend, he said yes, and we did things like kiss and touch each other. I didn't know what sex was back then, but I liked it at first and still saw him all the time without telling my parents. Even when I thought I didn't like it anymore, I still touched him without him asking and never told him no. It went on until his family moved to another city a few years later. My girlfriend said since I started the relationship and he was still a child, I'd raped him. She said if I was being abused, I could have stopped it at any time, and I was the one who usually initiated sex anyway. I slapped her and left a bruise. She cried, and we only got worse from there. We stayed together for a few more weeks before I decided I was sick of her meltdowns and just left without trying to help her anymore. I basically ghosted her. I didn't know until this week, but she apparently tried to kill herself a few days after I left. I feel like I failed her as a partner and am trying to hide behind my own mental illness to excuse the abusive things I've done to other people. She needed my help and I just left her. I might have raped a child and acted like I was the victim. I feel like I need to go to the police. I'm so disgusted with myself.",

      "description": "In my school I am known to get high grades and because of this a lot of people I know will ask me for help if they don’t understand something.\n\nI am fine helping people as long as it isn’t distracting from my work because I don’t like having work looming over me and want to get it done as fast as possible. There are certain people that ask for a lot of help like sometimes every 10 minutes it’s another question or some times it ends up being a walkthrough of the entire worksheet.\n\nOne of those people is in every single class I have this year. In some classes such as computer science I am fine with it because he just looks at my code and copies it down (we are working in groups so not a big deal with the teacher either) but it is in certain classes where he is actively talking to me asking for help, and it is usually help as in answers more or less not understanding it.\n\nThis really annoys me in a class like bio because I just want to get the work done not explain what a thermostat does and I started trying to be like why don’t you do this on your own chrome book it would probably be better for both of us( pretty much everyone else in the class was doing it independently so it was not group work) he said no to that so I ended up moving to sit somewhere else.\n\nSo AITA for telling him I don’t really want to work with him.",

This makes them angry despite the fact that I didn’t say it in a condescending way or anything as I’m used to their short tempers, moody ness, and ganging up on me.\n\n Then I hold the bag as I eat exactly TWO pretzels as they all are grabbing the air at me.\n\nThis entire process of opening and eating two of MY pretzel too a maximum of about 10 seconds.\n\nOne of these people was already in a mood so fuels the others by throwing the bag back at me after someone else snatched the bag away from me (after a gruelling few seconds) and gave it to him.\n\nThey are all shouting and saying that I have a superiority complex as I was “withholding the bag from them to feel superior/ powerful”.\n\nI was just eating a pretzel and wouldn’t do that on purpose because I know what my family is like. I think they were just being impatient and were blaming it on me.\n\nI always do this and have never had anyone say anything about it. I’ll always take a few chips or whatever from my own bag and then offer them to others once I’ve finished chewing the few I have as I think it’s more polite than doing so with my mouth full and o think it’s my right to have the first bit.

      "description": "Throwaway account because I do really feel bad about this, and I wanted to seek out help from someone about any advice they can give, or maybe I am right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, (17M) am friends with an 18yr Female, who is autistic, and ADHD. While she's older then me, she acts a lot like she's closer to 13 then 18, and her friend group is majorly middle schoolers. She's far behind in my school, and will need to spend another year in school. Me, I'm almost done, and I only have one more class I need, so I am away for a majority of my day. Pretty sweet too. Anyways, I met her when she and I were freshmen, and after awhile we got along great. Then...and something I now regret...We dated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo me she was great. We'd sit on our emails throughout the day talking to each other about who-knows-what. Later we found we live near each other (She's about 1.5 miles from me, but there's a spot halfway from our houses we'd meet at.) Anyways, we'd talk for hours online. It was awesome to feel...taken. I felt like I had someone who was on my team. Then it took a turn for the worst. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI later started getting tired of talking to her. Our conversations were always superficial, about the weather, school, etc. I never felt like we really got to know each other. What's worse is she always wants to talk to me. Always. And it was always online. We almost never talked in person, but she still wanted me to visit the meet up spot constantly. If I didn't respond within a certain time frame she'd reach out to me on a different platform (We'd use hangouts, but if I didn't respond she'd ping me in texts.)  On a game I brought her into that's online, she'd ping me publicly just saying \"hi.\" She even started talking to my parents and my brother for some reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI later told her my feelings. Relationship 101 right? Communicate? Well, I wanted to tell her that I felt like we weren't as in common as we thought, and that there may be someone better for her. We decided we were better friends then couples. It sounded great, though in hindsight it wasn't wise of me. She talks to her friends constantly about me, and how I don't respond often. Keep in mind, I am a gamer, and I would play upwards of around 3 hours max on something. Anyways, now the ghosting began.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stopped liking the convos, and I felt that I can't sit there and every day have the same conversation day after day. They always revolved around how I was her hero, how I made her feel cared for, how her old school she was teased etc. I didn't like that, I even told her that too. Anyways, I muted her hangouts, so I'd only see it when I chose to look, but I still responded every now and again (Being about 1 or 2 hours). She started hitting me on texts, so I muted that too. Then she lost her phone at one point so she hit me up on her friends phone, now her friend talks to me about how I should talk to her. So I muted the friend. I told my friend that I didn't like how she was constantly talking about me, or how her friends started coming up to me during the school day telling me to talk to her. At this point, I feel that she almost worships me, and it's making me anxious. I don't know how to handle her. I tried treating her like I would anyone else, talking honestly and openly, but that didn't work. She almost ignores anything I say that isn't relevant to her mind. Everything for her is hard, she can't talk to me in person, she couldn't be any more then superficial in convos, her friends nag me often.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI almost feel stalked by her. Everything I do she remembers. I say something once, she remembers it a year or so later. I don't remember telling her my middle name, but she knew that. She started watching my activity in my augmented reality game and if I was at the meetup spot or near it she'd walk over to it. It's creepy, and when I brought it up to her, nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've gotten to the point where I don't want to deal with her, but I feel like I have to talk to her. She's still muted on my phone, and I'd ghost her for a week, day, or a few hours before responding, and most of my replies are \"Nice, alright, cool, right\" I feel horrible, because I have no idea what to do now, but I feel this is my only option...but it hurts badly. I do care for her, but I can't have her being this way to me. I get really anxious being around her, talking to her, or playing that game or being active in it's community anymore. I've practically abandoned anything that she's around in. I barely go to that park anymore fearing I'll run into her. Now I'm just hoping to move into college and from there she'll slowly get more distant before finding someone else who will care for her better then I have, but I'm even afraid to do that because I fear she'll follow me into my college.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole? I am genuinely saddened by my decision, but I feel that is my only other option. I've talked to her multiple times but she just doesn't get the picture.",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my friend when she wouldn’t do anything to help herself out of a mental health rut for several months?",
      "description": "So this girl and I (both 22F) had been best friends for 10 years  (grade school to junior year of college). She had some mental health issues in high school, got on medication, and stabilized. However, this past year she spiraled again and was texting me several times a day about how she feels lost, how she wants a boyfriend, and doesn’t think anyone will love her. I would always text her back telling her that it’ll happen when it’s supposed to (she’s a big believer in fate). She would get on tinder, hook up with a guy, and then feel worse about herself when he was mean to her and didn’t want to date her. \n\nThis was okay, until it wasn’t. This went on for months and I (with my own mental health issues) was starting to get more anxiety from her to the point where I didn’t want to hang out with her or talk to her. I tried giving her all the regular advice- go talk to a therapist, talk to your doctor and get different meds, so on. I offered to go with her but she always refused, blaming it on insurance or not feeling like it or not wanting to tell her parents. \n\nShe had lots of options and opportunities to do something to help herself, but she didn’t do anything. She had a full time job and went to school, so she had options for counseling. She just kept wallowing and spiraling and hooking up to the detriment of her mental health and lack of self-esteem. Eventually, I had so much anxiety about her that I didn’t want to look at my phone when it buzzed because I was worried it was from her. \n\nIt all came to a boil when some of my high school friends and I were hanging out in a group and she started bragging about all the sex she was having (and then freaking out about and texting me that she was pregnant) to the rest of our friends, all of whom haven’t had sex yet and didn’t want to listen to her keep talking about it. \n\nI texted her that night asking her to lay off the sex talk and she blew up at me, saying she was just bragging now (junior year of COLLEGE) because those girls made her feel uncomfortable in high school. This spiraled into more arguments because at this point, I was done with her. We fought and I gave her an ultimatum- do something to help yourself or I can’t keep doing this. She said I was blackmailing her and that these really were her problems and not mine (when she made them my problems for 9 months). She also wondered why I couldn’t just deal with this “one little bad side of her” when the rest of her was great. However, we never talked about anything other than her problems, and she never asked me about my life or anything.\n\nWe haven’t talked since, except for when she texted me a day late for my birthday. I don’t miss her and am happier without her right now, but I had a lot of guilt when it happened that I was abandoning her in her time of need. I just want to make sure I did the right thing, so AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not using my husband's native language more at home?",
      "description": "AITA for not using my husband's native language more at home?\n\nThrowaway account for anonymity.\n\n**TLDR:** Husband claims I don't use his native language enough at home and that excuses the mean things he says in English.\n\n**Background:** My husband is Italian, and I'm American. We met in college when he was an exchange student here and I was looking for a language partner to help me pass my Italian class. My grandparents were Italian and luckily I qualify for dual citizenship, so after graduating I moved to Italy to work and be with him. After 3 years we decided to get married and move to the US. This was about 8 years ago. \n\nMy Italian is conversational, but I'm not fluent. And of course having been out of the country so long, it's getting harder and harder for me to remember. I do try to keep up but it's different when you're not a student and not surrounded by the language every day.\n\nMy husband still struggles with his English, although his English is better than my Italian. He uses English at work, has a few Italian friends he sees once a week or so, and at home we speak a mix, but it's probably around 25% Italian, 75% English. Obviously with English being my native language I usually start with that when we talk, but I do try to start conversations in Italian if I'm confident enough in the subject matter. I also find that if we're speaking in Italian and my husband switches to English, I mirror him subconsciously and switch as well.\n\nOften when we argue, I find that my husband uses language as a sort of \"get out of jail free card.\" No matter what my complaint is, he just counters \"you don't use Italian enough,\" as though that gives him an excuse for whatever he's done or said. He'll often demand I speak in Italian when we're int he middle of arguing too, which makes me mad because I can't accurately express myself in Italian and I feel like it's some weird power play for him to try to get the upper hand. He says when I use Italian it \"softens\" my tone and he can be more sympathetic instead of defensive. \n\nToday we had an argument about something he often does. I don't think I was being overly rude, but I sighed frustratedly and said something along the lines of \"you always do this\" (and honestly, it was the kind of annoyance that if he had just playfully apologized I would have rolled my eyes and gotten over it quickly) and he countered back (in English) \"F\\*\\*\\* you.\"  I do not tolerate being sworn to like that, to me that's a below the belt insult and I don't care what we're discussing, you don't say that to someone you love. He eventually apologized for swearing, but said if I had approached him in Italian he wouldn't have sworn - \"I'm sorry for swearing, just Italian next time.\" I don't think that's a good excuse or even \"agreement\" for our argument because he shouldn't be resorting to swearing whether we're speaking in English or not! And it's not like I say \"F you\" to him when we fight and he's just repeating my use of the language back to me.\n\nI want to make it clear that I in no way expect him to just speak English because we're in the US. I love the Italian language, and want our future kids to grow up bilingual (despite both my grandparents being Italian they never spoke it at home to my dad and he regrets not learning it from them). And I want our home to be a lingual safe haven for my husband after a day of using his second language, because I know what it's like to have to work in a foreign language, it can fry your brain. I just really dislike that he only brings it up if we're arguing and I'm mad about something he's done. He never asks me when we're just sitting around having a normal conversation, it's ONLY when we both know I have a point about something he's done and he feels he's backed into a corner that he busts out the \"You don't use Italian, it's your fault!\" card. Also, I only ask him to use English to clarify something he's said in Italian that I don't understand, I never demand he speak to me in English. Even in Italy I never asked that of him. \n\nAlso, I have stated to him that I would have no problem moving back to Italy if he finds he doesn't like living in the US any more, and he says he never wants to move back. So there isn't a problem with that either. \n\nSo, AITA for not using Italian more at home? \n\nI'm on my lunch break at work, I won't be able to respond much to questions for a few hours but will try my best.

      "description": "I run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?",

      "description": "Here’s the background. My brother came to stay with me after graduating college. He has been looking for a job where I live because the job market is greater. I told him he had 3 months to find a job and to get started early with applications before he moved here, so that he can be getting interviews when his feet hit the ground here. Instead he did nothing and didn’t start applying until a week after moving here. \nHe has an engineering degree, so he thought it would be easy to get a job, but he didn’t take me seriously about how it takes companies time to go through apps and resumes. This isn’t like applying at Walmart or McDonald’s and getting hired in a week. So he basically came here with no plan. \nFast forward 9 weeks and my internet usage is through the roof. Additionally my electric bill is over $100 higher. This is because he does nothing but go to the gym and then comes back and plays videos games and watches TV for the other 15 hours a day. No joke something is streaming or running nonstop in my house. I asked him to tone it down and he just responded with “what else am I going to do? You convinced me to move here and told me there were jobs but there aren’t. This is on you.” That’s not exactly how it went down, but ok, I guess it’s my fault he did nothing to prepare himself. \nI have a background in IT and yesterday I decided I’d had enough when the second electric bill was over $150 pass my budget and I got an email about my internet use. See apparently he was torrenting stuff. The problem is, he doesn’t live in some small market municipality telecom area anymore. We have a corporate internet company that actually tracks that stuff and I received a warning on TWELVE incidents of possible copyright violations. All he had to do was vpn but he was too lazy for that. He has managed to gobble up 2 TB of data in 23 days. So i logged into my router and set a down time. Now internet traffic is only allowed when I am home. \nHis response was fury. I told him I couldn’t afford this stuff and if he gets himself a job and starts paying a portion of rent and the bills, I will absolutely remove it but until then I have to find a way to manage the expenses. When I got home he had decided to reset the router and set it back up so I wouldn’t have access to it. Today I took the router and modem to work with me. \nI have been pretty close and good friends with my brother for years but this has nearly ruined our relationship when all I wanted was to get him out of small town and see that there is more than wheat fields and cows. \nShould I take more responsibility in this situation? \n\nTLDR: tried to get brother out of small town USA to further his horizons. He repaid with not being prepared, running my bills up and being ungrateful, so I took the internet away.  ",

Her parents sent her to rehab twice already and she's promised countless times that she's gonna quit but she still hasn't. \n\nI constantly see her on social media, posting videos and photos of her drinking and, she even told me that she drinks a whole (medium-sized) bottle of rum or vodka in one sitting. I've tried to convince her to quit but, whenever I bring it up, she changes the topic or completely ignores me. Over the last few weeks, it's been getting worse; she drinks almost a whole bottle every day.

She said she told me all those things in private and expected me to keep them a secret from her parents. I did make a promise to her that I won't tell anyone about it but it scared me that she's drinking so much. After the call, she blocked me on all social media and isn't answering anyone's call.

      "description": "Happened about 2 months ago, but still bothers me how everything turned out: \n\nI'm an ER doctor who works occasionally at a pediatric ER locally. I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. ",

      "description": "I commute to and from work on public transit. One day an older  guy (in his 60s), I'll call him Gus, asked me for change for a pass. I didn't have change so I bought him a pass with my debit card. After that we chatted until I had to get off of the train. To my surprise the next time I saw Gus he gave me a beautifully handwritten thank you note for buying him that pass. We chatted until we had to part ways again. After that I'd run into Gus quite a bit on my way to or from work and we would always chat about stuff whenever we saw each other.\n\nAfter knowing Gus for a little over a year and having a lot of conversations with him he saw me one night on my way to work and flagged me down. I was walking to work when he saw me. We were not on the train. I stopped said hi and explained that I was late for work and I need to get there immediately, but Gus wasn't allowing me to leave that easily. He started asking me about my day and was trying to tell me about a drawing he's trying to sell (Gus lives on a fixed income has a gambling addiction and sells nicely handwritten notes and drawings to get by) I told him again that I'm late for work, I don't have time to chat and I need to get there ASAP and that if he wants he could meet me at the train station in the morning and shut down the conversation before he could really get one going. \n\nLast night on my way to work I bumped into Gus for the first time since that happened. Gus did not hesitate to tell me that I hurt his feelings. Gus told me he felt like I should have at least asked him how he was doing and took the time to look at his work. I feel bad about hurting his feelings, but I did not apologize for blowing him off that night because I would do it again and I don't think it is wrong to prioritize work over chatting with anyone. A rule of mine is to not apologize just because someone's feelings are hurt. Needless to say me and Gus are no longer on talking terms. \n\nTl;dr: Running late for work when an acquaintance tried to stop me to chit chat. I blew them off. The next time I saw them they expected an apology and I refused to give them one because I don't think I was wrong and I'd do it again.\n\nWas I the asshole in both situations, just one or in none of them?

      "description": "This happened last year.  I was in my car, in line at a drive up ATM.  As the car ahead of me was about to pull away from the ATM, this old man walked out in front of my car toward the *drive up* ATM and proceeded like he was about to use the ATM.  I gave a short honk on the horn and said “Excuse me, can you please use the ATM inside the bank?  I was waiting for this one.”  And then the guy tells me that he’ll only be a minute and turns to the ATM.  So I got on the horn a little more to get his attention again and told him that he was cutting in line and asked him again, a little more curtly, to use the inside ATM.  He still refused so then I laid into the horn until he walked out of my way.  But then he started yelling at me, telling me I should “Respect my elders” and spewing something about how he was an army veteran or something.  I have all the respect in the world for the elderly and veterans, but this particular bank, at the time of day we are talking about, has no fewer than 3 other ATMs inside for people to use, so I just don’t think there’s an legit excuse for cutting in line at the drive up ATM.

The police were involved and deemed I was not at fault. \nLuckily, This is what insurance is for and he has a deductible. Unfortunately, the insurance company totaled the car because the cost to fix was higher than the car was worth. \n\nThe car is 10 years old and doesn’t have a ton of mileage but was starting to not look aesthetically pleasing. I feel extremely upset and want to do everything in my power to make this better including all costs associated. \nHe was able to get about $7000 worth including my throw in the deductible. This is great because we could outright buy a used car that is in perfectly fine shape, at the dealership of his choice. His family has also offered to replace said used car with another vehicle they plan on selling soon, which is KBB (I know not as reliable anymore) valued at $11,000, for free. Before he was all for the plan. Now, he wants a brand new car that’s the same model because he doesn’t want to deal with anyone else having previously owned the car. \n\nA new car would be about $24,000. I have a credit score of 650 and I’m young, so interest rates for payments are going to be astronomical. I 100% cannot afford this on top of my car payment and all other life expenses, but I really want to make this better. Am I the asshole for not wanting him to get a new car? ",

Whole bunch of stuff gets backed up every week.\n\nDuring this time, the waitresses need to bring some of the dishes to the basement because they're only used on Fridays and won't be up til next Friday. This means that out of the giant pile of pots, pans, bowls and dishes, I've got to get certain ones done first while the waitresses badger me for them.\n\nOne Friday I'm working shorthanded (normally 2 dishwashers and a dryer, was 1 dishwasher 1 dryer) and closing time gets here. The dishes are more backed up than usual because the other guy isn't there to help me move along.\n\nI would think that gives me some leeway for not getting all the dishes done in a heartbeat. Rather the waitresses seem twice as pushy about getting them done. Whatever, I said, I'm working alone and they're just gonna have to wait. Well, one of the people who likes to yell at everyone else (im not sure her position, but i don't think it's my boss)  comes by and says that the trash needs to be taken to the dumpster.\n\nMy friend who was gone always told me never to say no to people at work, so I go and take the trash out, no big deal. When I come back, the dryer tells me that the waitresses were *very* upset that I took out the trash instead of rushing along with the dishes, even though they were right there when I was asked to. They didn't tell me they were upset, the dryer did.\n\nThe club stops serving at 7:30 and with my friend there the dishes that go down are usually done before 8. This took place at 7:45ish, I think. The waitresses have a record for doing the badgering thing according to every dishwasher who ever worked there.",

      "description": "So this happened last night and my ex is going around telling everyone I hurt her and I’m fuming, but I will try to be as objective as possible.\n\nA few months ago I ended things because I had just slowly realized I was not in love with her. She took it really hard and since the break up she has belittled me, said terrible things, trash talked me to other people, etc. I’ve mostly taken it because I know the breakup was much harder for her and I was just waiting for her pain/anger to subside. We are both in a really tight knit friend group of a few guys and girls (18-19yo) that hangout a lot. She has said many times she cannot be around me and she cannot be friends with me it’s just too hard. It’s obvious she’s having trouble, and I see that. However, whenever our friends hangout she is now extremely toxic towards me making passive aggressive comments and actively dampening the mood consistently.\n\nNow for the incident. We were all hanging out and drinking at our friends place, and my ex makes multiple passive aggressive comments towards me, one relating to our past sex life, and two just regular passive aggressiveness. At those point I’m completely fed up and I’m just trying to have fun but there’s just such a toxic vibe with her. Finally she makes one more comment and I break deciding to say something back along the lines of “this is really embarrassing for you right now to act like this in front of everyone, I know it’s because you have low self-esteem but come on”. Then she gets up from the couch we are sitting on, she walks over to me and starts shaking me by the shoulders saying “go fuck yourself” and “you have no right to say things like that about me”. I then take her shoulders too and move her away from me, only leaning forward from my seat, not getting up. Then she starts bawling saying I grabbed her really hard and there were red marks(there weren’t) and she’s scared of me and she needs to leave because I’m going to hurt her. So then the whole night is ruined because she’s crying and really upset, which is not all that uncommon for her to start crying and moping while we hang out. Now, as I said, she’s telling people that I hurt her when all I did was remove her from my personal vicinity, probably squeezing her shoulders pretty hard but not pushing or doing anything violent in my mind.\n\nNow most of my friends are on my side but others and her friends think that I was really aggressive and went too far. I just want to hear an outside opinion, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Necessary background:\n\nI am a 17 yo guy, my ex is a 17 yo girl. We were each others' first love, dated for 11 months, broke up April 2018. We were on and off friends because I felt weird being her friend (still had feelings for her) until December 2018. She told me she regretted dumping me, and i still had feelings for her, so we went on a date. After the movie she said she wanted to be official again, so we were. A few days later, she came over to my house and we hung out. the day after, she tells me she made a  mistake and we shouldn't be dating. \n\nThis really upset me, because I had been grieving about our breakup for months, and the one time I justifiably have hope, it gets shot down because she made a hasty decision.\n\nShe told me after this that it is probably best if I don't talk to her again. Luckily, that is exactly what I wanted. \n\nAt the end of december, a girl who is acquaintances/ friends with my ex messaged me confessing that she thought I was physically attractive. Mid way through december I started recognizing that she was attractive as well. We went on a date on new years to get to know each other. after a few more dates we were really comfortable with each other, and things have progressed smoothly since. around mid-january, one of my closest friends tells me he's developing feelings for my ex. He wanted to make sure it wouldn't hurt me if something were to happen. i commended him for his transparency and said it was perfectly fine, although I would be careful and take things slowly considering what happened between her and I in early december.\n\nA few days later, my ex tells me we need to talk. she calls me and we talk for roughly 40 mins about how she wants me to be friends/ on good terms with her. I tell her that's not going to happen after what she did. Being involved with her since the first breakup has done nothing but bring drama into my life. she keeps pushing and eventually asks why I don't want to be friends with her (since me telling her that having her out of my life makes things much easier wasn't enough), and I tell her I don't care about her anymore. \n\n5 minutes of awkward silence, and we say goodbye. \n\nSince then, every time I'm near her with my current gf, she makes rude gestures. I was walking with my gf in school and she covered her face from me. Yesterday when I was driving to my house with my gf (when she was walking with my close friend) she rolled her eyes at us.\n\nThe reason I find this so confusing is for 3 reasons. 1. She dumped ME. Twice. Now she's salty that I'm dating someone she associates with. 2. She literally tried to set me up with one of her other friends in the fall. Didn't progress because I wasn't feeling anything toward her. 3. She always told me, even after the second breakup \"I just want you to be happy\". Her actions show me she doesn't give a single shit about my happiness. 4. She's dating one of my closest friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that being said, am I in the wrong for telling my ex I don't care about her anymore, and dating someone who's associated with her?",

      "description": "Currently, I'm in grade 11 and (in my country) Summer season has rolled around, the school year is ending, and for many in my grade that means its time to enroll in summer school/start studying for College Entrance Tests. Many summer schools and review centers offer group discounts, where if you enroll in a group you get a certain number off the tuition price. The good review centers are pretty pricey, but this certain center I found (that has good rep) offered a FAT discount if you enrolled in a group of 3. Quickly I rounded up 2 of my good friends (let's call em A and B for convenience) and they were both willing, until I told friend A that friend B was the third group member. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, friend A and B had gotten into a fight because, from what I gather from both of them, A feels like B isn't interested in what she has to say, but I have hung out with A and B together this entire year and B just acts like how she always has? So I don't understand the problem. I still wanted to push through with the group enrollment because it was a very big discount for high quality tutoring, and if they wanted to they could go to separate branches, or if A was insistent me and B would just find another third and she'd do her own thing. A was pretty stubborn though and wanted to still be in the group with me, just without B. I couldn't do that b/c B is still my friend at the end of the day, especially since B had no problem + could care less about A despite their fight. \n\nI told A plain and simple, 'I don't care about what petty drama you have with B, this is about my future and yours too. Either you settle it, or we'll just find someone else.' I sent this to her on Messenger, she saw the message but still has yet to reply. Just felt frustrated b/c for me I prioritise studies always over anything else (here we have a saying *Acads bago lakads/studies before outings*) especially since I'll be preparing for college this same time next year. I feel bad b/c maybe I was too harsh, or maybe I should've asked for more details about the situation. AITA? ",

      "description": "A couple of days ago my 96 year old upstairs neighbor passed away. His heart suddenly stopped and he collapsed. \nHis carer called me because she knew I was the only one there who was CPR certified (even though I had never performed it on a human being).\nI did CPR, even tho I knew it wouldn't work because he was so old and quite a few minutes had passed between the moment his heart stopped and when I got there and started with the chest compressions, so his chances of surviving were extremely low. However, his relatives did not think about opting for a \"do not resuscitate order\".\nAfter a few minutes of doing CPR, the ambulance came and the paramedics took over.\nAs expected, he was soon declared dead.\nThe funeral is in an hour and my mom just assumed I was going to go. \n\nThis morning I told her that I wasn't planning on going because I don't really like funerals in general, and I also know it's going to be super crowded because everyone knew him (there's going to be a choir and everything). \nI also don't like the idea of seeing the casket. \nIt just brings me back to me cracking his ribs, knowing that he was dead but not being able to stop because unless a doctor declares a person dead, you have to keep going (at least in my country) and I don't really feel like it. \nMy mom told me that I was a bitch for not going and that it was disrespectful.\nNow, I understand why she would say that but if I don't feel like going, why do I have to be forced to go? I'd put aside my hate for funerals if it was about a close relative or a friend, but even tho I have known this neighbor for many years, I wasn't personally that close to him.\nSorry for the long post.

      "description": "Hey there everyone, I'm a first time poster and I only made this account today. I love reddit and have been lurking fr a while lol. \n\nThis is something that has been eating away at me for a while. I really want to know if I am actually the asshole because this altercation ended my friendship and if I'm truly in the wrong  want to make amends if I can. This is going to be a relatively long story because I feel that the context of the situation and our relationship as best friends needs to be explained.\n\nSo this all went down last year whilst i was 17 (ill be 18 in two weeks). I was in my second last year of High School and I decided to leave early because I was going to do this early entry program for uni. long story short, I had to do two subjects online and if I got a credit average I would be enrolled as an internal student. Essentially I wouldn't have to suffer through the end of High School exams and I would start uni a year early, if I was successful.\n\nMy best friend at the time was 19 (twenty later in the year) and we had been friends in High School. At the start of the year she had some really bad family issues so she ended up moving in with me and my family rent free. She was struggling badly with depression and anxiety and throughout her sixth month stay with us, I took care of her. I myself have struggled with a similar situation so I really understand how mental illness can take a toll on every aspect of someones life. \n\nI don't want to sound like an asshole but it was really really difficult to look after her. I was working part time and preparing for uni so I didn't have a lot of free time and the time I had, I devoted to making sure she was ok. I went grocery shopping for her, took her to doctors appointments and cleaned up after her. I didn't mind doing it at all because I thought that when I was in a time of need she would do the same.\n\nFast forward to August and my bestie is leaving on a trip overseas for five months. She ends up reconciling with her family a couple of weeks before she goes and moves back in with them. I was really happy for her and saw her off when she left the country.\n\nA couple of months later I'm in the full swing of my uni work and its really enjoyable but it is challenging at times. Near the end of the semester I have my two major assignments due within a week of each other. Ooft. I was really stressing so I decided to go on a social media black out to help me focus and also relieve some stress.\n\nThroughout the couple of months that my best friend was overseas, she would constantly message and called me at really inappropriate times. I'm talking like 3 am. I'm generally asleep or trying to sleep at that time lol. I didn't mind too much when the uni work wasn't as full on but when it got to the critical point I had to just delete everything off my phone.\n\nSo I'm off social media for a little while (no longer than three weeks max) and I feel really guilty for not talking to my friends. Please be mindful I wasn't \"ignoring\" my best friend alone. I didn't speak to anyone outside my immediate family and one friend who was helping me with some work because she had done the subject the previous year. Once one of my assignments is out of the way I decide to reinstall Snapchat and Facebook messenger to contact all my mates and let them know that I wasn't dead just stressed as hell. \n\nI open my Snapchat and I see one of the most disgusting abusive messages I have ever received. It was from my best friend. It was a decent sized paragraph just full on abusing me for not responding to her, calling me selfish, a bitch, a bad friend ect. She had never spoken to me with such disgusting words in the entirety of our friendship and  was so shocked.     \n I took a screenshot and decided I should confront her about it.\n\nThe next day after I had slept on what I decided to say, I sent her a message on Facebook just saying that I was really disgusted with her choice of words and appalled that she would even think to speak to me that way. We then get into a massive fight about me not responding to her and I did apologise to her by saying that it wasn't my intention to make her upset,  I was just putting my studies and mental well being first. I was called a selfish asshole in response.\n\nI didn't intentionally not message her to spite her or anything like that. I cannot stress this enough, if I didn't get the marks that I needed, it would be significantly harder to go to uni, so a lot was riding on my doing well and she knew this very well. I  genuinely feel bad that I made her so upset over this but in my mind I thought she would just be overseas and enjoying her holiday and wouldn't focus too much on me. Keep in mind that we did talk quite a bit and she knew how much stress I was under and how much pressure I was putting on myself to do well. \n\nI have kept this story as close to the truth as possible. I can't remember word for word everything we said to each other during the fight but I did try to keep it as civil as possible. I asked her if we could just park this conversation because it was starting to get nasty and I needed to study. She sent me about fifteen more long winded abusive paragraphs, which I just read and didn't respond to.\n\nI went back to my uni work and didn't revisit her messages until after I had finished uni. Despite that hiccup I did really well (distinction and a pass) and I'll be attending uni as an internal student this year!\n\nAfter I get my marks and everything is ok, I go to revisit those messages. I come to find that shes blocked me on every social media I have. When she gets home, I find out through a mutual friend that shes been telling all these mutual friends she doesn't understand why I've stopped talking to her and shes just waiting for me to message her.\n\nI just feel really betrayed. She was my best friend and I just cant believe our friendship ended over a disagreement like this. I put my heart and soul into that friendship because when people are going through shit, as a friend I believe you need to step up to the plate and help them out. There is nothing in the world that I wouldn't do to help the people I love. \n\nI'm so cut up about this and I really need to know if I was being the asshole because I don't want to throw this friendship away over this fight, but I don't want to apologise if I'm not in the wrong. Was she justified in her actions? Was I in mine? I really need some outside opinions from people who aren't in my circle, because I don't want my friends to just blindly agree with me because of our relationship. \n\nThanks in advance,\n\nSwedishFish18818\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Background: \nI am 17 and do not have my license yet because of personal obstacles, so I ride my school's bus. I go to a private school and the bus driver drops us off at churches in our neighborhood. I live really close to my church (1 minute drive) so my driver drops me off at my house. Its in a neighborhood filled with nuclear families.\n\nNow to the AITA:\nNow my house is across the street from this family with 5 kids. Recently K1 has been outside and waving at me when I get dropped off. He likes automobiles so its pretty normal right. Well... when the bus moves, the kid moves. He started racing the bus and waving at it which is okay I guess, but he started another thing. He runs to the edge of the street/his driveway. My driver honks at him and it always scares me to death.\n\nLiterally like 10 minutes ago, he did this and I yelled over for him to stay on the sidewalk. I entered my house and out of worry I looked out of my window. K1 and K2 were playing, but K1 was being really mean and hitting the other. I got nervous, but then the OB came out and separated them. I was relieved, but then the kids went INTO THE STREET. My motherly instincts came out and I panicked because the OB didn't know. K2 was in the middle of the street while K1 was down a whole other street way. OB finally saw what happened and got them into the driveway. I walked out and I waved him over. He looked maybe 13 or 14 and he looked odded out.\nMe: Hey K1 was almost out on the street when my bus was driving away and i just want to make sure he is okay. Could you make sure he doesn't go in the street.\nOB: ok\nHe then looks at me weird and walks into his driveway with his brothers.\nI feel weird cause idk if the father might go to my house and yell at me or something. I think I did the right thing, but I'm not sure OB thinks so.\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "My boyfriend has this friend (that we’ll call C) who is actually his cousin due to marriage. (His uncle married her mom.) My boyfriend and C met before that and have known each other for 4 years now. I guess he doesn’t even consider her a friend because he openly admits that she’s not the best person, but she considers him her best friend. \n\nFast forward where she is always asking him to hangout and sends him drunk “I miss you” texts and tells him “I love you” all of the time. I feel like she’s crossing the line. \n\nJust tonight, C asked him if he wanted to go for a drive as hangout because she was “bored out of her mind” and he declined. He replied saying, “I don’t have any gas money, but ask u/shxrpie. I’m sure she wants to get out of the house anyway.” She simply said, “I could.” \n\nHim and I both wait for C to message me for about 20 minutes until I decide to message her saying, “I heard I was offered up to hangout with you. Let me know, and I’ll come pick you up.” Nothing. It’s been an hour and she hasn’t replied.\n\nThis isn’t the first time this has happened. She has declined me numerous times, saying she was busy everyday, but proceeds to ask him to go out the next day. He declines every time. I figured I’d try to befriend her because she hangs around my boyfriend, and I need more friends anyway. \n\nBasically, AITA for asking my boyfriend to ignore her like she does to me?\n\nThere has been a few other times as well where she has treated me like garbage. I don’t ever want to be labeled as the bitchy girlfriend, but she has definitely pushed my boundaries more than once. He doesn’t have many people to talk to, so he keeps her around because he’s able to talk about movies and TV shows with her since I don’t really watch anything. I don’t want to be controlling, and I don’t want it to seem like I’m being controlling. I just really don’t like how she treats me compared to him. \n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend has a friend/cousin who chooses to ignore me, so I asked my boyfriend to ignore her back. AITA? \n\n",

      "description": "I'm friends with this girl from high school. She's a high school senior (18 y/o), I'm a freshman in college. I have a genetic, terminal lung disease, so seeing people Juul/smoke frequently is frustrating to me because I feel like they're \"taking their lungs for granted\". (I also understand that addiction is an uncontrollable disease and I make a lot of effort to be sympathetic - but I want to acknowledge my inherent biases and say that I have an unpleasant knee-jerk reaction to smokers/vapers because of my own genetic lung problems.)\n\nAfter I left for college, a friend of mine got addicted to Juuling, drinking, weed; all sorts of substances. We were in a group chat with 7 other people, and after I graduated, the chat stopped being active. The only thing sent to it were what we named \"party updates\": videos of her being blackout drunk, smoking weed, vaping, etc. She also sent stories about how she blacked out (from alcohol) in the bathtub, wandered around drunk and alone outdoors in the middle of the night, etc. This would go on for hours every Friday and Saturday night. \n\nI care a lot about this friend. We used to be really close, so seeing that twice a week was always really hard to watch. It was stressful and emotionally draining to me. These messages started in September so it's been happening for 5 months.\n\nI confronted her about it a few times: the first time really gently: \"Hey, I'm worried about you and your health\", and then again: \"Listen, I'm really worried about you and I think you need to get help.\" Other friends in the chat even brought it up, but whenever someone mentioned it she got defensive, mean, and borderline verbally abusive. At the beginning she was responsive and said that she knew it was a problem, but didn't want to stop for \\_\\_ weeks/months. If someone limited their interactions with her because they couldn't stand seeing her like that, she would talk shit about them behind their backs and vague-post about them. \n\nTonight she posted another video of her vaping and being blackout drunk in the chat, so I left. Another friend that's also frustrated talked to me about it beforehand, so he left the chat right after me. Half the people in the chat agree with me and are considering leaving themselves, and the other half are telling me that I'm abandoning her and it'll push her to make even worse decisions. I'm not sure whether or not I'll keep talking to her outside of the group chat; I probably will though, because she's never sent me videos/chats of her abusing substances outside of the chat. \n\n I just didn't want to enable her anymore, and it was too upsetting to me to deal with after 5 months of this. But now I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong because a lot of my friends are angry with me for \"abandoning\" her. So, Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "\nSo a few months ago in school, we were having a study period class. I was sitting next to my friends (we are all boys) and the girls sat next to their friends (also girls). We all started talking to eachother.\n\nFew minutes later, a supervisor came into the classroom, saw us sitting together and decided to separate us, but not the girls, for talking too much. Mind you, we weren't talking a lot at all, nor were we loud.\n\nMe and a few other people got upset and started questioning why we got moved and not the girls. They were as talkative and as loud as we were. The supervisor started shushing us and left the room for a while. In that time period, the boys started arguing with the girls about how unfair this situation was.\n\nThe girls told us that they weren't as loud as we were and told us to just deal with it. This is when I started to get REALLY mad and told one of the girls, who happened to be a feminist, the following:\n\n\"You're a FEMINIST, I thought you were supposed to fight for equality?\"\n\nA few boys agreed with me and the room went silent for a few seconds. The girl then stood up moved somewhere else. It was at this point when I felt like a total jerk.\n\nNow, we are in good terms and she is one of my friends. She has probably forgot about this but it still haunts me to this day. So, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Last night, I got back to my dorm from thanksgiving break and texted my roommate and another friend asking if they wanted to get pizza. One said she would only want any if I was paying, and I agreed because I was already planning on ordering and really wanted to hang out with them. I let her order it on my card because I needed a shower after traveling and didn’t want to wait to do so until the pizza was ordered. (It was snowing pretty hard so I didn’t want to go out for food, plus I was hoping we could all sit in our dorm and eat while watching the snow and talking.) When it got delivered, I found out that she got it half pepperoni and didn’t think to use our school discount that gets you a one topping pizza for $11. Once I open the box, my roommate grabs two slices and immediately leaves. My friend takes a slice and drags me to her friends room with the full knowledge that I have anxiety issues and the amount of noise happening in that room combined with my travel exhaustion was so much that I had to leave. She didn’t notice (she wasn’t even talking to me once we entered the room). I ended up spending $18 to eat three slices of pizza on the floor of my dorm room while watching a nature documentary alone.\n\nAITA for thinking they should have hung out with me? I feel like if someone buys you dinner, especially if you insist on not paying, there’s an understanding that they want to spend time with you.",

      "description": "So this happened a couple of years ago in college but it still bothers me today.\n\nI moved in the day before into the dorm room. It was just me and my mom so we had to make multiple trips and set everything up by ourselves. Needless to say, I did not want to do anything more with my part of the room. The next day, my roommate moves in. She has her mom, mom's bf, brother, sister, and sister's bf all helping her. While this is going on I am sitting on my bed with my ear buds in. Nobody asked me to help and I figured I would just be in the way as she already had an entourage. As I'm sitting, her mom takes a picture of me and laughs. After a while, they had mostly cleared out and my roommate had a couple of things to move with her mom and sister. They asked for my help and I got up and helped them. They made jokes about how I was finally helping. It bothered me but I figured whatever.\n\nLater, like, months later, I'm at her house for a party and in front of everyone her parents bring up how I never helped them move. Her mom's bf referred to me as the roommate who just laid in bed watching Netflix while they moved in. And the thing is, they always bring it up, every time I see them. The joke's a bit old by now. And her mom shows the picture of me on my bed.\n\nWas I the asshole for not helping while I had already moved all of my stuff? And at the end, when they did ask, I got up and helped. It just really bothers me 2 years later.",

      "description": "Throwaway, since my best friend follows my regular reddit and I haven't mentioned it to anyone I know yet.\n\nMy relationship with my partner is, to put it lightly, on the rocks. I can't trust him, he lies constantly to my face about innocuous things and, quite frankly, he treats me like crap when I do anything even slightly 'out of line' like me wanting time away, or tell him he's wrong. He's also been treating someone else, another girl, like the way he treated me at the start of the relationship, and I've been left to the sidelines. This isnt jealousy either - he sends paragraphs of sweet nothings to her, and bad mouths me in texts. It isn't openly declared 'romance', but it certainly isn't friendship.\n\nThe biggest one though, is that I can't trust him with my secrets. He's blabbed about some major ones in the past. \n\nI'm pregnant. 4 or 5 weeks, according to the doctor. Found out roughly 36 hours ago. My decision was always going to be to terminate, regardless of relationship status - we agreed that, if protection failed, that's what we would do. I guess, now I know - even condoms can fail sometimes. \n\nYay.\n\nI want out of the relationship. I feel suffocated, trapped. I can't trust this man with any secret, and this is a BIG one. I don't want him talking about it with other people behind my back, but it feels so wrong to keep this secret. Despite our troubles, he's still a good person and I want to do right by him.\n\nI have an appointment on Saturday, to terminate the pregnancy. I haven't told anyone else that I'm pregnant.\n\nReddit: WIBTA?",

It sucks, it ruins my day and l don’t want to risk injury over moving somebody else’s stuff. \n\nI always hire guys when I move now. I have helped several friends in the past and only requested help once when I was younger so it’s not like I’ve gotten help multiple times and don’t want to give back. I’m actually ahead (helped way more than I’ve been helped).\n\nMoney isn’t an issue either. We aren’t rich by any means but we can all afford a few hundred bucks for movers. \n\nBottom line, I don’t bother anyone when l move and I pay professionals, so why would I risk injury to help someone else save a few bucks while ruining my day in the process.

I looked at her pictures and I wasn't attracted to her, and didn't really want to start a conversation/reply to just a \"hey\" anyways, so I didn't respond.\n\nShe must have the paid subscription that allows you to see read receipts, because she sent another message that said \"sorry i'll leave you alone\" after I didn't respond.\n\nNow, I'm brand new to dating apps, but I know not responding, or even responding a couple times then going dark is very very common in this sort of thing. I didn't initially think that I had done anything wrong, but after I read that message I just felt like the biggest douchebag for not responding. Like, she put herself out there and contacted me, I read it (and she knew I read it), and just ignored her, mostly because I'm not attracted to her.

      "description": "So I met this girl from tinder a little over a month ago and we have hung out 3 times already being the last time on Valentine’s Day. We have fun together, the sex is great, and she’s pretty cool. Yesterday while browsing Facebook, I notice she’s friends with my ex on Facebook. \n\nFor a little context, my ex in insane. She beat her mom and sister before, dad in jail, physically abused me and caused me legal problems that I don’t take lightly at all. \n\nI confront her about it on Snapchat nicely with something like “hey kinda random lol but apparently your friends with my ex on Facebook, how do you know her?” And she says “oh I have so many people added I have to go through and delete I really have no idea about her”. Then I say “yeah well she caused me a lot of problems in the past so you can imagine how I was weirded out” and she says “well you don’t have to worry about that with me :)” and I haven’t responded to her since. first off I’m like ok, a lot of people randomly add bunch of people and have like 2000 friends. Personally, I don’t add anyone I don’t really know. That’s why my Facebook friends are like 150. \n\nI’m having trouble believing her and even a simple explanation of how she added my ex would have worked for me but she flat out denied she knew her. I can’t take this situation lightly because my ex has sent people in the past to fuck with me and other people and I don’t want anything to do with anyone she knows. \n\nI want to give the girl the benefit of the doubt but it’s just too fishy to me and my experiences in the past are telling me to nicely let her down and cut contact. But I don’t even know what to say to her to see if she’s telling the truth so I think I’ll just let it end and maybe ghost because if I knew she was friends with my ex on Facebook in the first place, I wouldn’t have invited her over. Would I be the asshole if I just ghosted her?",

      "description": "I'm 2 weeks away from being the asshole in someones eyes.\n\nMy brother [20] and I [22] lived with our parents up until the end of 2018. For 6 months it was understood that he and I needed to move out for very fair reasoning by our parents.\n\nDuring those 6 months he was encouraged to get a job and save up to afford moving out. He finally got a low paying part time job in december and didnt put in an effort to find a place to move into until January already started.\n\nDuring those 6 months, my company opened up a satelite branch in the city where my friend [40] lives and she now doesn't have to commute 3 hours total to get to the main branch. But now that shes at this satelite branch, she isnt making enough money to make ends meet (going back to the main office is not an option), so she found room mates that absolutely did not work out. They actually costed her more money than they provided.\n\nHer and I decided that I'll come up to the satelite branch and move in with her to help her make ends meet until she's put herself in a better position to where she doesnt need help any more, and I decided to let my brother learn how life works when you put 0 effort in.\n\nI've been in her house for 2 weeks now and i hate being here for multiple reasons: she has 6 undisciplined dogs always making noise in the night or making a mess. She has made 0 effort to put herself in a better position. Im paying $700 for this room that she can't convince her daughter to fully move her stuff out of.\n\nNow my brother is getting a third job and putting multiple housing applications in a day and nobody is getting back to him. He's putting in a ton of effort and is on his path to growing up, but he still needs help finding a place and learning what it's like being an adult. \n\nAm I an asshole to leave my friend and moving in with my brother?",

She says that because she's known M for as long as she has and that if they want to hang out and sleep in the same bed one time a year, I should be fine with it. I'm perfectly fine with them sharing a bed, but I feel pretty hurt that she should choose to share a bed with someone else and leave me to sleep alone in a room ten feet away. \nAITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway account \nTLDR; Was casually seeing/talking to this guy, after an awkward date I wasn’t really sure it was going to work. He saw me with another guy at a bar and got mad because I didn’t run over to him when he walked in. He has now threatened twice\n\nI went out one weekend for a friends birthday and this guy approached me, told me he thought I was gorgeous and offered to buy drinks. He was tall and handsome so I accepted the offer. We danced for the rest of the night and exchanged numbers and started talking. The next weekend, we meet up and he offered to buy drinks again.\n\nHe suggested a real date with one-on-one time outside of the bar. I’m currently in my last year of school and working full time, he’s in a similar position and we had some trouble finding a time that worked for the both of us.\n\nInstead of a normal date, we were just going to pick up food and hang at his place. He picks me up, we go get the food, and we get back to his place. Everythings great. I’m thinking we were going to hang out in the living room, but he tells me that we should go into his room because the tv in the living room doesnt have Netflix. I’m a little uncomfortable now, because I feel like he’s just going to try and get me into bed with him.\n\nI opted to sit in a chair instead of on the bed with him, because I wasn’t ready to take that step with him. Despite this he began kissing my hand while we were watching a movie. I basically froze, I didn’t feel safe and I started panicking. He started kissing my neck and I told him I needed to go home. I told him I needed to go home at least 3 times before he stopped kissing my neck and got up to take me home. \n\nHe asked if I was ok and I told him I was just tired and had an early morning. I didn’t want to make him feel bad, I felt like maybe I had given him the wrong idea by agreeing to having a date at his place.\n\nI ended up going out on a Friday, which isn’t normal for me because of how busy I am. I was out with a friend of mine and I met a different guy, super funny and very cute. Suddenly, I feel someone grab my shoulder and it’s the first guy. He leans over and says something like “so now you’re just going to pretend you don’t know me?”\n\nI got defensive, I told him I didn’t even see him. He walked away but when I left to go home, he was outside waiting. We argued, he rolled his eyes and I walked off. He asked my friend to add him on Facebook. He sent her a message threatening to “cause a scene” the next time he saw me if I didn’t give him what I “owe” him.\n\nI thought he meant sex, but he told a mutual friend that he wants me to pay him back for the drinks/food that he paid for. Next time he saw me, he approached me and told me to give him the money. I told him I didn’t owe him anything and to leave me alone. He started yelling at me and cussing me out, calling me a dirty cunt and I had to ask a bouncer for help getting him away from me. ",

I had everything planned out, including the recipe I was going to use. I called my mom who was on her lunch break to ask if she could get me some ingredients I needed on her way home. When she arrived, she showed me a recipe on her phone that she really wanted me to make, and I was pretty frustrated about this. I explained to her that I had already chosen a recipe and that I wanted to use a simple one, too. We ended up getting into a small argument over this, and she finally decided to let me make my cake and that she was going to bake hers when she got home from work. I reluctantly told her that I would bake her her cake once I finished mine, but she angrily told me not to and then left to work.

I share a front stoop, plus one unit on each of our sides, so 4 units split over a building. \n\nWe are allowed to have two dogs and my fiance wanted to rescue a couple pups. One from an abusive/more negligent owner(catahoula hound). The other was abandon with an ex who couldn't have pets at their residence. She was abusive and left her without food much of the time because she didnt take the time to potty train her(GSD). She is around 4 years old and barely 40 pounds. Her lack of nutrition caused growth stunting. \n\nNow my catahoula doesnt like other dogs. I'm guessing the owner threw out food for all the dogs and he had to fight for his food. We got him around 7 mo old. They had about 5 or 6 other farm dogs and her lack of ability to answer questions about his previous vet records was also a red flag. \n\nMy GSD doesn't like people. I've seen her go full police dog towards certain people. Guessing people that are similar to her previous owners, like my old man. She has back him into corners growling and snarling with teeth bared, ears flat, and hair up. \n\nI always leash them on fairly short leads and will take them up to the mail box occasionally to get mail. Neighbor across the street has two rottweilers they they leave tied up outside in afternoons when it's over 35 degrees. \n\nMy dogs will growl and bark at them and they growl and bark back. One day while checking the mail, neighbor walks out and across the street to talk to me. I pulled dogs behind me and held onto their collars while he asked if he could pet them. They weren't happy with him and I told him they were rescues and weren't super fond of people. He kept his distance as they growled and said that he would want to introduce our dogs sometime. Again I told him it wasnt a good idea and that they weren't fond of people or dogs. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and I'm checking the mail with both my puppers on leashes and all the sudden i see neighbors rottie running across the street. I think she got off her tie out and start pulling dogs back towards the door about 75 yards away.  \n\nThe rottie Closed the 20 yards before I could drag my dogs 10 feet. Neighbor shouted that he wants to try \"introducing\" the dogs from their yard. While slowly walking over.\n\n I almost immediately drop the leashes and let my dogs rip at his rottie while feigning to stop them. I grabbed their collars after maybe 30 seconds after they turned the rottie into a chew toy. \n\nHe finally grabbed her collar and pulled her back a ways after slowly walking across the street. \"Yeah I was hoping to avoid that by introducing them...\"\n\n\"Your dogs may be friendly, but mine arent.\" \n\nHe went back inside taking the one tied up inside also. He hasn't tried to talk to me since(about a year now). \n\n\nAITA for letting my dogs gang up on my neighbors dog for his poor excuse of \"introducing\" them? ",

      "description": "Our sex life as a whole is quite lackluster. It’s not that the “sex” itself is particularly bad, it’s just not what either of us would like it to be. For starters, we don’t have penetrative sex purely because I have issues with that, and my SO has a lot of sexual interests she is really keen on trying out but is not able to.\n\nShe is definitely making a lot of sacrifices as to what she wants when we have “sex,” and I’m trying to change that. However, it’s kind of demoralizing to hear about things that she fantasizes about that I am so far away from being able to fulfill. I know she enjoys talking about her fantasies, but I just don’t want to hear about them. It makes me feel insecure over how inadequate I am sexually.\n\nBeyond that, I can’t mutually share my fantasies; I don’t have many sexual fantasies in general, and really only one that is appropriate to share. However, it would be incredibly unfair for her to fulfill mine when I can’t reciprocate. \n\nThat’s my rationale for wanting to tell her that I don’t want to hear about her sexual fantasies. I don’t know how to phrase it, but for the purposes of judgement how about if I just straight up said “I don’t want to talk about your sexual fantasies because I feel that it is counterproductive to do so.”",

      "description": "Context: I really enjoy animated movies, even though I'm in my twenties. One of my favorite movies is The Book of Life, and I love sharing it with people (in general I love trying to share stuff that I love enjoyed with my friends and family. In case it's relevant, my brother is younger but also in his twenties.\n\nSo I'm talking with my brother and trying to convince him to watch this movie because I loved it so much, and he says Nah I don't wanna watch kid movies. And I try to explain that just because it's animated doesn't mean only kids can enjoy it (using Pixar as an example because he does still like Pixar stuff), and somehow it devolves into an argument with me saying that even if you dislike something you should watch it with me as a favor for me, because the intent is that I'm trying to share something that I love with you, and I've done many things with him that I don't or didn't enjoy just because it's something that he likes to do. I feel like that's part of any relationship, whether it's romantic or friendship or siblings, that there's some give and take (obviously I'm laying it on a little thick for my side of the argument but I want to explain my reasoning). His argument was simply that I shouldn't be trying to force him to do something that he knows he won't like.\n\nHonestly I can see the validity in both points of view, and I feel like it's a matter of circumstances/context about which argument holds more weight. Or maybe it's a situation where neither of us is really wrong and one of us just has to compromise. I'm not sure, so I'll ask you guys for your perspectives: AITA?",

      "description": "She’s technically not my mother in law but she is my SO’s mum, so I’m just going to call her MIL for simplicity. \n\nMIL and my SO don’t have the best relationship (I made a post in r/JustNoMIL if you want context, but it’s not really relevant here) but I’m trying to be civil as respectful around her. \n\nRecently MIL came up to my SO and demanded him to tell her whether I had bulimia or not. SO knows I don’t, nor do I have any other eating disorder, and tells her so. She got pushy and said that she knows I have bulimia - her evidence being that she found some of my hair in the toilet (???). My hair does fall out a normal amount, plus it’s quite dark and noticeable, but if she thinks it’s there because I’m purging, wouldn’t it be flushed away when I’m done?\n\nMy SO told me about all of this but said at least she had fair enough reason to be concerned, but I don’t really think she does. I’m slim but not super skinny, I never binge eat nor purge nor fast, plus I don’t really have any body issues. All those would be much bigger indicators of an eating disorder, but she was so confident I had one because of some hair? \n\nI’m honestly really mad at her but I can’t put my finger on why. I know I don’t have an eating disorder, and I know she’s probably just concerned, but something about it has really made me resentful about it. So, AITA?",

I recently wanted to commission something from her because she's damn good and she's been advertising. I tell her what I want, and she agrees to do it after we agree on a price. \n\n\nWe don't talk for a week or two until one day I decide to pop in to see how it was coming along. She says she hasn't started since I haven't paid her I apologized and mentioned off hand she should have said something since I was waiting for updates. She tells me I should have known to send the payment first because she doesn't want to be scammed.\n\nNow disclaimer I am 100% supportive of artists, and I know how often people try to steal and rip them off. I'm also 100% supportive of them making the call on when they get paid.\n\nBut the way she said what she said hurt me, a lot. I'm not asking for special treatment im 100% fine paying first but she acted like I had the potential to scam her and it really hurt. Again, I'm fine paying early, Im fine with her not starting just hurt by what she said. I tell her im pretty tapped this paycheck and Ill pay her in about a weak. She says \"I knew it\" and now I kinda don't want to comission her, I'm angry and hurt.\n\nAITA for wanting to no comission her now?\n\n(Disclaimer: we were really good friends, even leading up to this which is why it hurts)",

      "description": "My husband and I have an eight month old son, who has his first cold this weekend. My normally super easy baby was a little needier than normal- nothing terrible, just having a hard time going down for a nap/sleep and not wanting to be left alone for too long. \n\nThis also happens to be a weekend where I have a major project for work due on Monday. I really needed the whole weekend just to sit and focus. The deal was my husband was supposed to take on more of the parenting so that I could get my work done. Needless to say it did not go that way. \n\nSaturday I got up with the baby (after having been up with him the entire night), fed him, started cleaning up around the house, and attempted to lay down in his room but wasn’t able to . My husband got up four hours after me, and took the baby...so I could wash dishes. I realized the baby had a cold then and volunteered to run to the store to get needed supplies. My husband asked if I was taking the baby with me, but I told him it didn’t make sense because I was just going to one store. I ended up picking up lunch on the way home to treat my husband. \n\nI got home and my husband was pissed off because the baby ‘wouldn’t stop’ the whole time I was out. He was fussy, but not screaming. I made and fed him a bottle while my husband ate lunch. He was happier after he ate until he remembered he had volunteered to take the baby to run errands so I could have a few uninterrupted hours to work. I got about two hours of work before he came stomping in, pissed off again and muttering about how his ‘day just keeps getting better.’ I put groceries away, fed the baby dinner, got him in for his bath, and tried to put him to bed. This is his first cold so he was being very difficult and I ended up having to rock him to sleep in his stroller. The whole time my husband was pissy the baby wasn’t going to sleep as easily as he normally does and that his one attempt at soothing him didn’t put him right to sleep. He was also pissed because he bounced the baby right after he ate and he spit up on him. He just kept muttering. \n\nI finally sat down to do work at almost 11 to find my laptop was dead. I plugged it in, sat down on the couch, and nodded off. I woke up a few times to soothe the baby, and now it’s 6 AM and he’s up for the day, already fed and changed (by me) and playing. I’m about to get back to work but I feel so annoyed with my husband. \n\nI always have work to do at home, plus most days I’m the only one to take care of the baby. He always asks if I want his help with the baby but I usually say no because he always acts so put upon when I say yes. He works a lot but I take care of everything else so that he doesn’t have to do anything but I just needed this weekend to work. \n\nSo now I’m pissed off and probably won’t finish my work (which is going to royally fuck me over).

This other friend of her's has some TERRIBLE tattoo choices that I cannot comprehend, Such as a pirate hello kitty on his ass because he lost a bet, Along with some other LOW quality artwork. But that is not my body, Nor one I see on the regular so to each their own. \n\nTo be clear I am NOT against her getting a tattoo, But I feel you should really plan on what your tattoo will be\\represent for the rest of your life, Especially in a place as obvious as your forearm. My main issue is that she seems to jump from tattoo too tattoo saying she wants one, but will regret it in the future.",

      "description": "I’m 21M and my gf is 21 also. She was raised by abusive parents who stole from her and verbally abused her for her mental illnesses. They are also anti-vaxxers and are extremely conservative and religious people. They sent her to a Christian private school where she was force fed a lot of racist, homophobic, and sexist propaganda. On top of all that, my gf was a competitive gymnast and her coaches led her to believe that she was fat and disgusting her whole life. \n\nNow she is in college, no longer a gymnast, and is very liberal and actively tries to educate herself about the things she didn’t have exposure to as a kid. She got vaccinated as soon as she turned 18 and has been proactive about her own reproductive health. \n\nThat been said, she is so naïve. She did not realize that her parents were abusive until I told her they were, and her mind was positively blown when she realized that having her parents steal $10k from her college saving and bully her relentlessly for her OCD compulsions was not normal. This is mind-blowing to me that she can’t see this. She also has really bad body dysmorphia and was anorexic all through high school because of her coaches. She’s naturally skinny, but she doesn’t see it at all and it’s almost like she can’t see it even if she tries. It’s really frustrating to me because these are things that are so obvious to me that she just isn’t understanding. She’s a brilliant girl academically and she’s very in touch with her emotions but when it comes to anything else, she’s clueless. The other day we were talking about fitness and she said “I’m just worried about getting too bulky if I do too much lifting” to which I said “you won’t get bulky overnight, and you’re not even lifting too much at all. Besides, you’re really lean and probably don’t tend to get bulky.” She said, “my coaches always told me I built muscle really quickly and its easy for me to look chunky and fat” and I said “your coaches were lying to you and manipulating you to make you feel like shit so you wouldn’t eat. How can you be so naïve about everything?” \n\nShe got pretty upset. She keeps saying that she’s trying to undo everything that had been taught to her as a kid, but it’s hard and takes time. I feel bad for lashing out but it’s frustrating to me that she can be so clueless about such obvious things. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I am the oldest of 3 children (22f), with one brother and one sister (20 and 19). I'm a student in a city a four hour bus journey from my family home but it's expensive to travel so I go home maybe every second or third weekend.\n\nA couple of weekends ago I got into a fight with my mom because she felt I had a bad attitude about doing the dishes for her after dinner. For some background info, my father and brother do none of the housework and as far as I can remember never have. My dad brings out the bins and lights the fire in the winter and that's about it, and after dinner he and my brother leave the table while my sister and I are expected to do the dishes. I'll admit I was annoyed to do them at this time, purely because of this reason, and afterwards when she stood in the sitting room door to shout at me about having a bad attitude I asked her why they couldn't do it. \n\nShe then accused me of not wanting to do anything to help her which is really not true at all, and of hurting her feelings. I saw the chance to apologise because OF COURSE I don't want to hurt my own mothers feelings, but her argument style does not allow any healthy discussion, just her going around in circles with accusations and then leaving the room when she's got it out of her system. \n\nI wanted to tell her I felt it was unfair that my sister and I were expected to do things for her when she's always allowed my father and brother to just kick back, but again I couldn't get a word in edgeways on her rant on how ungrateful I was. For some more background info, my mother has two jobs and my dad has been unemployed for years just because of the lack of work in the area. I get the feeling she has tried to bring it up with my dad in the past but has simply been shouted down, and she feels that nobody wants to help her. \n\nMy family has always had a communication problem because my parents bottle things up and then take them on us by starting a one - sided shouting match that us kids can never win. And I'm starting to get sick of it. I came home this evening and I did the dishes just to keep the peace because of course I want to help my mother - I love her so much and she's such an amazing help to me. I just want to see my dad and brother do the fucking dishes every once in a while. Does that make me an asshole??\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I am 24F and an only child. I just got a new apartment with my sweetheart about a month ago and moved out of my parent's house where we stayed much longer than we would have liked. I had lived away from home when I was 19-21 and my mom used to talk to me everyday, it drove me nuts because if i'd try to go one day without talking to her she would say things like \"we haven't talked in so long\" I figured this was normal with moms at my age until my peers told me that their mothers give them way more space, even going so far as to saying things like \"Geez, I wish my mom cared about me that much!\" Which made me feel really bad.\n\nFlash forward to now, I figured by now she would give me more space. Nope. For the record my mom is pushing 60 and hasn't much of a clue when it comes to the internet. So she \"texts\" me now via facebook on her prehistoric laptop. I haven't used messenger in 6+ months, but I recently had to download it for some other purpose but now I feel obligated to keep it. I try to ignore all the notifications I get from her for at least a few hours but for the best of my knowledge it still always says im online even when i'm not. She will constantly send me pointless things like \"hey i found this on the facebook sight free furniture *sends link to random persons facebook*\" and then send a broken link, followed by more stupid crap. All the time everyday, and i've gotten so annoyed I just want to block her. She doesn't call as often as she used to but I wish she did instead of constant messenger spam. Few weeks ago she called and I answered letter her know I have guests over and she starting crying and said \"i just wanna talk to my daughter once in a while, is that so bad?!\" Now seriously i hate seeing my mother cry but she cries all the time because of me, I hate it. I feel like such an asshole. \n\nI went to go visit my parents for the holiday\nliterally five days ago and she sent me \"Call home sometime, will ya?\"-esque facebook message yesterday. I didnt open it up, pretended not to see it, and called home out of guilt. No answer meaning my folks are at the bar. I assumed she would call me back when she gets home but nope just an abundance of messenger notifications i chose to ignore until she asked if I was okay and that she was worried I called for an emergency so I responded with \"Just wanted to say Happy New Years, no big deal.\" But really I just want to avoid her like the plague right now. I would love to go just one week without having to talk to her. \n\nAm I getting way too annoyed with my mom who's just trying to care about me? I feel like an asshole for sure.",

      "description": "It was my friends birthday, and we had booked a table for 12 at our favourite Japanese restaurant. We are an old group of friends that have known each other since high school, and had since spread all over the the UK for work or uni, so we hadn't seen each other for a long time.\n\nWe were given a big table downstairs, it almost felt like a private room because it was so small, but there were a couple of other small tables for 4 - one of which was occupied by two guys who looked about our age (24ish). So there was our big group of 12 coming to sit down, and this other table of two guys in this small room, in close proximity. I already felt kinda bad for them, and I imagined their hearts sank when they saw us come in - since they had peace and quiet before. But I did wonder why they were down here. The restaurant was hardly busy, and there had been plenty of empty tables upstairs in the main area. Maybe they just liked the privacy.\n\nAnyway, we got merry. It was BYOB, and we had brought bottles of wine and were having a lot of fun catching up, and I won't deny it, we were loud. Laughing at jokes and such. As the meal continued, I started noticing pauses in the conversation where my friends seemed to be reacting to something confusing (I was at the far end of the table). It soon came to my attention that the two guys were randomly shouting nonsensical words out of frustration at us. Again, I felt bad, but I felt that they had the choice to go upstairs at any point if they wanted to (they were only drinking tea and didn't have plates of food to take with them). If they had an issue they could have asked us to be more quiet, this behaviour just seemed needlessly antagonistic. \n\nI took note of how loud we continued to be, now prepared to tell our group to be more quiet if we got too loud, but there was no point where I felt that happened. Not until the very end, where we all started laughing at a great joke my friend made. We started filing out of the room when one of the guys loudly yelled *\"Bitches!\"* after us. We were mostly just taken aback and just left without confronting him.\n\nWere we the assholes? I think we could have been quieter, but I felt like for a group of 12 we could only be so quiet, and the guys always had the choice to move back upstairs. Surely when they came down and saw the big table waiting for a large party they would have anticipated this? What do you think?",

      "description": " Hey Guys,\n\n so I'm new here and have terrible spelling and language skills in general, so I apologize if anything is difficult to read. Stay in skool   \n\n\n  I have a very good friend of mine I've known for 14 years. We have a very good friendship overall. I'm an amateur filmmaker / rave dj and he's an aspiring actor/comedian.     \n\n\n We've always told each other our dreams and have always tried to help each other achieve them (IE. Him acting in my films, helping me create music, and me co hosting for his college radio show, and helping him write jokes). He has always been very supportive of what I want to do in my life, and was there for me when I discovered my mental health issues (I have anxiety and severe depression, which I've been treated for).   \n\n\n \n\n That being said, I get a call from my friend we'll refer to as David. David is slurring his words and is crying. I can tell somethings not right as he has a very quirky and positive attitude. He tells me that he's been drinking because he thinks he's gonna lose his job.     \n  A customer yelled at him, and his manager took the customer's side. I was really scared for him as I'm a recovered drug addict, and know the beginning of the spiral down when I see it. I told him he needs to stop drinking now, and go home, and that drinking was only going to make it worse. I told him that I had plans, but I was willing to cancel them if he was in trouble.   \n\n\n  His voice then changed, and he began laughing, Saying that this was a joke, and that he was on break and just bored. I proceeded to call him every curse word in the English dictionary, while he laughed and said I was a good friend.     \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  After I hung up, I sat in silence for most of the day in anger and disappointment. I sent him a text back and said I was really upset with him, and that I would see him next week (we do a podcast and YouTube channel with a couple other friends). I think what gets me is the fact that I thought he was in trouble and he really needed someone to talk to.     \n\n\n  I've never had someone call me asking for help, but I would only hope my friends would contact me first. I have since not talked to him because I feel this was just the stupidest thing a friend could do. \n\nI feel he knew this was a serious situation with me, and knew he could get a good reaction from me.   Its gotten to the point now where I don't trust him and want to cut him out of my life completely. I also have thought of replacing him on our podcast. But I don't want to jeopardize my friendship with everyone else in that group.     \n\n\n  TL;DR I get a call from a good friend saying that he thinks he's lost his job, and is heavily drinking. I get worried, tell him to stop drinking, because I'm a recovered drug addict. He then tells me he was joking, leaving me pissed off; not talking to him, and wanting to replace him on a podcast we started.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole who can't take a joke? Or was this a douche bag move by David?     \n",

      "description": "Title says it all and I'm glad I'm finally asking even if it is on a throw away account. I'd like to get my name changed for a total of 3 reasons that I've put together for convenience of explanation.\n\n1. I do not like my name and really never have since childhood. I've gotten use to the first part of my name since then and since my parents gave it to me, I thought I'd keep it for them if I change it but everything else I wish to change purely because I don't want it.\n2. The most important reason is due to my relations with my father and my brother in which both are pure bonafide assholes. My father has been a provider for us to his credit which I cannot thank enough for him doing providing a warm bed, clothes, a roof to stay under and other certain luxuries that might not be available to others. But the father I've had instead of the provider aspect of him is just a dick. I never have gotten any advice from him, he's never spent any time with me unless it was mandatory, and he always seems to be angry or just a asshole about everything. He really just never treats or never has treated me like a son before and I've heard him say multiple times that I'm a waste of time or that I am not worth anything of value. He's gotten better in his old age and he currently is in a declining state due to health problems, but does that mean I should forgive him at all for the stuff he has said/done? My brother is a more advance asshole being one of the most egotistical dickbags I have ever come across. He is trashy, he smokes and drinks, does not have any manners or care for anybody at all except himself, and has recently over a dispute declared that I was no longer his brother and have never been to which I agreed heavily on. I personally have told him after upsetting my mother multiple times and angering me over a long span that he just needs to die which is harsh but honestly how do you forget or forgive all the times you've been wronged or abused by someone of your own blood? Both figures have treated me like shit for my life and I would rather not go into detail but for the longest time it has just seemed like I have had no family or anybody to rely on at all except for my mom and some of her side of the family. I barley talk to them at all now despite living under the same roof and I don't wish to have the same last name as them anymore since it boggles the mind how I am even related to them.\n3. Like a lot of people, I've been struggling with my own dish of problems/stress/depression and frankly, it just feels like I need a redo or a motive for change. I feel like getting a name change would be the start of that and while it wouldn't erase any bad memories or actions that I have or had done, I just feel like it's a step I have to take and would be a new chapter entirely for me for the better.",

      "description": " \n\nI'm using a new account due to the fact that my main account is all fandom-related bullshit. I am an accountant in the US and our tax season is almost done (FINALLY), but it's still stressful.\n\nI have this client that I've been taking care of for a few years and he always got refunds every time he filed his return since he always made estimated tax payments. When he got married in 2017, his wife with him, which ended up that they both owed  a substantial amount of taxes on their joint return. I'd like to point out that they're both freelancers therefore their income fluctuates. My client is usually good at reporting to me when he receives a good amount of income, so that he can pay in his estimated taxes during the year. His wife, on the other hand, is completely MIA until I initiate. I reach out to her and give her tax projections, but it always falls through because she always says she \"doesn't have enough funds.\"\n\nSince it's tax season, my client calls me to ask me about  his taxes and expresses that he would not like to be screwed over this year. I told him, \"It depends on how much you made and how much taxes you've paid in for the year. I can't give a definite answer without knowing the big picture.\" After 10 minutes of going back and forth over the phone with various scenarios, I finally say \"listen, if you're worried about owing a huge amount of taxes this year due to your wife, talk to your wife about filing separately therefore you won't be liable for the taxes that she will eventually owe for this year and she will have to pay the taxes that she owes on what she's made.\" He gives me this MANIACAL laugh over the phone and says along the lines of \"so basically I just let her rot in jail for her unpaid taxes and I walk away scot-free?\" That's not how it works. I explain to him that it it's only a SUGGESTION and that she won't be \"thrown in jail\" just because she owes taxes. He says \"well, we're together as a married couple therefore we should be in this together.\" I kept my mouth shut even though I can list a substantial amount of clients that are married and still file separately, but, hey, that's just me.\n\nWe end our conversation and I'm still waiting for their information so I can file their tax return...\n\n**TL;DR: AITA for suggesting to my client to file separately from his wife, because she has a bad habit of not paying her taxes, while he does, which screws him from getting his refund?**",

The next day I had 2 MRI'S, ultrasound of my neck, chest x-ray, head x-ray. Got blood drawn 4 times, and have a heart monitor hooked up and was checked on every two hours. I wasn't able to get much sleep. They informed me it was migraines. They were strong enough to put me in intense pain want loose all vision in my eyes and my body goes completely numb.\n\nI was discharged at 10:30 last night. I got home, ate something small and passed out. I was uncomfortable and couldn't sleep well. I kept waking up throughout the night, my head killing me. I went back to sleep around 8 am and woke up at 2pm. I took my meds at 4:15, which includes a pill for the headaches. The doctor told me they were incredibly strong and will knock me out after 20 minutes of taking them. And it's starting to work.\n\nI have birds, cockatiels, and they love to sing. My grandfather has the garage open and they can see and feel the sunlight and he's getting upset at them. He had me get up and go clean their waters and feed them for the second time today, which is done every morning to not waste food. He wants me to stand there and help him with his project too. Which is putting together a bench\n\nHe's constantly getting mad and is now getting mad that I'm laying down wanting to sleep this headache off.\n\nI don't know why he's angry about this, he took me to the hospital.

      "description": "**The Context:**   \nIf you have ever planned a wedding, you will understand that deciding on the guest list is an unpleasant but necessary undertaking. My SO and I drafted a comprehensive list of who should be invited-- starting with immediate family, venturing into relatives, childhood and current friends, and finishing with a smattering of other meaningful people. It's not like we were merciless in our selection, but it's not as if former next-door neighbours, or even well-liked colleagues were making the cut. The final count was somewhere in the area of 100.   \n\n\nThis 100 invitees don't include two classic wedding demographics: Plus-ones and Children/babies. The wedding won't be until next year, so who knows if cousin Doug will still be with his girlfriend in six months (last I heard things were not looking good), and its anyone's guess if Janyssa will finally find her soul mate between now and the wedding. Babies and children are currently at a minimum of 7, but we are at that age where this could easily turn to 12 (I'm looking at you, Chris). Let's pencil in 25, for a total of 125 prospective attendees.   \n\n\nWith guest list in hand, venues are the next thing to look at, and many of our top choices seem to fit 80 to 100 guests. The thing is though, 125 invitees doesn't mean 125 guests. There are a dozen reasons people may decide not to attend-- can't take time off work, can't afford the trip-- whatever the reason, it is a fact of life. For obvious reasons though, we can't book a venue with a capacity of 80 and then find out 105 people want to show up. Heck, we might not even be able to book a venue for 100 if everybody shows up.   \n\n\n**The Choice:**  \nWe both have some issues with not allowing plus ones or kids. I'm not judging anybody who chose not to do this at their wedding, it just doesn't work for us personally.   \n\n\nThis leaves us with a moral dilemma -- WIBTA (we be the assholes?) if we created a wedding \"A\" list, and a wedding \"B\" list? With this option we send out staggered wedding invites-- the first to our \"A list\" (including A list plus ones and children), and then based on acceptance rate, we send out a B list (including plus ones and kids). This way if our A listers are attending but not bringing kids or plus ones, we can safely know the B listers will be fine to bring their plus ones and kids. \n\n  \nObviously we would not tell people we are doing this.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:** WIBTA if I stagger wedding invitations to an \"A list\" and \"B list\" in order to fit a hypothetical venue.

We usually fuck around and send memes and stuff or whatever but when someone has a problem and they need help then we always, *always* stick up for each other and make their problems our problems.  \n\nHowever, there is a pair of us who are together (not me) and that's awesome and they're amazing together.  I love them both.  My issue is that consistently they have their own personal conversations about their relationships and shit in our group chats.  They talk to each other about stuff, they argue, whatever.  I realize that is a important part of their relationship, but they're literally only talking to each other, and only about problems that concern them, and *not* us.  They're also very obviously not trying to have a conversation with any of us, they're only talking to each other, like if they were in PM.  I keep trying to ask them to take their conversations to PM and they just tell me to mute the chat.\n\nI don't understand why everyone else should have to mute the chat for them to talk to each other.  The chat is for everyone to talk to each other, about things that are relevant to everyone, or at least most of us.  Not for them to have their personal conversations.  AITA?",

      "description": "He bought me three small presents for my birthday that I never asked for nor wanted. Its really awkward and weird.\n\n5 months ago, I broke up with my ex and he has taken it really hard.  \n\nIt was my first breakup and I was naive thinking that he would get over me quickly and we could be friends again. I texted him saying I was open to talk about the break up and listen to him.\n\nThat was my first mistake because I led him to believe that there was still hope and I was giving him a ledge to hang on. When he began to get too clingy and desperate, I cut off communication but he didn't take it very well. I finally decided to talk to him. He basically complained that things weren't  the same. After that, I never wanted to talk about it again.\n\nAlso, about two weeks after we broke up, he bought my mom a birthday gift which I thought was weird, because he never even tried to have a good relationship with my mom and he didn't do it last year when we were dating. \n\nHe also came to my house uninvited to give me garden tomatoes and then complained afterwards that I wasn't \"excited\" enough to get the tomatoes? (WTF)\n\nAfter, things settled down and I slowly stopped replying as much to his texts. He was always the first one to text me. Then I started texting back because I felt bad, but we didn't talk much.\n\nThen I found out my ex looked through my friend's private messages between him and me without permission. He saw the messages where I was ranting to my friend about what a pain in the ass my ex is. My friend told me not to tell my ex. I felt very violated of my privacy and I felt I couldn't trust any of my mutual friends.\n\nThen his best friend texted me and said he is self harming and I felt bad so I texted him and told him he needed help and i was here for support. He said he wanted to be friends and he though I was uncomfortable texting him. I lied and said I wasn't, I was just busy. \n\nThis was another mistake I made. Im afraid I enable him to self-victimize because I seem to pay attention when he does this. He always acts out in an inane and childish way when I'm around. \n\nWe had an alumni day at my high school and I hung out with my HS group which includes my and my ex's mutual friends. After my ex left, I was talking to his friend and said I was meeting up with a guy friend at the train station. After I left, my ex asked what we talked about and his friend thought I was meeting up with my boyfriend. I found out from my ex's friend that my ex became paranoid and it was eating him up to find out who it was and if it was true. The ex's friend told me not to tell anyone.\n\nAt this point, I felt like my privacy was violated and I decided that I wanted to stop contact with him because it was clear he still not moving on. But I couldn't do it out of the blue since I promised I wouldnt tell about what happened. From that point on, he was always texting me and I always responded curtly. He's sent a long Thanksgiving text about him being thankful for me and I replied just saying Thank you and Happy Thanksgiving. \n\nThen he sent me the presents. Honestly afraid he'll come to my college campus when I stop replying to his texts.\n\nAm I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for wanting nothing to do with him even though he's in emotional pain?",

      "description": "Of course from just the title the obvious answer is YTA, but hear me out.\n\nI met this girl 4 years ago, when I was 19. I was still figuring myself out, since now I'm a confirmed demisexual type of person. I was never one to be with a random girl just for the deal of it, and can hardly even perform under those circumstances.\n\nBut when I met this girl I started to feel attracted to her. Not only did we share interests, but our emotional aspect was preety much on point. During this time she was single and so was I, and we even got to cuddle once. But out of my fear, I simply didn't do anything about it and we simply drifted away. She started dating another guy and once that happened we stopped talking all together.\n\nLast month I had been going through a self discovery journey of sorts, traveling and meeting new people and decided to contact her again. We hit it off preety well and while we chatted I did my best to see if she still was single. The whole month goes through and no mention of a boyfriend nor while texting nor in social media. I know people that don't usually publish their personal relationships on the internet but she simply did not talk about it.\nWhen I came back from my travels (about a couple of weeks ago) , we met again and I asked her if she was seeing anyone, at which point she states that she is, and with the same guy for 2 years.\n\nI kinda fell apart and got distressed. And these weeks have been quite rough for me emotionally, only blaming myself for simply not acting when the possibility was real.\n\nI am planning on telling her the truth, of how I still have strong feelings for her. I am not looking for her to dump her boyfriend, nor am I looking for a petty excuse to barge into other people's life, but I just can't live with all of this anguish inside of me.\n\nI'll take advice AND any criticism. I truly feel like an asshole doing this but many of my friends agreed that I should be honest with her. (I'm incapable of lying. Even if I try it's preety obvious I'm lying) and I know she knows I'm depressed as hell, which is horrible when she asks what's wrong and I simply pretend it's a \"random lol depression\". ",

      "description": "This happened probably four or five years ago, I was about 18 years old and I had just started using dating apps like tinder and OkCupid. One of the very first guys I started talking to was this slightly nerdy, sweet guy that I was really enjoying talking to. We didn't have a whole lot in common, honestly I don't think it would have really turned anything anyway, but I was enjoying the conversation.\n\nProbably a week or week and a half into talking to him over the app, I had a very realistic and intense rape dream involving him. I was in college at the time and it was a very realistic dream that made me wake up shaking and sweating. The next morning when I got a good morning message from him, I I literally cringe when I saw his face. I couldn't look at him anymore without thinking of that dream, so I proceeded to block him. I even tried unblocking him a few months later and I still got that deep feeling in my stomach and I couldn't say anything to him.\n\nAITA for ghosting him? I tried to think of something to say, but how do you say \" sorry you're cool, but I had a dream where you raped me so I can't talk to you anymore\" without sounding really crazy? Should I have just tried to work through it?",

      "description": "Right, so a bit of context. I can't drive and my aunt lives around 3 hours away from me and most of my family. Neither me or my mum have seen her in about 3 years.\nI'm only 19 and I suffer from anxiety which makes it hard for me to go places by myself. My mum knows this.\n\nAround Christmas time, my mum called me to say my aunt (my mum's sister) was very ill, her lungs are badly infected so she'd been put into an induced coma to help her breathe properly and give her body a rest. I was told that there is a high chance she wouldn't wake up.\nSo immediately, I asked my mum if we could go and see her together. She said that she would see what the doctors say and let me know.\nI told her that I felt incredibly guilty because of how I hadn't seen her in so long, and she always texted me telling me she missed me. I took it for granted and I wanted to say sorry and to tell her how I felt.\n\nFast forward to a few days later, my uncle put something on Facebook updating us slightly on my aunt's situation. I commented on it saying how worried I was and my uncle replied with \"it was nice to see your mum today\"...\nI started shaking because I was so angry. She didn't let me know at all that she was going, she knew I wanted to go.\nI immediately called her up and she didn't answer. She called back a bit later but I decided to leave it until the next day because it's a sensitive situation and I didn't want to try and make it all about me.\n\nSo the next day, I text her asking why she went without me and telling her that I was really upset, with her knowing full well I wanted to go and couldn't go otherwise. She sent me a text updating me on my aunt's situation but didn't really give me an answer. I didn't push it because again, it was a sensitive situation. I know that everyone is dealing with hell. I'm still incredibly angry with her though.\n\nOver new year my aunt goes into cardiac arrest. She nearly died and would have if she wasn't in a specific hospital that has the correct technology to stop it.\nA couple of weeks after this, my mum asks if I want to go and see her, so I said yes. I did let her know again that I was very upset that she didn't let me know the other week because I wanted to go and she knew this. She didn't apologise or anything.\nBut I was like ok, I'm going to see her now. I guess it's ok.\n\nA week later I get another call from my mum saying that my aunt's brain is swollen as a result of the lack of oxygen when she went into cardiac arrest. Her lungs were unable to pump oxygen through her body properly when they were doing the CPR. We were told that she was probably going to die in the next few days and they were going to do a brain scan to find out the extent of the damage in the next couple of days.\n\nSo we go over there again, this time staying overnight. During this time my mum was horrible to me. I know she was dealing with her own shit because obviously, her sister is on her death bed, but every time I spoke or slightly complained about anything she would tell me to shut up. She never asked me how I was, never sat down to talk to me at all. All she did was tell me to shut up. \nI felt like I didn't have a right to have any emotions when I was going through my own hell, just like everyone else.\n\nThey do the brain scan and the results of it showed that she doesn't really have much activity. She wasn't brain dead but she couldn't understand/respond to most things.\n\nSo that means that since new year, she wasn't really there. She couldn't have possibly known I was there. I'd missed my chance to say things I wanted to say to her after 3 years.\nIf I'd have gone before, when my mum did, there would have been a chance that she'd understand. \n\nThis led to me being incredibly angry with my mum again. And now I don't know if I want to talk to her for a while.\nEveryone except my partner is saying it's not a big deal and I shouldn't be as upset as I am but I feel like I have the right to be.\n\nIt's been a few weeks and my mum hasn't even attempted to text me/call me. I'm waiting for her to contact me. I don't want to contact her.\n\nMy aunt survived but is now in a vegetative state. She is being looked after in a nursing home but can't understand/respond to much still.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Background, I (F) am a sophomore in college, the friend (Tom, M, sophmore) are both Electrical Engineering (EE) students.\n\nOne of the classes required for EE students is an intro class that is only homework based. To make it easier the class meets 2 days a week and on the second day they give you the answers to the homework. This class is meant to be a GPA booster and teach you how to use MATLAB without much stress. The homework can be completed alone or in a group of two.\n\nHere is where the issues begin. After the first 2 weeks of class and assignments, Tom stopped showing any involvement in the assignments, not even a text asking if the homework was done. He had a different time for the second class so he could not see my work and I could not see his.\n\nSo, I turned in assignments 3-5 without his name on them. A few weeks later he notices he has 0 points for HW 3 and asks about it. I tell him I forgot to put his name on the assignment and that I will email the instructor.\n\nHe then seemed to show interest in helping again and said he would do the end report for the next assignment, which is just putting my screencaps of the code into a word doc.\n\nThe due date comes, and I end up doing all of the work again without a word from him so I can receive points. For some reason I put his name on this assignment.\n\nTom is busy with other clubs on campus and our schedules are almost identical, so I know the difficult classes he’s taking. However, this class literally gives you the answers if you just show up to the recitation period.\n\nI then emailed the instructors and asked to meet with them to discuss his lack of contribution to the assignment. I asked for his name to be removed from everything but assignments 1 and 2. Essentially, he will have 37% in the intro course with half the semester to fix his grade on his own. I also had his name removed from a lab report in our circuits class as this pattern has continued into that class as well.\n\nAITA for setting him back in an intro class because he would not help with the assignments?\n",

      "description": "I hate buying cars from a dealer. But with the poor timing of having a sheet of black ice sentence my beloved Tacoma to a concrete wall, and an upcoming road trip in the next week, I had to get something reliable soon. I settled on a used 2013 Scion xB from the local Subaru dealership. I noticed the front tires were wearing thin, and brought that up during the deal. They said “Nope! We checked them and they’re 70% tread” which they clearly weren’t. But they’re clearly under a third treadlife left. I also noticed the floor mats were not present, but I thought they’d be in the trunk after their detailing like all the previous cars I’ve purchased. After all, the Carfax said “floor mats installed” when the dealership originally took it in on trade. In hindsight I clearly should’ve checked, but mistakenly took their word for it. When all was said and done, I was handed the “key”. Just one. No second fob, no valet key, just one single key. This is a $260 second key from Toyota that I need to get cut and programmed now, and again, I wouldn’t have felt the need to clarify how many keys come with the vehicle during the negotiation. I assumed all the keys would be present. I only discovered the single key issue after the final handshake.  And lastly, for the cherry on top, I found out while they were attaching the paper temp tag that there’s a screw broken off flush in the license plate hole. \n\nThe car has 65,000 miles and I paid just under $10k for the car. Yes, I knew I paid too much. But after all the issues, now I feel like I REALLY paid too much after discovering that some of the basic parts are missing. I am meeting with the “sales manager” tomorrow to discuss my disappointment, but am I the asshole for insisting on compensation for new tires, a second key, and floor mats?",

However, I’m very careful when speaking about religion because I know it can be a controversial subject, and our conversations about it are few and far between. \n\nI asked him for an instance of when he felt this way and he said it was when I asked him if he would want our imaginary/future kids to go to church. Honest question, wasn’t said in a judgmental or negative way. I only asked because I was curious and because it is something that affects our future as a potential family. He said he wasn’t sure, maybe and I said ok. There was no further discussion about it and no awkwardness or negative feelings afterwards. And this conversation happened a week or two ago. He basically said I offended him and it was rude, and I was “shitting on religion”. I’m just trying to figure out if I asked an inappropriate question or said something I shouldn’t have.",

      "description": "So, a couple of years ago, I happened to come across a high street clothing shop in London that sold good quality cargo pants, jackets etc. They were not cheap but the material and stitching was very good and they felt great on me so I bought quite a few items. Cargo pants, a jacket, a few t shirts etc.\n\nBeen wearing them for a couple of years now and last night, a friend of mine looked at the brand and said \"Oh, Thor Steinar! You know that brand is banned in some German cities and other parts of Europe because of facist links?\"\nNeedless to say, I was shocked and confused and asked more. My friend works regularly in Germany and its information he's just picked up along the way.\n\nI did a Google search on the brand and the Wiki page https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Steinar\nand sure enough, there has been quite a bit of controversy about it but it seems like a lot of it has been media hyped. Nothing that we'd heard of in the UK as far as I know but obviously those aren't the circles I mix with.\n\nSo I was left with a dilemma. I'm not a Neo Nazi, i abhor the whole ideology and do not want to be labelled as such nor do I want to wave the flag of a brand that may or may not have links to facists but at the same time feel that it's an unknown controversy here, they're good clothes and I like wearing them. \n\nNow that I am aware of the controversy, I could throw them away as a protest of principle or I could continue to wear them. I asked my wife her thoughts on it and she said that now that I know, I'd be complicit and should do the right thing but my feelings are that they are just clothes, I like them and I'm not a facist so what's the harm.\n\nBased on how the comments are in this thread, I will change my opinion and do what the majority feel is best. \n",

      "description": "So, some background.\n\nThis past year, as it was for many, was fucking hell. It was just one of those years where everything happened at the last second— sickness, accidents, family emergencies. The biggest of which was I chose to take a lot of unscheduled time off to be on suicide watch for my roommate/best friend because honestly, fuck work or any other priority at that point. I also struggle with severe anxiety and depression (which I am always very upfront about so people can understand when I need them to back off or what’s going on with me when I’m overly quiet, etc) so I had to take a couple of mental health days of my own during this time so I wouldn’t have a breakdown. \n\nAfter being a retail manager for 8 years, I ABSOLUTELY understand the frustration of call outs, as well as a need to identify patterns of attendance and bring it to the attention of your employees, just as you would any other opportunity area, so that they may correct bad behavior and be steered toward a consistent performance. \n\nWith this all being said, here is my dilemma:\n\nI’m sick af with the flu, which of course happened to descend last Saturday. After going to the doc’s on Tuesday, I’m basically looking at needing to be off the whole week for rest and, eventually, recovery. \n\nI’m the type of person who would always just go in to work sick and ‘power through’— mostly because I was a manager but also because of my anxiety and convincing myself that I couldn’t afford any time to rest. Hell, I convinced myself I didn’t even deserve it. But I don’t work in retail anymore— I work at the hospital. Cancer Center, to be exact. Now, my role does not always put me face to face with patients but I will constantly pass them in the halls or even need to run to the infusion bay to check with the charge nurse on something. Because of this, and because of my understanding of how fragile their immune systems can be during chemo, I have called out more times in this one year than I ever have my entire working career. I’m terrified of passing on some simple sickness of mine to a cancer patient and being the cause of a hard crash for them. \n\nSo, back to this week. I had taken Monday off in exchange for working Friday (one of my usual days off) since we had Tuesday off for the new year. I put off going to the doc’s until Tuesday because I was honestly hoping against hope that whatever this was would just go away— obviously had to realize that wasn’t the case when I decided to see the doc. So then comes the flu diagnosis and the doctor’s note supporting me being out until I feel able to return to work along with it. I send this to my boss and let her know I will need to be out Wednesday and that by Wednesday evening I will let her know if I need to be out Thursday as well.\n\nBy 4:00pm Wednesday I am feeling like walking death and just know in my soul I need to stay home through the weekend and just sweat-rest this shit out. After texting with my boss, her attitude suddenly changes— no more emotes, no more exclamation points to add genuine inflection. Just a ‘Ok. We will plan to see you on Friday.’\n\nSo now I’m freaking the fuck out about whether or not I should go to work, wondering if I’ve just gone soft and am enabling myself to be a wuss, or if I’m making the right decision by staying home to make sure all this sickness is out of me. \n\nNot that this should be a factor— because I do good work for my own expectations and not to have bargaining chips— but I feel so frustrated because of how much I go out of my way to help. Covering shifts, picking up extra hours, helping with co-worker’s back work as well as clinic projects that need an extra hand. And all that accomplishment and feeling like I may not be such a piece of shit after all goes up in flames from one simple text. Not my boss’s fault, my brain is just cruel to itself. \n\nSo, please, honestly......AITA for calling out so much? Have I lost my work ethic? Should I go in tomorrow and just try and avoid everyone until I can clock out and go home? ",

      "description": "There is a long complex history here but I will do my best to explain while still not including identifying information. Throw away for obvious reasons.\n\nFor my whole life my father has turned the volume up on whatever he is listening to. Not just a little, but to the point you can hear it outside the house sometimes. My mom and I would both tell him he was damaging his hearing and would try to get him to turn it down. (insert: When we were in the house he would turn the volume was low enough that we couldn't hear it two floors away, but still would try to get him to turn it down for his own benefit before failing and camping out on the upper floor) Whenever my mother or I would try to get him to stop he would get mad and scream, he accidently hurt me a few times in anger (shoving me, grabbing me WAY to hard, stuff like that). I'm including this to show that my mother and I really tried to stop this, but failed.\n\nMany years of this has damaged his hearing a lot. He can't hear without things being up ridiculously high. The sad part is that instead of protecting what hearing is left, he compensates with the volume to the point that it's still just as loud to him, but louder to us. In the past when we'd watch TV together he'd turn it down to a level that I could stand (but was still loud) out of respect for me. Now he can't hear it at that level and tries to turn it up even higher. The issue is that the 'even higher' is REALLY loud now. (Another insert, in case anyone suggest it, we've tried to get him to get hearing aids. He refuses.)\n\nAnyway, the fight happened when I was already occupying the TV room and he came down and turned it WAY up. He was already mad at me for asking to turn on the air conditioning (he likes the house to be at about 75 degrees, my mom and I like it a bit cooler), and the TV was louder then usual, so I think it was out of spite. I was honestly sick of his behavior but used to it, so all I said was,\" can you please turn down the TV?\" I will admit that based on previous behavior, I had a feeling that he would get angrier, but I'm worried about letting him do stuff like that because it will damage my hearing too eventually. He kept snapping at me, tensions rose, and at some point I said,\" You'd think someone who has hearing trouble would want there child to protect there hearing.\" and he said,\" You'd think as someone who has hearing trouble my family would be more understanding.\"\n\nThat was basically how it ended. I don't see it as being extremely disrespectful to a parent because he has said many times that he's done raising me. I feel like if that's the case I need to make my own decisions and look out for myself. My mother doesn't side with me, but she didn't do anything when he was accidently hurting me either so I'm not inclined to trust her judgement on this. So what is your view? AITA?\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to see my old friends anymore?",
      "description": "For context, I'm a man. I have a few friends whom I've known for a long time. We go back to our college days, and we were really best friends who had such great times. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime has passed, and we are now all married, have jobs, etc. I noticed that whenever I see them, it must always be with their wives present. They say, quite literally, that we will not see each other at all unless it is in this way. I don't know the exact reasons for this arrangement. For what it's worth, I have sometimes told my wife, \"\\[This party/outing/whatever\\] is going to be just the guys,\" and she seems to understand and let me do my own thing. She also does her own thing sometimes and I'm happy for her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs to my friends, I realized that I don't like their wives very much, nor do I really enjoy my friends' company when they are with their wives. The night turns into keeping the girls entertained and not talking about things that we would talk about if the women weren't present (admittedly, not the most genteel and refined topics). While they claim they would love to have some guys-only time, that has never happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've decided that if they say, \"It is this or nothing,\" then I'd rather take the \"nothing.\" But am I the asshole for not understanding whatever marital relationship requirements they have? Would a good friend just adopt to the new arrangement and continue the friendship? Don't get me wrong; I still wish my friends the best, and I hope they are happy, and if ever they come back and say they're available to hang out alone, I would invite them in a heartbeat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso to clarify, when I say \"nothing,\" I really actually mean that I will put up with the wives to maintain some semblance of a relationship. We currently see each other 1\\~2 times a month (my wife accompanies me too when that happens); I'm thinking of letting that dwindle to that many times every three months. Next time they want to hang out, I want to firmly say, \"I'd love to, but I would rather it be just the guys tonight. If that isn't possible, please let me know the next time that it IS possible and I'll be there.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I'm morally justified in choosing my friends, and I have no moral obligation to hold on to friends even though they have, as far as I'm concerned, \"changed.\" But I wonder if I'm being immature about the realities of married life and friendship in your not-so-young-anymore life, and inadvertently being the asshole.

      "description": "So for a friend’s birthday, another friend decided to post an embarrassing video on social media as part of a “birthday post”. Said video unfortunately includes me making an ass out of myself. This video has been posted online before as a prank, and I made it clear last time to this friend that I did not find it funny. Now I’m really not a confrontational person and I never get angry; this usually means if I do happen to get upset, some people don’t take me seriously. On the previous occasion, I was really not happy, and thought I made it clear- but friend just thought the whole thing was hilarious. This time, I sent a couple of messages to him making it abundantly clear that I do not want it up online. On the other hand, our friendship is generally pretty jokey (we’ve never had an argument), it’s a celebration (?) for someone else’s birthday- should I just learn to take a joke? AITA? ",

Long story short, to save this puppy from death by neglect, I took it home. I hand fed it milk. Got all it's shots, visits, vet care etc. Now it is one year later. Dog is still with us. Ex doesn't want it at his house because I took it. Which is true. The dog has grown on me, to some extent. It's healthy and happy. But so damn yappy, as Chihuahuas are. I have tried so hard to train it to stop yapping at every little damn thing. I hate this breed of dog. My kids are annoyed by it's constant barking. I wouldn't have chosen it for my family.

I also totally understand why people do smoke/drink, benefits of marijuana, cbd.\n\nBut anyway a month ago my mum and her partner I saw buying weed. Don't ask but I just happened across it. My mum said it was going to be a one or two time thing, I didn't mind that much since when she was younger she had done and also it was cute to see these two middle aged people smoking pot. I spoke to her about how I don't like it, but if she wants to smoke it now and then I won't judge. But then fast forward after, almost smoking it every day in our house (I'm 18, working, so her house ofcouse but I live there) which stinks, her and him have decided to buy some seeds wanting to grow it. And I am against this. One it's illegal, and two morally, it kinda fucks me up. And this has been our arguments recently and I don't know if I'm overreacting completely and should just let them do their thing. \n\n(Its not legal where I live to grow it, sell it, but no big deal to smoke a little bit for your own use, privately, since the police will just take it off you and give you a warning)",

I mentioned that I had to leave by 11:20 pm because my parents want me home by midnight and the commute is about 40 minutes. Sarah offered me a ride to the train station because it was -20 degrees Celsius which decreased my commute to 30 minutes. I accepted Sarah’s offer and advised her that we should leave her friend’s dorm by 11:30 pm which she agreed upon. At 11:15 pm Sarah decides to smoke a joint. I ask her multiple times not to as it is not safe to drive high. Sarah assures me that she will be fine. After 5 minutes I notice Sarah’s eyes get red.  Infront of Sarah’s friend’s, I said, “You look so baked.” Sarah asks me if I can go home later. I told her in a neutral tone that, “my parents are super strict, they’re not chill like yours.” I didn’t mean to be condescending or rude at all. \n\nAt this point it’s 11:25 pm and I’m not sure if Sarah is dropping me off to the train station or if I need to sprint to make it home in time so I start putting on my jacket and head out. Sarah follows me and gives me a ride to the station but during the ride she’s upset that embarrassed her infront of all her friends and that she doesn’t need validation from me. I assure Sarah that I didn’t mean to come across as rude and apologize. Sarah decides to stop the car and continue to scold me. At this point, it’s 11:35 pm and we haven’t reached the train station yet because Sarah has stopped the car which makes me super anxious because I’m about to miss my train and not make it home in time. I start crying so Sarah decides to continue to drive. \n\nWe get to the train station at 11:43 pm where I miss my train and don’t get home in time. \n\nAITA for the way I spoke to my friend? ",

He isn’t clear about any discussion we have about the future. And he is pissed because he says in theory I’m right, he just doesn’t want it. We’re both totally financially stable and can afford pretty nice life, but he says he doesn’t feel financially stable to have a family yet.\n\nOver the last months he stopped coming to my place, or asking me how I am, or even kissing me. He’s doing his own thing and he texts, what it feels to me, when he runs out of things to do.\n\nWe were together for just a bit Thursday evening, had a late dinner, he slept here and went off to work on Friday morning early.\nFriday night he didn’t say anything and I can expect around Saturday after he goes and do some sports with his friends in the morning a phone call to get together in the evening.\nI’ve been crying all week because this makes me really sad: I actually have not been with him at all.\n\nIn any case, he turns 30 tomorrow. I tried to organize a little party but he pushed back, which made me even more sad because I thought we needed some reasons to celebrate. In any case, the plan is that we go to his moms place, he let me know about this fact in his family group chat. He did not invite me directly, nor spoke about it more than 2 words.\n\nI really think this is the end of our relationship and I am in tears all the time. I so much wanted to marry this man, have children, and so on.\nIn any case, I’ve come to terms that we need to break up, I need to pick up all my stuff from his house, and I want to do it today.\nAITA for doing this on his birthday?",

      "description": "Obligatory apology for mobile formatting. Now time for a little feedback.\n\nSometime last year I found out that my father would be leaving my mother by complete accident, I was planning to ask my family for a loan to put towards a deposit on a home for my wife and I. \n\nUpon hearing this, my father took me to one side out of earshot of my mother and told me of his plans. He begged me not to tell my mother as she would kick him out upon hearing this. He asked to give him time to find a place to live. I said I would keep it to myself. \n\nHe’s not wrong, as soon as he says “I’m leaving” she will want him out the door ASAP and likely wouldn’t care if he had nowhere to go. But that’s beside the point.\n\nI’ve kept my finger on the pulse regarding this, seeing how this has been progressing and I have found out today that he will be leaving her today. He’s told me to deny knowing everything and effectively spare myself from her potentially hating me. I’ve been keeping my wife informed about this through out and she thinks that I should bite the bullet and tell my mother.\n\nI am at a loss for what to do, I feel like an asshole for not telling my mother when I found out but kept saying that it’s not my place to say.\n\nSo I’m asking the strangers of the internet, AITA for not telling my mother about my fathers plans? WIBTA if I deny knowledge of knowing?\n\nCheers.",

      "description": "Yesterday, a guy reversed into my car in his work pickup truck. I asked him for his insurance and he showed it to me for a second then pulled out $200 and told me to take it as the damage wasn’t that bad. He told me how he is an immigrant and he has 5 kids and implied to me that he would lose his job if he had “another” claim filed against him. In the heat of the moment, I took the money from him and let him leave, taking a picture of his tag.\n\nLater, upon reflecting on these events, I decided to call the police, as the damage to the bumper would require replacement, which is pretty costly for any car. They sent out an officer who took my info and statement and he was able to look up the vehicle’s owner from the tag. It was registered to “ABC, LLC” (not the real name obviously).\n\nI attempted to contact the driver by calling the company during business hours, this morning, to be berated by the manager there, “Carl”. Carl accused me of trying to scam him because I wanted to speak with the driver instead of the office personnel. After explaining the incident, he quickly changed his tone and apologized, citing “the holidays” as a reason he was so upset with my supposed scamming. He would not give me the company’s insurance info, as he claimed they had to “dig it up”. He then proceeded to forward my info to his insurance company, who contacted me to start the claim process.\n\nAfter that I was put in touch with a different manager at the ABC company, “Sarah”, who is supposedly more involved on the business side of things. At this point I asked her what would happen to the guy that hit me, repeating a couple times that I hope that he wasn’t going to get in too much trouble for what happened. She was dismissive of question. The third time I asked she stated “I can’t say anything about it but let’s just say this isn’t the first time”. From her tone of voice during this line of questioning and her final response I assume that the guy is getting fired.\n\nThe last thing I did was ask to have the driver’s contact info or for them to pass mine along to him so that he could get in touch with me. Sarah told me she doesn’t know if that is allowed but she would check. I didn’t tell anyone except the police that I accepted the money from him. I am hoping that they giving him my number so that I can give him his cash back.\n\nTL;DR - guy hit my car, I initially accepted cash from him, then I called his company, and now I think they fired him.\n\nI feel pretty bad about the guy getting in trouble or fired especially because it’s the holiday season. I pretty much feel like an asshole. ",

      "description": "I won't go through the whole history of the relationship because I don't think it's entirely relevant. My ex and I dated for almost a year and it was kind of a whirlwind. It started out amazing and I was absolutely smitten, but we moved too fast and it quickly came crashing down. He because very emotionally and verbally abusive. He never actually physically hurt me, but he would corner me and block my exit, scream in my face, brandish knives, and make endless threats about how he would injure me if I didn't do what he wanted. It took me a month to get the courage to leave, and a month later, he figured out where I was and started hanging around outside my building, sending letters, making hang up calls at work (I changed my cell number so he didn't have that) and more stuff like that. I tried to go to the police and also tried to get a restraining order but didn't have enough evidence that he was a threat. One day, it all just stopped and I haven't heard from him since.\n\nI just went for a pap and was diagnosed with gonorrhea. I know it's from him because of the timing. I haven't told him because I know even if I use an anonymous service, he will probably know it's me, and he might start up again. I'm scared to open that door again. On the other hand, I know he's probably with someone new, and I would hate for her to have lasting complications because this went undiagnosed and treated. I'm conflicted, but I think I have decided not to inform him. Does this make me an asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for technically causing friendship issues between my boyfriend and his long-term friend, and not accepting her apology?",
      "description": "For context, I've had a history of difficulty with female friendships. I'm more relationship-focused and I think I get too attached in friendships, which can cause issues. I genuinely can't tell if I was toxic or the asshole in this situation, because I've been told before that I can be manipulative, overly-attached, and dramatic. Either way, the friendship between us is over, and I'm just trying to sort out the side effects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the story:\n\n* Started dating bf 2 years ago\n* When visiting bf's hometown, met his friend who he had been friends with since middle school (so, 10 years or so)\n* She introduced me to my current passions (tarot and astrology) and we became friends\n* Texted with her often, although she's slow to reply and a bit erratic so it wasn't consistent\n* I was friends with HER best friend for a bit, who lives in the same town as me. But this friend said that I was trying to force the friendship, so she didn't want to talk to me anymore. She called me creepy and entitled (this makes me think that I'm the asshole in friendships)\n* Leaned on her too much during a personal crisis while she was also recovering from weed addiction and dealing with a bipolar diagnosis, she cut me out of her life and said I was toxic\n* A few months later, she forgave me and we talked occasionally\n* We followed each other on Twitter (both of us have astrology/tarot accounts)\n* She came down to visit my bf and I, along with one of their other friends. While she was visiting, I felt a little disconnected. I posted (this is pretty emo and dramatic) \"I feel like there's a wall between me and other people\" after we all hung out. This is a personal issue and I've been working on genuine connections and doing better with it. But that night I wasn't feeling great\n* She kept posting about her best friend on her astrology/tarot account and that brought up bad memories for me. I have no right to tell her who or who not to post about, so I unfollowed her on my astrology/tarot account. I kept following her on my personal account, though\n* I noticed she blocked me on Twitter. I tried to text her about it, but she blocked my number as well. The day I noticed, she was texting my boyfriend saying \"I just broke up with my boyfriend of 6 years\" and clearly needing support. I don't think this was a romantic/sexual advance, they're pretty platonic imo\n* My boyfriend does not reply to her texts/calls - he's mad because she was rude to me and caused me anxiety by blocking me for seemingly no reason.\n* Months later, she finally replies to me. She tells me that she blocked me out of her life because I have \"negative energy\" and am toxic (she's really into things like energy, past lives, etc which I'm not as into). She cited my tweet as the evidence of my negative energy, and told me I was manipulative and I don't get to tell her otherwise. Apparently, me becoming interested in astrology/tarot after meeting her was creepy, and me unfollowing her on twitter showed that I disrespected her astrology/tarot knowledge. She also told me she regrets ever meeting me and being friends with me, because I ruined her friendship with my boyfriend, and that I cause him to abandon life-long friends. This made me feel bad because that was never my intention.\n* A few weeks after the stuff about the negative energy, she apologizes to me and says her words were uncalled for. She also texted my boyfriend saying \"hope we can catch up soon!\" I feel bad for her because she might've said those things during a time of poor mental health (dealing with a breakup and mental illness)\n* I haven't replied to her apology. I don't want to get involved with her anymore. She has some delusions that I can't get on board with, and I feel like having me in her life will just make it more difficult.\n\nAm I the asshole in this specific situation for bringing drama into their friendship and ending it? Also, am I the asshole for not replying to her apology and preferring that my boyfriend not be friends with her anymore? ",

Now this opportunity has arisen me another friend have semi arranged a trip to go see him in the summer as we're incredibly proud of him and it would be amazing to share that with them before we start having families and responsibilities. \n\nMy girlfriend has flipped out on me because she wanted the first time we both visited the city to be together.

Not seeing my best friend for almost 2 years would kill me and it's the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nWhen we spoke about it I told her things don't always work it the way you plan in your head and that when we eventually go together it will be a completely different experience that will still be special to us both. \n\nMy friend has been there for me throughout everything in my life and is much family to me as anybody else, my girlfriend wasn't with me during my upbringing and i feel like she doesn't understand that.

      "description": "For the past couple of months I've gotten to know this girl through college, we worked on a lot of projects and therefore spent a lot of time together. Through that time I began to have feelings for her but never acted on them as I knew she was already with somebody else. Two weeks ago she texts me and tells me that she and her boyfriend broke up and that was that. Some come last Friday she invites me over to have some drinks with her, we both have a good time just talking about random stuff when things get intense. She admitted that she had feelings for me and never knew I did as well. But right in the middle of everything she stops and says she cant do this. So I ask why, and she says that she cant do this to her boyfriend and that I should go. Keep in mind she told me that they had broken up. Now things are extremely awkward and I wanna know if I did something wrong.",

      "description": "Just a little disclaimer: I never went to the doctor with... let’s call her E. So I don’t know exactly what kinds of strokes she’s had, I just know what she’s told the family. So sorry if I’m using the wrong terminology. \n\nE is the kind of person who decided to give a big toast at my wedding to talk about how she’s a victim, and other garbage not related to the wedding. E is also the kind of person who doesn’t accept medical basic medical advice, like eat some vegetables instead of more lard, take a short walk around the block to get some exercise, etc. the kinds of people who would rather take weird pills they get from people who aren’t doctors to try to “look prettier” (her words) than just follow easy diet instructions from the nutritionist. \n\nSo this morning she texts me to let me know she’s very sick again, and had another stroke recently, and that her face is twisted again, and just about how horrible she feels. I have tried so hard to convince her that French fries are not vegetables, taking a short walk around the block is healthy, and that she should try to cook healthier. I even gave her some recipes. But of course she didn’t do that all these years. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting to visit her or give her any sympathy? My whole life she’s done nothing but be toxic, hurt me, and not take care of herself despite doctors telling her she needs to. Why is it my responsibility to comfort her for her refusing to take care of herself? ",

He keeps saying “your statement didn’t require a response” even though I thought the things I said could be turned into a conversation.  Sometimes his interuptions happen right as I’m in between sentences.  I’ll ask him if he heard me/was paying attention and he’ll repeat back what I said then tell me he doesn’t believe it garnered a response, then continue changing the subject.\n\nEven if he couldn’t think of a response, I’d still prefer a “gotcha” “ok” type response because otherwise it just seems like he isn’t listening.\n\nAITA for being irritated by this?",

      "title": "AITA for using a lane on the highway (in a car) until I was forced over to another lane by construction? (USA)",
      "description": "Happened last week while I was on a cross-country trip. I'll do my best to visually describe it.\n\nPicture 3 lanes, and construction is happening in the left lane, but a little ways up ahead, so I'm not even *in* the construction zone yet. However all 3 lanes are moving between very slow and dead stopped. Here in the US they'll put signs that say \"Left lane closed 1000ft ahead\" and another one at 500ft, and then they'll put traffic cones across the lane at a diagonal angle until it's impossible to use the lane.\n\nI'm in the left lane and we slowly pass the 1000ft sign. Almost everyone in front of me in the left lane starts merging at this point. I notice that the car in front of me is almost merged into the middle lane all the way and that the lane is empty until you get to the traffic cones, which are ~900ft away or so. Now as someone who's lived in large cities the past 15yrs, everyone usually goes all the way to the cones before merging, that's just what happens. So I take the opportunity to do this, and as I'm starting to drive by, a semi-truck suddenly juts out halfway into my lane in an attempt to block me. I stop and then go around him because he kinda had to get back in his lane fully and also there was plenty of room on the shoulder, but I didn't even have to leave the lane at all really.\n\nI continue on my way and am coming up on the cones getting ready to merge when *another* semi-truck pulls out and *completely* cuts me off. So the front of his truck is basically touching the first or second cone and the back of his truck is in the middle lane. I slam the brakes and am very annoyed, but there's nothing I can do so I start pulling into the middle lane behind him. BUT a fucking 3rd semi-truck, who is directly behind the one that just cut me off, also fucking cuts me off and gets within like 2in of the other semi-truck so that I can't merge. Finally, the car behind that last semi-truck lets me in because there's nowhere else to go, and less than a minute later I'm passing both of those semi-trucks because traffic started going more than 10mph.\n\nI've always been a fan of truckers and have done my best to be aware of what they're doing on the road, but what the fuck? I understand if you don't like what I'm doing, but it was legal and there was a huge amount of unused lane that I thought everyone should be using and just merging once they got to the cones, you know like a zipper. What were these guys thinking? \"Let's make this guy pass us in a few minutes when traffic opens up instead of right now because....uh....reasons.\" Are you really stupid enough to risk causing an accident that would be *your* fault because you don't like that I'm about to pass you using a completely open and legal lane? I understand people passing you when you're at a dead stop makes you think \"What an asshole\" but I feel like these guys were just sticking together as truckers instead of using their brains.",

      "description": "The scene:\n\nI was riding my bike on a two-lane road at rush hour in front of a school. There’s a row of parked cars at the curb and no painted bike lane, but the road’s wide enough for bikers to easily pass between traffic and the parked cars. It’s a neighborhood that gets heavy commuter bike traffic and there are at least two other bikes close behind me. Because of the school traffic and a red light up ahead, the cars around me aren’t moving, but I’m on my merry way between the parked and not-currently-moving cars.\n\nThen this lady with her two little kids steps out from between two parked cars like ten feet in front of me. I wasn’t going that fast and was able to slam on the brakes and stop in time for her (I could hear the brakes on the bike right behind me screeching too.) Then she stops in the road, as the light changes and traffic starts to move, to yell at me for... stopping in time? About how it’s a school zone and can’t I see people are crossing. I was mad enough to yell back that she wasn’t in a crosswalk, and she was ready to keep haranguing me but I just pedaled on.\n\nI feel like I was in the right here, but she seemed so outraged I’m second-guessing myself. Should I be ready to stop at a second’s notice if I’m near a school, even if I’m not near a crosswalk? Is it wrong for me to be moving when the cars around me aren’t?",

      "description": "Long time lurker. First time posting. I'll try not to turn this into a wall of text.\n\nI (F19) have been sort of going over in my head whether or not I should tell my mom about the fact that I like girls. She grew up in a very cult like setting where they were pretty much against anything and everything fun because someone did something in the Bible so don't do it or enjoy hell - they were not Christians, they were something way more fanatic so I'm not coming down on Christians. Anyway, she's said several times in the past that she would wonder where she went wrong or feel like a failure of a parent if I \"turned out gay.\" But I knew this wasn't really her talking, but more of that cult talking so I never hated her for saying it.\n\nAnyway, finally decided one afternoon to tell her that a recent outing with a \"friend\" off Bumble was more than that. I teared up, and became a lot more vulnerable than I usually am. I mean, it's a pretty scary situation. I thought she was going to look at me different. But she keeps texting on her phone and says, \"That's fine.\" She was a bit more nonchalant about how upset I was than I cared for, but later she said she was trying not to make me nervous by looking at me the whole time so whatever. \n\nAnyway, something we like to do is go in each other's social media accounts and post something to throw off our friends. So while she was napping, I came up, unlocked her phone, and was about to go on her Facebook when I decided to check out audio recordings. Sometimes, she'll record us when we're reading a bad book or a bad movie to catch all the jokes we make and how much we laugh. So I click it thinking it's one of those until I skip ahead and hear myself crying and coming out to her not one week ago. I immediately wake her up and ask her why she did this. She says because it was, quote, \"a pivotal moment, or whatever.\" \n\nI ask her to delete it. Telling her I was unusually vulnerable than I've ever been. She takes her phone, locks it with a new code, and refuses for no other reason beyond what was said above, saying I was being ridiculous. So now I don't know if I really am being. My friend says I have a right to be angry and that it's a violation of privacy. But I don't know.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "A few months ago, my GF of 1 1/2 years told me that her ex reached out to her and wanted to catch up. I had no problem with it at the time so I just said she could talk to him if she wanted to. My masculinity is not so fragile that my GF can't talk to a dude 1000km away. They chatted on and off since then, mostly casual chats about what was going on in there lives.\n\nRecently her and her family went to Alberta to her Sister's wedding (the dude lives out east. Just thought I'd mention it before it gets asked). In her time there, he struck up the usual chat about life. That they have been having infrequently. This time he decided he needed to tell her how he felt, and that included telling her that he loves her, and trying to convince her to break up with me to date him. She had the brain to tell him no, but they could still be friends, but deep down she got pulled back to when they dated and missed him. She broke and told him that and he tried to bend it to get her to break up with me. She ended up blocking him after he did that.\n\nShe didn't tell me for DAYS. She is back home now, and was being moody so I asked what was wrong. She was beating around the bush telling me things like \"you don't wanna know what's up, you'll get mad\". Naturally it brewed inside me that something bad had happened out west and I had no idea what to expect (did she cheat on me? Did she do something stupid?). I eventually got her to tell me what happened, and when she did I got furious with her. I yelled at her for the first time ever in our relationship (I never yell when I get upset. Never.) and asked questions any dude would when he feels he felt like he was cheated on. \"What are we doing here? What am I to you\" etc. I honestly feel like the anticipation made my reaction worse than if she just told me, and I pointed that out to her. We are on okay terms but I want to know if what happened makes me an asshole. At the time I considered it a form of cheating, but looking at it now I don't think it is. I still love her and I trust her, but I don't trust other dudes not to be stupid and sometimes it comes off like I don't trust her.",

      "description": "Throwaway for reasons.\n\nOkay, so this happened about eight or nine months ago, but I'm still wondering if I was the asshole, so you guys get to decide.\n\nFor context, I come from a family of means. I don't know how much because we didn't really discuss money, but I know that my parents own a multi-million dollar home, and they have no problem dropping money on a dime for a plane ticket anywhere in the world and paying my and my siblings' college tuition without loans, so I can comfortably say they are of above average means.\n\nAfter college, I had a lot of trouble finding a job. You know the old \"All entry level positions in your field need six years of experience and a third kidney\" kind of deal. I was able to find some seasonal and part-time work, but I was not having any luck finding a full time permanent job. It wasn't for a lack of trying, either: getting me a job had become a family project. I was hustling with those cover letters and informational interviews, my mother was hustling for connections and networking, and my dad was hustling trying to keep either of us (who both share some unfortunately anxious and neurotic personalities) from spiraling from stress. (To be fair to my mother, she might have been working harder than me on this.) The issue was that there was just too much competition for these nice entry level jobs. I'd get an interview, do my best, and then be passed over because someone with a graduate degree and nine years of experience applied (which actually happened for one of the part time jobs I applied to).\n\nDuring this time, I was also living with my parents. It was not an ideal situation because we all love each other, but we all have very intense personalities and get stubborn when we argue. It was made worse by the fact that I felt like a leech there, since they'd complain about me not doing things around the house and then complain about how I did the things around the house when I tried and then do it over their way. Especially with cooking, my mother would sometimes complain that I lived at home and didn't do any cooking, and then my parents would do nothing but complain about my cooking when I tried to make them dinner. My parents seesawed between being okay with this arrangement to throwing whatever shortcoming I had in my face when we argued, so we all agreed that the current situation wasn't ideal.\n\nSo after something like eight months of inconsistent work, my mother introduced me to a man who worked in the industry I wanted to work in and we hit it off. He offered to put a good word in with any of the places he worked with if I applied. So I looked at the job listings, and there weren't any office jobs available, but there was a front desk job at a homeless shelter available. Since I wanted to work in a humanitarian nonprofit field and my lack of front-facing experience had been a problem, I decided I should give it a shot. Plus, since it was less prestigious than the other positions I'd been aiming for, I thought I'd have a better chance of getting it and getting some coveted permanent full time work.\n\nI showed the listing to my mother as I got ready to bang out a cover letter, and she wasn't happy. She thought it'd be unsafe, which I thought was a fair concern from a mother and I made a note to ask about safety if I got an interview. But, due to her neurotic and anxious personality, she has a way of working herself up, and she kept repeating to me over and over in a ten minute period that she didn't think I should apply for that position, and eventually I snapped at her that I was applying so she should drop it.\n\nAnd then she said, \"Do you know how embarrassing it would be to ask a man I know professionally to help my daughter with a job like that?\"\n\nNow disclaimer, I know my mom is an elitist snob. She knows she's an elitist snob. I don't want to hear people bashing her about it because everyone in the family including her is aware of this.\n\nBut I lost my temper and I said in a nasty tone, \"I am not like you.\" This was meant to be a way of saying that I wasn't too proud to work in a job not in an office, but I didn't get to finish. She flew into a screaming rage, saying how dare I use that tone with her, and she chased me into my room. I tried hiding in my room and working on my cover letter, and she kept coming in to call me names and scream insults while I tried to ignore her, and eventually picked at me until I yelled at her that I couldn't stand living in the same apartment with her anymore. The next time she stormed in (while my dad was trying to play mediator and talk me down while I cried like an idiot), she slammed a check down for something like thirty thousand dollars and said that now I had the money to leave. Then she yelled some more insulting things and stormed out.\n\nWe hashed the argument out in therapy, but my mother never said that her behavior was unacceptable, and I really think it was. But then again, maybe mine was too. My mother felt like the hurt I caused with my tone was equal to or greater than any hurt she caused that night. Anyway, I've since moved out and a got a job that my mother turns her nose at, but it's a job that pays and she's trying to be supportive.\n\nSo, folks: was I the asshole?",

She does not have any form of custody of her children.\n\nMy sister has relapsed, again. She is an addict. She smoked weed and cigarettes the entirety of her first pregnancy. Her second, she added cocaine. And, her last, she added heroin. Since her last baby, she has been arrested, sent to rehab, run away from rehab, and has been relapsing. She has not spent more than 500 days total with any of her children. \n\nHer children all call her Momma and dote on her. But, her oldest is about at the age where he's starting to notice his mom only cares about partying. She comes into the kids' lives sporadically, and she can't stay sober, even when they're visiting. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I told her she needs to waive her parental rights unless she can get her shit together? She has already had her custody rights stripped by the court system,  as she failed multiple drug tests over the year after her daughter was born. While I know she loves her kids, I just don't think it's fair to her children to have a mom who cares more about getting high than them. ",

He's been emotional, unmotivated, has lost interest in everything he used to find enjoyable, is more tired, more hungry, etc. It's been really hard for him and I've been trying to help as much as I can because I also have depression so I understand exactly what he's going through. I'm not on any antidepressants because none have worked for me and I'd rather just deal with my depression since it's what I'm used to but I do think that he should be on some if they work for him and will make him feel better.\n\nHowever, I don't want him to start taking his antidepressants again because I know he just wants instant relief, which he won't get. The antidepressants take 2-4 weeks to work, and he has a med management appointment scheduled in about 2 weeks where he wants to see about getting prescribed a new antidepressants. \n\nWe were talking about this and he wasn't angry or anything, he understood what I was saying and agreed that I was right but he was still upset and I feel bad because I want him to feel better, but I really think he should wait until his med management appointment..

      "description": "Some context before I tell explain the situation i'm in. My parents are divorced and both get jealous when either me or my sister seem to pick a side with the other parent. \n\nSo a couple of days ago my Dad comes home and ask if I would like to attend my sister's softball game. Granted I had not attended one game all season and did not plan to attend any in the future. I told him that I was not really interested in going to the game with him. So fast forward to today, my mom is returning home from a business trip to Asia after 10 days. When she lands at the airport she finds out that my sister is currently playing a game and that she can still make the last quarter of it. My stepdad, who picked her up from the airport, did not want to go to the game so he dropped off my mom at the game. Because my sister has to stay after her game ends and watch the team after her play, my mom could not use my sister as a means to get home. So, my mom calls me and tells me to come to the game and watch the last quarter of it with her so that she has a ride home. Also I forgot to mention that my mom had no cash on her so she could not get into the game without me bringing up cash. So there would have been no point for me to drop off the cash then go home then instantly go back to pick her up after the game. \n\nSo my dad finds out that I went to my sisters softball game and calls me tonight cursing me out saying that what I have done is not right. I tried to explain to him the circumstance that led to me attending the game. He did not budge on his opinion of what had happened. Now he is demanding I hang up the keys to my car for the rest of the school year and use a much crappier car that we have instead.\n\nAnother fact that might be useful to the story is that my dad is a bit of a drinker. This is not the first time I have received a late night phone call where the likelihood of him being intoxicated came into question. However, usually within the next day or two i'll get another text from him saying that he did not mean most of what he said. I do not hate my dad for the person he is but he is getting in my head. I just really need to know if IATA here. I fully accept what you guys think of the situation and am ready to apologize if that is what needs to be done.",

Im still on my journey and not where I want to be due to plenty of ups and down (curse you side effects of medicine) but its a topic that came up in conversation between me and a friend. My friend is also obese. I personally dont think about it at all. I dont care if he's obese if he doesnt care and is happy. Its his body, his life, and Id never treat him differently because of his size.\n\n\n\nAs we were talking, I said that I finally am starting to be not fat, to which he told me I was never fat. Now, I definitely was. Im 5 ft 6.5 and I was almost 200 pounds when I started. Ive been fat long before we met. So I refuted his claim and said by definition, I was. So he asked me if I thought he was fat. And I said that technically he is. He seemed a little hurt and just said \"wow, ouch\" and we quickly moved on.\n\n\nI didnt mean to hurt his feelings, but I can see how I might be an asshole here. ",

      "description": "I live in a college suite (kind of like an apartment) with 5 others girls, one of them being \"J\". There are 3 bedrooms and one shared living room. The last couple weeks, I had been bringing my boyfriend over to hang out 2-3 times a week (never to sleep over, just for 2-4 hours), around 6 times total. 3 of these times was a weekend, while the other 3 have been during the weekday. We don't make out on the couch, but we do cuddle and do forehead kisses as we watch tv.\n\nI did not think that this was an outrageous amount of PDA, and the tv wasn't super loud but loud enough to be heard if you're in the living room. J had never communicated to me that she was uncomfortable with my boyfriend being around or me watching TV the whole time she had been living here. We don't have an unfriendly relationship, and I never gave her any indication that I didn't *want* to talk or be friends with her, we just never went past politeness.\n\nTonight, I was doing homework in the living room when she came in, and sat down and started doing homework or some schoolwork. Like ten minutes after she sat down, my boyfriend had come over and we sat on the couch, talked and I turned on the tv to watch a show. The volume was moderate, but my boyfriend and I were talking at normal volume.\n\nWhen he went to the bathroom, she yelled \"hey, do you have to watch that right now?\" I said no, and I turned it off. I was kind of stunned, because she never talks to me, and that she was yelling. She then said \"Well, aren't you going to apologize?\" So I did, and I told her that I never meant to make her distracted/uncomfortable and that if she ever needed me to just hang out in my room, I understood.\n\nShe then yelled at me that \"she shouldn't have to always tell me,\" despite not ever voicing any discomfort before. I apologized again, then I awkwardly sulked back to my room. In my experience a living room isn't a library-quiet space, so I hadn't thought to just watch the tv show on my earbuds, but I wasn't playing the show obnoxiously loud or talking loudly with my boyfriend. We have large desks in our bedrooms, and my roommate and I had always gone to our bedroom for a quiet place to do homework and study.\n\nIn hindsight, it was kind of an asshole move to have started watching tv while she was studying, as well as inviting my boyfriend and showing PDA in a shared living space. I totally understand why she was mad. But am I wrong to think she shouldn't have yelled at me? I'm not an unreasonable person, and if she had politely asked for some peace and quiet because she was studying I would've profusely apologized and gave her what she wanted.",

      "description": "So our new neighbours are taking advantage of our shared driveway. They constantly block it, despite our mutual conversations about idiots who decide to park across it, and subsequently make it impossible for us to get out of the driveway. \n\nAs mentioned, we have both discussed how annoying it is when people do this but they keeps doing it as well? I have an elderly grandma who could call me in an emergency and I would have to faff around trying to get them to move their car. Also, it’s very annoying when the driveway is blocked in the morning - I drive to work and have to ask them to move. We always park considerately and whenever we have guests (rarely), we ask them to park in a way that makes it easy for our neighbours to get out. Their guests, which they have at least 3/4 times a week, have no regard for where they park even when there’s masses of space available. We have asked them to move politely on several occasions, but they continue to do the same. \n\nOur council has a system where if someone is parked irresponsibly (e.g. blocking a drive way) we can call to get them a parking fine. So I did this. I know it’s not neighbourly, but it’s getting very annoying. Especially when they, too, get annoyed when others do the same. But, I do feel bad - I do not want them to feel any financial hardship etc. They have a decent income from what I understand, but that £70 could go towards food shopping. Ugh, I know that it seems like a silly situation but I feel very conflicted. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nI apologise that this is not the juiciest of situations here, but I would greatly appreciate your opinions.

On Monday she stayed home because Sunday was her birthday and she wanted a longer birthday weekend. She didn’t take me to school but I did see her in the morning however I forgot about this right away\n\nSo after school comes and I’m just sitting on my phone waiting until 3:03. 3:03 comes around and I go and look outside a wonder to see if I can see my moms car. I can do I walk out of the school and hop in the car. She instantly starts yelling at me claiming she has been there for 45+ minutes . I’m not gonna lie and say I apologized because I didn’t I probably should have but I didn’t. But I did say that I didnt think she was there. She said that I still should have looked because it what a responsible person would have done. I told her that it didn’t make sense for me to check if she was there if I didn’t think she was. She said it does and I should have. I then rebuttals by asking why she didn’t just call and she said that because she was trying to rush to get me she didn’t have time to grab it. That made me so mad that she couldn’t take responsibility and tried to blame it on me. I was also confused cuz if she was rushing how was she waiting for 45 minutes. I asked her this and she ignored me. Then she made a point to get the whole family but me Mc Donald’s but I didnt really care because I had pizza rolls. \n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "I (22M) work the closing shifts at a copy/print shop in downtown Toronto. Among other things, we have copy machines and computer terminals for people to use.\n\nA few nights ago a guy, roughly in his mid fifties, used one of the computers for a few hours, then got off right around closing time, 11pm. He argued with me over his bill for a few minutes before paying up and leaving. I checked a few other customers out while we were talking. \n\nA few minutes after the last customer left, he comes back inside, acting hysterical. He tells me that someone must have taken his wallet off the front desk while he was arguing with me a few moments ago. Immediately I jogged to the front entrance for a look around, then went over to the security computer to see if I could roll back the camera feed. I couldn’t; it was password protected.\n\nI went back over to him and told him that I wasn’t able to open the security feed, and that the thief was probably long gone already. I asked if he could come back tomorrow so that my boss could access the recordings, even offering to come in early so that the three of us could go over it together. He was furious at this, he got loud and demanded to use our front desk phone, or my personal phone, to call the police. He told me, very aggressively, that he wasn’t going anywhere until he’d filed a report and until the police had arrived. He told me that since the theft happened on my watch, I'd be in serious trouble for refusing to help him. \n\nI told him I was tired, that I had a class at 8am in the morning, and that a missing wallet that isn't likely to be recoverable isn't even going to put a dent in the list of priorities the police have. I told him I needed to close up shop and go home, and that I wasn't interested in placing a call and then waiting with him until maybe 2am for them to show up, or in dragging my boss out of bed to come in and do the same thing.\n\nHe flipped his lid a second time, stomped toward me, screamed in my face, called me a bunch of names, said that I was responsible for this and that I had no choice in helping him, then he sat down on a chair with his arms crossed and refused to get up to leave. I yelled back at him, told him he had a misguided understanding of the law, that I wasn't responsible for the whereabouts of his wallet and that he wasn't entitled to use our phone or to have me help him and that throwing a tantrum like a four year old wasn't going to get him anything that he wanted. I told him to gtfo and go settle his problems elsewhere. We argued back and forth for a long time, until eventually I started picking up his belongings and putting them outside the front door, then started moving and pushing him towards the door as well. It was nearly 40 minutes past close when I finally got him to leave. We haven't seen him in the store in the past couple days.\n\nAm I the asshole in this?",

      "description": "I'm a mod of a small discord server for fans of an internet music reviewer. All we do is talk music. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day a member joins and immediately starts calling out an inactive member (he used to edit for the music reviewer the server is based on) for being a nazi. He links tweets that are VERY borderline islamophobic. I say borderline because he doesnt encourage violence but still shows a strong despise for islam. He starts defending himself, saying he's not a nazi at all, and that he simply dislikes islam and all religions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I don't know what to do. The newcomer literally just comes here to tell us to ban someone. And he does so aggressively, he just pukes out all of his anger onto him, which doesn't help at all. I get pissed off at both and engage a conversation with the so called nazi, to see if he actually wants to debate. But he's too busy replying to the other, so I get ignored. However the other doesn't ignore me at all, he actually calls us out for supporting nazis, but we didn't know about these tweets and I can safely say that we disagree with every tweet. The chat becomes a mess, I insult the newcomer for hunting people online. I get off the chat to think for a second. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI DM the admin and we talk this through. We don't see a reason to ban the member. He's never active, and never talked about anything political, never debated or spread hate, so he didn't break any rules. I tell the admin that I want to ban the newcomer for his aggressive behavior, and because I think he's here for no reason, he would probably leave the server if we didn't ban the other person. The admin tells me to wait, since we agree on the latter part. The admin interrupts the chat and things cool down. The newcomer keeps talking in a passive aggressive way, trying to start the fight again, so I say that i'd ban him if he kept talking about that, even if I'd lose my mod role. This server is only for music, I can't stand people that ruins the chat by bringing politics. The admin yields and tell me to go for it. I ban the dude. The other one stays silent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater, I see a post about it in the subreddit of the music reviewer. They added that the editor in question, after working with the music reviewer, worked with an alt right symphatizer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery time I encounter someone that has extreme views (in this case, on religion), there're always people that act aggressively or insult them.

      "description": "One of my best friends has a new girlfriend of about 6 months. Before I met her, I was told that she had some chronic pain problems. I was unsure about how bad and even asked if walking around a lot (our double date required a lot of walking) was going to be OK. I was told sure, no problem. During the date, I’m being nice, trying to get to know her and all I could really get to know about her is her illness, she doesn’t work or go to school. Now, I also have a chronic illness, it’s in remission but nonetheless, I can relate and am aware that some illnesses are invisible. However, it did put me off a little that as soon as I introduced myself, she went right into talking about her illness. This made me feel a certain way for many reasons, mainly that I was afraid that she might hinder my friend’s goals as well as him taking on a caretaker role. Before he met her, he had plans to start a clothing line and seemed excited about it. Few weeks after the date, just me and my friend are hanging out, and I told him that while she seemed nice, I was concerned about some things, mainly that she didn’t work or go to school and that may interfere with his plans/life. I am admittedly a skeptical person and can be distrusting, and everything I was seeing, and hearing was contradictory, so I did mention that it seemed odd that she was drinking (despite being on many medications) and that she was fine to walk around for a few hours. Another example, I was told their sex life is fine and they have no issues with it, she has no pain during. Then I talked more about how I was concerned that she did not work or go to school and if there were plans for that, even suggesting online school or maybe part time desk work. I also expressed concern about him taking on such a big responsibility of essentially a caretaker and that it may hinder his clothing line goals and other things in his life (for example, he complained he was gaining weight now even though he’s always been big into working out). He was very appreciative and grateful for watching out for him and basically praised me for being a great friend. Flash forward to present, I find out that my friend told his girlfriend what I said, taking it out of context and saying I said she was faking her illness and that I did not believe her – not mentioning anything else I said. He also said he doesn’t need my concern, he’s a grown man. He was also upset that “why would I even question her because sometimes she can’t even walk up the stairs.” Now he’s upset he’s the middle man and thinks me and her need to talk about it. I asked him if he could connect us again so I could explain and apologize. Thinking it over though, I feel like I don’t owe an apology because he shouldn’t have told her those things to cause this rift between us. Also, I didn’t even say the things he says I said, so I wouldn’t even know what I would be apologizing for. AITA? Should I actually apologize? ",

      "description": "A friend of mine and I have been doing this thing for a few weeks--basically escalating dares. Every few days or so one of us dares the other to do something, and then the next time vice versa. We staked $100 on it, and the first one who caved and refused to go through with it had to pay up. \n\nIt's been getting tougher, and finally last week, after he dared me to staple my hand and I did it, I dared him to ask his sister for a blowjob and to be as convincing as possible. I thought he was going to refuse and I would win, but then he said he'd go through with it. \n\nObviously I had to know he actually did it, so he called me and left the phone on while he went to go ask her. He actually sounded pretty convincing. Obviously she said no. Thought he was joking at first (well technically he was), but when he kept insisting she finally got mad and kicked him out. \n\nI hung up right away and laughed my ass off, but the next day he calls me pissed off saying his sister's furious at him. She won't believe him when he tells her I dared him to do it. He's scared she's going to tell his parents and they'll think he was actually serious.\n\nIt's been like three days now and he's still angry. Honestly I don't think he has any right to be mad at me. I didn't *make* him do it. It's not like I twisted his arm or anything. It was a dare that he went through with of his own free will. ",

      "description": "I live in a townhouse next to a woman who is known to be very particular about her property. When we first moved in, I had a charity come pick up a piece of furniture and they were blocking her driveway. (They had to block either her driveway or my other neighbor’s driveway so they could walk the item down my driveway and onto the truck.) They hadn’t even been there for more than a minute when she came outside, demanding that they move the truck. She said she would be leaving in a couple minutes and I told her that they had one piece of furniture to pick up and would be gone shortly. She immediately got into her car, which forced them to move, and then drove around the block. By the time she returned, they were already gone.\n\nWhen the neighbor on the other side of her was having some work done, the crew needed to use her lawn to access part of his house. She told them to keep off her property which made their job more difficult.\n\nEver since then, I’ve warned our contractors about her and that they need to stay off of and away from her property. When we had our roof replaced a couple months ago, I told the salesman about her and he relayed it to the crew. The roofing crew was awesome! There were a couple workers on the ground whose sole job was to collect any debris that had missed the dumpster. They were very neat and I didn’t find any trash in any adjacent neighbors’ yards.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. My neighbor informed me that she was having her roof replaced and that I should move my car so that nothing falls on it. My husband told me that nothing should fall on it as the crew should be tidy but I moved it anyway. At one point, I noticed that there were shingles and other debris all over our driveway and yard so it’s a good thing I moved my car. There was even debris stuck in our tree, shingles in our yard and on our deck, and they used part of our walkway to house their supplies! I texted my husband and he was furious. He demanded that I tell her about it. \n\nShe wasn’t home so I texted her and said, “Could you please have the crew clean up our driveway? There are shingles and other debris all over. Also, they placed materials in our yard and walkway. Thanks!” I included a picture. She texted back, “I will call them. It’s kind of hard to avoid though when you’re having your roof replaced.” I did not respond but I was furious, considering she would have blown a gasket had this happened to her.\n\nSo AITA?\n",

      "description": "Disclaimer: I'm from Russia, English is not my first language, sorry for weird phrasing. TL;DR at the bottom of the post \n\nMe and my bf rent a studio apartment in an apartment building. Our next door neighbor is a really old lady. She barely walks and is practically deaf. \n\nEvery other day she comes to our apartment door for whatever help she might need: to open a jar or a bottle, to change a light bulb etc. Sometimes she asks us to buy her something in a grocery store (we never take any money from her even though she tries to pay us back). She is really nice and it's never been a problem really. \n\nThe only actual issue I have with her is the way she knocks on our door. We don't have a doorbell, so she takes her keys and knocks violently on our keyhole. Sometimes she comes to us early in the morning on the weekends, and waking up to this clanging is awful. Sometimes she needs something while one of us is in the shower or while we are having sex or whatever, and she doesn't stop knocking until we open the door. She doesn't stop knocking even if we yell asking her to wait for a sec, due to her lack of hearing.\n\n Our landlord told us that she doesn't have any relatives or friends in the city, so she can't call anyone else to help her I guess. I suspect that she might have some sort of a social worker visit her from time to time (her apartment is really clean and her fridge is always full even though she barely walks etc), but I have never seen them. I don't mind helping her but all this knocking drives me insane. We tried asking her to stop knocking so vigorously, but she forgets things and every time it's the same thing.\n\nSometimes I can't help but think what happens if we stop answering the door at all. She might start going to other people for help, but our other next door neighbor is really shady and weird, other people who live on our floor are also quite old, and I don't think she'll go on other floors. I'm heavily guilt-tripped even thinking about stopping helping her, but sometimes I feel like she's using us for doing even the smallest things and she must know that we can't say no to her \n\nSo, would we be assholes if we stopped answering the door for this lady?\n\nTL;DR: Our next door neighbor always comes to us for help, she knocks on the door as if she wants to wake up the Satan himself. WIBTA if I started ignoring her? ",

      "description": "Sorry in advance, I know this will get long just so I can paint the picture.\n\nMeet Janet, she's 35 with the brains of a 12 year old. Not really but we all agree she's missing screws in her head. About 18 years ago she meet uncle Joe after he returned to Colombia from Europe, and had a crush on him. She lived down the road but would spend most of the time at aunt Rosa's house. So much that no one noticed when she never left. Aunt Rosa was old and sick and she would help her. Eventually they started paying her, plus she's never payed for any living expenses other than her personal stuff. Joe eventually started sleeping with her when he had no one else. Was never a secret that it was just sex but she fell in love. Only she was also sleeping around and got pregnant.  Joe was done with her, and after his mom died he moved  to my grandpa's house where he could help with the yard and stuff. Janet stayed with some of my cousins at the city house but after years of paying her for her help around the house and the fact that she kept turning jobs down, even said no to getting a paid for education, my uncles were getting sick of it and cut her pay, after all she wasn't doing much after aunt Rosa died. Still insurance, food and board were being covered for both her and her daughter Lily. She started visiting grandpa's house on the weekends and it so happened that aunt Pearl got sick and needed to be cared for. Perfect opportunity for her. She moved in to this house with her daughter and same deal. Everything is covered plus she gets a paycheck. \n\nMy family (husband and 3 teens) move back home so we can build our house. We're staying here, we have a whole floor to ourselves. My 12 yo cousin lives here and 2 other little ones are here when school is out. Since we moved in any time we do anything as a family we include all the kids. We know that otherwise they wouldn't have those little experiences like the zoo, parks, movies, pool, etc. especially Lily, I even taught her to swim. We've had to pay for transportation just so we can bring them. As soon as we moved in Janet made me her kids tutor, homework helper because she doesn't know any of it. We're talking 2nd grade. But for everything she calls me. Can you brush ger hair? Can you take her to church? Can you take her to a party? Etc, Etc...At first I didn't have any problem helping. Then it became obvious it wasn't my choice. Lily would get home from school and Janet would tell her go so Jen can help you. She would come upstairs and would sit and stare at me until I would help her. I decided I would help but on my terms, when I was available and I made sure to tell Janet. \n\nLily has behavior problems, and because Janet doesn't do anything about it it's only getting worse. If she doesn't get her way she starts screaming, horror movie style. Doesn't matter the time of day. Every meal Janet fights with her to eat and it takes her an hour. Cousin Matt was setting the tree with all the kids. The deal was they had to eat their lunch to help. We thought it would help Lily eat her lunch without the usual fight. Instead it turned into a fiasco where she tried to break the tree. It was so bad that Joe was going to dump her in a water tank to cool her off but Janet didn't allow it because she was wearing new clothes. Btw even though Joe is not the dad and does nothing for them Janet got Lily calling him dad which he didn't stopped because he felt bad, but he doesn't care for them. Yeah he's a jerk and I don't see what she sees. \n\nI've had to deal with some of her behavior when we're out and I told Janet she needs to do something about it because I can't be taking her out and have her act like that just because. At the zoo one day we left the platter we got our lunch with in front of her and instead of moving it or asking that we move it she took of running and screaming. At the pool one day same thing because she had to get out. Next time we went to the pool for a family birthday Janet try to tell me not to upset Lily like the time before and I said \"Oh the minute she starts acting up I'm calling you so you can pick her up because I'm not ruining our day because of her tantrums.\" Well Instead of telling her to behave she didn't let her go. Which I was OK with. Fast forward a couple of weeks and we have another pool party. I went to help set up earlier and came home to pick them up. Janet asked me if we were coming back and I said \"probably after we're done with the pool so we can change.\" She had Lily run to get her stuff and got her in the car without saying a word to us. Obviously I'm keeping an eye on her but thought it was kind of weird. \n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back happened on Christmas day. We had a lot of people over. The set up here is the living rooms are outside but under the roof, with a wrap around covered  porch. Lily decided she was going to rollerblade with my cousin's daughter who was here. I asked them to stick to the back of the house because we had visitors. As soon  as they went around Lily decided she wasn't going to do that. My aunt Mary saw her coming and told her to turn around and go back,  which she ignored. I looked at her and said \"I already told you to stay on the other side. Turn around\" which she ignored and kept going. Janet said it was OK because she was on the outer side which I reply with \"You're the problem. You don't do anything about it and that's why she's so naughty.\" Janet said we had to stop being so hard on her, and Lily started crying and said she wasn't going to rollerblade anymore. I said I didn't care and that this behavior would not have been acceptable when grandpa was alive. Which everybody agreed with and started telling anecdotes about the times they got in trouble. Janet and Lily went to their room for a while. All the other kids played and picked everything up. A few hours later Lily came out with the plastic bows the other kids got and started playing with my other cousins kids. But left the bows out on the ground when they were done. My aunt Olive asked them to bring them inside but Janet said it was the younger kids earlier. Aunt Olive told her we had witness her take them out. My cousin Sussy called her kids to bring them in to which Lily said we don't have to because it wasn't us. I got up picked them up and said to Lily right in front of Janet \"since you can't put them away you can't play with them anymore. And by the way you're grounded and I don't want to see you upstairs.\" We have a gaming room setup and Joe actually had grounded her like that after the Christmas tree deal. I came upstairs to bring the bows up and heard crying downstairs. I thought it was Lily,  but turns out it was Janet. She went to her room crying, but because no one followed she came back to the family room still crying. When asked what the problem was by a friend she told him that she was sick of us humiliating Lily ALL THE TIME. I didn't hear any at that time and I'm glad.\n\nNormally when I get upset I cool off and then I'm back to normal. I usually try to talk to whoever the problem was with, or just move on. I don't hold on to things. Except until morning when aunt Olive told me that Bob had told her what she said and he was shocked because he's seen us with Lily and it's always like she's another of our kids. My cousin Sussy also told me she also told her we humiliate them too much. I haven't been able to let it go, I keep hearing humiliate and it makes my blood boil. I've decided to cut them off. I know it's hard being on the same house but I'm just going on about my day like I don't see or hear them. I think the fact that I've taken from my kids to give to her kid and she's saying that I humiliate her just broke my heart. \n\nMy aunt Mary wants me to let it go, but honestly knowing how Janet plays the victim and that she is saying that I can't. I feel that if I humiliate her so much why does she still stick me with her.\n\nSo AITA for not taking her crap anymore?\n",

      "description": "Hi Reddit. I’m on my mobile, this is a throw away, yadda yadda yadda. \n\nAm I (23f) the asshole because I think my boyfriend (25m) should eat healthier? He’s constantly ordering in food, picking up food, going through drive thru’s as well as going to  restaurants whenever he wants something to eat. He NEVER eats at home, even when we have food in the fridge/cupboard, he would much rather order food in or go get it. \n\nAbout a month ago I suggested that we try doing meal prep and exercising as our new year resolution. He seemed to think this was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever suggested. He said that he doesn’t need to exercise because he isn’t overweight. Which is true. He isn’t in shape, but he also isn’t obese by any means. \n\nI respected his decision and started working out and eating healthy alone. I’ve been going to the gym 5-6 times a week, after I usually come home and make myself something healthy to eat. He always says no when I offer to make him something too (obviously) and orders in something he’d prefer. Lately, however, he’s been asking if I can pick him up something on the way home from the gym. His suggestions are usually fast food which irritates me a lot, because now I have to wait to make something healthy for myself even though I’m hungry. I’ve expressed this to him and he casually laughs and says ‘don’t get me anything then’. Okay fine. \n\nAnyways, today I went to the gym and worked out for about 1 1/2 hours. As I was leaving I stopped at a smoothie bowl place to grab something healthy to enjoy until I headed to work later. My boyfriend was so mad that I didn’t offer to go somewhere ELSE for him as I got “take out” for myself. As a reply I said ‘well you don’t seem to like healthy things lately and I don’t wish to support that habit.’ And he got in his car and left our house. \n\nHelp me out, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "This came up yesterday during dinner with my SO. I am head of production in a medium sized company. When I am hiring I’ll get applications from HR and check them. At that point applicants have received a short standardized mail that we thank them for their interest and we Willens time to check the application. I usually check my inbox (it’s a separate one for applications) daily and, as hard as it sounds, Filter out the bad ones in probably less then 2min per application. Almost always I don’t check these a second time since I heave a few good ones to continue working with. Now comes the AITA part: since I check daily I could give applicants a direct feedback that they won’t get the job, sometimes maybe very few hours after the standardized mail. But I don’t. I wait a few days to tell them (or actually let them be told, as long as I did not have personal contact to applicants HR tells them. Only when I have mail or phone contact myself I tell them personally via the channel I used to communicate with them). My SO says I am an asshole for letting them hope for a few days even though I’m sure they won’t get the job. I think it’s very hard to get a negative feedback within hours, it’s like „yeah I didn’t need much time to consider it’s clear  your no it“ which is actually true (now that I am typing it I realize I may actually be an asshole). Other reason why I think I am in the right: you can’t expect an application to be answered in a few hours, I doesn’t take longer than normal my way. I could maybe think of more but I guess you have enough to judge.",

      "title": "AITA for arguing with my mother on how she feeds her animals?",
      "description": "My mother has three cats (8yrs, 2yrs, 1yr) and a black cockatoo (4yrs). When I finished uni and went on break, she asked me to move back home and, instead of paying rent, to help out with the animals and housework. This specifically meant entire responsibility over the cats, but not the bird. I was happy to move back in (I love these cats to death). However, a few weeks after I moved in I noticed some oddities with their feeding schedule.\n\nI was told the bird picks at food throughout the day and comes in at night, so only needs a bowl of food in the morning (a mix of fresh nuts, fruit, veggies). This is the specific diet for this bird: bc he was born with a calcium deficiency (broken wing/foot and twisted spine), he NEEDS the nutrients from these food groups to keep his bones strong. But he doesn't eat during the day...\n\nBc mother feeds him HUMAN FOOD at night. She feeds him anything she's eating (bread and butter, baked beans, noodles, bacon, chips, etc.) and there is a bowl of sunflower seeds sitting on the bench for him to eat at any time. He shouldn't be eating sunflower seeds all the time bc of his calcium deficiency. They're ok as a treat, but all the time? I brought this up and she said \"oh, stop it! They're just sunflower seeds!\" Which annoys me, bc SHE told ME not to feed him sunflower seeds. Bit contradictory, don't you think?\n\nAlso, he EATS AT THE TABLE WITH US! No shit! When we're eating dinner, he is ON THE TABLE walking around EATING OFF EVERYONE'S PLATE! Mashed potatoes, steak, egg, nachos... you name it. I always tell her that I don't want to eat at the table with him, and she just calls me mean. Mean? It's a BIRD, FFS! He doesn't like eating what he's meant to eat during the day, so he just waits until 5pm when he's brought in so he can get WHATEVER HE WANTS. I've told her plenty of times that she's gotta stop letting him sit at the dinner table, but she just says, \"What do YOU know? I can feed him what I want!\"\n\nThis is also an issue with the cats. Our male cat is ALWAYS hungry. He is always eating food and it gets to a point where he starts eating the other cats' food. So when it comes to feeding time we have to physically prevent him from eating all the food (btw he is given more food than the other two). I was instructed by my mother to feed them a pack of mince at 5pm and then put a double dish of food out at 7pm so they can eat through the night.\n\nMother comes home from lunch and feeds them a pack of mince. I said to her, \"they'll get mince tonight, so why are you feeding them now?\" And she said, \"But they wait for me to come home so they can eat lunch with me!\" Um, what? So you've been feeding them at lunch too? Sometimes the youngest cat doesn't eat at lunch and she gets angry at her, but I'm here like \"Don't overfeed her, bc it's obvious she's not hungry!\" Again, I'm blown off by mother.\n\nSo, she feeds them once at lunch and twice at night. What was the straw that broke the camel's back? Woke up early one morning (she leaves at 7am), walk into the kitchen and SHE'S FEEDING THEM MORE MINCE!!!\n\nI was ROPABLE! I couldn't believe she was feeding them AGAIN! Now I know WHY the male cat is always thinking about food - bc he gets fed FOUR LARGE MEALS a day! That's more than I eat in a day. He gets three lots of mince a day and sometimes he gets a slab of it all to himself!\n\nWhen she came home that day I tried to have a serious conversation about her overfeeding the animals. I told her that if she keeps overfeeding them they'll get overweight, especially our boy. I also told her that the cockatoo needs to stop eating what we eat and solely eat his fresh food. She got defensive and talked down at me like I was five again. She basically told me that I don't know anything, that I'm always on her case and need to mind my own business. Her house, her rules.\n\nI took the male cat to the vet to check his weight. Vet said that although he's not overweight, he is getting very close to being so and that if he doesn't stop eating as much as he does, he WILL be overweight and it'll be hard for him to get out of his eating habits. He said it will be near impossible if he's being fed at the same time as the other cats bc he'll be thinking about eating their food more than his own. Vet recommended different feeding times for the cats.\n\nThis didn't go down well with mother. She called it bullshit and a waste of time. She also said I'm full of shit and need to learn to zip it. Her house, her rules... I told her if you're just gonna keep doing this then they won't be my responsibility anymore, and walked off.\n\nAITA for nagging her about this? Am I overstepping a boundary? She's not abusing them - they are very loved - but she is overfeeding them and she instructed me to take responsibility over them. I don't want this to go bad and have her turn this all on me and say it's my fault. Also, our agreement was that I took care of them in exchange for having a place to stay, so I feel bad that I am shrugging off this responsibility bc it didn't go my way. Sometimes I think she thinks the overfeeding thing is funny, bc she always laughs about feeding them lots. I thought it was funny the first time, but now that I know how much she's feeding them I'm not laughing.\n\nLmk what everyone thinks.\n\nTl;dr Move home to help mother with pets and found out she overfeeds them (4+ times a day), but every time I say anything I'm told it's not my place to speak out.",

      "description": "Tl;Dr - my moms new husband called my dad and 15 year old brother sand n*****s and I havent spoken to my mom since..\n\nLong story, but days before Thanksgiving this year my dad had my brother for the weekend (my mom sent him to boarding school without my dads permission while my dad was doing business in the middle east.) Well, it was time for my brother to go back to school so my mother and her husband \"bob\" went to pick him up. It's a 30 minute drive for them and they arrived some time around 9am on a Sunday. My brother wasn't ready cause he takes forever so instead of calling him Bob decided to lay on his horn. My dad just moved into this beautiful development and didnt want to disturb his neighbors on a sunday morning so he went outside, asking Bob what the hell his problem is and that's not how he gets his son attention. \n\nThis turns into a vocal fight between the two while Bob hides in his truck with my mother sitting passenger, he had his window down enough he could shout at my father. Meanwhile my brother is freaking out (its suspected he has anxiety disorder so he doesn't handle altercations well) calling me while I'm at work so I'm listening to the yelling go down while trying to calm my brother down. My father finally had enough and told my mom and Bob that they will not be getting my brother that day, they can pick him up from boarding school so no more contact would happen between the two. As my dad grabs my brother by the shoulder to take him in, Bob screams out that they are just dirty sand n*****s, and speeds off. \n\nI messaged my mother asking what the hell happened and she told me she didnt want to talk about it over text messages, so we meet up and talk with my brother. He tells me every detail while my mother sits there denying everything that happened not knowing I was on the phone listening to everything. We finally agreed that my brother and I will not be coming around Bob anymore and that we will just have to have monthly dinners with my mom. I then texted my grandmother and let her know my boyfriend, brother and I will not be coming to Thanksgiving since Bob will definitely be there. \n\n(Word for word : \"Hey Gram, unfortunately due to an incident that happened with my mother and Bob, we will not be coming to Thanksgiving this year, sending my love ❤\" she responded by saying she hopes I wont be going to my fathers Thanksgiving since hes mostly to blame??? I dont see how..)\n\nWe went to my dads Thanksgiving and had a great time and took a family portrait (it was our second Thanksgiving with our father so he wanted a picture with all of my siblings). I posted it on Facebook with a heart caption and my mom messaged me that I posted it to rub it in her face that my dad has all of us and she doesnt want to speak to me ever again, that I betrayed her and I'm brainwashed by my dad. We haven't spoken since, and I dont want to speak to her but I feel so guilty... i love my mom but everyone around me says she fucked up and all I did was defend my brother. She didnt say the n word but she definitely defended Bob for saying it..\n\nSince then my dad has gotten full custody, put my brother in the school down the road from him and all in all my brother is very happy, he is very family oriented and being away from all of us hurt him incredibly. Hes happy, getting good grades and I dont think he thinks much about it (hopefully) but I'm just so hurt and confused..\n\n(Also a little back story, my mom met Bob on tindr and they got married 6 months later. He's white, Republican and very sexist/racist. He served in the military for a while and is a veteran. My dad is Arab, he moved to this country to start a family. My parents were married for 20 some years but got a divorce in 2014-15. It was just a very toxic relationship and I'm happy they separated. I wanted the divorce to happen long ago, if that makes sense.)\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to speak to her again? I feel so broken, I never thought I would go without my mom, I love her so much but she clearly made her choice. Should I reach out to her? I'm just not sure reddit... I have yet to open up to my therapist about all of this. I've been a wreck for months..",

They’re lovely parents and I know they want grandchildren. It’ll make them so happy.\n\nBut I just don’t want kids.

Even now they’re pretty poor and don’t really have any retirement funds (I’m secretly putting 5K into a money market account every year just for them for when they retire). \n\nNow that I have money and have worked so hard as they have inspired me to do so, I just want to enjoy myself and am too afraid I won’t be able to. I want to be able to retire early. I want to live stress free without kids. I don’t want to be scraping for money because of them. \n\nI haven’t discussed this viewpoint with my gf.

Before this for about a year or so, I was living with her and her folks because my father and stepmom ended up giving me the boot over defending my younger brother from the elders attempts to steal cash, pot, among other things from him.\n\nFlash to current time, on thanksgiving I ended up sleeping until about 4:00 PM (yeah, very late I know) but my past 2-3 months have been nothing but OT, lining things up for the move, and the actual act of. Attempt to get ahold of parents to meet at my grandmothers place and just get a text response saying “We already left”.

We do it for fun, but are trying to be a little more professional on the long run, so this weekend we decided to go to the biggest fair in our country to network a bit. \nOne of the guys just moved to the city it is in, we other two had to drive across the country to participate and shared the ride. I took my bf cause I'm disabled and needed his assistance, so we wanted to split the gas threeways and would stay at our other friends house for the nights to keep the costs low. On top my bf had to pay for the entrance of three days, we bought the tickets online before.\nWe arrived there, had a nice day and in the evening went to our friends house to relax a bit, but the guy we came with already seemed tense and in a bad mood by that point. Half way through the night he took me and my bf aside and asked, if we could drive home, there was an emergency at home he had to attend to. \nObviously we weren't thrilled, but as he claimed it was important we told him we could leave asap.\nWe packed our stuff and left an hour later in the middle of the night, leaving a disappointed host, who had set up a lot for us to be comfortable (also he has a gf with social anxiety who overcame quite a lot of accepting us in her home).\nHe speeded home over 6 hours straight, we all were tired (hadn't slept since Thursday morning cause I was so excited for the fair and we had to leave very early) and I tried keeping him awake cause his driving style just was insanely dangerous and I wanted to at least keep an eye on him. \nWe arrived home at 6 in the morning, all mentally and physically finished and went to bed straight away, deciding to talk about the financial point later.\nYesterday evening he contacted me and asked for the money. The way back nearly had been double the cost of the way there, cause he speeded that much and he told us the outcome and our part of it. I agreed on the sum and asked him, if everything was alright at home and what happened when he arrived. \nAnd as he told me what all this was for I lost it. \nHis girlfriend (19 y/o, we're all 26 and aren't the most fondest of their relationship cause it's always trouble) wanted him home, cause they spent way not enough time in her opinion and she wanted him home right away or she'd leave him (she knew what we were doing at the fair and that we were with him).\n\nI asked him, if he was serious, because he talked about a family emergency and I thought of someone who might have been in hospital or something of that kind, but nope - just her being a B' and him being a pushover.\n\nI told him under these circumstances I wouldn't pay a cent more than the way there and max. the same amount for the way back, not the extra money for his speeding or anything else. We already sat on the Online-Tickets we bought and couldn't use and the whole weekend was ruined for this.\n\nSo: AITA in this situation?\n",

      "description": "I'm a professional DJ and my friend who is also a DJ is performing at a music festival the beginning of next year.  \n\n\nI have a DJ setup at my home that I use and often let people come over to practice because the equipment is expensive, so many performers don't own it.  \n\n\nMy friend called me and asked if she could come over to practice on my setup at my apartment the last week of December because her show is the week after. However, I told her that's not possible because I'll be back at my parents the end of the month. My roommate will also not be home either so nobody will be home while she's at my place.  \n\n\nBack when I lived on my own, I used to let her come to my apartment while I wasn't home because it was just me - and I'm okay with it. However, because there's another person living with me now, I don't think its fair for him for my friend to be over when it's his space as well. She wants me to ask him, but I don't feel comfortable doing that because I don't want to put my roommate and I in a weird position. I tell her I don't want to ask him.  \n\n\nShe says in a sarcastic tone \"Thanks for having a helpful attitude,\" and I told her that she's being rude and entitled so I hang up the call.  \n\n\nShe texts me afterward by saying that I'm not being a good friend because I refuse to go out of my way to ask my roommate in order to help her or provide her alternative suggestions. I tell her she's being entitled because I feel uncomfortable and she's not getting her way.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Me and some of my friends started this early college program so we're all around 16 and taking highschool classes alongside college classes. We were all doing well at the beginning of the semester until one of my friends and her family went on a cruise for a week in the middle of the year. When she got back she missed a big chunk of assignments for most of her classes. Me and the rest of the group tried to help her get caught up but once we stopped helping so we could work on our own stuff, she would just fuss about failing her classes while hangin with her friends in between classes. I even tried just giving her the answers to math. One day she just point blank just said she had a paper due for her next class and asked if she was gonna do it she said no. Now she's saying she failed and has to pay for the class now. She doesn't talk to us anymore and my other friends feel bad for her but I don't. I don't want her to fail but I feel no remorse for it. Is that bad? Everybody else is sorry for her except me.\n\nTL:DR: Friend is failing her classes and people are sorry for her except me.",

Since the start of the relationship he has not stopped worrying about his hair. It \\*\\*absolutely\\*\\* consumes him. I fully respect this as an insecurity of his and have bought him Viviscal, I do his hair on nights out to look thicker, suggested shampoos and researched thinning treatments, I tell him that I don't care if he goes bald and that I'll love him whatever happens (obviously it's not exactly about what I think, moreso that he is just upset at his hair thinning). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kept up the sympathy for years until recently, so lately we'll have a heated discussion about how I can't keep up with the persistent questions about his hair that I have answered a million times before. \"Does it look thin?\", \"Does it look thinner than last week?\". I feel like an asshole for being annoyed at it but it feels like 1.) I'm trying to help and it's not going anywhere and 2.) It sucks that his hair is thinning but I have a \"fuck it\" philosophy. If it's not something you can control then there's no point worrying about it. Not that he can just decide to think the same way that I do but I truly believe that's probably the healthiest way to deal with it. In all honesty, I'm just upset that it bothers him so much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I right in thinking I'm being a bit of an asshole? Do I just put up with it and hide my annoyance? ",

      "title": "AITA for backing out of an agreement to go to church?",
      "description": "New user here, sorry if I'm doing anything wrong.\n\nA bit of info before I jump in, I'm seventeen, non-religious (was raised that way), but because my extended family members are religious, and because I attended a semi-private Catholic school for ten years, I don't really mind going to church, though really I'd rather not go at all.\n\nAbout two weeks ago I got approached by two women while I was walking home. They came to me and asked me to do a survey, and I agreed, mostly out of panic and having no guts to say no. It was then that I realised I had been approached by two women from a church. These women preach for a bit about their church, their volunteer work, and how they'd like to invite me to their church to learn more about their faith. At this point in time ANY smart person who wasn't interested would just say no, but let's recall, I have no guts. After shooting down all my excuses and pointing out all the dates I could go, I just cave to them and pick a random date.\n\nThe day nears, and one of the women who I had given my number to messages me about coming with her to the church, to which I ask for a reschedule because I didn't really feel like going to church. At the same time I ask her for more information about her church, and she gives me their website. I then ask my religious friends to join me, and they agree, so I give them information on the church, tell them the date, and thank them. When they message me back, they basically say something along the lines of \"hey this looks like a cult\".\n\nTo give some info about the church, it was set up in South Korea in the 1960s, believe in a \"God the Mother\", and a UK branch had received the Queen's award for volunteer service a few years ago.\n\nI immediately get concerned, do a bit of searching, and find some nasty stuff of them from other countries, but nothing from mine, so I decided to ask about it. I ask the woman if the church was a cult, and she responded that her church wasn't a cult because they had gotten the Queen's award. She also argued that I shouldn't trust articles about them online because they could be false, and that other churches were spreading rumours about them because they were jealous about their larger membership. She also said that I should come down to her church to learn for myself, something that I wasn't comfortable with anymore because I felt that their argument didn't answer my initial question, so I backed out and apologised.\n\nToday is Thursday, the day I rescheduled and therefore should have gone to the church had I not backed down. I've been doing a bit of thinking about it, and I feel kinda bad for making that agreement with those women. A part of me keeps telling me that I wasted their time and that I should have just given them a chance, that I should have just humoured them. When I look through my messages my last apology to them is still there and I keep feeling really shitty about it, like I could have done things more amicably, or avoided the whole thing altogether, that the women were really nice and I betrayed them in someway, especially when I asked about their church being a cult and everything. What if it really wasn't a cult? What if I was wrong and had massively offended them?\n\nWas I an asshole for not going to this church, even though I had already agreed?\n\n**TL;DR got invited to a church on the street, and I agreed because I was spineless, but I was eventually warned not to go because the church seemed to be a cult, and ended up backing out, hence breaking the agreement.**",

      "description": "I have a long time friend who is a very shy loner and who I was his only friend. Beacause of that I have been bringing him around and or introducing him to my other friends and helping him break out of his shell in a way. We had gotten very into doing LAN parties at our apartments with said group of friends who we also play online with. This is where the issue really began because, for some odd reason everytime we got the group together (especially in person) to do an activity he always seamed to try and bully me. He would often make jokes at my expense, which i can deal with, and if we were playing a game he would grief me even if we were on the same team, that might all be fine but he would also often try to get the rest of the group to join in too, sometimes they would but they would stop when i was annoyed, he would not. For example he would friendly fire me and knock me out of the round and then insult me and try to egg the group on to grief or insult me he would do it over and over round after round basicly not allowing me to play until he got bored of it. I just took it for a while but after a few times I started calling him on it in private. He told me he did realize he would \"act out\" in front of groups of people to try and get them to like him, but that he didnt mean it and would work to avoid it. It didnt stop he kept doing it to the point where i would just stop playing games with him or just not go to the lan party. This is where i think i might have been an asshole because I had decided to play a game with him and our group although this time we were playing online. Well as soon as he began to try and grief me by shooting at me, I imediately grabbed a gun for my self and downed him, I then pretended to revive him until his time ran out. I then called him out in front of all our friends for being a child and trying to grief me to get a laugh with my other friends, they all agreed with me, and I proceeded to draw the game out as long as possible so he could not play. I did this every time he tried to play with us to the point he just logged off without a word. Am I an asshole for this?",

      "description": "So my 4 friends and I were planning a multi-country trip to Europe for 2 weeks in June. I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to sign up for the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card for the sign up bonus since well have plenty of time before we actually go on our trip. The signup bonus is if you spend $4,000 in the first 3 months and receive 50,000 pts which is roughly $500-$625. They kind of shrugged it off like it was nothing and I ended up being the only one that signed up and was planning on buying visa gift cards over the span of the next 3 months to hit $4,000 spent. But instead we used my new credit card to pay for the plane tickets since we bought it as a bundle of 5 and it came out to $3942. So basically i hit my mark. Then the next day we were talking about the trip and one of my friends said oh we can use the points you got towards all our train tickets and my other friends agreed. Then I said no because those are my points. I told them from the beginning they could sign up for this deal and they all just ignored me. Then they said how I was shady and greedy for not wanting to share the travel points and that it's because of their collective effort that I was able to obtain the points in the first place. But I mentioned that I could've just bought visa gift cards which was my original plan and they just kept saying that I was sketchy. Then one of them said if you're really going to be this greedy then just refund the tickets and I'll buy mine on my own. So I refunded the tickets and decided that I didn't want to spend 2 weeks in a foreign country with these guys if they were really going to be this petty.",

      "description": "Working hard to meet the character limit, so excuse the concision in this complicated matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue: whenever anything meaningful to me happens in my life, I choose to not mention it to my mom at all. Since quite some time she doesn't get to know what brought or brings me happiness or sadness, nor does she know what I am doing or plan to do in my life. Same with my interests. We still live together so we have contact, but it's skin-deep. Whenever she asks me about anything about me she receives bland answers, like \"it's okay\" or \"I was with friends\". I'm 25, by the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy would I not be the asshole:\n\n\\- For as long as I remember, I was mom's trophy - a Gifted Kid (tm) she could brag about to her friends and siblings. She seemed to care more about my results than me as a person, and having a B in a streak of A's was something she always responded to with questioning and disapproval. That likely contributed to my self-esteem and motivation issues.\n\n\\- I got burned several times when opening myself up to her. At best she would not be able to offer any kind of empathy or advice, at worst she would joke about or underplay my issues and concerns. For example, after my now-ex gf (4 years together) broke up with me (devastating for me), her concerns were mostly about why that happened (sheer curiosity) rather than how I felt about it (empathy). Might sound petty, but that kind of attitude over long time does leave a mark.\n\n\\-She always scoffed at my interests, without even trying to understand them. Anything I liked was \"that weird thing he likes\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy I could be the asshole:\n\n\\- It's my mom. She gave birth to me, she cares for me. It's not right to just cut her off like that.\n\n\\- She grew up with 5 sisters as the youngest one, on the countryside. I, on the other hand, am an only child from a bigger town, so we have been brought up differently.\n\n\\- She's far from a bad person. She's helpful, takes care of people when she knows how. She never really means bad.\n\n\\- I had a really stress-less life thanks to my parents (getting tons of financial support, no pathologies, not too controlling), so maybe I'm just a spoiled, ungrateful shit\n\n\\- All of the bad symptoms are lessened now and I feel like mom's trying a bit more to connect with me.\n\n\\-I was a really quiet child. Got me lots of praise at some points in my life, but it also  resulted in her assuming everything was okay with me and only reacted when something bad started to happen (e.g worse grades). That said, self-reflection tells me I was just kind of unresponsive, so it's on me that I didn't communicate my feelings properly.\n\n\\-Finally, she's only a human. Focusing on stuff she in my opinion got wrong is unfair to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really conflicted about all of this. It's a constant fight between what was, what is, what should have been, wondering if I got attitude problems, when does her responsibility for my life end and when does mine start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I live with my mother, she's not tech savvy but knows enough to use a browser and pay online.  \nI pay for the internet and give her a small rent.  \nShe doesn't work and there's always been constant financial problems, we've had our electricity cut off because she couldn't pay the bills more than once in the past.\n\n**Some backstory:**  \nLast year my mother received inheritance money and started playing bingos online. She acted suspicious when I was nearby so I investigated her computer and found her bank transaction logs. She played on online bingos from morning to midnight on most days.  \nIt came close to $1000 in less than a month. Without the inheritance money that's more than what we live on a month. I didn't want her to keep throwing money out of the window so I blocked the website on her PC but she found other websites to play on.  \nWe had a few fights during this time. When I tried to have a discussion with her about playing online she said she had it under control and was only playing $20 now and then.  \nObviously I knew she was lying, but couldn't prove it without admitting to entering her bank account.  \n\nEventually it started to take away at my mental health so I gave up. She must have gotten bored of playing or ran out of money because she stopped playing. It came up to something like $3000 in 3 months, and that's a lot of money for us.\n\n**Back to today**:  \nThis December I saw her playing on bingos again, same suspicious behavior, minimizing the windows whenever I was nearby. It's happening again, a quick look at her history and there's over $200 gone in just a few days.  \nI didn't want a repeat of the past year so I quickly blocked all the websites she went on in our home network in a way that doesn't tell they're blocked and made up a believable story for why it's not working.  \nShe called the customer support of the website she's been playing on and our ISP and of course they couldn't solve the problem and made her even more frustrated.  \nI thought she would just give up and find something else to do but it doesn't seem that way.  \nShe's lonely and depressed and since finding out that the \"problem\" is restricted to our home network she's even started going outside in the cold just to play online bingos on her phone.\n\nAm I the asshole for blocking her from playing online and pretending to not know why she can't play?  \nShe's been lying to me too about how much she plays. Even borrowed her some money this month then found out she's been playing online and she says she can't pay me back until next month.",

      "description": "TL;DR on the bottom\n\nOkay so some backstory:\nMy grandpa was a Vietnam war veteran. He had severe PTSD, which led him to not trust the government. This also led him to not trust doctors and other professionals. His wife took advantage of that. She was incredibly horrible to our family, and horrible to my grandfather. She manipulated him into buying things for her, and she did many horrible things to him and our family. She held a huge banquet to help him with heart surgery, and with all the money that was raised, barely any of it went to his surgery, and went to a new truck and new expensive clothes(from what I was told).\n\n\nAround October of 2017, he was bedridden. His wife had to take care of him. Thing is, she neglected him and lied to visiting nurses. She would leave the house and leave him alone, starve and dehydrate him, and once tried to cut off his oxygen supply. We've recieved bank statements of her using HIS money for gambling, personal shopping of womens clothes, and etc. Eventually, around the end of January, he was hospitalized due to some incident. The wife never told us what happened, but we assume she sent him there to take money from his account because he was close to dying.\nMy mom and I decided to visit, I couldn't even recognize my own grandfather due to the poor state he was in. She had shaved his bear and hair off.  She was in there, yapping her mouth about about how much hard work she has done (thing is we live right next to her, we constantly saw he leave and be gone for several hours. She didnt have a job, since she was living off the money my grandpa recieved).\nSeeing her pissed me off so much... Eventually, they decided to cut him off life support. They knew he wouldnt get better, and that he would die. Our family was heart broken, but we knew it was for the best.\nWe took him off, and immediately the wife began to kiss and hug him. My grandfather was constantly struggling to respond to us. Her doing that made him completely stressed out. She eventually left.\nA few hours pass and her car is still in the parking lot. We get a call from my grandma(grandma and my grandfather divorced a long time ago). She told us she heard from the wife that he had DIED.\nHe was still alive... Apparently, the wife told EVERYONE that hadnt gone to the hospital to visit my grandfather that he died.\nThe attending family was in shock. I talked to my mom and she went to the front desk about it. She apparently explained the situation to them, and they gave us the \"okay\" to have security escort her out of the hospital if she attempted to come back in. \nNot twenty minutes pass and here comes the wife.\nMy mom and I immediately shut and locked the door.\nShe began to scream and pound at the door window to let her in.\nMy mom shook her head as I locked the door.\nSecurity came in and took her away and told her not to come back...\nWe soon found out she took all the money from one of his bank accounts after that.\n\nAfter 24 hours. My grandpa peacefully passed away. It was hard, incredibly hard. He may have done bad things in his life, but he was a wonderful person.\nA few days later we held a small funeral. We had to close the casket due to my grandfather's face being heavily distorted because of what the wife had done.\nMy aunt told her to not attend the funeral, and of she did they would call the police(this was what I was told, I have no idea how that would work out.)\nShe ended up coming, but staying in her truck the entire time.\nShe followed us to the grave site and stalked us.\n\nThe wife considers us the horrible people, and claim that we were the ones that allowed him to die like this.\nSo am I the asshole for refusing to let my grandfathers wife into the hospital room, and refusing to allow her to attend his funeral?",

      "description": "I will try to stick to the basics in bold and then detail what the hell I’m talking about. \n\n**1. The teacher I assist is the nicest person ever and we are friends. ** \n\nI am a TA at an elementary school. I work with one PE teacher 90% of the time and assist on other areas of the campus around 10% of the time. I help this PE teacher with all her classes and because we spend so much time together as the only two adults in the room, and the “organized chaos” nature of elementary PE classes, we talk a lot all day and over the last couple years, we have become friends. We text outside of school hours, bring junk food to share, and give each other gifts for holidays and birthdays. We occasionally hang out outside of work. She is one of the sweetest people I’ve ever met, and is *very* good to me as a TA - other TAs complain about their cooperating teachers berating them, undermining their authority in front of students, etc. Mine literally brings me Starbucks after I have a bad day, texts me how \nmuch she appreciates me when I have to cover her classes, brings me my favorite candy whenever she goes to Buc-ee’s, etc. I think our friendship is making me overthink this. \n\n**2. Field day is her one big school-wide event and it is a tough event to put on.**\n\nThe first year I worked this job, I helped with field day a lot. She holds it over the span of two days, and it’s a pretty involved format. The scope of my help was to assist with about 30% of the planning and to monitor/run errands in and out of the building all day during the event. I also took photos for the yearbook. This teacher puts a TON of work into making this event fun and organized for our (title I) students. She and I are the extent of our school’s PE department, and this is the department’s big event. \n\n**3. I want to skip her field day event for a hobby convention.**\n\nLast year my grandma convinced me to go to this huge international convention for the hobby that we share. After we booked the tickets, I realized that the Thursday and Friday I’d need to take off were the dates of her field day. I sheepishly told PE teacher that I’d made a mistake and I’d be gone during the event, but I’d still help with all the planning and prep. The other specials teachers helped her and nothing went wrong. It was a success. She was a little salty to me the week after the event but she tried not to show it.    \nAnd I had the absolute time of my life at the convention. My mom and my other grandma ended up driving to the same city to see us, and a ton of my friends from the hobby were there, so I got to see some of my favorite people and meet a ton more. I talked about my hobby with people who understand the obsession and geeked out with me. I felt like a kid in a candy store. That weekend is one of my happiest memories. I’ve been to similar conventions over the years and nothing compares to this one. \n\n**4. AITA if I skip field day for this convention? \n\nMy grandma assumed we would go again this year and booked the hotel for the whole convention (thurs-sun) this spring. I’m supposed to book the flights. I went to book and saw that the event falls on field day again. Cue me realizing I’d be a dick for skipping my department’s main event two years in a row. It is unquestionable that part of my job is to help with the event. I always do a ton of planning and organizing with the PE teacher before the event, though. I haven’t said anything to her yet - the dates are in April. \n\nI don’t want to let my friend down, but I don’t feel I owe my employers anything. Her kindness is one of the reasons why I’ve stayed at this job so long because there are other things that would otherwise have driven me to quit by now. However, she’s not my direct supervisor, she’s a colleague that gives me tasks and contributes to my appraisals. It’s a very tiny distinction, so input from teachers who work with TAs is very welcome!! She doesn’t approve my time off requests.              \n\nI don’t want to miss this convention. I don’t have a lot to look forward to right now and it will be so fun. I’m so torn that I’m actually considering quitting this job so I don’t have to tell my teacher friend that I made the same goof two years in a row. I’ve been wanting to find something new for like a year anyway. \n\nSorry this is long. I know I’m overthinking this so help me out. AITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "   So we got a new assistant manager at work and he is extremely rude and demanding. He’s a “my way or the highway” type of guy. Personally I get a long with him great(I have to try really hard to stay on his good side). However I do it to keep the peace at work. It’s not the same for my coworkers. He’s made two coworkers cry on different occasions. I noticed him messaging a manager from another store and a nasty message popped up and before he could minimize it I was able to read it. It said something making fun of our store manager. So I was curious and I waited for him to leave his computer unattended then I took it to the back and opened up the messages. I read a ton is extremely in appropriate and rude comments about my coworkers.... so I took photos of the messages and anonymously sent them to HR and CC’d our store manager (who was one of the people he spoke about negatively on the messages). His messages weren’t awful but definitely inappropriate for work. I feel bad because to his face I act really nice and innocent (like I’m on his side) however in reality I was looking for opportunities to “out” him. He is a good person just had a poor attitude and as much as he was being unfair, so we’re all of us. So I understand why he felt so negatively towards everyone. Sure it was inappropriate.... but should I have spoken with him and my store manager first, instead of sending it immediately to HR. Should I have sent in anonymously, and continued pretending as if I knew nothing? So far no action has been taken by HR. My store manager did speak with the 6 of us individually about the messages without revealing what was said. He mostly just asked how we felt about the assistant manager. He definitely spoke with the assistant manager and he is clearly scared he’s going to loose his job (he opened up to me about the situation). ",

      "description": "\\-- TL/DR below; apologies for any spelling / grammatical errors --\n\nThis happened a couple of weeks ago. It was a Monday and there was going to be a family birthday party on Friday. My aunt (lets call her Carol) asked me if my sister and I were going to drive to said party separated from our parents, we sometimes do that in order to be able to leave earlier. Carol and her 2 kids would then come along because she lives close to our place.\n\nAnyway, I told her I'd ask my sister and come back to her. Later that day I asked and my sister said she would.\n\nWell, I forgot to tell Carol. I then had a very stressful week, I had a lot of stuff in my head to think about that this just got lost. Skip ahead to Friday my family and I decide to get going. Sister is still planning to drive separately which I try to talk her out of to save money but she is insisted so I decide to drive with my parents for the sake of my mood and the relationship to my sister.\n\nWhen we arrive everyone but my sister was already there. I get to Carol and go in for a hug. While hugging she asks me where my sister is, I tell her she drove separately and then it hit me. I apologize for forgetting about it and she's pretty cool about it. She (kind of jokingly) says that I can drive her and her kids home so that she can get a drink. I didn't say anything to that but it wouldn't be a problem for me, wasn't going to get drunk that night anyway. Later on Carol comes over and asks again. I say yes.\n\nThe whole party then was pretty boring for me and I was kind of jealous of my sister but I accepted my fate.\n\nWhen we got going Carols kids were exhausted so I was eager to get home quickly. I was going over the speed limit where there was one on the Autobahn but never more than 20 km/h (12.4 mph) faster because thats kind of the limit where you get away with a fine and no bigger consequences. The fact that I never got a speeding ticket before and the lack of speed traps on this route gave me a false sense of security and then it happened. I saw a bright red flash and we all knew what was coming. My mood? Ruined. My aunt didn't say anything.\n\n3 days ago the ticket arrived. It's a fine of 40€ ($45). My aunt came over and told me and then asked how I wanted to pay her. I asked her to split it since it was kind of a favor that I drove her and her kids home so that she wouldn't have to. Additionally my job doesn't pay too well and I'm always kind of short on money. I offered her 20€ on the spot but she told me that I should pay all of it since I was driving. I don't agree with that. She and her husband both work full time and earn enough money, she should pay part of the ticket. Asshole thinking?\n\nTL/DR: My aunt gets a speeding ticket because of me taking her and her kids home in her car and asks me to pay the whole amount. I disagree and ask her to split it half and half. AITA?",

      "description": "So my brother often will pick something about me like that I don't really eat meat (for moral and environmental reasons) or that I wear my engineering ring (Canadian engineering thing related to a bridge that collapsed and that engineers need to remember the potential gravity of their actions) and personally attack me for it. In the case of the ring for example calling my wearing it pretentious and that engineers do it because they are elitist pricks basically. And I usually try to explain why because I do these things for a reason and he kinda just talks over me until I stop talking or until he is clearly wrong and then wiggles out of it somehow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo today we \\[my whole family at dinner\\] were talking about whether there should be a grade 13 and I said I don't think so since it would be putting a lot of people back a year; my brother's responses were something to the general tone of \"you're dumb; shut up\". The tone of the conversation was escalating (due to him continuing to talk over me) and then he said something like \"...for example I made dumb mistakes my first year out of high school\" to which I replied \"So since SOME people make dumb mistakes, everyone should be held back a year? That doesn't make sense to me.\" To which he replied something to the effect of \"you can take the bus home\" then got up and left the room to do his laundry and immediately the rest of my family started talking to me like I had just murdered an innocent puppy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI helped clean up after dinner (while my brother was still out of the room) and it was super uncomfortable and I was still being treated very much like a mean villain who was taking revenge so I went to the bathroom and then left silently and texted my family to tell them I was busing home and thanked them for dinner and told them I just didn't really want to deal with the situation right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that what I said could have hurt my brother's feelings as he might be insecure about his decisions etc. but I don't think that what I said was a) attacking him directly or b) deserved me being treated like I had just been a total dick by everyone c) merited my brother's response of leaving the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeaving I think was a bit selfish and cowardly, but I didn't want to deal with the situation and in hindsight I don't think that there was really a better alternative since my family is super dishonest with each other and themselves so at best they would just pretend it didn't happen and act super uncomfortable the remainder of the night and at worst they would continue to treat me like a puppy murderer.",

      "description": "My now ex girlfriend and I had been together for a total of 18 months. She was a pretty great girl in general and I liked her a lot.\n\nAbout 3 months after we started dating she told me that she loved me. Love is a very strong word, and I didn't love her at that point. So I responded with something along the lines of, \"You're amazing and I like you a lot\". She seemed hurt but didn't say anything about it. She continued to tell me she loved me for the rest of the 15 months probably about once a week.\n\nI've been in love with a past girlfriend. Really really in love. I liked this girl a lot but even after 18 months I wouldn't say I was in love with her. So during that entire time I never told her that I loved her too. I responded similarly to the first time she said it.\n\nAfter nearly a year of trying, she confronted me about it. She asked why I refused to say it back, and I told her that I care about her a lot, but I wouldn't say I love her until I was absolutely confident that I did. She said that it hurts feeling as if the love was one way and asked me if I could say it even if it wasn't true. I didn't want to do this because in my mind this takes away from the meaning of the word. If it's not true why say it at all? I told her that she didn't have to tell me she loved me. I told her that when I knew I was in love I would tell her. I liked this girl a lot, and I did tons of things to express my feelings, but I didn't love her in that way yet.\n\nShe took my advice and stopped saying she loved me after that talk. Six months later she decided to try it again. Once again I didn't say I loved her back. At that point she told me that she has had enough with our relationship. She didn't like feeling like this is a one way relationship. She said that I was being an ass and emotionally manipulating her by not saying I loved her. I feel like it's better to be honest than to lie to someone about your feelings, but maybe I'm wrong. AITA?",

This mostly happened at dinner where I would talk about something I believe I had a decent understanding of, or simply correcting another family member about something, and she would get pissy with me by making it seem like I was a dick for sharing my opinion. (I know this sounds weird I’m just not very good at explaining it) An example would be me correcting someone on a subject and her saying “As if you know what you’re talking about” \n\nNaturally I got pissed off after she did this because I felt bullied, but I bit my tongue since I didn’t want to start shit up with my sister who I live with still. But today I was really grumpy after working all day, and was not going to have it. While eating dinner she did something mildly annoying, but after waiting for so many days I exploded on her. I said “Why are you being such a bitch recently? Everything I do or say you fucking get mad about ,” or something like that I can’t remember word for word. She was shocked but retaliated by saying she would slap me to which I taunted her to do it. My dad said that I would punch back (although I probably wouldn’t), and that deterred her.\n\nAfter all this she barely ate anything for dinner and left to go to the bathroom and cry for a few minutes before composing herself and coming back to the table.\n\nI’m not sure what I should do, as all I did was stand up for myself even if I was mean about it. Am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: my sister has been bullying me recently and I yelled at her, making her cry ",

I have only interacted with her a handful of times (a customer service based job). \n\nMy friend repeats a lot of the conversations she has with this woman (she is in no way her friend and the woman is clearly not interested in the fact that my friend doesn't like her, she just talks to talk). She has repeatedly told my friend that she doesn't trust her husband with their 2 children (safety reasons not abuse) and is constantly bashing him but won't ever give a reason as to why and won't talk to her husband about it.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, the woman told my friend that she had started going on dates and her husband didn't know.\n\nToday, my friend was telling me that this woman approached her at work and the conversation went something like this: \n\nWoman: \"HEY, guess what, I have a secret!\" \n\nFriend: \"yah?\" \n\nWoman : \"I have a boyfriend!\" \n\nMy friend was floored at how excited this made the woman. \n\nFriend: \"does your husband know?\" \nIf it's an agreement within their relationship then whatever no big deal, you do you lady. \n\nWoman: \"No, my husband doesn't know!!\" \n\nMy friend stopped entertaining her at that moment and went back to work. \n\nThe woman spent he rest of the day telling everyone who would listen about her new boyfriend. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I reached out to her husband, a complete stranger to me, and told him his wife is telling everyone at work she has a boyfriend? \n",

      "description": "So my school-day basically only consisted of presentations after a week of working with a project in groups.\n\nTowards the end of the last presentation, I hear my phone beeping twice from the back of the classroom, even though, fortunately, nobody else knew it was mine. The teacher reacts immediately though and rages about it for a good minute, even though he was the only one who seemed bothered by it, honestly. The group presenting was even some of my good friends who didn’t seem to give one shit about the short noise, and just continued talking.\n\nThough, before we all got to go home, the teacher sat us down in the classroom and gave a good 10-minute speech about how the person who owned the phone was “extremely disrespectful and annoying” and ended the talk saying that the responsible person had to own up to their actions by baking a cake for the entire class tomorrow. If nobody shows up with a cake all phones will be taken away for the enitre day, and I don’t want to be responsible for that.\n\nI know it was irresponsible of me, but as someone who can barely have a voice raised at them without breaking into tears, I couldn’t make myself admit it in front of the whole class and an already angry teacher. I don’t even have time for baking a cake, and I don’t want the anger singled out on me tomorrow.\n\nAm I too sensitive? Am I an asshole? Should I bring a cake?",

      "description": "So my soon to be son in law was severely injured a week ago. He needed to go to the doctor for a follow up visit, and he just bought a brand new dually crew cab 4 wheel truck. No where to park his truck at the doctors office so he asked to use my car and said for me to take his truck. I have owned big trucks so driving it wasn’t the issue. But some how I ran a red light and got t boned. I have never been in an accident I caused before this. Not sure how I ran a red light on a street a half mile from where I have worked the last 25 years. I will say he tinted the windows way darker than I ever would have and I think that affected my ability to see. It was still dark out when it happened. \n\nSo I go through the steps of reporting it to insurance. My insurance says the vehicles insurance pays not the drivers. So all the companies have been notified. \n\nWithin a couple hours my daughter texts me saying I need to pay for the damages so there rates don’t go up. Well the car that hit me was almost brand new and was totaled. And the truck probably has $20,000 in damages if not totaled. So any where from $55,000 to $90,000 in damages. So I suggest we deal with that as it happens. Can’t imagine their insurance going up because of my accident.  But if it does I would work it out. \n\nThen today she text me saying that I need to do something for the diminished value of the truck when they go to trade it in.  And once again I stated that we should cross that bridge when we come to it. \n\nHowever it became a big issue and a long text battle with her basically telling me I’m a shitty parent.\n\nBut I did mention that I am in the process of borrowing a lot of money for her business to expand but my credit is going to show this debt. And if she expects a large sum of money from me for the damages to trucks value, I would have to cancel this loan so I could borrow money to cover the truck. \n\nAnd she accused me of guilting her instead of just admitting i am wrong. I know she’s under a lot of stress because of his injury. But I don’t know what she expects me to do. So am I being the asshole here?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Hello, I (31F) have been married to my husband (28M) for roughly two years, we dated for 1 year before that. In my past life before working at the church, I was a bartender at a popular bar. I made enough money to pay off my car and some credit card debt that never seemed to go away. Unfortunately, I had some issues with addiction and was not living a healthy lifestyle at the time. I had a couple of serious boyfriends and a dozen ONS before meeting my now husband. \n\nI disclosed that I had a rough time through my early to mid-twenties before we got married and was willing to be honest with him whenever he asked about anything. My husband is an old-fashioned type and follows the adage of “a gentleman never asks, and a lady never tells”. This was fine for me because I wanted to leave the past in the past and he wasn’t a jealous type while we were dating.\n\nHowever, I have a few tattoos from the days when I was in one of my serious relationships before my current husband. He never asked about these ones, so I didn’t feel like it was something that needed to be discussed. Whenever my now husband *generally* asked about my tattoos (I have a lot of them) I told him simply I liked the art, which is true. I knew when saying this in the back of my head that some of them had baggage and did not want to dig that up. At the time, I know he would have understood.\n\nThe conversation of tattoos did not come up again until a year into marriage. Because of talking about the loose associations some of them had, jealousy issues started finding their way into our relationship. Let’s say one of them had to do with my ex’s metaphysical snake. I love him dearly, I do. I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but these jealousy issues are starting to get cumbersome. It seems like every time he talks about this, he is possessed and wants to know all the dirty little details of this particular person in relation to himself.\n\nI feel like he is views me like I am trash, even though he is using a calm, respectful tone. I feel like when he goes deep into the rabbit hole about this, the only way to help him is to talk about the details that he is asking about. Every time it is like putting the nail in one coffin but opening up ten new cans of worms. After growing tired, I told him that I do not want to talk about it anymore. Seemingly out of anger, he told me that he wants the tattoo removed or covered up.\n\nI feel like he had his opportunity to find out about the details of all my tattoos and get them removed before the wedding. I could have been more open and forthcoming about the intimate nature of some of these tattoos, but we were seemingly operating under the don’t ask don’t tell philosophy. But now, there are early memories and wedding pictures tainted. I am hurt by him requesting me to remove the tattoos because it makes me feel objectified. It *seems* that this is leading to an ultimatum and I have decided not to remove it. Am I an asshole for not removing the tattoo?",

      "description": "(Obligatory this is a throwaway account.) Everyone in this story is in their mid 20s.\n\nTo cut right to the chase, my friend and my boyfriend's best friend (\"James\") started dating this girl (\"Nicole\") approximately 2 years ago. (Possibly relevant information: my boyfriend and I have been together for about 8 years now so I've known James roughly the same amount of time and consider him to be a good friend.) They've had an incredibly rocky relationship to say the least and have been on and off up until somewhat recently. This began with James emotionally cheating on Nicole with another girl  a few months into their relationship. As far as I know, it only went as far as texting. James came clean to Nicole shortly after and this whole incident unleashed a whole new side of Nicole that none of us had expected.\n\nTo make this short, Nicole developed huge trust issues and became both verbally, mentally, and physically abusive to James. To the point that she made him bleed and feel that he has to hide aspects of his relationship from us and his other close friends. I don't know if the abuse is currently ongoing.\n\nNow that they live together, my boyfriend and I often hangout with both James and Nicole whenever we see him. Nicole has been trying to bond with the \"girlfriends\" of our friend group - she's tried inviting me to dinner or insisted on going to gym together. I decline for some reason or another every time, but I'm always polite about it.\n\nThe truth is that I really have no interest in being friends with Nicole even if she is James' girlfriend. Aside from the fact that our interests and personalities are non-compatible, now that I know about the abuse I can't move past it. In my mind, it takes a truly fucked up mindset to go as far as making the person you \"love\" bleed intentionally and I don't think I could ever forgive it. When I do see Nicole in a group setting, I'm cordial to her and as friendly as I can tolerate, but I largely do this for James' sake and not wanting him to feel isolated from us in the event he is still being abused. (Just want to add, I do realize what James did to Nicole was also shitty, but no one deserves to be abused in retaliation for it.)\n\nI know in my mind that I can be friends with whoever I want to be friends with, but AITA for my reasoning for not wanting to be friends with Nicole?",

      "description": "My SO (F30) gets extremely anxious about lots of things and it has a huge impact on our lives (her more than me, of course, but as we live together and have a little boy it tends to affect us all a lot - we don't get to do much as a family as she gets upset at things and I get very little 'down time' alone as she struggles to look after our son so I'm permanently exhausted).\n\nBut the worst thing is her health anxiety. I hesitate to call it hypochondria but it pretty much is exactly that. She is constantly worrying about small sensations, literally sometimes worrying that a little stomach ache could be cancer, or something like that. Not to say she assumes she has cancer, but she treats it as good a possibility as food poisoning, or just trapped wind. So she's constantly freaking out and scaring me by proclaiming that she could have x y or z illness, often in front of our boy, and I haven't got any patience left, so I'm increasingly liable to getting pissed off and even snapping at her, especially when our son's in earshot, which makes me feel worse as I don't want to get angry in front of him.\n\nTonight she gave me some free time by going out with a friend for the first time in ages, and I was grateful (Ive gig asperger's so I need down time alone a lot). But she came back complaining it had been awful as she felt ill thd whole time and was terrified of vomiting or shitting herself (this has never actually happened but is a big fear of hers), so I felt awful for her staying out to give me time alone, and snapped at her thaf she's confusing anxiety symptoms with other symptoms and being overly dramatic, and then said I was losing my ability to show sympathy for her as it's so frequent and endless. I was quite cross and now she's in bed crying and I'm feeling like shit downstairs.  \n\nAITA for getting angry and snapping at her and upsetting her by disbelieving her symptoms? ",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago while I was in college working on a group project for a clinical psych course. At the beginning of the project, the professor made it abundantly clear that after all was said and done we would be able to submit peer evaluations so that each member would be graded accordingly, in hopes to eliminate social-loafing. \n\nThe students I ended up working with were awesome, save for one person. She took no initiative in things, and needed her hand held through everything. She rarely showed up to meetings, and when she did she was usually so late that the rest of us were already packing up our stuff. I tried to do my best to fill her in, and make sure she knew what her responsibilities were, but it was always rushed as I had a pretty tight schedule. \n\nAnyway, we get to the last few meetings and it's apparent she hasn't contributed much to the 25 page research paper, nor the presentation. The rest of us gave her a simple part, and pretty much did all of the outline for her, she just had to fill in the blanks. I'm pretty sure we gave her all the sources she would need too. \n\nBetween all my other classes, presentations, midterms, and what have you, I didn't have the time to babysit this person. I assumed after the last meeting that she would have everything done the day before at 6pm so I would have enough time to edit it, since that's we all agreed to. 6pm rolls around, she says she's still working on it. Then radio silence until like a few hours before class. Then it becomes abundantly clear that she hasn't written anything, \"but it's all in her head.\" I kind of go off on her. Tell her that this is absolutely inappropriate and if she wasn't going to contribute she should have just told us earlier so we could had time to do her part. \n\nAnyway, she eventually finishes her part. It's godawful, but I salvage what I can by editing the fuck out of it. We meet to go through our presentation one more time, and I realize she thinks she can just wing it, after I explained to her numerous times that we are being graded on every aspect of the presentation. Going over or under will affect our grades, and the quality of the presentation will as well.\n\nWe give the presentation, she goes before me and spends way too much time bullshitting her way through it; circling back to points she already made, or just reading of a powerpoint slide with no direction. Now I have to rush through my part of it, which makes me look unprepared.\n\nWhen it came to the peer evaluations, all my other group members and myself agreed we should be as brutally honest as possible. We gave her so many chances, and she fucked it all up. So that's what we did. I was honestly expecting her to fail the project, if not the course, but while we all got an A- she got a B-. \n\nWhere I feel like the asshole is wishing that she would have failed. I don't know what was going on with her. I just assumed she just didn't give a shit, but maybe she was dealing with something I had no idea about. Maybe she was extremely depressed and what she did for the group was the best she could manage. ",

      "description": "Hi everyone, new here and on mobile so let me off easy if I make any formatting mistakes, hah. And I will try to make it as neutral and understanding from my side as well as I can. Two sides to every story after all. (Also, sorry, this is going to be a long and very dark post that brings up abuse, mental disorders, and suicide, so here's my warning for that.)\n\nOkay, so interesting title, but here's what happened .My bf and I (let's call him A) were messing around last night, sort of teasing and wrestling each other when he tried to swat me off of him. This was all fine of course until he landed a pretty strong smack on my leg. It hurt quite a bit, and caused me to freeze up a little and have flashbacks to past, traumatic, fearful events.\n\nSome info on me: I grew up in a highly a\npsychologically and verbally abusive environment - and that haunts me everyday. For a while things were getting better, but recently I've started getting flashbacks (PTSD? Idk). I also have several mental disorders (diagnosed by a psychiatrist). Depression, Anxiety, and OCD. I have tried everything to help; medications, therapy, removing myself from the situation, but nothing quite seems to help. Not too long ago was seriously considering suicide, like, *really* considering. But I have moved past that, (although it still is rather haunting for my little damaged brain).\n\nSo he started telling me to stop spiralling and stop thinking about it. (He did apologize for hitting me that hard, he certainly didn't mean to and never would, it was an accident). I said how I didn't like having a mark on my leg from my bf: and that's when we went off.\n\nApparantly while we had been wrestling around, I had brought up some bad memories for him - something I was unaware of and apologized for. He also has had some trauma in his life; and if anything, we have always found solace in each other in that we can both heal together and he can help me.\n\nHowever, A gets angry, letting go of some emotions he had been keeping bottled up for a few days. He says that he feels I am not trying in our relationship, and that he feels he is not allowed to be angry bc it will trigger some memory, but when it comes to me I am allowed to feel upset whenever I want. I will admit fully that I have been in a weird mental state for several days and probably have not been easy to deal with.\n\nI had never told A he couldn't be angry, and yes I will admit, anger makes me nervous. I am used to anger lasting for weeks or months, not for a day or so - so I try to avoid it like the plague.\n\nI tell him I can't help that I have all of these memories, and that I have the mental disorders that I have. A says that I am acting like a slave to my own emotions, and confusing feelings for reality. A then brings up what he has went through, and that I have never faced sexual or physical abuse, and that I may have been scared before but never felt genuine fear for my life. He says that he could make millions of excuses for himself everyday, but doesn't. And that I need to get over my own issues bc it is destroying me. \"I and other people have done it, and you need to quit laying down and do it for yourself\".\n\nA says that he doesnt mind supporting me, but that he feels like he has to carry my issues with him. And that I'm supposedly comparing him to all of these awful people in my past and that it's getting to be too much for him.\n\nThis infuriates me and makes me feel terrible, like A is just making it about himself and completely informing my feelings. I tell him that we are different people, that he has had a good support system, a different life than me, and that I am still living with my issues. My family does still have control over my finances, car, etc. And that I have not given up, and still try every day to function best I can. If I had given up, I would literally not be alive and typing this out right now.\n\nThis morning I left his house (it was very late when we stopped arguing, so I crashed there for the night), and A didnt seem to really understand where I was coming from. I love him so much, and I know he loves me too... but I'm confused. Am I really a horrible gf for not being able to stop my flashbacks from my past from happening and not being able to stop myself from letting them upset me?\n\nI understand he wants me to be able to rise above it all, but he did not say it correctly at all. A even said, \"Well would you rather me have said that, 'Hey, you are only defined by what happened to you, you will never get over it'? No, I'm telling you that you can.\"\n\nThanks guys, again sorry for the long read. Any questions for clarification please ask. I just want insight.\n\nTL;DR: Bf tells me I need to accept and get over my abuse and trauma bc he did so for his, and is frustrated and upset at me me for letting it affect my mood and for not being in good mental health recently. I just want bf to be patient with me and understanding - I don't know what else to do.",

      "title": "AITA for asking my boyfriend to not drink or smoke in front of me?",
      "description": "Stuff is going like, great between me and the boyfriend. Except for one thing; he likes to smoke weed (often), and drink (rarely, doesn't get drunk), while I have PTSD tied to the stuff because of some childhood trauma.\n\nTo explain the trauma, my mom was an abuser, who smoked cigarettes throughout my childhood and was a an alcoholic for a few years. Even worse than that I found out from my dad that she was actually an addict on a variety of other drugs my whole life and just hid it from me. And her boyfriend when I was in kindergarten, whom I loved dearly, died of lung cancer from secondhand smoke. She was the only smoker he knew. Basically, she *killed* him. And her ENTIRE side of the family smoked cigarettes too, and since I got dropped off at school and they smoked in their cars and home, I went to school smelling like smoke most days.\n\nNow to my boyfriend. One of the very reasons I even AGREED to go out with him is because he didn't really plan to drink or smoke. This changed like three weeks into college. His friend convinced him to smoke weed, and then he just had to try alcohol too. I was like \"okay, don't like this, but so long as he accommodates me, we're good\". For awhile, I'll admit I went too hard and wouldn't let him even MENTION the stuff. By this point, I am chill with the mention of it. But now, he'll try and get me to consider like, being around it, “to get over it\" sometimes, but does drop it when I say no. I know it's a big part of his life, and where he met a lot of friends, but I just can't even consider it. Like, when we went to his family's Thanksgiving, EVERYONE was drinking heavily. And I was sitting on the edge of a panic attack the entire evening, unable to have fun. When he asked if he could have one drink, I felt like vomiting, and asked if he wouldn't. Alcohol is a smaller trigger than smoke, so if I couldn't handle that I couldn't handle anything else.\n\nI know he just wants me to be involved in all parts of his life, and not being okay with this means I can't meet all of his friends, but my trauma is so fresh because my sister is STIll suffering from the repercussions of substance abuse now, and I can't do anything to help her. I have not made any attempt to try and stop him, because I know it is not my place. My boyfriend does everything responsibly and safely, so I trust him, but I'm not at a point in my life in which I can handle it. I love him, and we have almost no issues beyond this. He is not the bad guy here IMO, but my stance is that I'm not either.\n\n**TDLR; I can't be around alcohol or any sort of drug that is smoked due to trauma that is still fresh, but my boyfriend who does those things wants me to be fully involved in his life. AITA for asking him to just do it away from me so we can enjoy everything else about our relationship, or should I 1) buckle up and get used to it or 2) end the whole thing because I can't accept everything about him?**",

      "description": "So, this actually happened a few years ago, but i still feel guilty about it. I dated this guy for 6 months. It was going really well, until depression kicked my butt hard. I decided to break up with him for both of our sakes. I couldn't handle a relationship at the time.\n\nI had an ex who I'd been in a LDR with several months before this. We stayed friends, and even though we didn't really hang out, we texted almost daily. No cheating, no sketchy topics, just friend stuff. The aforementioned now-ex bf was always skeptical of our friendship, but didn't make a big deal of it.\n\nSo I broke up with this guy in the evening after we got back from dinner. I told my ex about it, who happened to be in town, and he came over to give me emotional support. So he comes over about an hour later, and... things escalate. I end up sleeping with him 2 hours after I broke up with the other guy. \n\nI know I didn't technically cheat, but I don't know if I technically did anything wrong. It's been weighing on me for quite a while.",

      "description": "(Reuploading this because I did not add any info, sorry new to this reddit thread)\n\nThey’ve come close these past month. I see message notifications from her on his phone every day. My boyfriend is quite the handsome guy with a lovely personality and let’s just say people, and especially girls, do think that he could do better than me. This has sort of made me insecure. The fact that my boyfriend doesn’t hide the fact that he finds my outspoken, boyish, talkative personality quite opposite and incompatible to his shy and quiet demeanour has further cemented the insecurity of me fearing every nice low-tone girl he gets close to.\n\nWe met with this girl at this party and she was nice to me for 10 minutes then chose to snub me the whole night. I am very talkative and non-shy, was a bit drunk that night, and was having fun chatting with these other people about weird sex stuff. I’m often snubbed by other girls because “ugh how can you be so crude”, because I am not “ladylike” cuz I like to talk about sex openly. \n\nFrom the entire night choosing not to talk to me or engage in conversation, she even made a snide comment at some point saying “Ugh you only talk about sex, gawd”. Which I found to be quite mean especially since other people were engaged in that conversation happily too.\n\nAm I jealous? Yes one hundred percent. I don’t like that he is hanging out with this girl who is clearly more his type, who she’d have every reason to like my BF, and who refuses to hangout with me or give me a chance to be friends. This is all probably immature to some but if you also have any advice on how to deal with your own insecurities and jealousies and fear of abandonment, that will help a lot.",

      "title": "AITA for moving other people's laundry?",
      "description": "I live in an apartment complex with a shared laundry room. There are two washers and two dryers. The machines are coin-operated.\n\nEvery once in a while, though, both of the washers or dryers will be full with clothes, but the machine isn't in use. The cycle has finished, but the owner of the clothes hasn't taken them out yet. So I carefully take out their clothes and place them on a counter in the middle of the room to make room for my clothes.\n\nI didn't think much of this, but apparently I may have broken some unspoken rule of laundry etiquette. One time I did this, I got a note in my laundry saying that I should have just waited because I \"moved someone's laundry out not even 10 minutes after their load was done.\"\n\nMaybe they didn't like that I had my greasy hands all over their clothes? That I could have accidentally dropped a sock of theirs and lost it?\n\nBut my thought is that if you're in a shared laundry room, it's your responsibility to take your clothes out promptly. It tells you how long it takes: 30-35 minutes for the washer and 40-45 minutes for the dryer. You can set a timer. If you're not moving your laundry, you shouldn't be surprised when somebody else moves it for you. Other people need to use the machines.\n\nA second event happened last night though that inspired me to make this post. I was about to wash my bedsheets in the evening. One of the washers was still going, and the other was full of clothes, but the cycle was finished. Keeping in mind that note I got before, I decided to maybe give it the benefit of the doubt and heed its advice. So I left back to my room, waited 15 minutes, and came back. The clothes were still there. I had given them a grace period, so I took their clothes out and put them to the side. I continued on with my day and switched my laundry to the dryer after it was done washing. Then when I came back to pick up my dry clothes, I realized that this other person took my clothes out of the dryer, probably pretty close to when I put them in because they were still completely wet, and used my wash cycle, which I paid for, to dry their clothes. There was an empty dryer right next to mine, so this was clearly an intentional act of revenge. I had to pay another $1.50 to redo the load that they stole and also waste 45 minutes of my time. I had to get up early the next day for a class I have, and these were my bedsheets, so this person cost me 45 minutes of sleep. And when I came back to pick up my dry clothes after the second time around, they still had not picked up their dry clothes over 45 minutes after they finished drying.\n\nPersonally I don't think there's any ambiguity over whether this person is an asshole, but they clearly had a reason to do it. I just wanted to highlight the fact that people are out there who are upset by my actions. Now I'm wondering if them being upset is any way justified.",

      "description": "I work as a cashier and cashiers always get the blame for company policy.  At the store I work at sends out text promotions occasionally to people who sign up with the text club.  The deal on this day was 2 lobster tails for $5 with a limit of two.  Lobster is super expensive so two for $5 is an amazing deal.  \n\n\nPeople often come in and try a variety of different thing to get around coupon limits, splitting their order into two, having their kids pay for it at a different line, coming in a second time that day.  In cashier training our managers tell us all these ways people try to get around the limits and tells us that if we catch someone doing it we should not let them do so.  \n\n\nThe second order on my shift I run into a problem.  A mom and her kid come to my line and I notice that not only did they split their order into two, they actually split it into three.  I let the first two slide since \"Two lobster tails for $5 (Limit 2)\" could be interpreted as 2 orders of two lobster tails.  Once I got to the third order however, I told them that the coupon says limit of two.  \n\n\nMom: \"Yes, but I split it into three orders\"\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, according to company policy I can not let you have the coupon for this order.  I can scan it through at the normal price for you however.\"\n\nMom: \"Look, I'm shopping for my disabled mother who can not leave the house so the coupon is really for her.\"\n\nMe: \"Unfortunately, in order for the coupon to be redeemed I would need her to be present with her own code.\"\n\nMom: \"What do you not understand about she can't leave the house? Just let me have the lobster tails.\"\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, I'm sorry but I can't go against company policy.\"\n\nMom: \"Well, I'll just leave and come back in then.\"  \nMe: \"Feel free two ma'am, but if I recognize you I still wont give you the deal.\" \n\nMom: \"Just give me the deal, because I can always just leave and come back.\"\n\nMe: \"Ma'm, if you leave and come back and I don't see you there is nothing I can do, but for now I can't scan it at the deal price.\"\n\n(At this point I turn on my flashing light, which notifies the managers in the area that I need help)\n\nMom: \"You scanned the first two orders, just scan the third one, my mother is disabled and she can't leave the house\"\n\n(My manager walks by and I get her attention)\n\nManager: Is there something wrong?\n\nMe: \"Yes, this customer split their order into three to avoid the coupon limit\"\n\nMom: \"Look, my mom is at home and we need to bring the lobster tails home for dinner tonight, it says limit of two, so two for my son, two for me, and two for my mom\"\n\nManager: \"Ma'am, this time I'll scan the lobster tails, but I want to make it clear that this is a one time exception.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my manager scans the tails and enters the code.

      "title": "AITA for bailing on my family trip last minute and refusing to pay our part of the bill?",
      "description": "For some context:  My cousins are hosting an anniversary party.  They live some 700kms away from the hometown where my family grew up and where many still live.  I live a couple hundred kms North of that hometown.\n\nWhen we first heard about the party at thanksgiving (in October), the hometown family started floating the idea to rent a charter bus from the hometown to the party.  I quickly looked at Google Maps, and saw that it would add only 26kms and only 46 minutes to swing through my city on the way instead of taking the typical route.  It would save me, however, two and half hours driving each way from where I live to meet the bus in the hometown.  (Also, to drive from where we live to the party would be 5.5 hours and just under 600km each way, or $85.17 in gas round trip, according to a road trip calculator website.)  My cousin, Brooke, who was organizing the bus immediately shot down the idea at dinner.  I initially said, if it can come through our town, we're definitely in.\n\nThe price to participate was set at $100/adult and kids were free.  Immediately, I was put off.  That would be $200 for me and my husband with no kids (which is a lot of money for us, we don't have a lot of extra room in our budget), and $200 for my cousin's family with 4 kids.  It started to seem like a really good deal for the families with kids: now they wouldn't have to drive their big vehicles that hold all their kids, their kids would have other kids to play with, there would be movies to distract them, a toilet so they didn't have to stop, and it was becoming a \"booze cruise\" so the parents could drink on the way.\n\nWe felt a lot of pressure to participate though, because family's important, so we committed to the idea.  Last time it was confirmed was Oct 26, and I was told they were *not* going to go through my city.  I said we would come anyway, knowing it wasn't the best financial choice for us, but that it would be an experience.\n\nSince then, though, apparently a lot of other people from the hometown have backed out.  Yesterday, I was talking to my aunt, Allison, and she said that the price might be $140/adult now!  So, now we're paying $280 to drive 5 hours out of our way to catch a bus that we didn't really want to take in the first place, and we were never told that all these people were backing out.  And, the people organizing don't want to leave the town where the party is until 9:30am local time Sunday, which is 10:30am in our province, which means that my husband and I likely won't get home until 10pm our time on Sunday, and we both have to work Monday morning.  The cousin organizing was asked by someone else if we could leave earlier Sunday morning, but she said 9:30 was early enough.  I don't get that, even if you're tired and hungover, you're going to be on a bus for 8 hours - sleep then!\n\nI started to feel sick about the cost and about how it was never even considered to come pick us up.  Especially when I learned that the bus does not charge by the km, but by the hour.  So, if we arrived at the party town 45 minutes later (right now they're planning on arriving extra early so the kids can swim in the hotel pool before the party), and left 45 minutes earlier Sunday morning, the bus would be rented for the same amount of time, cost the same, but save my husband and me a lot of time. \n\nSo, I called my aunt back and expressed my concerns that it was getting too expensive.  Suddenly, she said, it wasn't going to cost $140 (which sucks, according to her), only $100 still.  And I told her that I was disappointed that the idea to drive through our city was never taken seriously (remember, it was rejected immediately by my cousin when I asked earlier).  My aunt said that the bus driver refused to drive to our city for only two people because then it wouldn't be a divided highway like the other route, and he didn't like that.  That's the reality of our province, there aren't always divided highways.  And, the bus companies in this province drive hockey players and miners everywhere without divided highways all the time, this is not out of the ordinary.  I told her still, we couldn't go on the bus, and she told me we would still have to pay our $100 each, which I think is crap.  She said everyone who backed out did so before the bus was officially booked 10 days ago.  I'm annoyed that I didn't get told 10 days ago that so many people were bailing and it was becoming more expensive.  \n\nAnyway, I told them I wouldn't be on the bus, to count me out, and hung up the phone and went to bed feeling sad and guilty - she was really pressuring me on the phone.  She was saying things like, \"If it were me, I would just come and have all the fun this weekend is going to be and then live conservatively next weekend and the next weekend and the next until January or February or whatever it took to make up the time and money!\" and \"As if you need to be home so much on the weekend, you probably spend most of the time in your bathrobe lounging around anyway!\"  It's the holidays, money is tight, time is tight, we have to be careful with what we do.  And, we don't laze around all weekend, we are in our early 30s but we don't party a lot.  We try to take care of ourselves and our house on weekends.\n\nI wake up to a voicemail on my phone; I check it, and it's from my aunt.  She's now saying, if it makes a difference, that they could pick us up in a small town 80kms South of where I live.  And they hope that will change our minds and make us come.  The thing is, that makes the bus take single lane highways!  But, I thought the bus refused to drive single lane highways?  Looking at Google maps, this new route they're offering is the one suggested by Google Maps, and is actually shorter in kms and time than the divided highway route they were going to take.  \n\nSo, I feel like the whole thing was being organized to work best for this one branch of the family, and my husband and I were going out of our way (literally and figuratively) to help keep the cost of this trip down for that branch, when no considerations would be made to help us out.  I don't want to pay the $200 to contribute to the bus costs, I think that's unfair, but my aunt made it sound like I don't have a choice.  When I said we couldn't take the bus, she just said, \"Oh, you're just going to pay $200 for nothing?  That sucks for you guys!\"\n\nThe bus was never the economical choice for us, but it was going to be where a lot of our family members were and was going to be part of the experience.  Now, though, it's mostly just that one aunt and her family, and they have a lot of kids, and we just feel like it's not fair that they booked this expensive bus knowing so few people were going.  And is our $200 really the tipping point for them?  Was it just us keeping the bus a go?  \n\nSo, am I the asshole for refusing to pay the $200 for this bus trip?  Am I the asshole for still refusing to go, even with this modified route they offered?",

      "description": "Posting this on a throwaway.\n\nI’m a college freshman living in a dorm with my best friend of 16 years. Across the hall lives another childhood friend and his roommate, Jeff, who we went to high school with. Jeff was never in our friend group until this summer, when he started hanging out with us. He was kind of a loner in high school, so I did my best to make him feel welcome with us.\n\nWell, since we’ve started college, his attitude has changed. He’s veeery critical of a lot of things I like, and doesn’t like when people have different opinions. I’ll break it down:\n\n• Jeff said the games I play (specifically Uncharted, Madden, Fortnite) are all bad because “you’re not learning anything from them.” He also said that if you aren’t playing games to learn something, “no one should ever take your advice on a game.”\n\n• Jeff says the shows I watch (specifically The Office and Atlanta) are bad because they aren’t about anything. This started when I was watching Atlanta while he was there. In a scene, a character throws his phone out his car window as a joke. He then went on a huge rant about how that’s bad because it wouldn’t happen in real life. When I explained that I was watching the show to take my mind off of my busy life, he said that watching shows with this attitude means I should never be taken seriously. He’s also the type of guy who *only* watches anime and claims it’s better than Western TV.\n\n• Jeff says that music I listen to (Post Malone, Logic, Childish Gambino, J. Cole, etc) is bad because “it’s not about anything”. One day we were hanging out and I was singing a song stuck in my head, and he went “Hey OP, did another one of your dogshit rappers come out with a song you’re going to sing for the next month?”\n\n• Jeff thinks sports are for dumb people. I was watching an MLB playoff game in my room in October when he came in. When he saw me intensely watching the game, he said that sports were “a waste of time”. I said I like them because I grew up with them and they mean something to me. He went on this whole big tangent on how I should only follow art because “that’s creative and original”.\n\n• Jeff thinks that comic book movies are garbage, and that studios just look for profit. I kinda understood where he was coming, but as a fan of CBMs, I still enjoy them. We saw Captain Marvel with Jeff. He criticized the ENTIRE movie, WHILE IT WAS PLAYING, and I got pretty ticked off.\n\nNow, I’m not the only one upset by this. Other friends have talked to me saying they were angered by his behavior. However, my best friend is very patient with him. He hangs out with him outside school and started watching anime with him. Jeff claimed that he had made my best friend a “weeb”. I don’t care if my best friend watches anime, but Jeff bragging about it upset me. I know my best friend better than him. So, with some friends backing me, I’ve considered telling him to either stop bashing things we like or fuck off. Would this make me the asshole?",

      "description": "So I’m on a dating site, and I started messaging this guy. We got along really well, so well that we exchanged numbers and started texting (instead of just messaging through the site). I’m the type of person that, if I’m teasing you, I can come across as a bit of a jerk. Just some ribbing, but playful. Anyway, he told me he had to be up early in the morning to go to his parents house for his brothers birthday (a birthday breakfast? I’m not sure). Then he said he also had to stop at a store on the way there to get his brother a gift card. So I’m thinking “typical guy move, getting a gift at the last minute” and said “are you serious 😂”, which he took very personally, that I was questioning his decisions? He got upset because (I didn’t know this) “the store is a half mile from his parents house, and half an hour from where he lives, so why wouldn’t he just stop on the way?” I apologized and said if I had known it would’ve upset him I wouldn’t have said anything. And now he’s blocked me on the site and (I assume) on texts. If I’m able to attach screenshots of my texts with him in the comments, I will, but... AITA for teasing him?",

      "description": "So I’m in college, but Im living at home with my parents till I graduate. My parents get frustrated with me for keeping my door locked when I’m in my room. The reason I do so is because I’m really introverted and I value my privacy. \n\nWhen I was in my more formative years I’d keep my door closed but not locked. They’d knock once and barge in. I tried to explain to them that it defeats the purpose of knocking if you just swing the door open a second later. The dumb thing is they still attempt to do it. I’ll hear a knock and then they’ll try the door handle just to jiggle it and knock again because it’s locked. Obviously I open the door, I’m not trying to ignore them, but I always get an earful for keeping it locked.\n\nI know it’s their house and everything, but idk why me living there should encroach on my privacy.",

      "description": "Last night my bf and I were playing a game and calling each other (we don’t live together). We had been playing for an hour and a half when he’s like “I don’t want to play anymore” and left the game. He told me we could still call and talk but he just didn’t want to play. At first I was like why not and tried to get him to play again, but he told me he was tired and planning on sleeping soon. I respected that so I stopped playing and asked if we could FaceTime for a few min before he went to sleep. I just wanted to see him because I barely saw him all day as we both had a pretty busy day. He declined and again told me he was tired and cut me off by saying good night. I tried to reason with him and brought up how minutes ago he literally told me we could talk. Without replying to what I just said, he hung up. \n\nThis really ticked me off. It’s pretty rude to just hang up on someone without saying anything to what they just said unless both people make it clear that they’re done conversing (e.g. both people say bye and hang up). So I text him and tell him that it was kind of rude of him to just hang up on me like that and again bring up how he was the one who said we could talk because he didn’t reply when I said it the first time. He texts back saying he said good night and “drifted off” which doesn’t make sense because he’s very awake texting me back less than a minute after he hung up. He then tells me that I’m not respecting him and how tired he is because he had a long day (totally ignoring that I also had a long day) and asks if he really said we could talk as if I just made it up or something. We continue to argue about it for a while and he calls me clingy and problematic which is totally uncalled for. He also claims that we never FaceTime for a few minutes which is false because we’ve literally done it before. \n\nI don’t feel like I’m asked for a lot here, just a few minutes on FaceTime is all. I know he was tired but I feel like he could spare 5 minutes calling me especially if he could spare 30 minutes arguing. AITA for wanting to call him even though he was tired??",

      "description": "Throwaway, obv.  \n\nSorry for the poor formatting and long winded post. Thanks for reading:  \n\nMy wife told me 3 months ago that she had feelings for someone else, someone that she met through work. I took it hard, but it was also a wake-up call for me to be a better husband and a better person. After a few weeks she told me the feelings for this other person were gone. Fast forward to a few weeks ago and we were both sick on a morning that we had to get our son to pre-school. I fell asleep and woke up to her fully dressed for the day and saying that our son is in school. I said \"wow how did you do that when you were so sick?\" and she told me that the co-worker she \"used to have a crush on\" drove our family car and took him to school. I was furious, and got mad and gave my wife the cold-shoulder for a few days. Now last week, our car has a minor repair needed. She tells me \"I'm no good with cars\" and that her aforementioned crush should take a look at it. I refused and said I know what happened and how to fix it and I will fix it. She then went behind my back and had this guy look at the car. She lied to me and told me she had her dad look at it (she later admitted lying). Mad, but still determined to prove my worth, I fixed the car no problem. The last straw was this weekend. She was at the store and asked me to take a picture of a recipe  in our cookbook. I used the \"family ipad\" because my phone was dead. The ipad is logged in with her Apple ID, and thus syncs pictures with her phone. When I went to send her the recipe I saw 3 pictures of her vagina close up. I sent her the recipe and said \"why do you have pictures of your pussy on the ipad?\" I knew that she was sending them to the other guy. She responded \"What? Maybe that just turns me on to take those pictures. You don't know how I masturbate anymore\". I don't believe her. Then yesterday in our counselling session she admits to having an \"emotional affair\" with this person and she admits to sending this man pictures of her vagina. I tried to meditate when I got home to calm down but all my brain could think was \"go tell this guy that he is messing with the wrong husband and he better back the fuck off\". So I did. I did a reverse lookup and went to his house, unannounced. He was home but chose not to open the door after a good 5 minutes of me knocking. I pushed on his front door and it opened. I saw a collection of DVDs on a shelf by the door and knocked them all down and yelled to him \"come talk to me like a man. If you want to wreck my home then i will wreck yours\". My rational thinking finally kicked in and i realized i better not break anything of value and get the fuck out of there ASAP. My wife called me about an hour later asking me \"what the fuck i was doing\" and i said \"defending my family, and also, fuck you.\" and hung up. We started our trial separation today. She insists there was nothing physical between them but only her marriage was stopping that. I don't know if i can believe that after her previous lies. I am very calm and peaceful now and honestly going to confront him (doing something about it instead of letting it bother me) felt really good. So, reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Background: my stepmother came into my life when I was about 5 or 6. I am the youngest of five children but the oldest three went with my biological mother. I grew up at odds with my stepmother and sister who generally teamed up on me as my father was working on the road 8-10 months/year. \n\nFast forward to last year: \n\nDad had been having a lot of health problems and appeared to be on his death bed. I was taking sick time off just to be with him. He'd go to bed and I'd have a couple drinks to blow off some steam before heading home (90 minute commute). I even cancelled a family trip to China that my wife planned to be by him (lost 1000s in flight and booking fees). Stepmom accuses me of using dad as an excuse to drink. I blow it off. \n\nChirstmas comes. She asks what my son wants. \"A nice RC car.\" She goes to Big Lots and the damn thing won't turn straight outta the box. Wife gets a super-used silver plated watch with chinks of silver missing everywhere disguised in a new box. Wife and son are upset but I tell them to be grateful. Nothing was said to stepmom. While visiting one day, she takes me aside, stares me right in the face, and accuses me of cheating on my wife. I never have. I blow it off.\n \nValentine's Day comes and I wish her a happy Ash Wednesday (she is Christian, I am not). She responds by saying she hopes I have something nice planned for my wife. I say we're going to a nice restaurant she wanted to go to. \"That's a bad idea. It'll be long waits and terrible service.\" So I go off on her. No cursing, no name calling, but I brought her to justice on her previous offenses. Her reaction? \"We're making a lot of important decisions right now and you just made them easier.\" Wow. Using my dad's poor health to threaten to take me out of the will (they have a very healthy retirement). \n\nI stopped talking to her. She and my sister stopped talking to us. Come to find out a couple months ago, she went to the hospital for jaundice. Dad is forbidden by her from telling me about her condition but she took a dozen people down to the Bahamas last week so it's probably pretty bad. Also, some of dad's comments lead me to believe she doesn't have long.\n\nI couldn't be happier. My life has been relatively drama free since I cut her out. I am looking forward to spending my dad's last year or two without her in the picture. Not to mention, I think it's just desserts that she used my dad dying against me and now it seems she will go first. AITA here?",

It sound silly said like that but my totem name is lune franche (I'm french, sorry, but it sounds better in french, it means frank moon in english). I know I'm young, and I don't know everything about myself, but please trust me when I say that everything that I say in the next lines will be exacly what I mean (even the thing with soul mates, even that I didn't left my boyfriend because of my fuckfriend)\n\nIf you don't trust me on that, please just don't read the next lines, you can think I'm the asshole it's okay, but please don't think that because of something that is not true\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm young and it was only a 2 months old relationship so it wasn't a really serious relationship but I want to know if I was in the wrong.\n\nLast monday, I left my boyfriend by texting him. I planned to tell him in real life but my mother forced me to go to the hospital (mononucleosis) and when I returned home, he had left all these kind messages and I just couldn't wait two days  to tell him. The next day I had prepared to see my ex-fuckfriend (we didn't slept together when I was with my boyfriend) and sleep together. The friday before that, we hugged (sometimes we do that, it's nothing sexual and my boyfriend was ok with it, because our friendship is more important than the sex we had, and he needs affection sometimes) but it was more than just friendly this time and we just couldn't help it (if there was soul mate for friends/fuckfriends we would be soul mate)(I don't believe in soul mates usually).\n\nI didn't broke up with my boyfriend because of my fuckfriend, he was only the trigger. I wasn't ready to be in a relationship. I needed more liberty and more times for myself (to learn more about myself) and this relationship was not good for me and for him. I kept making limits to the number of times we saw each other (1 time by week). My fuckfriend was the trigger because he reminded me of when I had more liberty and more time for myself.\n\nAlso, he really thought that we were going to spend our life together... I mean, we're 15 years old, calm down please.\n\nSo when I told him that it was over he insulted me, tried to bargain and apologized. I accepted his apologies obviously but refused to bargain and decided that we would talk about it in real life wednesday. \n\nAnd tuesday I saw my fuckfriend and we slept together. I decided to do it because I was free, I mean I might as well enjoy it. Now that I think about it, I know that it was because I wasn't good mentally and I just wanted someone to think that what I did was okay\n\nYou, do you think it was okay? ",

      "description": "  \n\nAITA for removing my mother from my life? This happened in 2014.\n\nSo, some background. I'm bipolar, as is my brother. My brother had an episode and ended up getting into some trouble and getting hospitalized. My mother said to me, \"I just don't know anyone who is bipolar!\" I was floored. I told at her how I was bipolar, too, and she knew that and I had been diagnosed several times and attempted suicide several times. When she found out about my first suicide attempt she yelled and screamed at me. She offered no advice or comfort.\n\nWhen we would talk on the phone the conversations were always one-sided. Every time I would try to say something she would interrupt me. It got to the point where I would just stop what I saying and stay silent for most of the conversation.\n\nWhen I would get to together with my siblings we would complain about her and her antics. She was once staying the weekend at my sister's to babysit her kids and she re-arranged the entire the kitchen just because she didn't like how it was. My sister and her husband her pissed!\n\nIn high school I wanted to walk to school instead of her driving me. This led to a fist fight. She was always quick to hitting us when we were growing up.\n\nSo I got really sick in 2013 with Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. I suffered from chronic pain and couldn't do a lot for myself for a few years. She had helped me out a lot during that time, staying with me and caring for me when I needed her to. She was retired so she had the time to do so. It was a really rough time for me - lots of doctors, lots of procedures, lots of medicines - nothing was helping my pain. I could do nothing that was fun anymore.\n\nSo in 2014 I had called her about something and said something about being in pain. She screamed at me on the phone \"I am so sick and tired of hearing about your pain!\" I was so upset. It was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. Everything that had happened in our relationship had come back in that instant and I yelled back \"You will never have to hear about my fucking pain again!\" and hung up on her. I haven't spoke to her since. I blocked her on social media. I blocked her from calling or texting me. She can still email, though. She never apologized to me directly, but I have heard through my siblings that she feels bad about it and she tells them she is sorry. The thing is, she didn't talk to her own mother for 14 years as she was toxic. I feel like turn about is fair play. I have always said that all she needs to do is apologize to me, and all will be fine.\n\nMy step-mom brings it up every once in a while if I have talked to her. \"She is your mother. You need to talk to her.\" I just don't feel that way. I feel like she is a toxic person. She brings no joy to me or my life. I don't miss her. I feel like I am better off with her not in my life. So, AITA for removing my toxic mother from my life?\n\nTL;DR: I got sick, mother yelled at me, I cussed her out and haven't spoke to her since 2014. AITA?",

      "description": "Light background: I’m a minor, my relationship has been going on for about 2 years or so\n\nSo basically, my parents are not very supportive of my LDR and didn’t acknowledge it as valid for over a year and half, and they still might not now. They haven’t been very supportive either, going to say things like “why can’t you like someone closer?” Or “I’m done with all of this,” never asking questions about my significant other, never really attempting to understand and work with it, etc. \n\nShe visited for the first time in September of 2018, and that was a whole mess in itself and sh has came to visit this weekend. This was planned in October and it took me weeks to build up the courage to tell them and work it out with them, and the day I planned to, they said they had a vacation planned for when she would be visiting. This would probably cause complications because they wouldn’t want her coming down while they weren’t home, or would have a general problem with it since it’s an LDR, etc. \n\nFast forward to now, I didn’t tell them and lied about where I was for one night.    I came clean to them that night and explained the situation and again explained why I never felt comfortable talking about the visit, or the relationship in general. I know it’s not right to lie, but am I the asshole in the situation or was I justified in being worried and anxious about talking about it? ",

      "description": "Hi there! First time poster here so apologìes if I don't do this right. \nFor clarification purposes; She's 18, I'm 22 I live in Australia, and Centrelink is basically a pension from the government for being an unemployed job seeker, disabled, carer of a child or some other such condition.\n\nWe started out as a one night stand into friends with benefits, and after a few months of this we started dating, and very shortly after that I begrudgingly agreed to let her move in with me after I did up a draft for a joint budget based on an average of the income we both expected her to have and compared to a budget for only my own income (full time work).\nI had made very clear before we were even dating that on the off chance I did let her move in with me, she would have to get a job, to which she happily agreed and I very begrudgingly took her word for it, since she had said she had indeed had a few part time jobs in the past.\nThe whole relationship was rife with arguements near daily, the core of which is that I'm more controlling and inconsiderate than I'd realized, and she's what I'd call 'emotionally volatile'. I won't get into the personal side of things but suffice to say we both got annoyed/angry at the other very regularly.\nAnyway, as you can expect things only lasted a few months and now we're broken up but she's still living with me. Throughout the whole relationship she's only put in what I feel is the bare minimum effort the whole time to seek an income. She refused to apply for centrelink because I earn enough that she wouldn't recieve anything anyway, and she didnt want to lie to the government and say we're not together (common pracrice in aus, lol). What she did do is hand out 2 resumès to local pubs for a waitress job (there was no job advertised, she just walked in and applied) and she walked down the road to a local mechanic and got herself an unofficial apprenticeship.\nI was quite pleased when she did this as I thought she'd be finally earning a bit of money, but over the exactly 1 month she was there she earned a total of $150 dollars, though she did learn a bit about car mechanics. I had tried to be supportive and didn't mention anything at all about giving some money to me for food or bills.\n\nLast night I brought up that I don't want to support her because she's unwilling to support herself and she got upset and started crying, saying that she already knows and that I'm guilting her and constantly making her feel like shit with my constant reminders.\nI feel a bit trapped because if I kick her out she has to go back to her mother, who she says is emotionally abusive, or her father who she says is physically abusive. But if I let her stay I'm having to financially support my lazy ex who I'm constantly having arguements with, and won't do anything to seek an income.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to kick her out?",

      "description": "  I have been in a long-term relationship with my boyfriend for 4 ½ years and we live together. He was previously married for about 6 years, and has been divorced for 11. His ex-wife does not live close by (she is about 700 miles away) and they do not have children. Their marriage ended on relatively amicable terms (they were not compatible and miserable together), so there does not appear to be any kind of lingering hostility. \n\nThe ex-wife will periodically initiate contact either through text messages or phone calls, depending on what the circumstance is. It is typically that she needs to vent, is experiencing emotional turmoil or needs his help or advice on something (this can range from something minor like what kind of toaster to buy to what kind of car to buy). Usually the calls or texts will occur when I am not around, but I hear about them so I appreciate the disclosures. Every once in a while she will call or text when I am present and let’s just say he will take the call from another room, etc… The preference is to deal with her as quickly as possible so whatever need there was for the interaction is taken care of. \n\nThe frustration I have is after 4½ years he still will not tell her he is in a long-term relationship.  After 11 years, walking on egg shells with how this woman will react to anything is still very present and obvious.  Often times I let it roll off my back, but there are periods of time where I ask “what is the fear here?” and why the ongoing need to hide this part of his life from her? Everyone around us knows we are in a relationship, and albeit a rather happy one at that. \n\nTo some degree, I get that what is going on his life isn’t really her business. They don’t have kids together, they don’t see one another… but honestly, there are times where I want to scream that he needs to f------g deal with it and take care of telling her. The longer he waits, the ease of telling her diminishes…. and frankly 4 ½ years? Is it going to be 6? 7? 10? \n\nAITA for expecting him to just bite the bullet and tell her? Honestly, he’s moved on in his life, but she is a constant presence.  I know I would be the huge asshole if I found her contact information and took care of telling her myself.",

      "description": "I’ll try to keep this as short as possible! I’m a European transplant who’s been on assignment in Miami, USA for a year now. I love it here, and we have a pretty famous and well known nude beach that’s popular amongst local, visitors, and European tourists as well.\n\nI go to the beach a few times a month because 1) awesome year round Miami Beach weather, and 2) I miss having nude beaches everywhere like we do in Europe (I hate tan lines!). I most recently went to the beach yesterday (Tuesday) around 11am, so it wasn’t too crowded. The place gets PACKED on weekends, as the beach is a couple miles long but only about 0.4 miles is sectioned as the nude beach, and 95% of visitors to the beach go to the nude section.\n\nSo I get there, am laying on my towel reading my book enjoying the nice day, and an older gentlemen comes onto the beach and sets up his chair behind me, but not directly behind me, a little of to my left side. Mind you, of course, I’m fully naked, so where’s he’s at, he’s got a full on view of my ass cheeks. He sets his stuff up and about ten minutes later I start hearing comments, very sexual, quick comments ( I won’t repeat them but you can imagine what he was saying) and then I realized he was talking about me (he mentioned my tattoo that I have on my upper back so I know he was looking). The comments got more sexual in nature, but they were very quick outbursts, and stopped until he started again. At this point I got up and walked away, found a beach worker (they take reports of unwanted sexual behavior, which obviously isn’t allowed on a public beach, pretty seriously). A few minutes later the worker comes up and tells the man that he needs to move his chair and stop making comments or else he’ll be asked to be removed from the beach.\n\nNow, the man says he has Tourette’s. I instantly started to feel bad (I wasn’t standing there with them but could overhear from where I was) but I genuinely thought he was making lewd, unwanted comments. He moved his chair to a group of men who are regulars and just arrived, and about two hours later when I left the beach, one of the regulars came up to me and told me I should’ve refrained from escalating the situation because the man has Tourette’s and I could’ve told him to stop on my own first, and that it was genuinely rude of me to do that.\n\nAITA here? I genuinely had no idea he had Tourette’s, and there’s been a few incidents of creepy men on the beach making actual unwanted sexual advances, and they seem to only actually stop when confronted by beach workers, which is why I brought it up to them first, instead of talking to the guy first.",

      "description": "Some background: been married 5+ years, together 10. My husband’s mother has been an issue in our relationship since day one. He is an only child. The first day I ever met her, she spent over an hour telling me about every girl he’d ever dated, making sure to point out one of his exes was a lawyer (I’m a teacher). She is very possessive and controlling. \n\nAnyway, in late June, we were having a garage sale. My in-laws dropped off a bunch of stuff they didn’t want and told us we could keep the profit, which was nice. My MIL insisted on pricing all of her items, and was adamant that we did not take any less than she wanted. Odd, but whatever. \n\nOne day before our sale, I was hanging out in my neighbor’s driveway; my husband was at the gym. I got a text from my husband saying that his parents would be by to “check on things;” his mom wanted to make sure everything looked the way it should. It is not usual that my in-laws just show up with little notice, and I wasn’t really doing anything, so this didn’t bother me. They did not give us an approximate arrival time, and my husband said he’d be home soon. \n\nShortly thereafter, my in-laws arrive while I’m still at my neighbor’s. I live in a residential suburb and our houses are very close together and have short driveways; I waved at my father in law and he waved back. I intended to finish my conversation/activity with my neighbor and then would go back to my garage to speak to my in-laws. \n\nLess than 5 minutes after they arrived, they got in their car and left. I found out later that my MIL bitched to high heaven about how rude I was for not coming over to my garage immediately after their arrival. \n\nSo, like I said, that was in June. Fast forward to this Christmas. We went to my MIL’s family home for the holiday (I really like her family). She barely spoke to me, which isn’t unusual for her (I never know if she’s going to try to be my best friend or if I’ll get the cold shoulder). At the end of the evening, she and my FIL were getting ready to leave. I hugged my FIL goodbye, but when I approached my MIL, she turned around and walked out the door. \n\nI told my husband I thought that was odd, and his response was, “I don’t know, maybe she’s still mad about the garage sale.”\n\nIt is not unusual for her to get really pissed and hold grudges over things I perceive as petty (she absolutely freaked out at me when I suggested we make a donation to the American Cancer Society in our wedding guests’ name instead of favors; she was very angry at me about that for a while). However, she was at my home and I didn’t greet her. \n\nSo, let me have it. AITA?",

      "description": "When I was about 15, I got into an online relationship with someone (yes I was dumb) my age through a mutual skype group. We had the same sense of humor and interests and he seemed super cool.\n\nEventually, I found out I had feelings for a friend IRL and he was entering his freshman year of highschool. I thought it would be healthier for us both to seek relationships in real life, and I also kind of felt suffocated in a relationship where I didn’t have a voice, so I broke it off with him. I told him that he should look for someone IRL and this blew up in my face resulting in him telling me that “you can’t break up with me because that’s not a good enough reason to”. I dated him for about a week after that before actually putting my foot down because I’m kind of a doormat. \n\nWe remained friends for a few months but he was constantly telling me how he was depressed and lonely, and that he didn’t know how to go on without me. I know that stuff is messed up but he did have mental health issues so I have a hard time blaming him or considering it deliberate. Eventually I was worn down enough that I got back together with him even though I really didn’t want to because I was scared of what he would do to himself if I didn’t.\n\nOver the following months of us “dating” I tried to interact with him, but I often became exhausted in a relationship I didn’t want. I also had very serious personal issues happening IRL, that he ignored in favor of chewing me out for avoiding him. I would cut contact with him without warning for over a week sometimes just so I could get myself together and in a mental state where I could handle interacting with him. \n\nCutting contact got him so upset that eventually he didn’t really have a choice other than breaking up with me. He later went on to claim this was abuse because he had bpd and I was his “favorite person” and ghosting him was simulating abandonment. For a while I felt really awful and genuinely saw my actions as abusive until I told my friends about it and they said it was the other way around. \n\nIt’s been a long time since then but I still feel very conflicted on my own actions, and whether there’s even a “wrong person vs right person” in the given scenario. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "This is an old argument, but my ex-wife brought it up today and I was wondering. Some backstory:\n\nWe used to live in an old farmhouse and the first, FIRST thing I did was install dampened, quick release toilet seats in the two bathrooms to prevent slamming and ease cleaning. However, since we were on well water that had a high sulfur content, no matter what I did to clean the underside of the seats, they would eventually get hard water deposits on them that would turn some various shade of yellow. I spent two years cleaning the seats by hand (wife didn't like cleaning bathrooms - it made her sick) but I would have to remove all the seats monthly and soak them in a tub in one of the outbuildings for an hour or two to get the stains out.\n\nAfter the second year I noticed that any plastics from the kitchen I put in the dishwasher, all of which suffered the same sulfur curse as the rest of the house, came out clean. Our soap holder above the sink, the dishrack, etc. responded pretty well to a dishwasher cycle. So I tried the toilet seats. And guess what? IT F\\*\\*KING WORKED LIKE MAGIC!\n\nSince I was working at home at the time and taking care of the house, I think I did this for four months before my then-wife discovered what I was doing and I explained it. I wasn't trying to hide it, she just wasn't home when I was washing the toilet seats. It turned into a blowout argument, which wasn't unusual, but she refused to use the dishwasher until I replaced it and she made me throw out all the dishes. She was obviously angry at me for putting a toilet seat in the dishwasher, but I was equally angry at having to throw out all the dishes, because dishwashers clean things, right? It's not like there's going to be special dirt left over from a toilet seat. \n\nI realize there are some things you can't put in a dishwasher, like oil-coated carburetors or dirty parts from a car, because you're ruining the water pump in the dishwasher. Toilet seats don't do that.\n\nWe've been split up for five years, but every time we have an argument, which is rare since we don't live anywhere near each other anymore, she brings up the toilet seat in the dishwasher. She's told it to multiple friends, posted it on Facebook, and otherwise tried to use it to shame me. I don't think I'm in the wrong, however.\n\nAITA?\n\n ",

      "description": "I used to be fairly understanding to beggars, and would usually give a dollar or two if they ask from me. However, last year I had an experience with two beggars where they asked me to buy McDonald for them and I did, but then ended up asking for much more than necessary (over $20 from like large milkshakes, chicken nuggets, etc etc). So I put my foot down and only bought them a 20 piece nugget. After that terrible experience, I have taken to ignoring beggars of all sorts and refuse to hear any one of them out. \n\nJust now studying in a cafe, a mother carrying her child tapped on the desk near me (I had headphones in) and I took off my headphones to talk. She asked me to help and immediately I put my headphones back on without hearing her out at all. I felt really bad for that... so AITA if I continue to treat beggars this way? ",

      "description": "When we got our new place we told each other that we would have Thanksgiving together and finally be free of the over-the-top 6 hour family dinners. I have no family here, I moved up here from all across the US to be with my girlfriend. Yesterday, she told me that shes going to have dinner at her parents house, which means that I am going to be totally home alone. \n\nShe was supposed to do the groceries  because my schedule has consisted of pulling crazy long shifts from 8 am-11 pm. We wanted to have a bonding activity where we just whip up something together and I looked in the fridge to realize she didn't do any shopping even though shes been home almost every day. \n\nEating with her family is not an option. Her mother physically attacked me a couple months ago and I refuse to step foot in the house in fear for my own safety. I was also surprised to hear this news because she doesn't have a good relationship with her family and wants nothing to do with them. I got really upset and told her that what she's doing isn't exactly cool, especially if we had planned out our Thanksgiving. She told me its not fair that I'm making her choose between me and her family. I told her I don't get it because she doesn't even like her family in the first place.  \n\nI just feel like shit. I've been crying alone. I am embarrassed. Am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for expecting my dad to put gas in my car after borrowing it?",
      "description": "My dad recently borrowed my car while his was in the shop(this has happened often recently). The thing is 3 of the last 4 times he's borrowed my car he has returned it with an empty or nearly empty tank, no matter how full it was when he received the car. He plays the lottery 3-4 times a day at around $7 each time but never has any money for gas. The last time he returned my car below E, I ended up late to an important appointment. The time before that I wasn't able to go to class because I had no money and once again no gas. I complained to my mom saying that I hope he doesn't return my car on E like he usually does. Yesterday, he let us know his car was ready and told us to go pick it up from the shop. When my mom texted him letting him know that we had picked up his car she also said \"Please put some gas in dontaskplease's car when you return it\". What followed was him calling everyone petty and saying it was rude for us to mention gas at all. In our family group chat he said, \"Whenever I use don'taskplease's car -- I wash it; I vacuum it; I put gas in it; I put oils in it!! If I don't put gas in it it's because I don't have money .Too Hard to think and understand and resolve in your own head on your own!! \nKeep pettiness to yourself!!\" \n\n\"I do too much.... I sacrifice and put myself last too much for any of you to not allow yourself the grace and the reason to slow your roll and your suspicion or to process things that may appear to be a slight against you. If I ever don't put Chas in your car, it's because I don't have the money. You ever wonder why your oil, power steering Fluids never run dry... ?? \nSmh.....Young lady ... do not grow up petty!! Think higher !! No one is out to take advantage of you-- especially your father!! \nThank you!! \"\n\nIn response I asked him not to react to a simple request with such negativity and name calling and I explained the reason I mentioned it was because of the inconvenience it has caused me and because I felt like he didn't care if I couldn't get to school or work because he had used all of my gas. What annoyed me most was that he never once just told me\" Hey, I don't have any money for gas, so the car's on E, I'll get you some gas later,\" he always just left me with no gas and let me find out about it when it was time for me to be somewhere. Lastly, I said, \"I hope that you will treat others' commitments and responsibilities with the care that you put into your own! Thank you.\" I don't even want to lend him my car anymore.\n\nI am so frustrated by how overblown this whole situation has become. I always make sure to thank him when I notice he's changed the fluids or cleaned the car. I felt bad after reading about not having money because I know that he's stressed because of our family's financial difficulties. We don't have a great relationship and he and I butt heads every once in a while. I know I may just be annoyed about everything else leading up to this but AITA here?",

      "description": "So I [2x m] had a homie, Dan, [2x m] who was dating this crazy cat lady [2x f]. We were childhood friends and nobody was closer than we were. Our friendship ended shortly after his relationship with his girl for related reasons. \n\nAfter a solid month of them dating, she was posting some pics about her and another bro, “Luis.” This is unusual because this chick only posts about cats. I had a suspicion that she liked Luis but had no proof. I didn’t know if Luis was interested in her so I made a joke to Luis that he’s got a new girl. He said nah fam so I thought that he’s doing nothing.\n\nThis girl was so crazy about Luis that there were albums full of pics of him and posts dedicated to him. Heck, girl had more pics of him on social media than pics of Dan. Somehow, I was the only one who was suspicious of crazy girl. If she had pics of me like that, I’d tell her to put them down. I don’t do that.\n\nMonths later, she gets caught making out with Luis cuz she was only using Dan the man. She figured Luis didn’t want a relationship so she toyed with Dan. Now, Dan hears about this, acts like a pisser. He wanted me to beat up Luis and I was like bro I don’t want to be behind a cell. \n\nLuis somehow makes it up with Dan. Dan starts becoming a drug addict and an alcoholic. Anyways, this crazy cat girl starts posting up pics of some schmuck who looked real squeaky clean. I don’t like guys like that. Makes me question them when they that good and clean. So, I guessed that girl is cheating with this clean dude. I don’t confront it but I kept it to myself. Never said a word to Dan.\n\nMonths later, it turns out she was cheating clean guy for several months. She got caught in her cat filled apartment. I was the only bro not surprised so Dan figured that I somehow knew and it broke his trust. He said I’m the asshole for never telling him on some dude I don’t even know.\n\nAITA? This girl is obvi and it ain’t my fault Dan is blind. Also, it ain’t my business.",

      "description": "Jessica and I (21F) were best friends in high school, but she now goes to university on the opposite side of the country. Nowadays, we only see each other 2-3 times a year.  We're no longer as close as we used to be, but she still has a special place in my heart, and I've always assumed she felt the same way about me. \n\nIn December, I texted Jessica to ask if she would be coming home for Christmas. She texted back, \"Sorry, I'm too busy to fly home this year! See you in the summer.\" I thought, okay, no big deal. \n\nThen one day, closer to Christmas, Jessica sent a Snapchat to a group that I'm part of. It was a picture of her sister (who lives in our hometown), and the background looked vaguely like a restaurant in our hometown. I wasn't really paying attention, so I thought maybe it was just an old picture. But the next day, Jessica sent another Snapchat to the same group, and it was a video of herself that also looked a lot like it was taken in our hometown. \n\nI texted our group chat (which has 5 other people in it) to ask \"Hey Jess, are you back home?\" and received no immediate response. Our group chat moves pretty fast, so the message got buried quickly and I wasn't sure if Jessica ever saw it. \n\nThe night of December 25th, I received a text from Jessica. She said, \"Hey, Merry Christmas! I actually did fly back to \\[hometown\\]. It was only for a few days though. I knew I wouldn't have time to hang out with you so I didn't bother telling you. I'll see you in the summer.\"\n\nI was with our other friend when I received that text. I showed him and he told me, \"Yeah, I bumped into Jessica at the mall on December 23rd. She told me not to tell you. She didn't have time to hang out with you and felt bad about it.\" \n\nI said, \"Then why did she send me those Snapchats that were clearly taken in our hometown?\"\n\nHe said, \"I don't know. I guess she forgot that she was supposed to be lying to you.\" \n\nThis really upset me at the time. I'm a mature adult who understands people have different priorities and get busy. If Jessica had just told me the truth, I would've been okay with it. But the way she handled things, it felt like she didn't care about me. And the fact that she didn't even do a good job of lying and sent those Snapchats is just the cherry on top. \n\nFor the record, I didn't hold a grudge against Jessica for this. I never brought it up again after that one text, and our friendship is still going strong today. But I  can't believe she lied to me (and made our other friends lie to me too). \n\nIs this justified or AITA? ",

      "description": "We are a group of four friends in our final year of high school. We are planning to go to South Korea this summer after we graduate to visit one of our other friend, and we've been planning this trip for a while, but delaying buying plane tickets because we are still unsure of the dates on which we will go. \n\nBecause in order to pay for my expenses during the whole month we will stay in the country, I have to work in July, as well as another one of my friends (let's call her S). Last friday, I learned that the other two (let's call them J and M) planned on going to buy plane tickets together this week on wednesday, which is a problem because :\n\na) our parents were supposed to meet and help us sort everything out to make sure we were all on the same page before buying the tickets\n\nb) I'm taking my photo for my passport and doing some other really important stuff for the trip on wednesday, and so is my other friend S\n\nc) the departure date falls right on the last day of July, and as I don't know where I will work exactly, and what my schedule will be like, I don't want to miss a day and not get paid. They KNOW that S and I can't go if we don't work, and they won't budge. \n\nd) we were supposed to buy them all together \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I expressed that I felt betrayed they took this decision selfishly without telling us, they basically replied that they want them now and are worried about the prices rising, which I can understand, but I doubt waiting two more weeks will change anything to the price. It's supposed to be a trip we are taking as a friend group, but the more time passes the more I wonder if I even want to go if they act that way. \n\nIt really hurts me because it felt like they purposely make this harder for us, and when I talk to them about it they get really defensive, bringing up how long we waited as some kind of excuse.

A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin’s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister’s kids that my son was a, ”Retard.” Then came to me nudged me and said, “Is your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, “YOU CAN’T CALL MY SON A RETARD!” All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, “Using that language around her.” And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn’t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn’t.",

      "description": "\nI’ve been going out with a very nice guy for a while. When we first met he introduced himself as a «Musician/artist » and he told me all about his dreams of making it in the music industry.  Not knowing much about him at the time, I was polite and I told him how great it was for him to firmly believe in his dreams. \n\nOver the next few dates he would play some of his music,  it was very basic electronic music with very few unimpressive vocals, the type anyone can produce at home on a laptop. I later went and checked all the music he posted on different platforms and they all had very few following aside from some kind words from his friends.  Nevertheless I was still nice and didn’t make any remarks about it.\n\nWe were starting to get closer, and one afternoon we decided to meet up for coffee. The whole time he complained about his job, ( he worked as a server, but always said it was a part time temporary thing, even though that’s all he done his entire life). He complained about not being able to make ends meet , and having debt he should repay. He also recently had to move from his apartment to a basement because he couldn’t keep up with the expenses. \n\nThat was when I, a very honest and objective person decided to dish it out for him. I started off by asking him about his career plans, and when he started to talk about the music, I interrupted him and said, « no, real plans ». I tried to be as kind as I can, but At the same time I wanted to him to hear that, I told him that he doesn’t really have a chance at a big music career, and that he should focus on something more realistic that will help him establish a stable life. He was pushing thirty and haven’t had a job other than a server. I made all my points, which were all valid.\n\nI felt like I was just being blunt and honest and trying to show him the situation as it for him to get realistic.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n",

      "description": "This is going to be kinda difficult to explain, but I’ll try my best. Also, I’m on mobile. \n\nSome backstory; I’ve had a rough relationship with my fathers side of the family. My aunt is really demanding and more often then not gets what she wants. My cousin is a few years younger than me, and I used to be really close with her, but when she decided to do some bad decisions, I cut all ties with her. She had to move to an institution.\n\nNow, where I live we have this very expensive national costume which we have for very special occasions, such as the national holiday or weddings and such. These would cost around 2500$. They take months to make. \nWhen people are around 15 yo, we have this huge celebration, and this is kinda a big deal. And most girls get these national costumes for this day. I was one of these, and i absolutely love mine. \nBut since my cousin have been in and out of intuitions, I don’t think she had the time to get one. And my aunt just suddenly asked if she could borrow mine. I was kinda flustered, and didn’t know what to say, so I just awkwardly agreed. I didn’t really want to, because I had been looking forward to wearing it the whole year. \nI should note that my cousin is a bit bigger than me, and it probably wouldn’t fit, but I have a bigger sister and my aunt just assumed she would also be fine lending hers out if mine is too small.\n\nI told my mom about this some time later, and she was all “ no, absolutely not. It’s made for you, and you only get to wear it once a year. And what if something happened to it? Who would be responsible?” So I agreed, but I don’t know what to think. I really wouldn’t like giving it away, but feel kinda bad, since she hasn’t had the opportunity to get one. And even if I don’t talk to her much, she’s still my cousin,and this day is special.

      "description": "Throwaway because reasons.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, my parents split under tough circumstances. In short, my dad had an affair and my mom found out. It was really shocking and hard on the whole family, as my dad had always been a really stand-up guy, and they divorced a few months after she discovered what was going on. \n\nMy dad is currently in a relationship with the woman he was having that affair with; they live together, he has a relationship with her (grown) children, the whole nine. Recently, he called and asked if I wanted to come out and visit them - I live in CA and he lives in FL. I told him in no uncertain terms that this was not something I would be interested in, as i did not have any desire to meet or get to know his new girlfriend, and likely never would. This was of course not what he wanted to hear. He seemed really upset by the concept that i would \\*never\\* want to meet her, and while he was not yelling or being aggressive or anything like that, I knew he was very angry and hurt. \n\nFor reference, I'm an adult (24F), I live on my own and support myself entirely, and while I love my dad and always will, a big part of me is still working through the hurt he caused. I don't necessarily think that the best thing for me to meet this person, and frankly I don't see what the benefit of me doing that would be. But, I have talked to a few people who seem to think I'm being petty or spiteful. So, what do you think Reddit, AITA? ",

FA even apologized for making it strong.\n\nOnce he finished the drink(The drink i gave him)  he still kept on complaining about how the his old drink was strong. Then he stated that \"you guys have bad intensions.\" As soon as he said that I snapped and I told him to stop complaining about a drink he is not drink in a very insulting manner. I said \"Stop bitching about the drink you are not drinking. It is a drink you go and add more coke to it and make it lighter.  Also the FA apologized for it so stop complaining. Past 30 minutes i just hear you bitching about it and it annoying Af.\" FB stated he will be leaving and thus i told him \"if you want to stay fucking stay or leave but stop complaining.\"\n\nAs i said that he stood up and left.

      "description": "I have two beautiful Persian cats with very long, thick fur. I live with my mom, it’s just the two of us and we love our cats very much. \n\nWe live in a single family style house with a screened in patio in our backyard. We also have a pool inside of our patio that has no fencing/netting around it. My mom is a smoker so she spends most of her time in the patio. A few months ago, one of my cats would always stand in front of the sliding door that opens to the patio and meow to come out. My mom started letting him out with her. Months later when I took him to the groomers, they informed me they found fleas on him and had to give him a flea bath. They texted me a picture. I felt awful as I used to work in a pet store and I know how much of a nuisance it is to get rid of fleas once they’re in your home and I know it really hurts the animal. I explained this to my mom and she stopped letting him out.\n\nNow my mom is letting BOTH cats out on the patio for extended periods of time. I told her to stop doing that but she argues that they love it and they get bored sitting in our air conditioned home all day. I love my cats and I want them to have fun and I know they like going outside but now there’s a bigger dilemma than just fleas. My mom leaves them out sometimes and shuts the patio door. We live in Florida, it’s HOT and they get thirsty and try to drink from the pool water. I’m scared they’ll fall in and drown while my mom is inside. She is also extremely forgetful. For example 2 days ago we went to the doctors and she asked me if she remembered to bring the cats inside. We have also had a snake somehow get inside the patio in the past. I love my cats and I know they have fun exploring in the patio chasing lizards and whatnot but I’m very worried about safety. I woke up at 2am today with a racing heart because I thought my mom may have forgotten one of the cats outside. Often times she is too lazy to bring them back into the house so she will either force me to drop whatever I’m doing to go get them or she will turn on the vacuum which startled them and makes them run inside. \n\nNow I know lying is wrong but here’s why I’m considering it. My mom is extremely narcissistic and sensitive. Especially when she drinks, which she does almost every day. If I tell my mom why I’m apprehensive about letting the cats on the patio she will get irrationally angry and accuse me of saying she is “dumb” and “negligent”. She will continue to let them out. If I say they have fleas and bring up the argument that it makes the animals super itchy and the fleas can transfer onto rugs and other things she would be more inclined to stop letting them out.

      "description": "I feel like I was an over-sensitive asshole, yet at the same time I don't. (I'll be calling my ex-friend A)  \n\n\nSo, I met A on Roblox, and we hit it off pretty quick, we had a great roleplay, and our characters got along VERY well. We roleplayed a couple more nights on Roblox on the same game, and after a few days, A gave me their discord name, so I added them on discord. We started chatting even more on discord, expanding our roleplay world. We were kinda disagreeing a tad bit on some things, but it was overall fine. After a few days of roleplaying we had a HUGE disagreement, I don't remember how it came up but I stated that canonically in this particular story my characters would die in a few hundredish years. A threw a fit and told me they'd sabotage the relationship, kill off characters, ect, after a bit I got A to calm down, and we were fine for a few more days until A decided they wanted to ship their female character with one of my males, who was gay, I politely declined and told A that my character was gay and thus uninterested in their character, A had a complete meltdown and started threatening to kill characters, and sabotage the roleplay. Then A started insulting my character. At first I kinda took it as a joke, until A started insulting his sexuality, I took that more seriously and started yelling back at A. They continued insulting my character and threatening to sabotage the roleplay, I couldn't take it anymore, so without warning, I blocked A. I've never heard from them again. This has just been...scratching at me...I feel like an over-sensitive asshole.  \n\n\nWas I the asshole here? Or was I in the clear? I feel like I was a tad bit too protective over this fictional person I made, but at the same time, I felt like A was insulting the gay community and gay people as a whole, and to top it off, they were threatening to sabotage our entire roleplay. Should I have given them a second chance? Or was I right to block them?",

      "description": "So I do photography as a hobby. And one area of photography I want experience in is “boudoir” which is usually in lingerie or tastefully nude. It’s meant to celebrate the beauty of the human body. Not pornographic. I want to be clear about that.\n\nMy friend that I’ll call Lily wants to be the subject of a boudoir shoot for me and I said sure. She lives with her boyfriend James family but she assured me that there’s plenty of room to do it. So I grabbed my stuff and went over there. And the house is like medium sized but there’s like 5 cars in the driveway. I’m a little suspicious. But I text lily. She comes out and brings me inside. And there are like 12 people there. I guess family were visiting. But I’m polite and say hello and explain that I’m a photographer and I’m here to try some shots with lily and all that but leave out the boudoir part because I feel a little weird about it. \n\nLily takes me into a sort of like living room/reading area room and says she thinks this spot will work. I agree but one wall is open to the rest of the house. I ask her if she’s alright with that and she says yeah and James comes over to help too. And he assured me that nobody will come over to this part of the house and they’ll respect privacy. So I just go along with it. \n\nI set up lights and stuff and lily gets changed into the lingerie. And it’s going well for a while. And then James mom comes in and says “oh I just wanna watch. It’s so interesting” and I’m uncomfortable. But it’s her home so I just say okay. And she watches for a bit and then leaves. Shoot keeps going. More of the family peeks their heads in and James and lily aren’t doing a thing about it and I’m getting more and more uncomfortable. At one point I did ask James to keep them away because I felt uncomfortable but he said he can’t because it’s his family’s house. It finally came to a head when lily was fully nude and still posing and James little brother came in and poked me in the side and said “you just wanna see boobs. Don’t you? Creep” and I just couldn’t take it. I already felt weird about this whole thing because I was worried people would say that precise thing. And everything since then just made it worse. So I just told them I was really uncomfortable and I didn’t want to keep doing this and I started packing up all my stuff. And James and lily are apologizing and asking me to keep going but I couldn’t. I was too uncomfortable. So I leave. \n\nNow they’re upset at me. And I feel bad. None of the other family judged me or criticized me or anything. And the brother might have been joking. But I was just almost having a panic attack by that point. I have bad anxiety and depression so that may have been making things worse. Should I try again? Or ask them to find another location or something? Also I’m 22 and lily and James are 20",

      "description": "I come from a rural area where everybody knows anybody and tonight I was out partying in a nearby town. I came to a scene where apparently two guys had kept a girl who I know(I also know her parents, if that matters) and two of her friends(all three are minors) from being brought home by the police by saying they were their cousins and keeping an eye on them.\n\nWhen I came to the scene the police was still there controlling other people, but not directly in earshot. The two guys demanded a \"thank you\" but kept insisting on it even after the girls said the words and we're visibly uncomfortable. \nThe girl I know looked terrified and came close to me, so I told the guys to get lost, as they had received their thanks but they didn't listen and stuck around telling me that they'd take care of the girls even though the girls and I insisted on them leaving.\n\nEnd of the story was, that I waited there, until a cab arrived to take the girls home as they had surpassed their curvew anyway.\n\nLong story short: Would it have been ok to punch the guys or should I have gotten the police involved?",

The problem is I live with my parents and can't really make those decisions. Another problem is that he is like 23 and I´m barely 18. Now, had it been a really close friend, of course I would have *tried*, but I barely know this guy, and he has been pestering me for months now.\n\nAlso, from what I've heard, he is a horrible house guest. He has long, thick hair and when he brushes it large balls of hair come out, which he just leaves on the floor or on whatever couch or something he sits on. He is into some weird sexual stuff and brings it up to everyone, even strangers, and has a hobby of watching really nasty porn infront of people. I've also heard from my friends that did take him in that once he is there, it can take up to a week to get him to leave, because he literally refuses, and even locks himself in to stay. Am I an asshole for refusing to even let him *see* my place knowing that he has used that as an excuse to stay for weeks.",

One day, he comes over to our group and asks if he could sit with us, obviously, we let him sit with us since none of us had anything against him. This is where a problem started, this kid talked and would not stop talking to us about stuff like video games and politics, so much that we couldn't focus on work for the class. He would constantly talk to us about how he hated the US president (We are Canadian) and kept saying how he wanted to assassinate him. The worst part was that he would take our supplies to \"borrow them\" and when we ask for our stuff back he would say that the supplies were his and he didn't trust us. Eventually, all of us had gotten fed up with him and asked him to leave. I had felt bad about this because I believed he was on the spectrum and I know that people like that are great people and should be treated equally, but this guy really got on me and my friend's nerves.",

      "description": "A little backstory, I go to college and me and my roommate share a room. Not very big, just enough to fit 2 beds, 2 dressers, 2 desks, and 2 closets.\nThis morning I got a text from him saying he wants to get the room so he and his girlfriend want the room to themselves from 8:30-10, promising to not go any longer than that. This happens often so although I’m not a fan of this happening, as sometimes he asks for the room until midnight, even on school nights, I agree. Keep in mind I have classes about an hour and a half before he does, so I can’t be awake all night like he does. \nAnyways, tonight I was in my friends room next door, killing time until I can go back, which again, would be 10pm at the latest. As soon as it turns to 10, I text him to make sure I can come back, as I normally do. No response. I give it 10 minutes for him to respond, but still nothing. At this point, I’m getting frustrated because I have work to do, which I can’t because my laptop and notes are all in my backpack, which is in my room. Finally after 15 minutes from the initial text I decide to walk in anyways, because sometimes he doesn’t answer his phone and isn’t in the room anymore. \nI open the door and am immediately greeted with him frantically telling me to close the door and to get out. I never looked up, so I didn’t see anything. Another thing about my roommate is he has never had sex before, so I assumed nothing would be going on. Anyways, I keep my head down, grab my bag while he is basically yelling at me to leave the room, and leave. I was only inside for 10 seconds at the most, not even seeing anything. \nAfter about an hour, I get a text from him saying he is finally out of the room, even though it is close to 11pm, and that what I did “wasn’t cool” because I should have knocked and respected his privacy. Although I understand where he is coming from, I still had work to do and couldn’t be up all night waiting for him to leave OUR room. \nWhen I told some of my other friends they have had mixed emotions about what I did. In the end, everyone was about 50/50. \nSo AITA?\n",

During these lunches, people who did something memorable last weekend or went on vacation or something often show photos of what they've been doing on the TV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring one of these lunches someone asked if anyone had any fun plans this weekend. I happily said I'm going to comic con with a few friends, explained what it is etc. They were positive/neutral about it and suggested I showed some photos next week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing; I'd prefer to not openly present those photos in front of the entire workfloor (about 15 people). It's not that I don't want them to see it, I just think it'll be rather weird and awkward if I display me and my friends dressed up as anime characters, without them having any context or knowledge of those series or characters at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Colleagues often show pictures of fun weekends during lunches.

We even took the idea of the draft the guards set up and drafted characters and made a game of the season.  I told someone about this and they made it seem like I was an asshole for watching a show with as much nudity and sex with a 14 year-old. I am not attracted to kids at all and was kind of offended by that assertion, but am I an asshole here?",

I was fair in my message to her saying that love comes with time and so does knowing someone completely. However, because my friend is delusional and didn't like what she heard, she broke our off friendship.\n\nI care for her a lot and she tends to do this with boyfriends. She puts all the focus on him and if anyone has a bad thing to say, she will cut them off like they meant absolutely nothing. I know it wasn't my place to have an opinion on their relationship, but considering he was a 23 year old from tinder who knew she was 17 from the get go (it was in her bio) I just found it a bit creepy. I got a bad vibe from him to be honest.\n\nHe also stated that he had never had a serious girlfriend and had only one night stands. My friend is so easy to manipulate with words so I was worried.

      "description": "We are getting married with my partner soon and we want to start a family.\nHe has a very bad phobia of going to the doctor, getting tests done, being diagnosed etc. probably because of his traumatic experiences. Through high school/early college he had multiple lung surgeries that left him with many scars.\nCouple of days ago I tried to convince him to get some blood tests done because he has some health issues. At first he freaked out and said he doesn’t want to go, eventually I eased him into the idea that health problems won’t go away just because you ignore them and diagnosis can actually help you get right treatment.\nAfter that conversation I asked him if when we will have children he could try to not express his fears of doctors in front of them, so they are not scared as well. I told him I would like him to try speak of going to the doctor as something positive in front of them and only express this negativity when we are alone with no kids around. He agreed but I felt terrible guilt afterwards.\nAfter all... I have fear of insects and if someone told me to not freak out when I see a giant bug it would be very difficult for me. Fear is something very difficult to control. I feel like I’m expecting too much of him...\n\nIn summary - Am I the asshole for wanting my partner to not express his fears and phobias in front of our future children so they are not scared of them too?",

      "description": "A few things before the story because not everyone knows Ark:\nTribe- clan\nAlpha- largest/strongest tribe that makes the rules\n \nA friend and I both started playing this game called Ark Survival Evolved on pc a little over 2 years ago or so. The objective of the game is to build up a base, tame dinosaurs, beat bosses but you can just do what you want. We joined a server and soon after started getting trolled by a person named Joey. He only went after newbies so soon after we learned the mechanics, he chose a new victim.\n \nAfter getting our base destroyed numerous times, we took a break from Ark for a bit.\n \nA huge inter-server war started around this time and we were in the middle of it. Alpha tribes of all different servers were trying to pillage servers while other alphas started barricading off their own obelisks with automated turrets and walls.\n \nOur servers’ defenses were good but not good enough. An enemy Alpha tribe got into the server somehow and went on to wreck the entire server there was nothing we could do to stop it, we just watched as their wyvern slowly disintegrated the dinosaurs and home we grew to love.\n \n(This changed how we played Ark permanently)\n \nBIRTH OF BOBS:\nWe no longer saw a point in building at all as it would just be destroyed anyway. We now saw took after Joey.\n \nWe joined a new server. Again, my friend and I both created a tribe together, this time called “Tribe of Bobs”. We had a few differences in character build, but mainly leveled melee damage to allow us to knock others out in 1 hit. This quickly became the most fun thing to do in the game because you could knock someone out and they had to just sit there and wait. We got better and better at infiltrating bases and ambushing. Some people would have large groups come help them some didn’t. A lot of people begged us to stop and offered us stuff/asked what we wanted/why we were doing it.\n \nUnlike Joey we didn’t just do this to new comers. New comers were way to easy to knock out and it wasn’t fun, nor did it feel good. The most fun was when we’d fight larger tribes than us which was mostly everyone because we are just two people, but also when the enemy is experienced. The experienced players had guns, better dinosaurs, harder bases to get into, and they tried to jail us. A few times we had gotten caught and thought it was all over but hatched well thought out plans to free each other from these prisons and every single time they worked.\n \nThe best part was we easily made armor, clubs and made no bases, we just spawned where we heard people were at. Our enemies would always say they’d get us back and that we’d be sorry but there was nothing they could do or take from us. No one was able to stop us, it was so exhilarating! Sometimes doing these things we felt bad because we were making others feel bad. But the entire servers we were on were about pvp, if they didn’t want to have people attacking them, they could have played pve.",

      "description": "tl;dr my boyfriend works in the forestry sector and one of his co-workers is leaving, so today his company had a leaving meal. Afterwards two other co-workers came past my boyfriend and I's flat and I was invited to go out with a coffee with them. \n\nWe go out to a coffee shop and I didn't end up having a very nice time. The entire time it was either all three of them engaged in discussion about forestry, or two of them engaged in discussion about forestry with my boyfriend and I being cut out of the discussion. **Don't get me wrong though,** I don't mind this. One of his co-workers is leaving, obviously the focus of any discussion is going to be with him. My issue is that the entire time I was there, despite repeated efforts to engage in the conservation (I don't know much about the industry and the terminology they were using), I was pretty much waved over or mostly ignored. Because I was just sitting there awkwardly I tried to focus my attention on my boyfriend and strike up a conversation with him instead, but he was acting off. Whenever we had a quiet moment to ourselves I kept asking him he was okay, but he told me that he was fine. It was only when we got home that he pulled me aside and told me that actually, yes, he did have a problem. He told me that I was acting really weird and rude. That I was just sitting there staring out of the window and biting my nails (I am a nail biter, but I only do it when I'm feeling anxious, and I do it subconsciously). He told me that it was weird that I kept trying to talk to him when he was actually listening to his co-workers conversation (my bad on that. I genuinely thought he was bored too since he kept staring into space).\n\nI get mad and tell him that if I looked bored it was because nobody was making any attempt to reciprocate me. He's telling me that it's my fault that nobody's talking to me because I look bored and that if I don't understand the conversation then I should just pretend to be interested. I'm telling him that it's a chicken and an egg situation because the only reason I was looking bored, staring out the window and was probably biting my nails was because nobody was accepting any of my efforts to engage in the discussion, and that I wasn't going to lie and pretend to be interested in a conversation I know nothing about because I hate when I'm talking to people about something and they pretend to be interested in it because I think it's a waste of both our time (and to be fair to me, I did try asking questions, like whether the sweet chestnut tree was native to UK, but all that happened was that my question was answered and then went straight back to being ignored).\n\nDid I actually do something wrong here? I genuinely don't get it.",

      "description": "Let me start by saying that I do absolutely plan on talking to my wife about this, but I wanted a reality check first to see if my perspective on the issue is wrong.\n\nMy wife and I have been married for 4 years and we have 2 kids, a 3 year old and a 6 month old. Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?",

      "description": "I live in Harlem. It is a very busy area, there is a lot of traffic at all hours of the day. Often when I'm walking my dog - always on a leash - there are people out walking their dogs without leashes. Usually their dog will then run up to my dog and get right in her face. My dog doesn't bite, but she is a senior rescue and she is strange around other dogs. Sometimes she's oblivious to them and other times she growls and gets noticeably scared. This especially happens with pitbulls and similar breeds. I am concerned about unpredictable dogs possibly hurting her, but I'm also concerned about unleashed dogs running up to her and into traffic. This has in fact almost happened but the owner grabbed their dog just in time.\n\nNYC is very \"mind your own business\" and so I generally don't say anything. A few times I have said something when my dog is visibly shaken by the ordeal. I simply say, firmly but a little curtly, \"You should really have your dog on a leash\". I don't yell or swear but I'm not friendly about it. I've had responses ranging from \"don't worry about it\" to \"fuck off\" to just laughing at me.\n\nAITA?\n\n(and for the record, I have no problem with pitbulls. I think they're generally sweet and loving dogs unless they're trained to be otherwise. The issue is that *my dog* seemingly has a problem with them.)",

      "description": "This last week I was working out of towm with another co-worker who is a metal head. We were staying in a work house together and this guy is really into metal music and felt the need to share it with everyone around him. It was spewing out of his room, you could hear it through out the house. When he took a shower in the bathroom which was adjacent to the kitchen he played his music, when he would actually use his earbuds he had it loud enough to be heard clearly in what ever room he was in. I found it extremely grading and disrespectful to the people around him. I've asked him to turn it down. I had to ask four times today, raising my voice to practically yelling at him to turn it down. He is ten years younger than me and pretty sure he still lives with his parents for context.  Am I the asshole here? I find this extremely unpleasant in a shared space. Is it just me?",

      "description": "So, I (20F) have been friends with C (20F) since we were little kids. She’s always had a very demanding attitude. She’s the definition of “It’s my way or the highway!” and she honestly is crazy when she’s in relationships.\n\nShe used to date this guy, M, in high school. They broke up because she cheated on him with a guy she had been having a very long term affair with. \n\nRecently C and M started talking again, but M is in a bad place. He’s couch surfing at a friend’s house, he just got out of a relationship a few months ago in which he was cheated on and his girlfriend got pregnant. \n\nC wants a relationship, but M isn’t ready which is pretty understandable. They hung out every day/night over the last month up until this past weekend, when M was hanging out with his friends. \n\nFriday night she texted me freaking out because M would rather go to a party with his friends than hang out with her. I was sick with the flu, but she demanded that I come with her to show up at a party we aren’t invited to so that she could be petty and make him “know that she’s angry.” I refused, and she got pissed at me for it. She went alone.\n\nSaturday, M was working on his truck. C blew up his and my phone all day, because he wasn’t texting her as much as she felt that he should be. Once again, she went out driving past all of the possible places he could be at until she happened to pass him on the road—at which time she whipped a u-turn and followed him. They ended up hanging out that night because she just got into his vehicle without asking and refused to leave.\n\nSunday, he had plans to hang out with his friends again—but C swore he made plans with her. He refused to leave to come hang out with her, so once again she went looking for him. She found his vehicle which he stupidly left the keys inside of and MOVED IT. \n\nMonday comes and she’s trying to get me to message him and “make him feel bad for treating her so horribly.” I refused. She got pissed again. She sent me screenshots of her demanding that he come to her house and talk to her, in which he responded he wasn’t sure he wanted to talk to her anymore after all of this. She called him a fucking dipshit and demanded that he go to her house to talk to her.\n\nI’m sick of hearing her cry about the fact that she can never just find a good guy and have a happy relationship, and having to bite my tongue to keep from saying that she’s the reason it never works out. \n\nWIBTA if I finally told her that the reason her relationships never work out is because she’s horrible to all the guys who give her a chance? Obviously I wouldn’t just rip her ass and call her names, but try and put it constructively.\n\nTL;DR: my friend is abusive in her relationships, but always makes herself the victim and can’t figure out why no one ever wants to be in a LTR with her.",

      "description": "So for Christmas, my brother got me a Nintendo Switch and Smash Ultimate, which I had been so excited to play! Since the switch was completely mine, unlike the wii that my brother and I shared, I was really excited to play through the game by myself. When we played brawl, I was too young and bad at the game to play the story mode myself, but now, over a decade later, I was really excited to unlock every character myself, whether it be via normal vs modes or the story mode, World of Light.\n\nFlash forward to this weekend. Yesterday, we were playing smash with friends, and everytime a new character showed up, I emphasized that I'm always the one to unlock new characters. I made this very clear. Today, we were hanging out with friends, with them playing risk and I was playing smash on my switch. I left for 30 minutes or so to help out a friend in anothet building. I came back when they were done woth Risk, and he told me that he had broken one of my rules, and showed me my switch, which had the screen that said that a character (incineroar) was unlocked. And also, in doing so, he unlocked kne of the acheivements. Naturally, I was super upset and ended up getting really pissy at him and also crying a bunch because I'm just sad about this! I'm honestly considering restarting the whole game just so that I can unlock everything!!! I keep going through these periods of getting mad at him because he KNEW that just this once, I wanted to 100% complete this one game. I know I'm not going to 100% pokemon lets go or breath of the wild, but this one time, I was ready to do something completely on my own, and he messed that up for me.\n\nTl;dr: i wanted to 100% complete this game, but my boyfriend unlocked one of the characters while I was away and ruined that for me.\n\nIs my anger justified, or AITA here?\n\n",

Vs. moving to a new area for jobs that pay a hefty amount more than what we make now, and being able to financially support his kids. \n\nWe are both more than qualified and capable of finding and fulfilling new jobs with higher pay grades. \n\nAdvice please.

      "description": "I (M, 16) am currently in some deep shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago during lunch, I was in a debate with my friends about whether purple was a color or not. Don't ask what the argument was, because I could not tell you for the life of me. I had just gotten back from buying my lunch and sat down at the table with my friends, and they attempt to catch me up on the debate. My friend who started the debate asked what I thought, so I (jokingly) said of course it's not a color. In response he (jokingly) told me to sit under the table and think about my life. This was meant to be like a \"go sit in the corner\" kind of thing. I oblige and find an (at the time) empty table. LO AND BEHOLD this was a bad idea. As soon as I sit down under the table, a group of high school girls sits down at that very table. I get out immediately, and, well, picture this. You've just sat down at an empty table with your friends, you open your lunch, having a good laugh, and then this highschool boy crawls out from under it. Pretty obviously not the best situation to be in. After a bit of panic, I get sent to the office, they try their best to understand my side of the story, understandably I get in a heap of trouble, after a week the whole situation settles down. But believe it or not, this is not what I'm asking you to judge. You can judge if you want though.\n\nNow after this incident, I start avoiding everyone who sat at that table, and I especially avoid one person at the table. I tried to learn her route through the school to avoid interaction, I made no conversation, and everything was going good. This person had a \"history\" to say the least. She was a total teacher's pet, friends with all the girls at our school, and, for some reason, believed that all boys were out to get her. Now a couple more things to note, I go to a very liberal school. Like, extremely liberal. As in a kid got bullied out of school because he came out as a Trump supporter level liberal. Now about a year later I wasn't screaming out into the void that I was going to stay away from her, but somehow through the grapevine, she figured out that I was avoiding her. What followed was her reporting me to the office for whatever reason, me getting sent to the office AGAIN for whatever reason, and me getting in trouble AGAIN because apparently avoiding someone throughout the year is not allowed.\n\nAnd that's my situation. So please, go stupid, go crazy, and tell me AITA?",

      "description": "I am currently in the hardest class of my life, MKTG 3100. It shouldn’t be this hard but my professor belongs on a different subreddit. I have never worked so hard for a C in my life (I’ve never gotten a C until now either) I was consistently making scores in the bottom % of the class and kept trying to study harder to overcome this class. While looking around during the last test I noticed all the people who usually skip class (~90% of the class) are cheating very hard. Using the internet, asking each other, taking pictures and sending them to each other, etc. I was furious because the professor has been thinking his tests weren’t hard and the grade % data confirmed that. After I finished the test I asked to speak to him. I told him what I saw and to notice the only people left in the room testing all came to class daily and I witnessed most of the class cheating. I made sure to tell him after the test was done and not mention anybody specifically so no one will be in trouble. He will be watching us test from now on to keep an eye on cheating. I enjoy doing things the correct way and it felt unfair I was studying 8+ hours per test while other students just showed up and made a grade 30 points higher than me, making my professor think his test was too easy because 90% of the class got an A. I have never snitched like this before so idk if it was the correct thing to do.",

We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel).

It was also a pretty crowded parking lot, I guess Trader Joe’s is the spot to be at 5pm on a Tuesday.\n\nI was looking for a parking spot with my friend so we could meet up with another friend to go grocery shopping with her. I saw a car pulling out so I took the spot, but it pulled out so that you couldn’t see the other side of the road. I didn’t realize that there was a guy waiting for the spot there until after I was already in. I only learned after this incident that you’re meant to pull out and give the other person the spot then. I haven’t been driving very long.\n\nOnce I was in the spot, I just stayed there really out of confusion of what to do. Once realizing there was someone there waiting before us, me and my friend laughed a bit awkwardly. I’m sure the dude got the impression we stole it on purpose. He immediately started honking and yelling at us. He was saying a lot of rude things and threatening to hurt us. He said a lot of “fuck you”s and yelled out “if you weren’t a girl, I’d fuck you up” (sometimes sexism IS beneficial!). He eventually drove away after a good minute or two of this. My friend was laughing at this and I sort of chuckled along out of awkwardness and fear. Once he was away, I was shaking and terrified to get out of the car. I waited a long while before trying, even with my friend trying to convince me it’s fine.\n\nHe didn’t come out of the car or anything, he was just yelling out of his. He never made a direct threat of violence or that he was going to follow me, but I was really worried about that. \n\nAITA?",

They ask me which form to use, which superior department to call in terms of some orders, whom to address in business-emails, how to write an email properly etc. etc. Its like they never did their job before. They seem to be super insecure and are afraid of doing mistakes and by asking me they try to share resposibility for their mistakes with me.\n\nFor the first few months I tried to help them as much as I can. I tried to find simple solutions so they can easily remember common tasks. But there seems to be almost zero progress. They still come up with two sentence emails and ask me if it would be okay to write it this way.\n\nSome weeks I feel like I am busier doing their job instead of my own.\n\nSo after almost 2 years of working together last month I simply stopped helping. When they came up with a question or a task I just told them, that they already knew how to handle the problem or at least where they would find the regulation to look it up themselves. But to this day they refuse to look things up but expect other people to just hand them the solution on a silver platter.\n\nNow two of them just got mad at me and told me I am an asshole for not helping them anymore and that they are disappointed of me.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "(English isn’t my first language so excuse and grammar mistakes)\n\nSo, a bit of backstory. I have a condition called Misophonia which translates to a ‘hatred of sound’. Basically, certain sounds that may sound normal to other people like the sound of typing on the computer, eating, and snapping your fingers trigger an extreme reaction from me. I get extremely angry or if it’s really bad I can get a panic attack. My two worst triggers are any sounds that come from the mouth like chewing, swallowing and whatever and the sound of typing on your phone and phone notifications. (My whole family knows this btw). When I know I will get triggered I wear ear plugs or headphones to cancel out the sound (like when I’m eating with people or in a classroom) but the thing with phone notifications is that they are random, which means I can’t prepare for that they are going to happen. The worst thing is that both my mom and my step dad have to sue their work phones a lot and tend to have their notifications on very loud. I get that they have to use them for work but if they just carry their phones around in their pockets on vibrations it should be ok right? \n\nThe worst thing is that they don’t really understand how Misophonia works, I can’t really help when I get angry and it doesn’t help that they get really angry at me back. All of this is pretty recent for me and I don’t know how to deal with it yet, though I am trying my very best. I’ve tried telling them what triggers me but they only pay attention to the chewing trigger and ignore everything else which in turn I feel make them worse. \n\nSo yeah, would I be the asshole?\nThanks!",

So, the thing is, since we left the house, they ask to stay there but we didn't set the terms because mainly of the rush of moving and secondly because she don't let me talk directly to them (it has been an issue forever). Well bottom line, has been three and a half months since we leave and yesterday, she came over to me saying that \"she has just collected the rent from her parents\". “OK, let me see”, and it was only one month, that when I said \"WTF, they have year and a half sharing the hose with us plus three months having it for themselves and they only pay one month at half the market value?\" she was like \"oh, youtheasshole, my poor parents (they aren’t, he had just give away a car to his sister and always brag about how much he wages and how much he has in the bank), how I can collect backwards? that's crazy\".\n\nSo, the first question is AITA for asking for the money (we're pretty thigh right now, and we pay a lot of rent)?\n\nAfter that she said, I don't want trouble (nor talk with my parents), so here's this check covering your 2 months share that I didn't collect.\n\nSecond question, AITA for accepting that money?\n\nA little bit of background about our finances is that we leverage all the expenses and each of us pays a proportional (in relation to the individual income) of the expenses, and she never forgive me any expense or payment (for example if any of us makes 2x the other income it must pay 66% of the expenses).",

It just hurts my feelings that I’m the only one in the group that wasn’t allowed to go.

      "description": "For context I'm 24M\n\nSo I've been playing team sports for a year (basketball, volleyball etc.) with some friends at social competitions and I always strive to be the best player I can be. Recently in one of the games I did quite poorly and as a result I looked quite down/sad on the court which translated to a down/depressed atmosphere. After reflecting on that night I realised that part of being a good player is to be a positive player to instil confidence in the team.\n\nSomething to note is I'm normally quite a timid/quiet guy that doesn't normally talk; will normally just give hi5's when a good play/bad play was made.\n\nSo when next week rolls around I decide to take my attitude and turn a 180 and go really over the top (to try and trick myself) I'm screaming good jobs, you're the best, you can do it etc. generally being quite loud and rowdy with encouragement and most of the team was laughing on the court wondering what drugs I was on\n\nThe game ends and I think all is well but later I heard from a friend that my team was talking about it and they were actually quite uncomfortable/felt off putting and even scared about my sudden change in demeanour and felt I was being really disingenuous about my remarks and attitudes and it all felt way too fake. (I didn't mean to be that disingenuous I just wanted to try replicate what a super positive player would do)\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I play social competition team sports with friends, usually I'm really sad on court if I'm doing bad. Week after I turn a 180 and put on a really positive attitude. Team/friends feel off-put and that I'm being really disingenuous,",

We're all over 18 and we all work while we attend school. My mother and I have two dogs from before she began a relationship with her girlfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, some days I work and have classes and I don't get home until late evening. No one takes care of the dogs while I'm at work or in my classes. I have begged and asked that they take them outside and make sure they have food and water. They say they'll do it and I come home to find that they have eliminated in their crates and they're bowls empty. To sum it up, I'm gone from 7am to 9pm on days I work (At most three days a week) and they leave the dogs in their crates the entire time. I did get into a big argument with my younger siblings and my mother's girlfriend children after I came home one day to find that someone had pushed their crates into closets because they were whining to be let out. I recently got my part time job hours reduced to focus better in my classes and be more available for my dog. Now when I have a long day ahead, I take them to a Dog daycare that I have to pay for since 'I'm just overreacting'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, my mom's girlfriend has taken partial custody of her grandchildren from her other daughter who does not live with us. The grandchildren are 2 and 4. I was asked to watch them since I was at home more often and said no. If they aren't going to watch my dogs while I'm gone, I'm not going to watch your grandchildren/nephews.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey've (my mom girlfriend's kids) tried to start having to leave while I'm there to do something and leaving the grandchildren with me thereby leaving me to watch them. I still refused and told them if they have something to do, they need to either take them with them or drop them off at a daycare, because I'm not watching them.\n\nTLDR\n\nI'm not watching your nephews when you locked my dogs in closets for 12+ hours.

      "description": "Broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years about 9 or 10 months ago. She started dating one of my friends 3 months ago. I figured if either of them gave a shit about how I felt they wouldn't do that so I told my former friend I'm done with him and didn't wanna see him again. (Keep in mind he and the rest of my friends were well aware I wanted nothing to do with my ex after the breakup.) Fast forward a few weeks and I decide I wanted to hang out with my other friends so I hit em up and asked if anyone was busy that night. The two I was closest with told me \"I have work tomorrow morning, I can't\" and \"idk I dont think so\" so I figured whatever, it's near the holidays and they're probably busy. The next day I go on Instagram and see that they were all together the previous night, with my ex and the kid I no longer want to associate with. Not only did they post pics of all of them together, they posted an old pic of us and tagged me in it as well, despite telling me we weren't going to do anything. The kid who posted it (who up to that point had been my best friend) had explained to me that it was my ex friend and gf's idea to go do something with everyone and they had mentioned it before I said anything. However, they still lied to me about getting together and then tagged me in their group pic on Instagram. After that I decided to just wait and see if anyone would ever actually hit me up to do anything since I had always been the one planning shit for us but lo and behold, I got nothing but snap streaks with blurry pics or half faced morning selfies. I decided to cut all contact with them and hang out with some of my other friends who I hadn't been as close with but still got along with. \n\nNow comes new years eve. I found out the next day that they all had plans together (big surprise) so I just did shit with family and other friends. I dont entirely remember what happened since I was way off my ass, but iirc I snap texted my old best friend \"fuck you\" and he responded but I didn't open it before he blocked me on everything and it was deleted. \n\nTL;DR - gf of 3 years and I break up, few months goes by and shes now dating one of my friends who I decided wasn't worth my time. Other friends lie to me about being unavailable, hang out with ex gf and friend, then tag me in their group pic on Instagram. I ghosted them all and am now spending more time with other friends who I wasnt as close with previously.",

I told her she has impaired vision, bad reflexes, and weak muscles to even move/react. I pointed out that she is using a cane as well. The lady then hit the hood of my car twice with her cane (didn’t leave any marks) and said that she was going to call the police. I told her to fuck off, and she went to her car just as my brother came back. I just left and told him the story as I drove.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

I was working with some coworkers on a project, when one of them who had previously left the room sneaked up behind me and attempted to make me lose balance by pushing in the back of my knees. I stumbled a bit as I was extremely startled, but once I regained my composure I asked him \"What the fuck?\" a small argument ensued (\"Dude chill out\" \"No, don't do shit like that, it's not cool\") and eventually I ended up leaving the room. We haven't spoken about it since, though we continued to work on the project amicably afterwards.\n\nMy relationship with him is friendly, but I wouldn't say we're friends. He's played other pranks before that I don't mind but I feel like doing one where he touched me, startled me and could have easily injured me was taking it too far.\n\nWhat I want to know is was I justified in my frustration or was I an asshole?",

      "description": "tl;dr My kid is sick and rather than being available to watch my other kid while we go to the doctor, my parents intend to watch my sister's kids while she puts down her horse and/or takes a recreational trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife and I have 2 kids, 1 and 3.  The three year old had a cold and croupy cough over the last week, which culminated in him losing consciousness twice.  We went to the ER, emergency stuffs checks out OK, but recommend following up with regular pediatrician.  Regular pediatrician recommends visiting with a specialist in a bigger hospital about two hours away, and while not an emergency it should be sooner rather than later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I get this news, I call my parents asking if they could babysit the one year old for two days, as the appointment may be earlier in the day (we'll get a call with the next available appointment, and we better damn well take it) requiring an overnight or 5 am departure.  Chances are it will be next week sometime.  I'd really like for both my wife and I to be in the room and paying attention to what the doctor is saying, rather than one of us out walking around with the one-year-old or having her in there distracting us\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir response is that they've already said they would babysit my sister's kids next week.  One day my sister and her husband have a pre-planned trip to a different regional big city.  Another two days (they don't know which yet), my sister will be putting down her horse.  They don't know when that will be, but assuming my sister's horse euthanasia isn't scheduled within a day and isn't the other day they're sitting, yeah they can watch my other kid.  2/5 chance.  They'll let me know when that is and they'll be available...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just really can't believe what I'm hearing, and let the conversation dwindle eventually just hanging up without saying goodbye.  They've called a few times since then, but the voicemails are only about logistics.  The horse is being put down this-and-this day, so they're unavailable then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn their defense, our family was pretty attached to pets growning up.  Also, my folks were over at our place twice last week taking care of the three year old while he was coughing so bad we didn't want to send him to daycare.  They told my sister they would watch her kids first, whatever day that was she needed them.  Also, I do have my wife's folks and her aunt as possible babysitters we haven't even asked yet (however, she also has her husband's mom and her husband's brother and sister-in-law as well).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, it's a fucking horse.  My sister can deal.  She'll need a sitter, what, for an hour?  My kid, while unlikely, might have something seriously or life-threateningly wrong.  In addition to the childcare, I could really use some emotional support right now.  I feel the relatively-rural upper-midwest pressure to be a strong head of household, but I'm really fucking scared.  What does my sister need the support for?  The horse should have been put down three years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've thought about replying to texts or calls wondering about how the three-year-old is with questions about whether or not they were done worrying about the dead horse - obviously they need to deal with that first.  That's just too passive-aggressive for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I were to call them up, tell them that I thought it was incredibly shitty they were prioritizing my sister's dying horse over my son's serious (but likely minor) medical concern, would I be the asshole?",

      "description": "My teacher today during class was listening to a conversation I was having with my friend. We were talking about Instagram and who we follow and the teacher comes up and says that following people is douchy and stalkerish. My friend and I explain we follow people to look at posts we enjoy and to see what other people are up too. He says that weird and we should only follow our friends and not “famous people” and other people’s accounts. I start to get heated and I tell the teacher that he should just let us kids do what we want to do and he should judge us about everything. I leave the argument and he then keeps on telling my friend that following people on Instagram shows that we don’t have our own life and are obsessed with other people and their lives. I don’t join but I was so infuriated that the teacher always has to say something no matter what.  So what do you guys think AITA?",

Now listen, I’m glad I can inspire the kid but I know this is just to copy me. \nI post a gym selfie, he post one.\nI post food, he post food. \nNow when we were kids David would often imitate me and sort of look up to me, but he’s also always sort of been an asshole at times. Often I would excuse it but other times he would get to under my skin.\n\nAnywho, enough of the background story:\nSo the other day David calls me up and curses me left and right, claiming I stopped some girl he liked from going out with him by pursuing her too. Now to be honest, I had no idea he had any real attention of going out with her, and I obviously knew she wasn’t going to be interested in David. So I got pissed and I hung up the phone. I decided to call his dad and tell him it’s not right that his son calls me, someone who is a good friend to him and let’s him ride my coat tails and practically copy my every move and curse me, and that his son needs to realize he can’t get the same quality of women as me and he needs to lower his standards. \nHis dad just seemed confused and said “I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry David cursed you.”\nMy other cousin says I’m wrong and it was unnecessary to call his dad, AITA?",

      "description": "My best friend has seen me through so much and I’ve been there for him as much as he allows anyone to be. Except the difference being I’ve grown and matured through my experiences and am working on bettering myself. Im not where near done or perfect but I keep trying. He on the other hands keeps making the same mistakes over and over again.  Never listening to anyone about how to make some changes to prevent the system from repeating. He refuses to make changes because it doesn’t stick. He’d rather ignore all the issues. \n\nHe’s started dating again, which is great. He wants to build a family and be in a relationship. He’s wanted this for a while now but the last dozen girls he dated have been mentally unstable or he’s fucked with their heads too much. Me and his other best friend have talked to him about his dating patterns and his behaviours but it doesn’t faze him. \n\nI’m at a point that I don’t want to talk to my best friend about his dating life anymore. I’m fed up with it.  He ignores all advice and jumps head first in with girls before they even have their first date. Then gets hurt when they don’t feel the same. Or when they ghost. Or when they turn out to be mentally unstable because they jumped in just as he did and hurt him. Or he hurts them. \n\nI’m tired of trying to talk to him and talk him down from his major depressive episodes when they don’t work out. I get wanting a relationship and a family. He’s just doing clingy and cringe worthy things that he didn’t used to do when he was younger. It’s like he’s getting more desperate and less open to any advice or common sense. He is a good guy and a great friend when he’s not so focused on thinking with his male member. \n\nSo I’ve kind of been avoiding him some, he’s starting to notice. It’s honestly because his actions dating and changes to his personality to fit each new girl. That I’ve stopped caring about the girls names or information about them because they come and go so frequently. That he changes or cancels plans made in advance to spend time with the new girls who only last 1-5 dates or at most 3 months. \n\nMy last straw was talking him down from tears there nights ago because this girl who he thought was amazing didn’t like the fact that he had dated a friend of hers. She found out after their date and he didn’t see the issue but did some super cringe worthy things to get her to stay and date him. Then I find out today he’s already moved on to a new girl who’s about to have date number three with him in a time span of last night to tonight. \n\nI know how this is going to end. I just don’t want to be involved. I want no part of this shit show and hope I’m wrong but given his track record and the behavior the both display I’m betting this ends about the same as his last one or worse. It’s shitty seeing him hurt but not making changes to stop the cycle. \n\nSo AITA for limiting my time with my best friend over his dating habits? ",

      "description": "AITA for getting pissed that my neighbors 2 doors down (we live in an unfenced townhouse complex) allow their toddler to play in my backyard while they are in theirs 2 doors down? To elaborate, I have 3 kids. Ages 2, 3 and 11. I also provide weekday care for 2 other kids. My yard has a ton of toys including ride ons, a climber and a bretty big spot to dig in. Now I don't mind if kids come to play but for some reason it drives me nuts when it happens when I'm not outside with my kids. My kids stand at the window asking why this kid who is only 1.5 is playing with their toys. This family does have toys of their own and little guy doesn't understand that ours aren't his so I try to just let it go and be ok with it but I cant get over how I feel it is disrespectful. I never allow my kids to play with others toys without permission. I'm raising my kids to respect others property and living space and if we aren't invited, we wait till we are. I just had their little guy outback playing with a toy while dad is bbqing so I offered for them to bring it to their place so little guy could stay near them. I looked out the door a few min later to see dad pushing his boy down the street with our toy. I didn't give permission to take it and run it up and down the street as fast as he could without his son getting hurt. They then returned it like he said he would and took the wagon without asking..... like seriously!?!?! Just because I have a fun yard does not mean it's for the neighborhood kids to grab what they want....\n\nI also feel that I should explain that these people have 2 other kids around 4 and 7. These kids are spoiled rotten and unsupervised all the time in the complex. 4 yr old has been running around the parking lot unsupervised for 2 yrs. They break anything I see them outside with (normally only their things or abandoned toys) and throw around the attitude like it's nothing. Their daughter is sly and always trying to make herself out to be better than my daughters. Their oldest son no longer comes around cause I've set him straight in my yard so many times for roughhousing with the little ones and I've had to send their daughter home on multiple occasions. Now I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt and try to be the nice guy so this is really eating at me... so.... AITA for getting pissed that my neighbors allow their toddler to play in my yard when I'm not outside? I don't know if I should pursue with contacting management or just sluff it off cause it's not the kids fault... ",

      "description": "Parents, I want your opinion especially - \nI have lived in apartments pretty much my whole life and I was always taught to be respectful of downstairs neighbors. Mind you my dad wasn't the best example of parenting in the world, but he always told me to stop running or stomping or jumping or playing my music too loud if he knew it would bother our neighbors. He always told me that it was the price of living in an apartment and not a house - that you had neighbors to be considerate of and that outside was the place to be loud and play loudly.\n\nMy upstairs neighbors are a family that consists of a dad, an older son, and two little girls. If there is a mom, I've never seen her. Dad is gone most of the day working so it seems like older brother is the one in charge of watching them... but honestly I have no idea because I've never spoken to them so I could be 100% wrong about their situation. Anyway, the little girls are LOUD. Like I've never had neighbors be so loud in an apartment complex. They run around all day, I can hear them screaming and jumping and stomping.\n\nI've complained to the landlords once and they were given a warning notice, basically just a polite \"please stop\". I know complaining too many times could get them in trouble and risk eviction. Part of me is like - not my problem, they should just be respectful to their neighbors... but the other part of me is like - dang it's a single dad doing his best to work and raise his kids and I don't want to be responsible for him ending up on the streets or something. \n\nI'm writing this because I am registered to start school again in a couple weeks and I just started a new job working from home. Not to mention I recently adopted a dog with anxiety, and the other day the dad yelled \"bad dog\" so loud at his own dog that it scared mine. All of this means I'll be home a lot more and needing to use this space to study and focus. It also means that I need an environment with a normal level of noise for my pup, and this is not a normal level of noise. \n\nWhen I reached out to my landlords the first time, they told me to let them know if the problem continues. Well the problem has definitely continued, so earlier today I sent out another complaint email, but I can't help but feel a little guilty. Am I being too hard on myself or AITA for not letting kids be kids? ",

A little over 10 years ago, she married a quiet guy with my sense of humor. Recently, I found out she's been cheating on him for a while from my grandma. We're a pretty religious family, so my mom doing this, not going to church, and just being mentally screwed made her the black sheep. \n\nI confronted her about it and she just told me to mind my business and that her happiness is what's best. It's clear that she isn't trying to make her marriage work and my stepdad doesn't want a divorce since he's Catholic.

A college student recently married.\n\nThe man she married is a person who came to the US on a visa to go to school, when he finished school he decided he didn't want to leave, and convinced my cousin to marry him so he could have an easier time becoming a citizen.\n\nThey did not date before this, they do not have a relationship now, and after 2 years he has made no forward effort to become a legal citizen.\n\nNow I wouldn't care if not for one detail my Dad and Aunt talked about with my brothers and I in the room.\n\nThe man my cousin married has purchased a stolen Social security number and is using it to work. So some person out there is probably have a hell of a time with the IRS right now.\n\nAm I the asshole for getting upset about this? My dad offered (apparently) to play the big bad mean uncle and report him before they got married so that my aunt wouldn't have to worry about my cousin getting charged if he was caught, and says he won't do it now because she is family.\n\nI have no such convictions, I've met this cousin maybe twice in my 20+ years of life, and what I know of her and him, and what I've experienced talking to both of them, is that they are not the nicest of people, and all I can think about is how right now, there might be some grandma, or some teenager with his first job, or some parent struggling out there because of his identity theft.\n\nThe odds of him being charged I think would be pretty high, and probably the same with my cousin (Accessory?)\n\nSo, Would I Be The Asshole for reporting the both of them?",

      "description": "So I was on the phone with my sister just a little bit ago talking about whatever and in the background I hear my niece who is \\~2 years old. She's obviously playing and exploring like kids do, but I hear my sister scold her a few times for walking on furniture and being loud in general because she's a kid and they do that, it's a part of growing up and childhood. But after a few times of scolding her it intenses a bit and she yells at her like she was disciplining her like one would a dog for getting into something they shouldn't. She puts the phone down or something and I hear her yelling at her more and spanking ensues because I guess my niece was walking on the arm of a rocking armchair with a possibility of falling off and cracking her skull. Of course I understand that it's not safe for my niece to be doing that and if she was repeating doing what she wasn't supposed to do after her mom told her not to, spanking makes sense and some firm words. But they yelling, it sounds so harsh and I worry that it'll affect my niece in the future and cause her to yell at my sister and maybe other people because she thinks it's okay and that's how you do things. \n\nWhen she got back to the phone she explained what my niece was doing and I suggested that maybe she shouldn't yell at her so much. Silence ensued and then she said \"wooooow, really?\" and then she said some other things along the line that she is her mom and then pointed out that I don't even have kids. I responded by saying I don't think I need to have kids to know that yelling can't be too good in a situation like that and maybe she could have just talked to her in a sterner voice than before. She said again that my niece is her daughter and she will raise her how she thinks, then proceeded to say that she needed to go do something.  I'm pretty frustrated at this point and I just say bye, trying to keep it cool and not seem like I'm upset at her.  \n\nI don't want this to end super bad because she's actually supposed to come visit me next month for a week and I don't want it to be super awkward. She's far away living back in my home state while I'm away for college, and it's always nice to see my family. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for suggesting to my sister that maybe she shouldn't yell at my niece too much? Am I butting into something that maybe isn't my business?",

Except he was so paranoid about her finding out about me which I found strange. We’ve been together for 4 years and throughout this time I’ve found out that he was in fact cheating on (us both I guess) and still to this day tries to send her messages telling her how much he loves and misses her. This has broken me. I can ever trust him again, and I don’t want to be with him. He has abused me emotionally and sometimes physically. We have broken up too many times to count. Despite this, I still love him and care for him deeply. I don’t want him gone from my life but I also don’t want to be in a relationship with him. Now we are at the point where I’m stronger and I’ve told him if he wants to see me, he’s going to have to work for it. He still thinks I’m his partner but to me, I never will be. I also have a crush on another guy, he seems to like me too. If anything happens between us, I don’t want to tell him about my current ‘bf’ because I figure what he doesn’t know won’t hurt. If it’s just casual dating do they really need to know? I don’t want to use this guy, but I also don’t want to put all my eggs in one basket, and I don’t want to scare people away with all this drama... WIBTA if I didn’t tell them about each other? ",

      "description": "This story is gonna sound pretty childish so let me give you guys some backstory.\n\nI have a friend, let's call him Chris. Okay so Chris and I are both sophomores in college attending our local  community college in Northern California. (go Kings!) We have been friends since 8th grade and are both in a friend group that formed our freshman year of high school with 10 other guys. As we all graduated Chris, myself, and 3 other friends stayed and went to our community college, the other 7 went to Universities elsewhere. \n\nThroughout high school we all played basketball against each other at a park near my parents house (I now rent an apartment with 2 of my other friends who stayed back) and this past Wednesday two of our friends came back a few days early for spring break and Chris, myself, my 2 roommates, and the 2 that came back early decided to play at the park for old times sake. We used to use the ball at my house during high school but all my balls were so used and lumpy that they became unusable. Chris brought his ball that despite having a lump in it but it wasn't as bad as my old ones. We are all very competitive and during our last game I got frustrated after losing a close game and slammed the ball on the ground. The lump on the ball got a little bigger (still not as bad as my old balls) and Chris got really upset and wanted me to give him money for a new ball or buy one for him. I told him I wasn't going to buy him a new ball and he got upset at me and I gave him 4 reasons why I wasn't going to. \n\n1. There was already a lump\n\n2. Back in high school and freshman year of college all of my friends, including him slammed my basketballs and messed with them and I never made them buy me a new one\n\n3. He bought it at Walmart for $14.99 in October (I was there when he bought it) \n\n4. He still owed me $10 from a separate matter\n\nHe got angry and demanded I buy him a ball or venmo him $15 for a new ball. I told him I was sorry and it dumb of me to slam the ball but that shouldn't warrant me giving him money for a ball that already had a lump and was not very nice to begin with. I offered to just call it even on the basis that he owed me anyway but when I brought up the money he completely denied owing me anything.(I got my friends to back me up that he owed me)  I thought of it as a stupid argument and went back to the apartment. He has refused to talk to me since and even though I apologized and it is only $15 I feel like he is acting selfish. I offered to call it even on the money he owed me but he didn't accept it. AITAH for not giving him money for messing his basketball up a bit or is he overreacting? I know this a completely childish and silly post but here I am posting it anyway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

No date was set but we were looking at keast 18 months to two years in the future.  She wanted a big wedding and time to save money was needed.\n\nNow here's where it gets sticky. A terminally ill relative decided to let us in on their will. There was enough reserved for me to pay for a house and leave a good bit left over. At this point I realized while I wouldn't be wealthy I did need some protection. So I asked ger to sit down and tried to lay out that I wanted a prenup specifically to protect this large inheritance that was coming my way. I wanted it to include the money and the hime I was to purchase free and clear with it (stipulation of the will was that I was to purchase a home rather than continue apartment living or I didn't get it).  I explained I would pay for taxes and home upkeep and we'd only need to split utilities. She cried a bit with a whole \"you don't trust me\" spiel followed by a \"this is OUR money not just yours\" and me being called selfish among other things, even though it was my relative and being left to me directly. After she had her say I told her that I doubted I could marry her if she couldn't sign so we should break up. \n\nMy friends are split mostly along gendered lines. Guys sided with me while the girls went with her side.\n\nWas I wrong to attempt to carve out a large inheritance to be mine alone?",

The only issue is that she has a boyfriend (normally I get this would be enough to make me the asshole but I don’t feel any guilt for this because her boyfriend has done terrible things to her that I don’t want to repeat online), I tell her that she should probably leave him because of what he’s done but she insists she loves him and that he’s changed - yesterday we had a conversation where we both admitted that we had feeling for each others and that this was just the wrong time to meet. She’s decided she wants to stay with her boyfriend, so am I the asshole for not wanting to be super close with her anymore and just see her at work because it would suck to see her with him?",

      "description": "My little sister and I have been close for our entire lives, and I have tried to give her guidance and advice where I can. In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby.

      "description": "Some History:\n\n\nSo about a month ago, I was promoted to Night Shift Team Lead at a distributing company I work for. My coworker who I became good friends with while working here also interviewed for the position. He did *not* get the position, but I did. I NJ had voiced concern over there being hard feelings in a situation like this, but he assured me that wouldn't be the case. It most definitely *was* the case. He was an asshole for a solid week after the fact, but then finally realized himself and apologized for his behavior. Fast forward to the week of Thanksgiving when we were performing a warehouse wide inventory. Everyone was divided into 3 teams with a \"Point Man\" directing each team. I split \"Point Man\" duties with the current night shift manager as a part of my ongoing training, but my name wasnt explicitly announced during the dividing of teams, so my friend was under the impression that I was just another counter, and not a director. For three days, he would walk by and make snide comments, along the lines of \"boy, you're working awful hard\" and the like. Finally, about day 3 of inventory, I finally snapped and ask what his problem was, and he told me I had been goofing off instead of counting, when I told him that it was never my job to count, it was my job to delegate and direct with my night shift manager. He stated that since my name wasnt explicitly announced, that wasnt the case. So he flat out called me a liar, while also calling my work ethic into question, and that pissed me off. I chewed him out good, and told him I did exactly what my job was, that what I did at work was none of his business to begin with, and that I'm tired of his saltiness towards me since my promotion. Stated that I valued our friendship but that I'm tired of him always seeming to find reasons to hold me with contempt since my promotion and that if he wanted to destroy out friendship, then that's on him. He hasn't spoken to me in over a week.",

My initial contract stated that during my first 30 days I could be let go at any time if they felt I wasn't the right \"fit\".\n\nProbably worth mentioning that I have Asperger's, so while I picked up on the technical skills like the POS near instantly, I had a tendency to trip over my words and just be generally a bit awkward when dealing with customers. And Chick-fil-A tends to prioritize your people skills over your technical skills. But that's not the issue here.\n\nSo I'm let go, I'm a little bummed cause I have a history of struggling to get hired anywhere and a little annoyed to have to start the job-finding process over again. But whatever. I did manage to find a work study job at my school's campus ID center.\n\nMy parents come down to my college for a weekend in February, the weekend after I'd just been let go. Have a pretty good time until mom brings up that my aunt (dad's side) had apparently CALLED CORPORATE about me getting fired and went off on the owner of the Chick-fil-A I worked at. My face immediately drops and my head is in my hands. \n\nLike the rational human being I am, my plan after getting let go was to just lay low for a bit and then maybe go back as a customer in a few months, as I do genuinely love their food. But now I'm not sure I can step foot in there ever again. She has since apologized, but I'm still afraid to go back and mad for getting involved when it wasn't her place. \n\nAm I the asshole for still being mad?",

      "description": "I am the 19 year old only child of a single mother, who was very young when she got pregnant. She has never been specially interested or caring about me, and left me with my grandparents (her parents) so that they would rise me. \n\nMy father never really cared about me. However, he must pay child support (because of a law), money that i directly receive and use for college expenses, etc...\n\n6 years ago, my mom met this man she loves and married him. He has always tried to be my father figure, or something like that. They both hate my biological father and, as you read in the title, my step father wants to legally make me his son, and  to change my surname to his. This implies that I would have to give away the child support monthly money deposits. \n\nWe live in the same house and i have to decide within a year if i change my surname. Personally, I couldn't care less about feelings or relationships.\n\nSo, is it selfish to prefeer having money that i otherwise wouldn't receive over an \"official\" relationship? \n",

      "description": "So we’ve known each other for around 3 years, and we only started talking because of mutual friends. She gets quite annoyed when she sees arguments around her and quite often adds fuel to the fire, cries, and then proceeds to storms off (a wee hypocritical); at the start I would go after her, comfort her etc. because I don’t want her to be feeling like shit... but now I just feel like a fucking life jacket that she uses to consolidate herself. Normally, I don’t mind people ranting to me, blowing stuff off their chest — I actually prefer that than people suffering quietly — but when we talk, it either her being ranting about bullshit to me, talking about that one fucking anime she watches, or just talking  about how she’s part Italian and that her house flooded! I feel like that’s as far as the conversation goes, as much as I’ve tried to steer it the other way. \n\nI feel bad for thinking that she’s faking being depressed or having anxiety problems, but honestly it’s really fucking tiring when I feel like there’s no value to our friendship. For example, she’s told me that she’s thought about killing herself a few years ago over friends arguing (I mean, 12 year old girls hitching at school, I not sure that’s something anyone would take their own life over), she’ll talk about how pointless relationships are and act edgy when the “popular” girls are around, saying that sarcasm is what made her have trust issues (I mean, there was a point where she said that I have earned her trust, like, oh, how privileged I am to be HER friend). One think that really ticks me off is when she saying she has problems with talking to large groups, but is still able to chat to people halfway across the class and talk very openly when doing class presentations when I goddamn fucking knows that it is something that I had/having issues with. \n\nBut yet I still remain friends with her, I consider her a friend. Why? I feel guilty about leading her on when I know I dislike being around her. It’s harsh. If she does actually have mental problems, I don’t want her to be alone. She’ll high five me, and can be funny at times. I realise that I might be being too rational and/or dense about the friendship we have, and I’m just not seeing it in the right light at the moment. I should step up and make an effort to have a better friendship but I don’t even know if I want to.\n\nIn conclusion: Am I an asshole for leading a friend on that I don’t enjoy being around? Judge me with all your might! I realise that this is a very one-sided account. Sorry.\n\nIf had read this, for replied, cheers. Sorry if there’s odd formatting. I feel like this whole post is just me bitching lmao",

      "description": "First of I made a throw away Reddit account for this post as my partner checks my social media ( not in a creepy possessive way but because some times I upload picture of my pet that I don't send to her because she likes to see how cute he is, as they call it Reddit exclusive posts)\n\nI'm M 24 they're F 21 and we have been dating 2, coming up on 3 years\n\nBasically the story is that I'm hoping that after I finish my studies I would like to go on a trip to Japan or perhaps Indochina, now I've already been to Japan about two years ago and I went on my own this time as I would be next time.\n\nThe funds wouldn't be an issue for me to drop on this new trip but because they also want to go to Japan they want to go with me instead of me going on my own. now while I have no problem with them coming with me at all in fact the company would be nice. The problem is that she can not afford to go on this trip with me so this is the main reason I want to go alone as I can always go back another time with her as I will more then likely be able to afford the  trip again in the future. ( I cant afford to buy tickets and spending money for two people however nor would she accept me to pay for her share of the trip)\n\nMy thinking is it isn't a big deal for me to do something she wants to do on my own as it an opportunity for me to have a trip that and its unfair on me to miss an opportunity to do something just because she want to do it too but doesn't have the time or money to do it.\n\nThe same thing happened when I went to Brazil last year as I was just going to go to see my family for around a month because I hadn't seen them in two years, I said that they could come with me one time but because they didn't have the cash that I was going to go on my own they then proceeded to take it as I didn't want them to come with me anymore even though I did. fast forward a few month she managed to save enough for the tickets and enough spending money for a couple of weeks so I had to cut seeing my family short to accommodate her budget  ( we spilt it in to 1 week in Rio and 1 week with my family) ( well technically with in her budget I paid for a fair few things that she doesn't know about in order for her to be able to afford it.\n\nI feel like the same thing Is happening this time as I brought up the subject of me going on my own and she started to get upset and sulk about it because she really wants to go, but as I said I don't see the point on missing out because she has to miss out. We already do go on holidays together as is usually tailored to fit around her budget. for example we went to Amsterdam a few months ago because it was a place she wanted to go ( I had already been and wasn't really interested in returning, but did anyway because it was something she wanted and was in budget for her)\n\nThe main reason I want to go back as the last time I went we had just started dating and when I suggested that I was going to extend my stay she started crying about how much she missed me and how that she really wanted me to come back and made be feel guilty about extending my trip ( was going to go from 2 weeks and add another 2 weeks to the trip) as a result I feel I missed a lot of things that I wanted to do. I brought this up and it led to a fight about how she don't have anything to do with me returning early.",

      "description": "Yes this is very odd but let me give you guys a little background on this. \n\nSo my friend, let's just call him ''Dave'' and I went on barely two dates 5 years ago. We never had sex and we barely got intimate at all, we kissed twice on the second date and after that he cut off the contact with me for basically not being in the right state of mind. I honestly didn't care much and it barely hurt since we didn't even build some kind of relationship, just starting to get to know each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a bit over 4 years later (2018), he writes back to me apologizing for what happened over 4 years ago. At first I was a bit confused cause I didn't know who it was until I took a closer look. Something worth mentioning is that a few months before this happened my 3 year relationship with my ex ended. So I was really not looking for anything new or even a flirt.   \nI of course accepted his apology and made it very clear that I wasn't interested in anything else than friendship, I had recently ended a long relationship and my attraction for the guy wasn't there anymore at all. \n\nAs I mentioned, I was very clear about it and he told me that he also just wanted to be friends.. Well fast forward a few months; we've been talking from time to time, seeing each other sometimes but only as friends. He spoke about girls he was dating, I helped him with what he should say to them etc. \n\nNew years eve comes up and he invited me to a home party with a bunch of his friends. I was scrolling through the people who were going to attend on the facebook event to see if there was anyone I knew. Saw one of his friends who happened to be his best friend and I wrote to Dave saying that his friend looked really good. He replied and told me not to hook up with him cause it would feel ''weird''. When he said that I thought it was because his friend recently broke up with his girlfriend and that maybe he wasn't ready to hook up with someone yet. Dave didn't give me a further explanation to why it would feel ''weird'' hooking up with his friend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to the party; Me and Daves best friend ended up making out a lot and he really digged me and I really digged him. He kept repeating how Dave would ''hate him'' and ''kill him''. At first I thought he was joking cause I didn't understand why Dave would be mad since I saw him making out with plenty of other girls and even kissed my best friend that I invited.   \nBy the end of the party Dave saw us making out and being really touchy, he got so mad that he took his best friend in to a room and literally gave him a real scolding for like an hour. We went home and the next day Dave sent me this huge message telling me how I was one of the most disrespectful people he'd ever met and how he didn't want anything to do with me. He had already blocked me from every social media before I even had the chance to answer.\n\nWas I the asshole in this situation for making out with his best friend because he told me before that it would feel ''weird?''

      "description": "So, there's this guy, let's call him Alex.\n\nLet's call my girlfriend Jacky\n\nLet's start with some backstory: \n\nSo I started dating Jacky 5 months ago during the summer; we were close friends before we were dating. \n\nDuring the summer we would work together at a program, it's how I got so close to her. \n\nSchool starts, and I start walking her home everyday. \n\nI noticed that Alex would always be there, he was always silent so I assumed that's what he's like but Jacky told me that he doesn't usually act that way.\n\nI found out that he has feelings for her, his friends and Jacky's friends were constantly trying to set them up.\n\nI'm in love with my girlfriend and I love holding her hands, hugging her from behind, just hugging in general.\n\nI noticed that whenever we're around him she doesn't let me show any sort of affection, this is the only dude she does that around; she's fine with showing affection around everyone else, including the father she said that would kill me if he found out we were going out together (he found out that day and said I was a nice dude when we were leaving).\n\nSo I asked her what was up, she said she doesn't want or knows how to let him down\n\nSo I dealt with it.\n\nI'm insecure around the guy, he doesn't just look better than me but has better grades than me.\n\nHe stops walking her home because I'm assuming he took the hint that we were together.\n\nSo things happen and I found out that she used to have feelings for him, she said it was when she was with her ex and knew she was going to break up with him.\n\nShe also said they slow danced to Paul Anka's 'Put your head on my shoulder' during a field day inside a classroom alone with only the teacher being there (this occurred whilst she was fighting with her ex).\n\nSo obviously I'm uncomfortable with this.\n\nShe's starting an internship type job today, she comes out at 6 and my parents won't let me walk her due to it being far and I'd get home late.\n\nThe dude's going to be there, he'll obviously take this opportunity to walk her home due to my not being there.\n\nSo as I was walking her off to take the bus to her new internship job I brought it up to her, \"Is Alex walking you home\"\n\nshe told me he wasn't. \n\nI then asked her \"Please don't let him walk you\".\n\nShe then went off saying \"So I'm supposed to walk home all alone?!?\"\n\nMind you, her best friend takes the same bus and is also working there and his stop is just a few behind hers so she'll be on the bus alone for less than 10 minutes. The bus stop is literally on top of her house too so she walks for a few seconds.\n\nI should also add on that this Alex dude takes a completely different route to get home and has in the past waited in pure heat and even during harsh rain to walk her home.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway because my cousin knows my reddit. \n\nMy cousin and I are close; she's a few years older than I and we live in the same city and have similar hobbies. \n\nMy bf (who she is also close with) and I invited her to a concert tomorrow for a band we all LOVE about four or five months ago. \n\nMy cousin is known for being non-committal with plans and is also known for not answering her phone (texts and calls) very often. \n\nThis is always something I've known but in recent months it's become more annoying. She asked me to catsit for her but did not reply to my texts asking about details until the day she needed me. She has flaked out on concerts last minute before and it is never known for sure if she is coming to a family event until she is actually there. \n\nSince she is family and we are genuinely friends, I put a lot of effort into coordinating our plans. I text her mutliple times, I call, I figure out as much as I can about a plan and relay the information to her, I make it as simple as possible so that she can just show up to the thing and not have to worry about coordinating anything. \n\nThis usually works out, maybe 60-70% of the time she shows up. I wanted to ask WIBTA if I did not do that this time? We have known about this concert for MONTHS and I texted her at 11:00am this morning asking if she bought her ticket/if she wants to do dinner together before we go and she has yet to reply and it is 6:00pm now. WIBTA if I didn't text her anymore about these plans and leave it up to her to plan with me/show up tomorrow? It's fine if she doesn't want to go, I just wish she'd tell me so I can stop wondering.  \n\nI know this kind of sounds like a validation post but she has an affinity for not realizing her mistakes. I also do not know if she really knows any better, I don't think she realizes how rude it is to just not reply. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I didn't text her/follow up anymore? ",

I try having a different conversation with her and she either says shut up or I dont care(This has happened on different occasions, but its somewhat apart of our friendship where a little mean to each other, like she calls me bitch and I call her a dick) Then ten mins pass and she says I have to listen to this playlist and I do.  After the song is over I tell her she should listen to this.  She tells me no and when I said I listened to her songs she said it was my fault for listening.  Ten mins pass and I try showing her this gif on reddit, and she says she doesn’t want to watch.  I look upset and she asks if Im mad now.  I was mad but tell her no because she had a really bad week last week, and I didn’t want to say anything I regret and I said no.  The class period ends, and we both go to different classes.  I spend the whole period thinking out what I was going to say and how I felt because the last month I felt she wasnt treating nice at all.  She ignored me last week, but talked to all the friends in our friend group and ignored all the texts I sent.  I sent 4 texts in total and gave up when she didnt reply.  Theres alot more stuff that she does but Im trying to keep it short.  I send a message saying how I felt and why I didnt say it in person.  She tells me that I should’ve said it in person and not hide behind a screen.  When ever she critizes me, she does it through text.  I replied do you to talk about it in person and says No, and that if shes such a problem i should leave her.  I tell her she is acting childish and the only said this so we could make our friendship stronger.  She gets upset and tells me to leave her alone.  She tells me if I ever make her uncomfortable or if I do something that angers her and I thought I was just doing the same thing.  Am I the asshole",

      "description": "Every Wednesday a group of friends and I go the bar for trivia night. The same two servers always work trivia night. One is a great server and the other is absolutely miserable. Regularly gives wrong drinks to wrong people, gets orders wrong, you've got to ask for a water three times before it comes etc etc. This past week, four of us sat down and ordered draft beers from the bum server. Approximately 5-7 minutes later another table walks in and they are greeted by the proficient one. Ten minutes after that, we still have no beers and the other table has drafts AND FOOD (it's burger night so they have burgers cooking already). It was the tip of the iceberg. This person ruins my experience, and for whatever reason we have gotten him as our server for weeks now. Perhaps he is here to teach me something about myself, and I wish I could keep that perspective always but I don't always succeed. This is where I come to unwind and have a good time, and he's blowing it. Would I be the asshole to request a different server? Or would I be the asshole to buy drinks at the bar and sit at our table (server section)? I've left a yelp review about the guy and told the manager to no avail.",

      "description": "Been dating my SO (25F) for five years and it has been awesome. Both her and our families have been starting to hint at marriage happening soon, especially since she is turning 26 in a year and will be kicked off her parent's health insurance. My biggest hesitation is that she isn't financially future planning. \n\nI (25M) personally am super money frugal and plan for the future way more than I probably should (maxing out 401k/HSA each year, portion of paychecks into savings, etc.). My biggest two future worries are that I will run out of money when I retire and having a SO that would potentially turn into a money drain (too many family friends have made this a scary thought for me).\n\nMy SO has been working at part-time/temporary jobs since graduating college, and none have ever had any 401k/retirement saving initiative or match. As a result, she has never opened up a 401k or even a savings account. Every time I bring it up, it is a touchy topic (she complains she doesn't make as much as me so it isn't as easy). Where it hurts me a lot is that when she does have a good amount of money laying around, she ends up treating herself to something new (new laptop, loads of new makeup, etc.).\n\nWhile I don't think she would ever be a money drain, I still worry about the future and having to be able to support two people with only my contributions. Majorly worried if I ever hit issue #1 and run out of money while retired. Seeing prices increase so quickly makes me worry too.\n\nI love her a lot but I want as stress-less of a future as I can get after retirement. Maybe I'm over thinking a lot of this.

      "description": "I'm a college student and live with four other housemates. I moved in with friends and they come from difficult backgrounds. I'm conflicted because they're actually good, ambitious, hardworking people and care about me, but I want to be around people who are, I guess in my terms, better. I'm uncomfortable with how the guys talk about women. One always complains about how he never gets dates, that people don't want to hang out often enough, that people work too much, and complains about the girls who have rejected him but he still crushes on them. I've been realistic with him on what he can do to change his situation, but he doesn't try clubs, change how he looks to be more attractive, etc. Another comments on how attractive other girls who are at least 6 years younger than him are even though he has a girlfriend. He actually hit on me before when I had a boyfriend, which I thought was trashy. The other brags about stuff like how he used to date a girl who was a D-cup.  One girl jokes about how her dad cheated on her mom and she doesn't expect her own relationship to last. That's not them as a totality, but I just don't like that these are the type of people I decided to live with and I like myself less because of it. I don't want myself to get used to this being the norm and this isn't helping the bias against guys I have from growing up seeing the men in my family cheat. I even recently found out a cousin broke up a marriage in a messed up way and I'm sick of feeling like I can't run away from this pattern. My main reason is that I just don't want to think this is what I should expect from people and I expect better. They seem to have just accepted their life and what they saw growing up, but I want to surround myself with people I can be proud of. I'm not perfect either and I don't want to sound like I'm better than them, but I'm just really disappointed right now. ",

      "description": "Few things for context before story:\n1. I am a new student at a rural Michigan school and I moved from Thousand Oaks, California\n2. This teacher is very polarizing amongst students due to style of teaching, personality, favoritism, etc.\n3. The class is AP Environmental Science (I'll avoid unnecessary science vocabulary)\n4. My teacher isn't the best with technology\n5. He's a hardass\n\nCanon:\nMy teacher gave us a project involving  survivorship at 3 different time periods (1700-1900, 1901-1950, 1951-present) and explaining what we see. The entire class went on a field trip to the local graveyard to collect data from the tombstones (birth year, death year, age, sex) and we all entered the data on to a Google sheets spreadsheet that our teacher organized. The class breaks apart into groups of 5 and nobody really knows exactly what final product he's expecting from us. This entire project was given to us via word of mouth. A few days pass, and my group collectively put together a fairly long PowerPoint presentation with multiple graphs and explanations. The amount of effort we all put into this project was higher than usual because we didn't know exactly what our teacher wanted so we wanted to overshoot a bit to be safe. Our group was first to present and he absolutely trashed our project in front of the whole class. It was very clear to the whole class he was unsatisfied with the quality that we had presented. I felt defeated at first, but then I saw what other groups had. Some had hand drawn graphs, some just printed graphs, a few had no explanations, and there was another PowerPoint besides my groups. What my teacher really wanted from this project became clear while he was picking apart projects. The thing everyone lacked was specificity and we had until tomorrow to fix it. The specifics he was asking for were impossible to find with the way the data was entered. My teacher set up the spreadsheet in a way that we couldn't tell what exact year a person was born or died. When it comes time to graph and explain, we are making assumptions based on the ages people died and the time period, not their age and year. For example: the 1901-1950 graph had a higher child mortality rate which we could be due to polio, Spanish flu, blah blah blah. What our teacher wanted was: in 1918 we saw a spike in child and infant mortality rates attributed most likely to Spanish flu. I tried to explain to my teacher that what he's asking for isn't possible in a day with a spreadsheet that doesn't work. My favorite quote from my teacher regarding the whole graphing portion of the project is, \"Why would I learn how to do something, just to teach it to you?\" \n\nSo quick recap. The project wasn't explained well when first presented (my classmates know who they are and would attest to this), my teacher doesn't know how to make the graphs for this project, what he's asking for is impossible, and we have one day to fix it... Nice\n\nI wrote a very professional, sternly toned email to my principal (thanks for proof reading mom) because talking with my teacher didn't get us anywhere. My principal pulled me aside at lunch the day after I drafted the email to thoroughly explain the situation, and thankfully she took my side. To say I was nervous going into my teacher's class after sending that email would be a gross understatement. I have seen him pick on kids, pull hair, and single people out in front of everyone so I was a little afraid some of that would happen. Instead, he told me to stay after class. The tone I got from him was the \"I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed\" tone and he said that it was a low blow to go to his boss rather than speak to him first, I attacked his career, I need to not act so impulsively, and get out of my face.\n\nDilemma:\nI feel like I narc'd him out when I could've let the project blow over without any administrative intervention at all due to its impossibility. Did I do the right thing? I don't know, the situation doesn't sit right for me",

I know how much money and heart they spend on me so it makes me feel really bad for them that they have to deal with my bs. I told them to hate me or disown me or emotionally cut ties with me but they say no, but then they blame me for tearing the family apart. I guess it is my fault. I don’t know what I want. I think it’s my fate to just die tbh. Like, natural selection to get me. I’m torn bc I don’t know if I want/can get better and it shows, so my parents are worried. They’re rightfully blaming me for being a leech. I told them I’d move out (I’m a high school senior but 18 so it works) and pay for my own food and stuff but they refused so I don’t really get it either. I don’t try to hurt them for the most part but sometimes I’m just upset. I don’t want to talk and to see other people. I kinda just wanna die because I’m honestly so done with my bullshit. I’m sorry to everyone. I don’t even know if I wanna live or die. I just had an argument with my parents over this and I really impulsively wanted to slit my neck but also I haven’t written any goodbye letters yet so I had second thoughts. Now I’m typing this. \n\nAm I the asshole to myself and my parents? Serious answers only. ",

      "description": "Background: I’m a senior at a relatively large American high school. There’s a student-run tradition at my school towards the end of the school year called Senior Assassin. Basically, everyone who wants to participate pitches in a small amount of money. Then each participant is randomly assigned another participant to “assassinate” with a Super Soaker (water gun). But school grounds are off-limits, so most participants get their assigned victim by essentially stalking them and then shooting them with the soaker as they’re leaving or entering their house. This goes on for as many days or weeks are necessary until there’s only one person hasn’t been “assassinated”. That person wins half the money originally contributed by the participants, while the other half is divided among the next few runners-up. \n\nThe problem: I purposefully chose not to participate. With my luck I’d be assigned someone I’ve never met, which would make it really difficult, and also, the whole thing just doesn’t seem all that fun to me. My best friend “Lucy”, however, decided to participate, and was assigned to get “Adam”, a boy we’ve both heard about from other people’s gossip but aren’t actually familiar with. \n\nDuring lunch today, we were going through his social media, trying to figure out where Adam lives. I wished Lucy good luck getting Adam, and she replied, “Oh, no. You’re not just going to stand back and watch from afar. You’re going to help me. Are you working Thursday?”\n\nI checked my calendar. “Nope.”\n\n“Good. We’re going to stake out in Adam’s yard together. I’m not doing this alone.”\n\nI didn’t reply, but I was a bit taken aback. I purposefully avoided signing up for this game, but I felt myself getting roped into it anyway because of someone else’s decision to sign up. \n\nI don’t really feel comfortable stalking a random stranger, even if it is for a game he willingly signed up for. At the same time, though, I value my friendship with Lucy and don’t want to let her down. \n\nWIBTA for refusing to help my friend with Senior Assassin?",

      "description": "Context. Been married for 11 years, known for 4 years before that, met in high school. This request of mine has pretty much been a thing forever.\n\nWhatever drinking glass I use I put in the same place on the window sill above our kitchen sink. I always leave my towel on the towel bar after I shower. I like to know that my things are clean and where I left them so I can use them next time I need them. \n\nShe isn't that kind of person so she views this request as an attack on her. As in: \"You will kiss me but you won't share your drink with me?\" I will share if I have water or whatever, however I ask that if we are just at home she leaves my glass where I put it and get her own glass. The towel is a similar issue, she leaves her towels on the bed, couch, floor, pretty much anywhere in the house.\n\nI am a generally possessive person, I am protective of my things, I follow the rule of a place for everything and everything in it's place. WITH MY THINGS. I am not a tyrant, I don't go around the house dictating where her or my children's things go. Live and let live.\n\nShe just told me she needs to leave the house (like to cool off, nothing crazy) because this came up again for probably the 20th time in our lives together and I still didn't change my stance.\n\nSo seriously, should I make a very major change to my personality so I don't hurt her feelings, or am I being reasonable?",

That was my Idea that he only reluctantly agreed to. \nWe both were in shape when we met and got fat together.\nNow we want to change that. Especially I have formed a very negative self-image regarding my looks. He is my first boyfriend and I generally have problems with insecurity which I'm working on, but it's stil a work in progress.\nI also had the expectation, if we got a good routine of consistently going twice or three time the week, that would be it.\nSince Tuesday my bf had hid the gym every single day.\nI had been swarmed with work, I go to college and had papers due on Wednesday and Thursday, and am currently on sickleave from my part time job for the weekend because of a very bad cold. I slept all day and used enough tissues to probably single handedly be guilty for the deforestation of half the rain forest. \nSomehow him going so often and getting so much done so fast is getting me mad.\nOn one hand because part of me feels like I'm way behind even tough this is not a competition.\nThe other part of me is mad because for himself aka his own fitness goal he is this motivated while he couldn't care less about our household. He sometimes does laundry and helps under protest if I make him.\nSo am I the asshole for beeing a bit angry? Am I just bitchy because I can't breathe for shit with this clogged nose and my throat on flames?\nThanks in advance for reading.",

I have a very very one track mind. I can’t do multiple hobbies at the same time because I put 110% effort into what I do. My friends grandmother died, so I’m ready to give her the space or whatever she needs, and I still message her regularly about daily life and stuff, but it’s obvious our hobby together will be put on hold. I have no problem with this as I respect her and her need to grieve, but I’m 110% into this hobby right now as in when I’m not working and she’s busy I’ll literally sometimes nap in order to “fast forward” time to when she is available. I have plenty of other hobbies I could be doing, but giving my all to something else such as gaming means I won’t be able to get back into the mindset to do this for a little while if I absorb all my free time when I’m not working into games with another friend. \n\nBasically, I have nothing to do now that she’s taking some time away, so would I be the asshole for throwing myself into another one of my interests knowing full well that when she’s ready to do things with me again, I’ll have moved on for the time being and will be giving my attention and time to different people? I still text her regularly about day to day stuff, but all I do is work, so I don’t usually have anything interesting to say. \n\nI don’t want her to feel like it’s her fault for not writing with me while she’s obviously grieving, because I don’t expect her to, but I also don’t want to just wait for her to finish and waste my days off work doing nothing :( ",

      "description": "Little bit of context for ya;\n\nI went on this camp with about 40 people in our troop, all about 12-15, and in each troop there is 6 patrols. Now I was the leader of one of the patrols and we had this guy in our group, (lets call him E). I had already met E and he was about 13, and I knew beforehand that he had anger issues. He wouldn't be able to communicate what he wanted, then he freak out, maybe yell, swear, scream, stuff like that. So this one time our group is off playing minigolf and E isn't doing great. He'd been kinda moody for the whole day, walking off and half-assing everything. At one point he had been trying at this one whole and he started just crazily swinging the putt at the ball before throwing it to the ground. He then swore at another guy in my group (C, you can call him), (he's like the second in comand)) and went off. Later, as we were walking back to the campsite he was being all moody saying stuff like 'the activity was so stupid' and 'so dumb and boring'. I don't know how the conversation got to this point, but it did. I was like 'well, you should listen and have respect' and he said 'I'm not gonna respect people i don't have respect for'. And I, being angry and tired, told him 'It's not about respect it's mainly about not being a dick' and then just stopped talking to him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhe got talked to be one of the adults later about how he was being rude and angry and apologised, but he wouldn't meet my eyes.\n\nI know this may not seem like such a bad thing, but I just feel like a totally screwed up as a leader, what do ya'll think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : guy i went on camp with had anger issues and threw a tantrum and swore at someone, l later told him he was acting like a dick.

      "description": "So yesterday mods banned r/watchpeopledie and r/gore, which I think was a long time coming. People keep calling it censorship, but it’s not like the mods went around hand picking opinions they didn’t like and took those out, they simply got rid of some of the darker shit on the site. I’ve always thought those subs were disgusting, and I can not imagine they bred a sense of community or brought any one together like other subs do. And it’s not like they’ve wiped it from the entire internet, if for some reason you still wanna see that type of shit, you can just go to sites like Liveleak or 4chan. I’m not trying to make Reddit SFW, but those subs, I think, were really bottom of the barrel, and the worst parts of Reddit. \n     Also, r/pewdiepiesubmissions was recently made private for the time being, because of the shooting in New Zealand. And honestly, that whole situation is fucked. What other decent options are there? I’m sure Felix would like to address this himself and I’m sure he’ll come out with that video pretty soon. It’s not his fault, and he has continually come out against stuff like this, but the media is not going to like this, and the only attention he’s going to get at the moment is negative. I think he should talk about it first rather than the sub start meming it or giving their opinions. It is his sub, and we should hear from him first. \n     I’m sure r/pdps will be made public again relatively soon, but honestly I think Reddit, if anything, is saving him from a ton of negative attention. Like when celebrities die, and millions of people start following their Instagram, I think he would have seen a rise in people subbing simply because they heard about the shooting and not to participate in the community. We should just wait for Felix to address it and for the whole thing to calm before we call the mods terrible censors.\n\nI’m currently in a disagreement with my friends about this, and they believe that the mods have no place touching those subs and are especially pissed about r/pdps. So AITA for trying to defend the mods of Reddit?",

      "description": "Ok. So, I work at a certain big box hardware chain as a plumbing/kitchen/bath associate. I've been working in this department for almost 9 months now, and preform to the best of my abilities. \n\nDuring many of my shifts, I am on the sales floor with my department manager. She oftentimes leaves me alone with a confusing/vague list of chores to do (downstocking, cleaning, moving things to vague locations, etc...), and i get lectured if the list isn't done. On top of that, she oftentimes refuses to help me when a customer has a question that I can't answer safely (some kinds of gas line and other things that OUR STORE SELLS weren't covered in training whatsoever), claiming she is busy when i can see her on Facebook on her phone while a work related page is up on the computer she is seated at. Whenever she IS on the floor actually working, she oftentimes stops me in the middle of whatever task SHE gave me to send me on a new one, even going as far as to cut me off from the middle of helping a customer, and then proceeds to be mad at me for not finishing the first job. She even gets mad at me when i go get the electric lift for stuff on the upper shelves instead of trying to balance or knock over large boxes of heavy brass fittings safely as i stand on my toes at the top of a shaky ladder/staircase.\n\nThen there's the other closing associate. She joined us about two months after I joined, and refuses to learn anything about plumbing. She picked up a few small things from training, but still sees it as her right to drag me away from MY duties and customers to answer questions that should be embedded in her skull already (locations of most common items that we get reminded of weekly, thread sizes we've used since day one). I understand wanting to get a second opinion on problems, but she refuses to learn and walks away when i try and explain somethings use after customers walk away. If I were this helpless my Super would have had me fired in a month, but this coworker gets off with no penalties and actually was offered a raise recently. \n\nAm I the asshole for trying to transfer out of this shitshow of a department? Or am i missing some key to retail outside of customers and safety coming first?",

We both struggle with anxiety and depression, though when we first started dating I was not getting help/treatment, but he was. I have gotten help and with medication and therapy, I'm at a pretty great place mentally now, I think. He still has struggles; he stopped going to his therapist a while ago, though he does still see his regular doctor for medication. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe has bad days more often than I do, and earlier this year we almost broke up because I couldn't take how often they were/how much he relied on me to fix his mood as well as some other things. We worked it out and he has been like a new person since then (in many ways). At the time, I told him that I was fatigued from being his emotional crutch for so long. He has been better than he was. Recently, he has lost most of his friends and basically only has me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have small arguments fairly often and he still has bad days. I am understanding most the time and try to help him, but today I just did not feel like dwelling/dealing with depression/self esteem issues. We hung out for a bit with him being pretty quiet/seeming down, but eventually he brought up how it upset him that I didn't ask him what he was upset about. We ended up talking about it for about an hour. I told him I thought he should go back to therapy and try to make friends again, which he seemed upset about. We were basically at a stalemate, and I suggested that he get a therapist and ask their opinion and that I would ask my therapist the next time I see her. He then he asked me if I was done talking about it and I said I didn't want to any more and he left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for suggesting he see a therapist instead of relying on me for everything? He says that he thinks it will just end with him just having to hide/suppress his depression/issues.",

I'm female, this will be important.\n\nSo I recently went overseas for work, where I met this guy while checking in to my hotel. He's local to the area and after I complimented him on his shirt, because I genuinely thought it was a nice shirt, we chatted for a bit, like where I'm from and what I'm doing there, and he said he could tell me where I could buy shirts like his. I'm all for getting some wearable souvenirs so I accepted his offer, and he said he was in a rush and asked for my phone number to send me a message on the location and name of the place. He asked for a picture before he left, and since I'm a bit of a rare sight in his neck of the woods (an African in Russia) I agreed and he left.\n\nFast forward two days later, I get a call from him saying that he'll be delivering three shirts to my hotel and asked where I was staying. I thanked him again but it really wasn't necessary, he said they'd already been made according to the estimated proportions from the photo we took. So I told him where I was staying and the shirts were delivered. \n\nSince then, he's been texting me asking if we can meet up (he first texted me this at 10pm, asking if we could meet up later, I was creeped out already so I ignored it and replied the next morning saying that I slept early), when he can see me again, when I'll bring him around my home country in Africa. On my flight home he texted me to tell me to send a photo of myself in the plane and that he'd love to see me again. I'm really creeped out and I want to block his number but AITA for wanting to cut him off after I'd accepted a gift from him? ",

A student teacher in one of my historical based classes was attempting to keep us connected and spoke of the recent current events politically, and lets just say where I live, my beliefs are a minority. They then goes on for roughly 15 minutes explaining the political situation with major bias. Like, this was basically indoctrination. I get frustrated but to keep the peace I keep my mouth shut, while most of these students who didn't care about politics are now outraged and intently listening to the slander pointed towards a single party. For the record, everything this person brought up as \"evidence\" was seriously debatable, and I was really about to go off.\n\nSo this gets to the point, would I be the asshole if I sent an anonymous alert to the school notifying them of this and seriously crippling this persons chance of receiving a job here?",

      "description": "My girlfriend owns a bar and was sick with a really bad fever the past 4 days, I stayed at hers (above the pub) because I knew she was pretty bad and could use help with running errands, getting food/water/meds, keeping her company and covering shifts etc while she recovered. \n\nI ended up catching it off her and she asked me to stay at hers so she can keep an eye on me. I was concerned that being above the pub it would be too loud but I have epilepsy and tend to be more prone to seizures when I'm ill so I thought it would be good to have her keep an eye. (The last thing I want is to choke on my own puke while I'm having a fit) so I've been there all day, she came up to see me about 3 or 4 times for less than 5 minutes each time and I understand that she's busy working but it got to the point where it was getting way too loud and I couldn't handle it anymore. \n\nShe told me to message her if I needed anything and I had been messaging her for at least 3 hours to turn down the music and when she wouldn't I asked if I could go home. An hour later of trying to get a hold of her to ask if I can go home and I ended up going down to the pub to get her. She told me to stay in bed and rest but I kept saying I wanted to go home because it was pointless me being there, she wouldn't even know if I was having a seizure because she's busy working and I want to be somewhere quiet. She got annoyed that I was being ungrateful because she was coming up to check on me even if it wasn't often or for very long because she's busy. I tried to explain that I had missed out on client work (filming) because I was taking care of her and that I just want her to spend a bit more time with me. Is it wrong for me to be pissed off at her for not doing enough? I know she's busy but there are at least 5 other bar staff she could ask to cover if need be. Part of me thinks I'm just being selfish but part of me is sick of going out of my way for her and her not reciprocating it. ",

      "description": "First time poster, so I hope I'm doing this right.\n\nHusband and I were playing miniature golf, and we were behind a family of four: a mom, a dad, and two very young children (toddler age).  Given that we are just two people, and they were four, naturally we were golfing faster.  And then also the kids were so small and still trying to figure out this game.  We found ourselves waiting quite a bit for family to finish.  I really don't care that much about waiting, but I felt bad because I had a feeling they were pressured to rush in their game.  After the 5th or 6th hole, I went up to the parents and asked this.\n\nMe:  Hi.  Can we play through, like go ahead of you?  Is that ok?\n\nThe mom seemed a bit surprised, maybe bewildered.  She looked at the dad, dad said nothing and had no expression.  The mom turned back to me and said ok.\n\nHusband and I played through and everything seemed perfectly normal.\n\nAt the end of the game, when we were returning our clubs, the mom comes up to me and starts berating me.\n\nThe Mom: I just want to let you know that what you did was really rude, and you should never do that again.  You need to wait like everyone else.  You have no manners, and you really put me in a bad position in front of my kids, you set a bad example for them--\n\nMe:  But I asked you if it was ok, and YOU SAID YES.\n\nThe Mom:  Yeah because I didn't want to be rude in front of my kids!\n\nMe: You wouldn't have been rude if you said no, you told me it was ok, so I--\n\nThe Mom: No you shouldn't have asked in the first place!  You are so rude and it's really unfair to everyone else--\n\nMe: You don't understand, this is a real thing in golf, it's when people in the front are slower and--\n\nThe Mom: IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE'RE SLOW YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT AND WAIT YOU ARE SO RUDE AND\n\nI have to hand it to this woman, she is REALLY GOOD at steamrolling because she just kept yelling at me at a consistent speed and volume that I had no space to rebut or respond.  (The only time she actually let me talk was when I said I asked if it was ok.  After that, she was an unstoppable train.  Just repeating the same lines over and over.)\n\nAt this point both of us were really loud because we were trying to talk over each other.  This whole time neither of our spouses did or said anything.  After 30 seconds of this thing, my husband finally stepped and shouted, \"OK ENOUGH, NOTHING IS GOING TO GET RESOLVED, JUST LET IT GO.\"  I stopped immediately and just walked out of the golf place with him.\n\nLater, husband said that I should not have asked the parents to play through, and also I should have consulted with him first before asking.  I disagree.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My friend comes over at least once a week, but usually closer to 5. Almost every time he comes over, he bails out of the blue without saying goodbye. Often enough, he’ll get up an leave while I’m standing right there, but sometimes he’ll wait until I go inside. Usually I’ll shoot him a text asking where he went, and he’ll usually say he’ll be back in a couple hours or so. But sometimes he won’t come back when he says he would. He also does things like say that he’ll come over at 3, and then show up 5 hours later than he says he would.\n\nWhen I call him out on it, he’ll say that he’s not my boyfriend/he gets enough shit from his ex-wife/that none of his other friends complain when he does it. Am I blowing this out of proportion? It’s getting to the point that I’m almost ready to give up on him.",

      "description": "We've definitely had the same fight more than a few times and I walk away feeling like he's being a dick but maybe he has a point and I need to be brought back to reality. \n\nI vent to my bf sometimes about my best friend. I love her, she's family, but she has a tendency to be a little self involved. It's something I find obnoxious, but honestly it isn't that major. So let's just use the fight today as an example. I have a holiday party coming up that she is going to with me, and last year she had a few too many. She wasn't alone in that, most people really should have been cut off. That said, she was wrecked and this year because of her and another person the party will be much tamer since it's a work thing. \n\nI mentioned to my bf that I was a little nervous because she kind of has a fuck it attitude about the whole thing, but then immediately after that I was like but honestly I hope she gets wasted and it's a giant shit show. This exchange happened on slack, so immediately after that he starts in. He gives me a couple of sentences in quotes to send to her as though our conversation is a post on some reddit advice sub, or as though I asked him in the first place for advice on how to handle it. I find the whole thing super condescending, and I let him know that.\n\nHe responds with well I hate that you talk shit about your friends then don't say anything to them. So I counter with cool, let's go tell your friends at work all of the things you say and he tells me those aren't friends. Those are literally the only people he hangs out with so I guess he doesn't consider anyone to be a friend? So don't give me advice on my friends. You see where this goes, we end up super shitty with each other and we both walk away with that fuck you feeling.\n\nSo I know the way to solve the problem, I'm no longer going to make any negative comments about my friends to him. My question is am I the asshole in the arguments we've already had? They always go pretty much to the tee like this one did. ",

I introduced her to everyone and everyone was pretty nice except my sister. She’s not the most pleasant person to begin with and my girlfriend sensed it. When she left my sister blurted out loud “wow she’s ugly, you can do better!” I wasn’t entirely shocked because she says dumb and rude shit all the time. But it pissed me off, she laughed a little and said she was complimenting me and that I could do better. I got angry and lost it I told her she was a mentally challenged loser and whore and that’s why her husband left her stupid ass to be a single mother, and that kid would be better off with his dad than with her, because at least then he might have a chance at being a normal human being. \n\nShe lost it and started screaming at me, calling me names and throwing shit at. I left soon after and a few days later I got a call from my dad telling me not to come over because my sister is still angry and will call the cops on me and say I hit her if I come by.

I don't doubt his love for me. \n\nAnyway, he has an ex gf which was his first love and they were dating just over 2 years when they were teenagers, so about 5 years ago. They message each other maybe once a month to catch up (I know this because he told me) and she wishes his happy birthday and stuff, at first I had never heard of ex relationships keeping in contact if they don't have children together so I thought it was strange, but I had accepted it because I thought it was innocent.\n\nBUT this changed when we both came home drunk from a party, we got into bed and I turned around to see him looking at her naked body on his phone -_-\n\nI was upset and in the morning we talked about it. He said he was on the toilet and wanted to know if he still had the photos, which is a silly excuse because why would you enlarge the photo after seeing the thumbnail? Apparently when he opened his phone is popped up because he forgot to close it on the toilet. (These photos are on Facebook messager from years ago btw)\n\nNow I feel like he isn't fully over his ex and uncomfortable when he speaks to her, he says he doesn't want to cut contact with her because she was a significant part of his life. Am I the asshole for wanting him to cut ties now?",

      "description": "I’m gonna apologize in advanced for any grammatical errors, English is my second language.\n\nThrowaway account because my friends know my main and I don’t want them to see, they’ll make the situation worse. \n\nSo, I’ve (22F) been going out with this girl (22F) for a year and a half. We both liked each other but didn’t really want to go out because we’re the only lesbians in our small town and felt like it was expected. But eventually I gave and asked her out, she said yes and we went on a date. The date went fantastic and we really hit it off. A few more dates later and I asked her to be a my girlfriend. She said no and explained it by saying “I really like you but I don’t want to force labels on our relationship so early.” And yeah, I could agree with that. I didn’t press anymore and was just happy spending time with her.\n\nBut it’s gotten to the point where I want her to be my girlfriend. We’ve been going out for so long! I just feel like it’s overdue. I mean, we’re basically already a couple just without the title; nothing would even change besides me being able to introduce her as my girlfriend. (We’ve met each other’s parents, I went to her house for Thanksgiving, she spent Christmas with my family and I, she happily learns about my culture and language, we even live in the same apartment as of a month ago). \n\nUntil a week ago, I never brought up us becoming girlfriends, I just thought she’ll bring it up even she was ready. But, then my cousin told me the reason she probably didn’t want to label our relationship because she is cheating or doesn’t really like me. And that thought scared me so I gave in and asked her about it. It caused an argument. She called me an asshole for “wanting to force labels onto us” and that “we can enjoy our time together without the need for a label.” I asked her why she didn’t want to be my girlfriend and she didn’t answer just keep insisting that we don’t need them. \n\nI feel terrible about everything because I love this girl and want to spend my time with her, I never wanted to upset her. Should I just drop it and be happy that we’re going out? Should I be worried like my cousin said? (I would ask my friends and family for advice but I fear they’d make it worse by harassing her about it or something). So Reddit, am I the asshole like she says?",

During the most recent visit she saw that I had recently searched up a few girls (both that i know and don’t know) on instagram and asked me about it.  I told her honestly, I looked them up because I thought they were attractive and enjoy looking at hot girls but nothing else. (I’ve never cheated, intended to, or even ever wanted to cheat)\n\nShe was very upset and I understand why she’d be uncomfortable with it so I told her I’d stop because I’d rather not make her feel that way. She started making me feel guilty about it saying it’s disgusting and that I should never have done it. I told her that we have different views because I think it’s totally fine as long as it doesn’t mean anything and if she wanted to look up hot guys, as long as she never acted on it, I’d be completely fine with it. She’s also upset that I only stopped because she was mad about it and I didn’t think it was a problem until she brought it up.\n\nShe says it’s okay to think people are hot but not okay to actively and repeatedly look them up because i wanted to see their hot pictures.\n",

I've never liked having my photo taken by other people (or myself most times), and have only recently started participating in group photos, despite still hating the outcome. Typically seeing photos of myself just makes me miserable, whether they're taken by me, or by someone else (but especially someone else). I'm not talking just \"oh boo, how unflattering,\" but like, sometimes crying about it, thinking almost compulsively about it, etc. I've also had instances in the past where friends have posted bad photos of me purposely, as jokes, and often refusing to remove them because \"they're funny,\" even if I nearly plead with them to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom is very praise-y about my appearance all the time, complimenting me on that more than anything else. She often asks to take a photo of me, which I usually deny. She uses the arguments that it's \"just for her,\" \"I'm your mother, I'm allowed to take photos of you if I want to,\" and uses guilt to try to persuade me like \"if you/I die, you'll regret not letting me take these photos,\" \"if something ever happened to you, I'd have NO photos of you. You're okay with that?\" ~~(btw she does have photos of me just i guess not as many as she'd like?)~~ etc., etc., etc. I try to tell her that I'm uncomfortable with it and that it's upsetting for me, but she doesn't seem to accept that because she thinks I look nice/the photo is nice.\n\nAdditionally, in the last few years, she's gotten Twitter and has been super active on it (and some of my friends follow her), where she'll sometimes tweet about me or something related to me. She's tweeted photos of me before without asking, ones that she claimed were \"just for her,\" and she wouldn't post, which makes me distrust her now when she says it (these aren't in any way inappropriate or anything, by the way, in case this is reading weirdly. just not flattering or genuine candid photos). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it upsets and frustrates her, but I can't help feeling like this?  I know this sounds vain or childish or something, and I'm sure one day I'll get over this, but as it stands right now, I'm just not there yet. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful for her praise or anything, though, because her approval is really meaningful to me, I'm just uncomfortable in this situation and it's been going on for years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting my photo taken/posted, regardless of how someone else thinks it looks?",

      "description": "So bit of a context here, my girlfriend (18F) is the type that loves going out and going on adventures like shopping, theme parks, eating out, activities and such. Me (20M) is very much the opposite and would love to stay at home, relax and spend some cuddle time with her but always down if she wants to go somewhere or do something. The thing is, I am (or would like to identify as) the breadwinner or a very slight definition of it, meaning I go work 5-6 days a week, 30 hours average and earn the money \"we\" essentially both spend etc. Like it's not much money but it gets my bills paid weekly and just barely enough to go out with her and do stuff. She on the other hand doesn't work as she's busy caring and babysitting her older sister's baby and can't afford to do the things she loves anymore or just can't find the time to do it in general with me or her friends, basically she is stuck at home 24/7.\n\nSo last night, I basically said that our plans when she comes down on the night before my RDO is we go out have dinner and the next day just spend it at my place and just chill and watch some movies and cook together. But she got snappy and said \"we always do that, we always do what you want and never what I want\". I was tired and replied that \"we always go out and do what you want to do whenever you're down. Why can't we spend time at home on my day off and enjoy our private couple time together?\" It escalated to where she mentioned that everything she wants to do gets shut down by me and is stupid, guilt tripping me. I've never hinted or said that, only saying everytime that it costs money and \"we\" need to save if we want to travel to New Zealand this year and shouldn't be constantly going out for breakfast, lunch and dinner or going shopping etc, plus I'm tired from work. You guys get the gist of it by now. \n\nShe then goes off saying that I never want her to be happy and enjoy herself which hurts, cause I feel that way whenever she says that. I do want to make her happy but I also just want to make us both happy in the end, where we can both agree on something simple that's not financially and physically exhausting for me. Anyways, it got to a point where she says I make her feel needy, always wanting and wasteful of \"our hard earned money\". My reply to that was along the lines of we do waste money spending it on food we can make ourselves, on days where we can just find entertainment at home or do activities that don't cost ludicrous amounts and things we buy but don't necessarily need but you want because you're suddenly in the mood for it or looks pretty, plus I'm tired from work and just want to stay home and enjoy time with her. She got hurt and kept repeating that I always force my way and we stay at home, never doing what she wants and making her feel like we waste money. I tried explaining that I don't mean to always want to stay at home, but I'm exhausted after a long week and that we don't waste it but could just put aside for rainy days or our end goal for this year. Then it was just a constant loop of that until she just went to bed upset and tired. We always go out when she's down and some days I just want to stay comfy. But yeah, that's it I suppose.\n\nTL:DR - Boyfriend wants to relax and cuddle with his partner at home, save money and have a great trip for special anniversary. Girlfriend wants to explore, shop, essentially spend said money.",

      "description": "I'm 23 (Female), he's 22. We have been dating for about two years. We are both in grad school (law school/MBA, respectively) now, and met in undergrad. He had a girlfriend in high school and during early years of college. I don't know a ton about her or their relationship.  it's just he once told me that he lost contact with her and they don't talk at all.  Anyway, I have recently (I'd say past few months or so) noticed that he has been not only liking and commenting on her IG and Facebook posts (which everyone does and I don't think is that big of a deal in theory) — but the part that is more of a big deal to me is that he's also been sharing some of her Facebook posts on HIS profile. context: Many of her Facebook posts are of her singing and performing because she is in musical theatre/performing arts at the school she's at. Recently he shared one and said \"So talented, miss you!\" --which is nice but kind of weird.. why does he have to share that?  She does  auditions and stuff and is talented! But it is kind of bothersome to me when my BF posts and likes/comments on her posts but sometimes will \"not see \" my posts. I'm admitting it makes me kind of jealous-- but mostly just bothered and weirded out a little bit. I get she's talented. I see/hear her perform, act, sing in these videos, but it's just weird to me-- why does he have to SHARE them? Should I talk to him about it? Am I just overreacting?? ",

      "description": "Happily married monogamous one child and we’re both 30. We’ve been married for 3 years but my wife is completely against giving bjs. She’s always been against it but I love giving and receiving. At first I thought I could eventually get her to budge but she’s very firm on her stance. I told her sometimes in relations you might not like doing something but if your partner enjoys it you should be open to it at least occasionally. For example I’m not too enthusiastic about giving her massages  but I do it anyways and it requires a lot of energy and time and I do it at least twice a month. I tried to bargain and told her I’d be happy to receive 1 bj for every 10 times I go down on her but she’s still not into negotiations. It’s not like I want her to live down there. I’d really be happy with a three minute blow job twice a year. And I’m totally willing to have a good shower beforehand. \nJust really bummed out that by doing the right thing and staying faithful could potentially mean never again receiving a bj ever again. \nAITA for asking my wife to love me the way I’d like to be loved even though she’s not really into it.

My apartment complex gives each home one assigned parking spot, but there are open spots sprinkled throughout the assigned spots and also parking on the street. It looked like there was a pretty big party going on so there is no parking up and down the street. I thought about letting it go, but it’s our spot and the weather was nasty and I didn’t want my wife to have to walk far in that weather. I called the apartments tow company and had the car towed. I settled down to watch some tv when I see ANOTHER car pull into our spot and dash off into the party before I could situate my son and go say something....so I had their car towed too. It is the apartment complex’s policy to inform any guest that the assigned spots aren’t to be parked in. So I’m wondering if you guys think I’m the Asshole. ",

      "description": "I know that this is probably a stupid question but for context I'm a girl who's 19 and we live in Ireland. I'm a full time student living at homebut recently got a job in a bar. My mum is happy for me but has told me a few times I should look for another job that's at daytime and isn't bar work.\n\nHer reasoning is because I usually don't finish until 2am and she thinks this is too late  for a student and she gets worried about me so she stays awake even though I tell her not to. She's also worried because I have high functioning autism (ASD) and doesn't like the fact that I'm around drunk people as I'm still quite young mentally. She's also upset they've made me work boxing day and new year's eve, even though the family are meant to get together for food and drinks on new year's eve. \n\nMy reasoning for staying is that I really like absolutely everyone who works there and if I went to another job the likelihood of being friendly with everyone is slim. I also like most customers and the fact that you get tips on top of what you get paid which won't be the case anywhere else really. It's good as well because it fits in to my university schedule as I always start work at 6-8 so there's no chance it'll interfere with my class schedule. I also like daytime and like to go on walks in the morning that last for a few hours. If I worked in the daytime that couldn't happen. I only go out at night as in nightclubs like once a month and I usually get Saturdays off work anyway.  I like how easy the job is as well because it's just cleaning and stuff like that. I do volunteer work for a charity shop based on poverty and that's actually harder and more stress because it's more complicated. I like just cleaning it's easier.\n\nSo am I the the asshole because I won't quit my job even though it inconveniences and worries my mum?",

I write original short stories, I’m working on a novel, I write fan fiction to develop my plotting prowess (and for fun), and I work on a collection of poems. It takes up a lot of my spare time and it’s my favorite hobby. Maybe eventually I’d like to write for publication, but for the most part, I write for me. Until I’m ready to write for publication, I’m also intensely private about my writing.\n\nLately, my husband has been coming up behind me while I write and looking over my shoulder, saying, “Whatcha working on?” I quickly close my document and just tell him that I’m writing. He’s hurt that I won’t share any of my works-in-progress, and feels like it means I don’t trust him. Which he’s not totally wrong—I think he’d make light fun of me for the fan fiction in particular, but it’s mostly that it’s something that’s just mine, for now. I promised him that I’d let him read something when I’m ready, but also admitted that it could be a few years from now, if ever.\n\nWhile he’d never use the word “asshole,” he definitely thinks ITA for hiding/not sharing such a big part of my life with him. I think to him, I spend hours working on something and it’s clearly important to me, but I withhold it from him, my life partner. I get that, but I also think it’s okay for me to have something that’s just mine. But maybe it’s too extreme?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I live together, but we don't get to spend much time together. During the week days, he gets home late and tired and only wants to unwind by watching videos, eating and sleeping early. I understand that, but I don't count eating together as quality time spent. His job is unpredictable and he has to work about half of the weekends, spending nights in another town.   \n\n\nHe has friends in a town a few hours away that he likes to visit once a month. He stays the entire weekend with them and I can't come along also because we have two dogs and I have to take care of them, and his friends don't have space for our two dogs. We've often invited them to visit us but the ratio of him visiting them vs them visiting us is about 10:1.   \n\n\nSo there's only about one weekend per month for us to spend quality time, but there's also one silver lining on the horizon: a four week vacation to Asia when his job is off-season this fall.   \n\n\n  \nNow last weekend he spent at his friends', and one apparently proposed for him to take a two week vacation with him very soon. They did that last year already. I hate the idea of not seeing him during those two weeks already, but because he's using up all his vacation days for the four week vacation with me, he can only take the two week vacation if he works overtime enough to make up for it. It would amount to 80 hours overtime.   \n\n\nI have only told him that he needs to remember that it's 80 hours less for us on top of the two weeks, but apart from that I haven't told him how much I hate the idea. Whenever we spend time together, it's obvious how much we're made for each other, we're always having the best time, laughing, doing our hobbies together. We barely argue and we often joke about how we don't even need to talk anymore because we can read each others minds (we still can't stop talking non-stop). Despite this, this entire year I've been having day-dreams about breaking up with him and finding someone just like him but with more time... These are intrusive thoughts that I can't control, I would never really want to break up with him but it's hurting me so much to see him so little.  \n\n\nHe cries often whenever we're apart for more than like 4 days, he needs me too. He told me he was miserable on the two week vacation last year because he was without me. He's also on the spectrum (but highly functional). He probably has a new job next year, but I expect the situation to only improve a little.  \n\n\nDo you think I would be the asshole if I tried to discourage him from taking the vacation? I feel like he'd say yes to any plans his friends would make... But I also don't want to be controlling in any way, or demanding...  \n\n\n(I'm still studying and also have a very flexible part time job, but I study/work during times when we're not together anyway so it's not relevant. We also have separate finances, he works for himself, not for us.)",

      "description": "I have a friend who claims he has bipolar depression, ever since then I said I'll do my best to help, which I did. It increasingly got worse to the point where he tried to end his life twice, one he sent me obvious messages and I found him in the aftermath. Which made my depression and anxiety 10x worse than it's ever been and I haven't recovered. Hes had multiple options to get help, which he doesn't do. And is constantly self destructive and blames other people for it.\n\nBut then he started asking for favors that ranged from small to big/expensive. Some nights I'd spend trying to sleep and he'd ask for a favor really late at night, and I would agree everytime, because I began to feel like if I ever rejected helping him, he'd be closer to killing himself, I started thinking like this ever since I found him after the first time he attempted to. Sometimes I'd be hanging out with my girlfriend and he'd send me messages saying he wanted to go for a ride or needed a favor, and it caused serious problems with my girlfriend and caused big fights because I began to dedicate my time to help him a lot more than seeing her and she began to feel alone because of her anxiety, she supported me helping him at first, but she said shes starting to believe he's using me. I couldnt accept it at first, but I started to. These favors were only the tip of the iceberg, theres a lot more serious ones but that's too long to say.\n\nOne time for three days, he went on a depressive episode staying home. I tried to reach out to make sure he was okay and alive and I had a bad anxiety attack because I thought it was my fault for some reason. A week before he was giving obvious hints he didnt have money to complete his tax return fee. So I gave him money and a ride to his agent since he was almost broke. I had my girlfriend message him that his agent called and his tax return was ready, this is when I found out he blocked me. And all of a sudden his episode \"ended\" and he apologized and asked for a ride to see his agent after he read the message. That same night he made a joke about killing himself and I said, \"Cmon man Im busting my ass for you.\" He went on a rant saying how he hated when people said that to him, like they forgot what he's done for them. That hurt, a LOT. It was like everything I've done he's disregarded because he felt like he'd done enough for me, he hasn't, trust me. He spent the rest of the night saying he had it worse than me.\n\nI used to have fun and now I feel worse everytime we get done hanging out because he has started to get rude. He calls me out for random things for no reason, lies about things he claims our friends say, or just lies in general, and constantly passive agressively talks. Its taking its toll on my mental health and I now think its toxic, he needs to start doing things himself, but he doesn't really have anyone else at all, I feel obligated to stay and help, WIBTA?",

She was like she got the tickets and they were $70, and I was like OK I’ll give you the money for them. She didn’t want the money as we pay for stuff and never ask each other for money. She later texts me saying it’s ok a Sunday and since I have to get up early at 6am On Monday I didn’t have to come. That’s never been an issue. We stayed out numerous times when I had work and we both work early. \n\nI was like you’re sending mixed signals so I don’t know if I wanna go. Her next texts consisted of excuses she was making for me and how she’d love for me to come. But if if I wanted to back out she would be mad. I was just like yea I definitely don’t wanna go. \n\nShe tried calling me after and I flat out told her I don’t want to talk to her. She tried to play the victim and say why are you mad at you didnt want to go. Then she was like I was joking, I didn’t know you would get so upset and apologizing.   I was like basically you uninvited me and I see right through your bullshit. So whatever and I haven’t spoken to her since. \n\n\nFYI she’s really sweet and does a lot. We both put some effort into doing cute things for each other.  So I guess I’m I was so pissed because this is completely out of left field.   \n\n",

Due to financial reasons (I'm currently unemployed), I had to move back in with her last year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, my mother is the kind of person who won't do anything by herself, e.g. she will refuse to go to the movies to watch something she really wants to unless she has company. We have vastly different personalities, and we honestly don't have much in common besides \"being family\", and I really just don't feel like spending time with her. I always knew this on some level, but when I lived with her years before she had a SO to do things with and never really complained about my lack of participation, so to speak. She's currently single and her few friends are all married, so she feels \"abandoned\" a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause I'm the closest person to her right now, she has latched on to me to be not only her friend, but her best friend, and gets really passive-aggressive when I don't want to do things with her. It makes the whole living situation needlessly stressful. I'm struggling to get a good job that will finally get me out of her house for good, but in the meantime I obviously do my part around the house (I'm basically her housewife at this point).

      "description": "Sorry it's a long one, also on mobile so sorry again. I really just want opinions on if I handled this situation the right way or not. \n\nSo I used to have a friend who lived around the corner from me, we used to skate and hang out all the time almost daily. She moved away about 5 years ago \n\nA few weeks ago  she messaged me out of the blue asking to call me. She basically told me that she had been in a really abusive relationship, was in a coma for a bit and all her friends were on drugs and she didn't want anything to do with them and asked if we could hang out. Myself having no friends said of course and went to hang out with her as I thought it would be good to have a friend and be a friend to her in her time of need. \n\n Turns out she's massively suicidal and depressed, which is totally fine with me been there done that I just want to help any way I can. As time passed she didn't feel safe at her house so I offered for her to stay at mine for a few days. She was there for 4 days but what I discovered is that she's a liar and very manipulative. She told me she threw up in the bushes out front while having a smoke (there was no throw up) she said she was in a coma for 6months, then it was a year then it was a year and half. I checked her Facebook and she had been posting throughout the whole time she was \"in a coma\". I dropped her home after 4 days as my partner was getting a bit fed up and as I dropped her off she said \"I don't know if I'm gonna make it tonight bro\" that was not the first time she had said that since regaining connection with me. She has also said things like \"this might be your last chance to talk to me/see me, I'm going away, ive been planning this for days tonight is my last night etc\" when I have said I might not be able to see her which makes me feel bad so I change plans and things so I can be there.  I've been there for her every call so that she's ok even if it meant it put strain on my relationship. \n\nAnyway she turned around one day and started saying that I thought it was a joke and I didn't care blah blah which is totally not true after everything I've done for her especially since we've had almost no contact for 5 years except one exchange on Facebook about a year ago. Then a few days later she tells me she's in hospital and to leave her the fuck alone and that she didn't know if she wanted to talk anymore, so what do I do? I left her alone just like she asked because I was not about to be sworn at like that and try keep messaging her. She got mad that I hadn't messaged her a week later. \n\nIt gets better guys, yesterday she messaged me saying her dad (who she said she doesn't talk to) is trying to call me. Hm I have no missed calls, she doesn't have my number and if it was on Facebook it would have come through.  I told her I had no missed calls and she said \"well I was sitting right next to him. I'm in a hospital bed. He tried calling. Anyways hes just trying to get you to call me so can you call\" at the time I couldn't as I was having Christmas dinner with my family so I said I can't right now. She got kinda mad being like \"my dad said he will go to your house if  he has to, you're the only person I asked to see and now I'm in hospital, there will be a time when you can this isn't a joke I'm about to be put into a medically induced coma\" at this point everytime she messages me I have a panic attack because I feel like she's gonna manipulate me and lie and attack me so Im freaking out while having this conversation with her. I asked why she was being put into the coma and why I was the only one who could help and she said \"how many times do I have to say it, call me\" at this point I was fed up. \n\nI sent her a long message that basically said how many times do I have to say I can't call? I'm having panic attacks everytime you message me because I feel bad I can't help you or be there and you're manipulating me by saying things like I'm not gonna make it and then being completely fine the next day and all the other stuff she has done and that I didn't want to talk to her anymore and that I hope she got better and then I blocked her. \n\nAm I the asshole for doing it that way? I really just didn't want to get into an argument with her because I'm a bit of a doormat and all I want to do is help and Im very easily taken advantage of because of that. I tried my best to help her but she was so toxic I couldn't handle it. I know she was struggling and the few weeks I bent over backwards for her were based off the \"what if she's not lying, what if it is her last night and me seeing her could help\" but she was fine, she even told me she jumped in front of an ambulance, yes an ambulance not a car.  I saw her the next day, not a scratch on her. \n\nSo am I the asshole for handling it that way? I feel like I am but my partner says it's not my responsibility and I shouldn't feel bad for cutting off someone toxic. \n\nTL;DR old friend messages me after 5 years saying she is suicidal, I try my best to help her/ hang out when she needs even putting strain on my relationship and finances. She tells me I think it's a joke and I don't care and to leave her alone etc. Then says she's going to get put into a medically induced coma I need to call her asap, is sending me into panic attacks everytime she messages me so I send her a long message saying I don't want to talk anymore, explain why and then block her.

Then she said she was asking if I’m going to when she does go and I said I always do again. “I’m a good neighbor!” And we both chuckled. My dog pooped and the lady was still leaning out of her window. Feeling as though I was being watched to ensure I was going to pick it up, I felt irritation boiling under the surface. Once she was done going, I leaned over to pick it up, and to my surprise, there was a crack vial next to it. Utilizing the bag, I picked the crack vial up too and held it up so she could see. Thinking I was waving dog poop at her, she goes, “I don’t need to see it” while smiling, and I said “oh, I’m showing you the crack vial. Did you happen to catch the person that left that?” And her smile dropped and she just looked at me. I said, “Yeah, I’m sure next time you’ll lean out your window to make sure they pick it up”. \n\nAm I the asshole for feeling like she should police crackheads as thoroughly as she polices dog owners?\n",

      "description": "Hi! This conversation happened a few months ago but I am ready to bring it up to him again, but want some input first. \n\nMe and my BF are turning 35 this year, we don’t want kids. We’ve been in a relationship for 4 years but close friends for 10 (for the most part).\n\nA few months ago I brought up a vasectomy to him. The reason was bc I was having some mental health-ish type problems that I suspected were at least partly related to my birth control. \n\nHe gave me a flat out “not a fucking chance” type answer and wouldn’t even really consider it. \n\nI have been on birth control on and off for 20 years and at this point my honest very basic thought about it is that it is a pill designed to go into my brain, fuck with my hormones and make my body not do what it is supposed to do - and more things I won’t go on a tangent about here.\n\nBecause of our age, I know I will have to take it for another MINIMUM 10 years and up to 20 years. 3/4 weeks of my life for 20 years taking a pill that fucks with my brain and body. \n\nI feel that a vasectomy is a short procedure with a day or a few days of mild pain and that’s it. It doesn’t effect your brain. I have mild discomfort ummm... every month. \n\nThe kicker for me was that shortly after (like 15min) that conversation, I mentioned a copper IUD. He was legitimately immediately concerned bc he has heard about them perforating etc ppl. But the fucking with my brain and body thing doesn’t raise as many flags! Why?? Because it’s just been “how it is” for so long? \n\nCost - a vasectomy in Ontario is free. My pills are covered by his work insurance right now but up until 2 years ago and would otherwise be $13-20 per month.\n\nAnd I bring irrational or selfish? Is there something about this topic that don’t know or don’t understand? At our age is it logical/illogical to think this way?\n\nPLEASE... I am not looking for birth control advice or suggestions, thank you in advance :) \n\nJust to add, he is otherwise amazing, incredibly understanding, kind, intelligent. This type of response was actually kind of out of character for him.. and that’s kind of how I know how serious he was about his “no”! \n\nAITA or WIBTA for getting disappointed/upset/angry/pissed that he did or if he reacts in the same way - completely dismissive and won’t even consider it? WIBTA if I pushed him to at least look into it? \n\nThank you in advance:))",

      "description": "I'm going to omit as much details as I can, for legal reasons.\n\nThere is a competition going on for maths, and it is quite a distinguished competition. Each school only have 1 representative to compete for the school in regionals, and then finally nationals. \n\nI am the HOD maths, and I'm in charge of making a tests for the school qualifying rounds. Basically, the top scorer would get into the regionals. I had around 20 students apply, and there were 3 top scorers for the qualifying school round, equal marks on each. \n\nNow the competition is timed, so obviously the qualifying round is timed as well, but in the competition score goes first, time is only used in the event of a tie, so we did the same thing in the qualifying round. One of the students is easy to eliminate, because he took up way too much time compared to the other two. Now for these two, lets just call X and Y for now. Keep in mind they both scored the same mark.\n\nThe time difference between X and Y's finish is 5 seconds, however, X did make a silly mistake in one of the questions, whilst Y didn't. Had X been more careful, X would've scored more. \n\nThis obviously created problems. There were people arguing for both students, as the results were extremely close. However due to time constraints, there were no time for another rematch. We had to make a decision now. So they turned to me, as I was the one who made the test. I had the final say.\n\nHere is the thing: I absolutely hated X. X is arguably smart, and due to this, X doesn't make effort in class. There are multiple times where I caught X texting or going on social media in class, and I gave her hell for that. X has long learned to behave in class, but it still doesn't make X a good student. Never participates, goes to the toilet for half the lesson, and suspiciously interested in X's computer screen (haven't caught X yet). I don't teach Y, but I heard Y is pretty hard working.\n\nSo, because of my personal feelings, I choose Y over X. Officially, I argued that X made a silly mistake, so X is likely going to fail under pressure, but Y kept Y's cool and is better suited for competition.\n\nSince my word is final, Y was nominated for competition. Y did end up scoring 3rd place in the nationals, which is very good. However, right after my decision, some colleagues (who were advocating for X) called me biased for using my personal preferences in a professional judgement. Since this was a extremely close situation, they can't do much about it. But it led me to post here anyways.\n\nReddit, AITA? ",

      "description": "I'm a stand up comic in a humble scene. My best friend, Sidney, is also a comic. Sid is a fierce LGBTQ+ ally and devotes themselves to spreading awareness and teaching tolerance on the matter of trans rights. While they put themselves out there as nonbinary, closer friends know that Sid identifies as female and isn't ready to fully come out (despite sometimes wearing makeup or a dress onstage).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA group of us were getting drinks and talking about upcoming shows. Our mutual friend, Liam, was setting up a multi-city tour with a group of comedians and was rattling off only male names. I bring up how he should maybe include one female comedian. Liam said that if he were to put a female on the roster he would choose Sid. This ticked me off because while I recognize Sid's identity, I do not consider them representative of my gender, especially if they're the only rep in an otherwise male lineup. You only know Sid's identity if you meet with them offstage, onstage you see an androgynous person with a deep, masculine voice. People in the audience will not look at Sid and think \"wow that lady's pretty funny\", I think that unless Sid is wearing a dress they'll be lumped in with the dudes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel that I need to change my view of femininity in order to accept Sid as a solo rep. If it were an all-female show and they were included, I would be thrilled, but to call them the only woman on the show when they don't even bill themselves as a woman just didn't make sense to me. All told, Sid is still on their identity journey and I am in full support, and have grown with what I've learned from them so far. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for thinking this way?  ",

I have lots of homework.”\n\nMy brother does have a tendency to help for a little while and then go to his room, and needs to be called back to work often. I did not defend this behavior. However, my brother was not home at the time and wouldn’t be for a few hours.\n\nMy boyfriend kept saying it wasn’t fair for him to come work if my brother wasn’t going to help as well, and he kept saying I was being insensitive to his homework. \n\nAITA for getting pissed at him for making it about himself?

Last Saturday was our first family group and visitation. After it was over I stopped in the lobby and began inquiring about aftercare programs for when she’s discharged.  \n\nSuddenly a man I’ve never met comes into the lobby from a different room, approaches me and asked me to follow him.  We go into an office and this man starts interrogating me.  Asking me why I was angry.  At that moment I wasn’t, I was asking about aftercare for my wife.  Then it switched to a bizarre line of questions and accusations.  \n\nThis man tells me my wife is only with me because she has “daddy issues”, that my woman picker is broken, that I only date alcoholics and if you put me in a room with 100 women and 3 were alcoholics I would leave with one of them.  He tried digging to see if I’ve cheated on my wife, I haven’t.  Absolutely crazy.  Who the hell is this guy?  How the hell does he know who I am or anything about me?\n\nUpon leaving I was so disoriented I felt as if I had just undergone an interrogation. \n\nI called and spoke with him the next work day and asked him what the hell that was all about?  He said someone told him I was agitated, when asked he refused to tell me who it was. Said he was trying to help. He then claimed I took the statement about my wife having daddy issues out of context.  In what context would that be appropriate?  He ended the call. \n\nI cannot reach the clinical director, or even leave him a message because his voicemail is full.  I have his cell number, but he ignores my calls and texts. \n\nUpon speaking with her counselor she said she was aware I spoke with him, but he had only entered “counseling session” in my wife’s file.  No details.  When I  informed her of what happened she was shocked and agreed I should be pissed. \n\nI decided to tell my wife about it. She has never spoken with this man before and he is not her counselor. She’s only a week out of detox and is still pretty f’d up mentally.  I am extremely uncomfortable with her being there but do not want to disrupt her treatment, but how good could the treatment be if the staff are gossiping about patients and harassing family members?  What could be the motivation behind his behavior?  Is he trying to sabotage my marriage?  WTF\n\nI didn’t want her here but it’s my wife’s treatment not mine.  Not sure what to do as it’s obvious there is something very wrong with this place. \n",

      "description": "A bit of background, I only met my friend (who I will call Shannon) last year when she moved to California but in this time we have become fairly close. She gets a lot of attention from guys and she never focuses on school or anything that matters which I openly criticize her for, but she insists that she is happy with how she is living her life. Some time around November of last year, my friend (who I will call Devin) facetimes me. Devin tells me that he knows Shannon and he shows me her nudes. I was shocked, because I honestly couldn’t believe she would stoop as low as to send stuff like this to our friend. Devin tells me that they slept together and he calls her a barbie doll to which I agreed with and we laughed about it. I never even introduced them and they live far from each other so I had no idea how they knew each other. I felt betrayed but this brought Devin and I closer. I knew that he bragged to other people and showed the nudes to them as well.\n\nI avoided Shannon after this incident, and a week later she approaches me. She was crying, and telling me that someone was threatening to send her nudes to other people and she didn’t know who it was. I was still angry at her, and so I told her it’s her fault for sending it to someone in the first place and that I knew who it was, that he was a mutual friend, but I won’t say who showed me because he is my friend. She begged for me to tell her who it was so she could handle the situation but I refused. She was honestly making me feel like I was bullying her, but she overstepped boundaries and broke our trust.\n\nLater that day, I found out she went to her counselor about it and they immediately got law enforcement involved because we are minors. She mentioned that I knew who was sending the threats, thus getting me involved. \n\nShe eventually got the situation sorted out, but she refuses to be friends with me for not saying anything. I apologized to her for calling her a barbie doll and I only acted the way I did because I thought she was being irresponsible and because I didn’t want Devin to get in trouble. AITA? ",

      "description": "This is a long one...sorry. TLDR at he bottom.\n\nI have a learning disability that goes hand in hand with an anxiety disorder. I've had both these issues since first grade and have always had accommodations like small groups for taking tests and extra time. Through having this kind of support and joining an art program I've gone from having a GPA of 2.5 to 3.8 in a matter of less than two years. I'm above average in subjects such as English, reading, writing...But when it comes to math I struggle greatly so that's where my accommodations mainly focus. I often would spend double the time it took my peers to finish the same test but I was allowed to do so, and if I didn't finish I'd either spend my lunch time or study halls coming back to finish. My teacher would provide the pass and I'd come up at the designated time.\n\nUnfortunately my math class, which was on the third floor, was on the complete opposite end of the school where my next class, ceramics, was. The ceramics class was on the '0' or ground floor  and my high school was HUGE and had a lot of students, something like 5,000 or so so the traffic between classes was super bad and we had 5 minutes to get between each class after the previous one ended. \n\nI'd often be 1 problem away from finishing or just had to ask my accommodations math teacher a question when the bell would signal it was time to move classes. Both my math teacher and my accommodations math teacher agreed it would be best if I just stayed back and finished the remainder of the test if I was nearly done anyways and it would usually take about the 5 minute shift or less between classes to finish it up and be on my way with a pass in hand because I'd be about 1-3 minutes late at most for my ceramics class. \n\nAlthough this was a daily occurrence, my teacher had been notified at the beginning of the year about my disability and I'd made it a specific point to speak to her the first day of class about how far away these two classes were, as it took about at least 4 minutes on a good day without staying back for math to get there with the traffic and I'd often arrive either on the bell or a few seconds after. But regardless of this and the fact that I'd had a note written by my teacher for every instance I was late, she'd publicly shame me in front of the entire class. Anytime I'd walk in even just a minute late after the first scolding she'd stop explaining to the class and start asking me why I'm always late and interrupting her class. It was particularly bad one day where she'd really gone at me and I made it a point to keep away from her the entire class. That was the first time I'd really spoken too much about it to my mother and a friend. I'd begged my mom not to say anything because she's a momma bear type and would 100% call the school. For me, although embarrassing and nerve racking, she was such a kind older lady a lot of the time, Id just assumed maybe she thought I was purposefully making trouble for her even though I'd explained prior. (My friend ended up talking to her about it despite my wishes because after the worst instance I was really shaken up . She'd basically said \"hey my friends got this, this and that which is why they're late and they feel really bad about it\" and the teacher said that she'd just been having a bad day and had a migraine and took out out on me, although she wouldn't go on to tell me that in person or apologize for it.)\n\nSkip ahead where this is a daily occurrence of her outing me and the like but I've kind of just become accustomed to it , although I do mention it at home. I make it a point to come in outside of class time to get ahead on my work in my free  time. I guess it was to show her that I was serious about the class...because I really did actually enjoy it. \n\nOne of those times she receives a phone class in the middle of teaching whilst i'm sitting in the back working. After a few minutes she hangs up and starts crying in front of everyone, this goes on for a few minutes before she walks over to me while everyone is looking and says \"does your original teacher know you're here, are you sure??\" asking all of these questions while crying, despite the fact that I'd tell her a day in advance if I was coming and would bring a pass from my study hall teacher. It turns out my mom had called, being fed up with her outing me in front of my peers despite my asking her not to. I'd felt really bad about the whole situation and still think about it sometimes...\n\n**TLDR: I was late at least 2 times a week to my ceramics class because of my disability accommodations and my teacher outed me in front of my peers multiple times, even meaner when she herself was having a bad day until my mom called the school and she cried in front of her entire class.**",

I always hung out with her after the class coz we were always going to the same metro station. Whilst we were chilling at the apartment of one of another girl from the group, one thing lead to another and Gina said that she is depressed and that in the past she was anorectic.

At that point I also knew that she is allergic to gluten and dairy products.\n\nRight now I don't have any other classes with her but I still see her at the university.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's the thing - I know that she is attracted to me but at the same time I'm interested in another girl (not the one from the project). Me and Gina share common interests, she's optimistic like me and she's cute. It's the emotional baggage and her allergies that make me question whether to give it a try because I don't want to try to be with her only to break up coz I'm interested in another girl and because I wouldn't have to deal with her allergies. At the same time I am not sure whether the other girl even feels something for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnglish is my second language so sorry if I wrote smth wrong but I think you get the idea.",

      "description": "Last weekend my (M26) girlfriend (F25) wanted me to visit her parent’s house with her. She had additional family members that would be present so she really wanted me to be there. I didn’t sleep much Friday so Saturday morning I had a headache. She’s slightly upset, but says its fine and she’ll go herself. When she left, I took two Aleve and laid down for 30 minutes. Earlier my two friends told me they’d be heading out to the desert to play but I told them I’d be at my girlfriend’s parents’ house and I couldn’t go. After feeling better (Aleve works quickly!), I ask in the group chat and ask if they’ve left yet. They haven’t, so I get ready and everyone shows up including their girlfriends. The four of them are on my lawn shooting the shit and I’m loading up my ATV.  My girlfriend’s best friend drives by (she just lives down the street) and waves at me. I didn’t even think about it, but 30 minutes later I get a text asking me what I’m doing right now. I reply “I’m not really sure”. Her friend definitely said something. She calls me and asks the same question. I tell her I’m feeling better and just made other plans for the day. I can tell she’s upset, so I tell her I’ll come over. I unload my shit and embarrassingly tell my friends that I can’t go. I drive to my girlfriend’s parents’ house and literally the minute I step foot on the ground, she storms out of the house and orders me to get back in the truck. She gets in and I pretty much get questioned as to why I was going out with my friends. She questions whether or not I was even sick. I inform her I was, but just took some Aleve. I don’t have a whole lot to say but I told her I don’t care for visiting her parents since they’re far right and often spew what is sometimes racist, bigoted and hateful shit. I’m Conservative (right), but not to the degree they are. Every time we visit my parents, they never bring up anything remotely political or controversial, so why the fuck should I have to listen to her parent’s spew their bullshit that I don’t care about? I only visit them because it makes her happy. She doesn’t say anything, and we go in. From the way her parents greeted and spoke to me, they knew I had avoided plans of coming. Maybe I should’ve been more transparent with her from the beginning, but she knew I’d also been waiting for a weekend that was clear weather since I just purchased my Raptor (been saving and desiring this for the last like SIX years – HUGE DEAL to me though not as important as our relationship) and I wanted to spend a day with friends messing around in the desert. We’ve always been extremely transparent in our relationship so I’m feeling shitty since I know she almost feels slight distrust in me now. She hasn’t been talkative as she normally is, and we haven’t had sex recently. :(",

It has been great to spend time with her family.  \n\n\nRecently, her father and younger brother invited her out to lunch without me. At first, she thought it was just an oversight. She told them I was available. They seemed to turn down the suggestion, saying something like \"it was just an immediate-family event.\" I wasn't interested in going out anyway, so she left, but I started thinking that this was really strange. I mean, I had never been considered differently until then. Later that evening I discussed it with my wife and she agreed it was strange. We decided she would no longer go to events where I am excluded.  \n\n\nThis past weekend, I explained the reasoning to her younger brother who seemed bothered by the experience. I said it was screwed up to make a distinction between blood relatives and other relatives. I explained repeatedly that \"one-on-one talks between you and your sister are fine, just not events limited to blood relatives.\" He kept saying that I was just stating \"an opinion.\" I told him I was not, and my wife had agreed she would not longer attend these events.  \n\n\nTonight, I find out that her younger brother is furious with me over this. Supposedly, this is controlling behavior, and I'm to blame for taking her away from normal family events.  \n\n\nAITA?",

He never said anything about any problems with the drive I gave him so I assumed all was well. I had tested it that morning and packed it well. Yesterday my friend texts me asking for his 2tb drive back because mine isnt working. I told him it has been 3 months so it wasnt my problem, then he told me it never worked when he got it. I told him he should've told me when he got it so I could swap back, because it could've just been he had it hooked up wrong or it wasnt partitioned properly. My friend comes from a messy/rough household. Not like poor or anything but the house is a little messy and him and his siblings dont really take care of their things. Due to this and it being 3 months before he told me about it I told him i wasnt going to give his back. He wasnt happy about it but he really should've told me when he got it and I gladly would've swapped back.\n\nSo am I the asshole even though it's been 2.5-3 months before he told me?",

      "description": "So, let me preface this by saying I have a great roommate. We rarely have spats, able to keep up her end of  the rent, etc and we've been roommates for two years. However, recently I had to tell her to get over an issue which was pissing her off. \n\nI regularly do the dishes. She does...not. She rarely does them. She hates doing the dishes. We have to handwash them since our apartment doesn't have a dishwasher. \n\nShe will say repeatedly that she'll do them (I don't nag her--but internally, something's yelling at her to do them) but then, usually, I end up doing them after a long day usually due to her typical x, y, and z excuses. \n\nYesterday, she gave my least favorite excuse: \"I had to walk away from them because of my pet peeve. Grease.\" \n\nIf I notice that even after she's promised repeatedly to do them and doesn't (especially when we have a surplus of them--she does a LOT of cooking), I'll do them at the end of a long day--I usually get home after a 9.5 hour shift, take an hour, go livestream some video games, then rest. Apparently, I can't feel a lot of grease around suds, which seems to be my failing. Even so, I swear to God, I tried.\n\nThe other morning, she told me she couldn't do them the night before because she was annoyed by the grease. Annoyed, I told her, point blank, she needs to get over it. \n\nAs I see it, if you don't do dishes after repeatedly saying you would, then I do them, you have no right to complain anyway. You need to suck it up or prepare to do spot cleaning from time to time if you're not going to do them, especially if I do them as a kindness after a 13 hour day--AFTER you already promised to do them. \n\nAITA for telling her to get over it?",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago, but I’m still torn about it. \n\nI had this friend, who I’ll call Peter. Peter was transgender (FTM), and his family was transphobic, so he couldn’t come out to them. \n\nThis, along with other factors such as severe social anxiety and dysphoria, lead to him becoming more depressed. He would often talk to me about his problems, which was fine, I would try to help as best as I could. Previously, when I had tried to tell his parents, he would get very upset with me, and his parents wouldn’t do much to help the situation, which is why I hadn’t tried that in a while. His depression continued to become more severe as time went on, with him telling me about how he had almost taken his life a year prior and how he was self harming. He also had a girlfriend at the time, who I’ll call Gwen.\n\nOne day, we were FaceTiming and he just said “Oh I have a crush on somebody!” I was confused, because I knew he had a girlfriend. I asked about that, and he just said, “I’m polyamorous.” Eventually, with me asking enough questions, I got him to tell me who he liked. It turned out, he liked me. I didn’t feel the same way for him, but I was nervous that if I said no, he would handle the rejection poorly, and hurt himself or do something worse. So, I said, “oh yeah I like you too!” \n\nFor roughly 2 months, I pretended to feel the same way for him. I would always say stuff like, “yknow it takes humans about 6 months to fall in love, maybe wait and see if what you’re feeling is right?” I was trying to delay more stuff from happening. \n\nThe thing that made me tell him i wasn’t actually interested was that he was planning on breaking up with Gwen because of our ‘relationship.’ I didn’t want to ruin something because of a lie. I ended up telling him the truth. \n\nAITA for even starting the relationship in the first place?",

      "description": "Tonight (Thanksgiving) I order food off Grubhub from a local pizzeria (10 minute drive). Grubhub said that it would take 45-50 minutes to deliver.\n\n​After 1.5 hours, my food hadn't arrived and I called the pizzeria to ask if my food had left. Just wanted to make sure I hadn't missed the driver or something, as my doorbell is broken and maybe he doesn't have a cell phone to call me. The guy who answered told me that the driver was on his way.\n\n​A half hour later (2 hours after ordering), I called back and a woman answered. She said that they were very busy and that the driver had left with 3 orders (no apology).\n\n​I waited another half hour (2.5 hours after ordering) and called back. By now the pizzeria is closing in 20 minutes. I call 16 times and no answer. At one point, they pick up the phone and hang up (probably because the phone was ringing continuously and doesn't go to an answering machine). Finally, they must have taken the phone off the hook, because I got busy signal until 11 p.m., when they closed.\n\n​I think that they owed me an explanation about my food. If you know that there is a late order still undelivered, you shouldn't be closing up and you should be trying your best to reassure me that my food was coming (by having the driver call me or something).\n\n​Finally, I was fed up and lost hope of my food coming. I cancelled my order through Grubhub and ordered somewhere else.\n\nAt around 3 hours after I placed the order, and after I had already cancelled the order and ordered somewhere else, the driver calls me to tell me he is outside. I told him I didn't want it because it was late and is probably cold (not to mention I had ordered elsewhere and had cancelled that order).\n\n​I'm pretty mad at this pizza place and won't be going there again. I understand that they may have been busy with the holiday, but 3 hours is ridiculous (especially since they said the driver had left after 1.5 hours). Are they the assholes or am I?\n\nTL;DR Food came 3 hours late, pizzeria ignored my calls, I cancelled/refused the order",

      "description": "My dog, a 5 lb Maltese (Baillei) is curious but mostly obedient. So sometimes I like to let her out into the front yard and watch me and my mom do.. whatever we are doing in the front yard. After an incident a couple years back (long story) , she usually stays on or around my driveway, so I don’t feel it necessary to leash her when she’s only going to be outside for a little while. A few months ago, however, someone was walking their dog (border collie, at least 10x my dog’s size) on my street while Baillei was outside with us. Baillei, being a dog, ran down the street to the guy walking his dog, barking the whole way. I take notice, and immediately run after her, being more scared of the big dog hurting Baillei, than the other way around, because even though Baillei hates other dogs, she really hasn’t ever tried to hurt them. When I get there, the guy begins shouting multiple profanities at me (I am 14) saying stuff like, “CONTROL YOUR FUCKIN’ DOG, DUMBASS”and, “ FUCKING BITCH” as if she had hurt his dog (who did not seem stressed or hurt) I pick up Baillei, say I’m sorry, and run back to my house. My mom says something like “Don’t say that stuff to my kid!” , and I run inside with my dog. After setting her down I begin to cry, because I was 14 and self conscious and sad, etc. All in all, this whole situation made me feel terrible. \n\nI know that I should have had my dog on a leash or something. I’m just wondering if any of y’all also think he over reacted or something... \n\n(Sorry for format, I’m on mobile)",

No cards, no acknowledgement. Every holiday she says she forgot my gift at home, but never ends up giving me anything. I understand financial struggles and would understand her not getting me something big, but every year she gets her child 30+ gifts for Christmas and a lot of them are expensive. My sister is a lawyer with her own law practice, gets child support from her ex husband, and has a side job and lives in a tiny apartment so her rent is pretty low. She shops at the most expensive grocery stores and chooses the most high end expensive daycare she can find. I love her kid to death; she’s a real sweetheart. Lawyers make good money around here so I’m not sure why she can’t afford gifts for not only me but our parents or anyone in our family. I don’t need something expensive but EVEN A CARD would be nice. An acknowledgement. I have decided that since the past 4 years she has not acknowledged me for holidays, I’m not getting her a gift even though I am financially able. I have talked to her about this and she has acknowledged it’s shitty, but nothing has changed. I usually get everyone nice gifts, and I am planning on getting my parents a nice gift but leaving my sister out.

      "title": "AITA for calling HR to remove an employee from my dept??",
      "description": "I made this a throwaway for controversial. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nBack in October 2018 an employee named ‘L’ became pregnant, she was about 2 months at this time. About 3 weeks later she said she couldn’t lift more than 10 lbs. After about a month of this the store director actually required her to get an HR form filled out and brought back, this was around the end of November.  Once she brought this paper in all of the problems began. She started weighing things, fryer baskets, the wedge bags and basically anything she is able to lift even with this note, she did her best to not do it. She wouldn’t use arm strength to lift a basket up, would turn oven timers off and fryer timers off essentially burning food and causing shrink. \n\nFor almost a month(December) I was scheduled the days my manger had off, but with her. I did 98% of the work day by myself. Filled sales floor, salad case, hot food items(whole birds, fried chicken, and an 8 pan wing bar). She help customers and packaged cold protein, but I still had to do more than half of that also. I basically ran the dept twice a week, all myself. I finally had enough and started looking at other stores to transfer to since my Store Manager didn’t seem to care, then he decided to tell our manager she could only work 11-5 shifts. Everyone started to have their share of annoyances with her. L would leave the dept to talk to the floral supervisor(who subsequently is the babies grandmother) and started taking 12-20 minutes to even get behind the counter in our dept. She’s been taking phone calls on the clock, eating food in the dept and basically breaking all the rules that we all abide by. There probably more that I don’t remember and I’m typing this fast on my break, but basically myself and the dept head included have had enough. We called HR Saturday morning and made an investigation to have her removed.\n\nI didn’t mention about her being on her phone or eating or any of that petty bullshit. I just simply stated company policy and the liability that she can cause. In the application it states you are required to lift more than 45-50 lbs several times an hour, be able to perform all tasks without any limitation, which includes lifting, cooking, etc. I also didn’t give out any personal information but made it clear the whole dept doesn’t run at optimal speed when she’s back here. I stated that when I have to drop the tasks I’m doing consecutively it just bogs my work flow down enormously. After calling and noticing my manager clearly upset, I’m starting to feel kind of bad. She won’t be fired because that’s discrimination, but she does know how to cashier since she did that for months before the removed her from that for “being to much drama.” \n\n\nTL;DR Pregnant employee got a doctors note for a lift limit of 10lbs so she didn’t have to work and has milked it for far too long. Requirement for the dept I work in is 45-50 minimum and being able to perform all work tasks laid out in the dept without issue.",

      "description": "Ok story time, one of my roommates and I were just chilling doing some stuff for school kinda late at night and our 3rd roommate was out for the night. I’m working on something on my computer when I here someone swipe their ID on our door and try to open the door. I look through the peep hole and see it’s a girl who doesn’t really look like a student but I couldn’t really tell with the fish eye effect of the peep hole. \n\nA little background information: the local barstool sports at my school was warning people about girls on campus asking other girls walking alone if they believed in, “the mother god,” and if they said yes the girl would ask them to come to a bible study but it’s actually a human trafficking trick. So I’m pretty paranoid already even tho I’m a guy. Plus I was very baked.\n\nAnyways, i stay quiet and just watch what she’s doing outside our room. She keeps swiping the card and trying to get into our room while talking on the phone and she’s saying, “there someone in our room, it’s 535 right?” (My room number is B35) and then outloud I say, “you have the wrong room, this is B35” and she ignores it keeps swiping. So I repeat myself cause I thought maybe she didn’t hear me, and then she says ,” Jake, Micheal why are you in my room.” No one named Jake or Micheal live in my room. So at this point it’s pretty bizarre, instead of saying more stuff to here I decide to just watch through the peep hole. She keeps swiping for like 20 minutes and talking on the phone trying to justify her trying to get in so people who walk by don’t think she is suspicious, and then our foreign exchange friend Patrick walks by with his friend and asks if she needs help(he is from China and speaks little English) he grabs the card from her and tries swiping in and it doesn’t work and he asks her if she knows me and she doesn’t respond and keeps trying to swipe in. At this point I’m getting more suspicious so I say, “ we don’t know her Patrick” twice to make sure he heard me and then he looks up at the door with a surprised face and then him and his friend leave. I got to talk to my roommate Ryan and then go back to the door and she’s gone. We start talking about what just happened and agreed that it was very suspicious. After 15 minutes of chatting I go back to the door, and see her leave from our door take a left and go out the back entrance to leave the entire dorm. SHE WAS LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION. \n\nOk so our first thought was that she was drunk or fucked up on some drugs and actually thought it was her room, but she walked normally and left the dorm altogether and instead of talking the elevator to the fifth floor where he alleged room was. I’ve seen drunk people in my college life and she didn’t seem like it. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying to help her out? Or did I do take the right precautions regarding the circumstances? ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to share our sex life with her friends?",
      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 2 months now, and we are really happy together. She hasn't been in a \"serious\" relationship before, by which I mean her previous relationships have been mostly under wraps from her family, and haven't involved much beyond sex. She leads a decently busy life (college student), so up until this point she's considered the idea of something serious to not really be within the realm of reality. I wasn't interested in fully casual, but was fond of the idea of not needing to see each other 24/7 (I also have personal interests and things that keep me busy beyond work), and we've managed to make it work for both of us and are comfortable. I've had 2 serious relationships before (one that was 3 years, another about 1 year), and I feel I've done a decent job showing her what life is like in a relationship where you care for one another beyond lust, and she's been really appreciative and also done the same for me.\n\nNow, to get to the meat and potatoes, with her prior relationships being mostly devoid of this sort of mutual care, she's openly told me that in the past, sex hasn't really carried deeper feelings beyond physical attraction, and so it has meant something different for her before us.\n\nI explain the above as I feel it, and her young age/inexperience in relationships, to be the reason for this behavior of hers  that I'm not a big fan of. She's laughed about how her friends have reacted to some stuff her and I have done together (for example, I have one of those under-the-mattress systems that strap your partner's \\[or your\\] wrists and ankles to the bed, which she's told them about), and while I laugh with her about it, I feel a bit invaded. Admittedly, when I was early in my first serious relationship, there were one or two friends who I'd tell about certain stuff I did with my SO, feeling like I had to tell *someone* about it because it was just that good. I was 17 at the time, and as time went on (likely after 4 or so months), I realized that the experience itself, and the person I'm sharing it with, are more than enough to keep me happy/satisfied, and that bragging about it doesn't tend to get you anywhere.\n\nOne of the things that bothers me about it is that I haven't met a couple of the friends she's talked to this stuff about, making me feel like they could be internally trivializing me as her *sex thing*, and not the guy who cares more about being there for her when her pet gets sick, or watching a movie while eating spaghetti.\n\nAnother instance; she was taking a Snapchat of me while I opened my Christmas gift from her, which confused me a bit, but I proceeded to unwrap the present, and saw she'd got me (us) one of those vibrating cock rings. She was laughing the whole time and honestly I just felt really uncomfortable. I asked why she filmed it and she said she wanted to send it to the 3 people who *helped pick it out with her* (one being male, but a friend of mine so i'm not concerned on that front), as well as an **ex FWB** of hers who she claims to be decent friends with now, though they don't hang out, just snap each other, basically. I should clarify, I do trust her, even though I have zero care/respect for this guy for a few reasons, so I'm not really worried about that part, but why did he have to be on the send list of this snap? I told her not to send it to him in particular, but that I guess it's fine to send to the rest.\n\nWe have a very healthy sex life, and I'm very grateful for that, but my guess is based on her past experiences, she feels obligated to share personal details about us in the bedroom that I feel only really belong in said bedroom.\n\nAnyway, do you guys think this is unreasonable? AITA? And if not, how should I go about talking to her about this without seeming controlling? Thanks in advance, didn't know where else to go about this.",

Now the school is sending flyers out that next week is \"spring class pictures!\" oh brother....They didn't do this last year. Last year it was just a one time thing. These pictures arent cheap either. You can not just purpose a few. They come in packages and the cheapest package is $40. So in December in total i spent roughly $80 for pictures of my children. And my children are at an age where they HATE smiling while taking pics. So i spent $80 on them seriously staring at a camera...I still love them though. I told someone i don't plan on wasting another $80 for more pictures and they looked at me like i have a problem. Then pointed out how my kids will probably see sitting to the side while watching other kids take pictures and feel left out, or like i dont love them enough to pay for more pics of them. Am i an asshole for not wanting to pay for MORE pictures???",

      "description": "We are about 15 years old, and it's a bit long.\n\nAbout a year ago, two of my friends and I went to my dad's company warehouse full of tech. Monitors, printers, switches, and other assorted gadgets. We tested them to see if they were sellable. What really caught our eyes were the computers. There were 3 stacks of 12 laptops. We tested each one and it's components, and ended up with 9 functioning computers cobbled from the parts of all the laptops. We decide to take one as a shared laptop between our circle of friends.\n\nFast forward a year, and the \" shared \" computer has been with 1 person the whole year, Mr. Friend (we'll call him Jack). My dad had recently moved and hired new employees, which meant he had to use all the laptops. I had to take back the laptop Jack had so that my dad could use it for his company.\n\nWhen I get it back and hand it it, Jack asks me for his money back. I had no idea what he was talking about, so I asked what money.\n\nApparently, Jack had paid for a higher bandwidth WiFi card and repaired the screen that broke after half a year. However, he put in non genuine parts. The total cost would be minor for adults in the US, about 75$, but for me it's a huge amount of money. Or I could return the laptop to him. He also mentioned that we had to sell the functioning laptops for a 60/40 split.\n\nWhen he sent that, I got a bit annoyed, and told him I can't just return the computer, its being used, that I can't get that kind of money now, and that he's not the one with the hardware, my dad is, and he's using it. Jack retorts that he practically worked 4 hours LAST YEAR for no revenue.\n\nThis man is trying to use an event that happened a year ago, to get me to give him a laptop.\n\nAfter fuming on that for half an hour, I return to my phone with this:\n\n\"You're now talking business, since revenue is a business term. So from now on, it is business. I opened up the computer and looked up the part number for both the panel and the WiFi card, and they are both non genuine. This means you have added risk. On top of that, you got a fully functional laptop for a WHOLE YEAR. There was no need for it until now, and as a result, you got to keep it for longer than you should. If we reimburse you for the repairs, then I will expect $95 for renting the laptop for a year. To add on that, forget selling the computers. You will have to talk to my dad, who is a businessman, and therefore looks for profitable deals. In what scenario does he benefit from even an 80/20 split? What are you bringing to the table? That's right, nothing. So choose.\"\n\nJack blows his top off, releasing a barrage of shade.\n\n\"You said we could sell the stuff.\"\n\"You say but you don't commit.\"\n\"You said we could have it forever.\"\n\nThese I could tolerate. However, he pulled a dirty move and tried to tell my friends that I stole from him. I had to send them proof before they could believe me again, and I dont blame them. After that, I decided to ignore him. \n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Going to be slightly vague because I don’t really know who looks at my reddit.\n\nLast week, I went out of town for 6 days. I was really busy and had a detailed itinerary that I shared with my boyfriend, so if he couldn’t get in contact with me, he would have a good idea as why he couldn’t reach me. I posted on my Instagram story quite a bit, but I tried to be conscious that I texted him when I got a chance and just made him aware of what was going on when I had the chance. Also just to like, talk to. Talk about the experiences I was having, his day, like the usual. I just didn’t want to make it seem like I was just posting on my Instagram story while knowing I had unread texts from him.\n\nThis week, he’s out of town. He has no real plan for the trip, it’s just networking with his team. I’ll text him and he won’t respond for hours. He’ll post like 3-5 times over the course of a few hours, and not even acknowledge my texts. I called him out for it and he got annoyed, but was aware that I didn’t do that to him the week before. \n\nI just think it’s inconsiderate. I didn’t do that on my trip because I didn’t want it to seem like social media is more important, or that I was ignoring his texts. Like come on, if you’re already going to go so far as to pick up your phone, open an app, and post with literally only the intention of others seeing it, how hard is it to respond to a text? Is posting your life frame by frame more important than responding to your girlfriend?\n\nMaybe I’m just being too sensitive. Feedback much appreciated. ",

I also turn off my phone a lot, so there were probably more calls than I knew about.\n\nA few weeks later, I got a call from a man, who said he was a business owner. He didn't specify what kind of business it was, or if he did, I don't remember. He told me that my new phone number used to be his business's number, and all the wrong numbers I've been getting were his customers trying to call him. \n\nHe told me that he wanted me to change my number so that he could get the number back, or at least so that the number won't go through and confuse his customers.\n\nI told him, \"I'm sorry your customers are calling me and thinking that it's you, but I'm not going to go through the trouble of changing my number just because you lost your number and I happened to get it.\" After that, I was about to walk into a noisy cafeteria to get lunch, and wouldn't be able to hear what he said so I told him that I had to go and hung up. He never called me again, and the wrong numbers slowed down significantly after a month. I still have the same number and I haven't gotten any wrong numbers from his customers in years.\n\nI thought about this again recently and have been wondering if I did the wrong thing. Am I the asshole for refusing to change my number?",

      "description": "I work for a large phone company in the United States. This happened about 20 minutes ago and I want to know if I’m the asshole. I’m gonna be OP and I’ll use C for Customer. \n\nCustomer walks into the store:\n\nOP: Hey how are you? \n\nC: Moto G6\n\nImmediately I’m like “oh” in my head, wondering if he didn’t hear me or just doesn’t want to answer me ? \n\nOP: Oh, so you’re looking to buy a Motorola G6? Absolutely I can help you with that, let me go ahead and pull up your account.\n\nHe doesn’t say a word and follows me back to my desk. I log in to my system and ask for his number and get into his account.\n\nOP: Any particular reason you’re choosing the G6?\n\nC: I don’t need my phone to be a computer, but I do use it a lot for GPS, calls, texts, and photos.\n\nOP: Oh well let me take a look at our promotions and see if there’s anything else I can offer you. \nMaybe we can get you a better phone for a comparable price. You may have to change your number though. Sound good? \n\nC: Yeah sure\n\nCurrently new line customers can get a LG G7 (normally $750) for half off. I know that it doesn’t sound like a big difference, but the G6 is worth about $250 and is definitely not a great phone. So I figured that any reasonable person might consider the extra $125 for a much better phone and the hassle of changing your number.\nHowever I understand that the hassle of changing your number isn’t ideal for everyone. \n\nOP: So I brought out these phones for you. This is the G6 and the G7. Now I have a promotion available for you on the G7, if you were to change your number I can cut the price of it in half making it $15/month instead of $30. The G6 would be roughly $10/month. \nThen I went into detail about how the G7 has a better camera and better specs than the G7. \n\nC: So I would only get the promotion if I changed my number ? \n\nOP: Yes, you’d have to change your number. \n\nC: Do me a favor and see if you can tell how long I’ve had this number.\n\nOP: I can date your SIM cards back to Nov 2012\n\nC: Well I’ve had this number since 2003, so you’re gonna have to make a case for this phone. *points at G7*\n\nOP: *literally repeats what I said two seconds ago*\n\nC: not good enough, you gotta make a better case for this phone. \n\nOP: *speechless I start to repeat myself for the third time*\n\nC: Ok, you just lost this sale. \n\nHe gets up angrily and starts walking towards the door. \n\nC: *turns around and stops at door* Do you know why you just lost this sale ? \n\nOP: If you just want to get the other-\n\nC: DO YOU KNOW why you just lost this sale? \n\nOver his bullshit, and not wanting him to leave a bad google review (which will happen anyway) I just reply “yes” and he left. \n\nI assume it’s cause I asked him to change his number ? Am I the asshole here ?\n\nTL:DR; offered a customer a significantly better phone for about $5 more a month if he changed his number (required for promotion). Instead of denying my offer and moving on, he gets up and makes a scene in front of the entire store.",

I have been friends with this girl for a few years and she is very full on but generally a lot of fun and just need reigning in a little. examples inviting herself to dinner, coming over unannounced not getting that I can't always proritise her but all I do then is pull back a bit and get some space. She cam over a few months ago and I was crying and discussing with my husband issues with regards my brother moving in as my dad had an affair and things had gotten bad at home and he didn't want to be there. I wouldn't have really discussed this with her but I was upset and shared a little. We have spoken a little about it since and everyone is trying to move forward.\n\nThis was 4 months ago things have settled into a routine and we were chatting about going out this weekend and she messages me saying I have gossip. I asked her what and she telling me she is getting it on with her uni mentor. I asked if this was the guy who is married and had a baby. She then says \"no baby isn't here yet, yo'll either be really disappointed in me or super proud\" I then explained she is risking her reputation, that she is helping him destroy some poor woman's life if he gets caught. I don't want her to get hurt and honestly it just isnt worth it. I then ask how her days going. She then tells me she isn't and that she feels judged she told him to fuck off and that's why I should be proud. Says shes upset and she's worried I hate her.\n\ni have told her I am not judging but after watching what that did to my mum I could say I agree with it either each to their own but Its what she said. My husband says i just should have said any thing. But i cant help thinking she is a dick . She says because she is single she isn't the one doing any thing wrong... but nothing has happened. I'll be honest I just didn't want to talk to her much after that and I know that's she is just back tracking as she honestly thought I would be happy that she is putting it about with a married man! \n\nTL:DR - friend tells me she is hooking up with married man, I tell her that's shitty she says I hurt her feelings. Husband says I should have said nothing ",

I feel really bad for her and am trying my best to offer her support since I work with her fairly often (at my job it's two people per shift so we are generally alone together, giving us a lot of time to talk.) I mentioned her situation to one of my roommates because I'm fairly bad at social situations and wanted some advice on how to handle it. For reference, he has never really met her and only seen her a few times when visiting me at work. He proceeded to say that it was her fault for choosing to marry a man that cheats and for having a son with health problems. When I tried to defend her, he kept going with it, saying that she brought the whole situation upon herself. He was obviously joking, considering he makes jokes like this fairly often, but I felt that it was really awful and uncalled for, considering a woman just lost her son and found out the man she had been married to for decades was unfaithful. I called him out on it but he kind of shrugged and went to his room. Lately, I've been kind of cold to him and avoiding mentioning anything remotely serious around him. I want to confront him about it but I am afraid I am in the wrong and just being rude and overdramatic about a joke or just getting too offended on someone else's behalf. He is still a really close friend but I feel like this was a horrible thing to say. AITA for being upset with him even though he was joking?",

I really like him and I get the sense he feels the same about me. We get along really well and generally have a great time together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not go out of my way to mention any exes, but it does come up, especially when we are hanging out with mutual friends who know my history and may bring it up, and I'm not going to pretend I'm an innocent virgin who has never been with another guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, we were alone at my apartment studying, and my ex came up in conversation (I can't remember how) and I decided it was as good a time as any to open up about what happened. My ex and I were together for almost 2 years, and this included an incidence of him cheating on me, him threatening suicide many times, pressuring me into sex, him attempting suicide after I tried to break up with him, accusing me of cheating nearly every day, me visiting him in a mental hospital, and his attempts to control me (clothes, instagram posts, friends, etc.). It was a textbook toxic relationship and borderline abusive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat relationship fucked me up and traumatized me, and while it was a long time ago and I have healed from it, it was still a big and formative time in my life and the kind of thing I feel like people close to me should know about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I gave my current BF the TLDR of that toxic relationship (I did not go into detail), I pretty much just told him what I wrote here. He seemed very upset, told me he didn't know what to think, and went very quiet. I said I hoped he didn't think any of less of me, knowing about that era of my life, and he said he didn't know. He told me not to talk to him about that \"kind of stuff\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not the first time we have had an incidence like this either, several weeks ago, an old friend of mine visited me for a weekend, and we had a long emotional talk about some old stuff we never really had a chance to process, including a sexual assault incident. I saw my BF later that night, and he could see I was upset, asked what was wrong, and so I told him I was upset because I was thinking about this sexual assault I had experienced. He told me that time he \"didn't know how to deal with that\" and told me not to talk about it or bring it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want him to have to deal with my past mistakes, trauma, and bad decisions, and it doesn't seem fair to make him listen to it, but I feel like its important for him to know. Am I the asshole for telling him this and making him deal with my shit, or is he the asshole for telling me not to talk about it?",

      "description": "Some back story, we became friends through her husband and we talked and played video games together for about 2 years then when her and her husband separated and started the divorce process she told me it was because she cheated on him 7 times over the course of their 10 year relationship. There was never any inappropriate talking or actions between us while they were together a while after their separation we started sleeping together and she was asking about dating I made it clear I wasn’t comfortable dating until she finished her divorce and worked on improving herself and figuring out why she cheated so much. 2 months later she told me she had a boyfriend now so we had to stop the sex part of our friendship. We went back to how it was before.\n\nShe moved in with her boyfriend, and started acting really weird so I asked what was going on and she told me she hasn’t told him about me so she only talked to me while he was gone (she doesn’t have a job so he pays for everything for her, and is talking about paying to help her go to school) so I started pushing her to tell him about me and introduce us. Her boyfriend found out about me and we talked a little, I found out they started their relationship before she ended things with me. \n\nI confronted her about it and she confirmed they were in a relationship at that point and she lied to me about being single and cheated on him. I told her he deserved to know and she should tell him. She said “it should be my choice to tell him, and I don’t want my past to ruin this, I didn’t know what this relationship was going to turn into and I ended the cheating”. I decided that the guy deserved to know anyway so I decided if she wouldn’t tell him within 2 weeks I would. I tried to talk to her a couple times ending with crying and begging me not to bring it up again, then I told her to meet me on the last day so we could figure out this situation in a face to face conversation so it could be resolved she agreed but never showed up so I called her boyfriend and told him. \n\nShe lied saying the weekend in particular that I told him about she was with family so he called her grandma who she was living with at the time and she said she was with family that weekend so apparently she started this lie before it ever happened, she started telling her boyfriend more lies and he started talking a lot of shit and threatening me so I went to bed, in the morning it hit me she can’t fake bank charges I sent him a message saying ask for her statement for that weekend and there will be 3 charges at specific locations which are not in the city she claimed to be in, she kept denying it, the next morning he messaged me to say that she admitted it finally and that she isn’t allowed to talk to me so if she contacts me to let him know which I told him to go fuck himself and if I choose to keep talking to my friend in the future it’s not his decision then he threatened to beat me up a bunch more.",

We had a great time and I saw her one more time, but I wasn't feeling it. \nWe were talking on the phone for a bit and she mentioned how in the past, she promised a guy head if he did her essays. She never gave him head, but she then told me that she has an essay due. That freaked me out and I hung up on her. I started thinking about her differently and I remember her telling me how just 3 years ago, she was severely depressed. She attempted suicide 5 times and she was hospitalized. She had major shit. After thinking, I really wanted to break up with her. Besides her weird comment, I feel that I could've hurt her beyond repair. I know that it's her decision to date, but I don't want to be responsible for pushing her into depression again. Btw she has been good for a year or two. \n\nTldr: I broke up with a girl for saying a weird comment and because she has depression. I didnt want to hurt her.",

      "description": "I’m a new driver, and last night I was pulling out of my parking space at work when another car in front of me was aggressively trying to pull into my spot that I was pulling out of. They weren’t leaving me a lot of room, and I was getting nervous, so I very slowly crept back a little more...and bumped a parked pick up truck with my small sedan, and I do mean slowly, as I had only just removed my foot from the brake a little bit. I panicked. Put my four ways on, checked both cars and saw no damage, not even paint transfer. A couple came up from the side the truck was on and said “truck’s fine. I think you at most knocked off an icicle. Have a good night.” So, I thanked them, got into my car, and drove home. When I got home, I realized that I just assumed that was the owner, but what if it wasn’t. So, I drove back (6km) to find the truck and leave a note, but they had left. I had been gone less than an hour. I asked the security team if anyone had reported any vehicle issues, and they said no, there were no complaints. But I feel absolutely terrible for just assuming that I spoke to the owner, and not just a nice person. \n\nAm I an asshole? ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to have to pay my father for a car that the person tried to give to him for free, but he insisted on paying for anyway?",
      "description": "I was recently rear ended and it resulted in my car being totaled as well as some minor-to-moderate injuries. It's been a pain getting the insurance figured out, luckily my father has a family friend with a good car that belonged to his late-wife he didn't want to have to deal with trying to sell.\n\nMy father, his wife, and I all took the day off of work to go visit the friend, who lives about 2 hours away.\n\nBefore the drive, my dad and I had worked out a deal. He was going to offer the guy $4 grand for the car(KBB puts it between $4.7-5.8) so already a good deal. He then said that I would just have to take out a loan(once the insurance settles my previous loan on my car, and the remaining $2k is paid off) and then pay him for the car.\n\nI was fine with this, honestly it was great news. I'd much rather pay my father for the car than be \"in debt\" to him for it. I try my best to not rely on him and be my own man, but this was an emergency situation and a much better deal than going to a dealership.\n\nWe arrive and begin discussing the car, after a few minutes he says, \"Take it, it's yours. Merry Christmas.\" I'm surprised, for sure, as I wasn't expecting him to just \"give\" us the car. However my step-mother interjects and insists that we pay him. He counters by saying, he really doesn't want our money at all and that we would be doing him a favor by taking it away. She continues to insist he takes the money(not her money by the way) and after some back and forth he says, \"Okay I'll take half then.\"\n\nThis continues to go on with him insisting on half of what we were going to offer him, and her insisting on the full amount, him creeping it up to $2,500, then $2,750 and so on before finally he sighs and agrees on $3,500, which she(and my dad) also begrudgingly accepts.\n\nAt one point I literally had to step out of the room as I was getting so angry. I dunno why I was feeling this way, I was *completely okay and happy* to pay the $4,000 that I had originally talked to my dad about, however it feels like now I am being FORCED to pay this money unnecessarily. Hell even after my dad cut him the check, he said he was \"Going to hold onto this for him.\" and when they insisted he cash it, he refused, saying, \"You can't make me.\" or something to that effect.\n\nI then had to drive the two hours home by myself. Honestly, I was steaming the whole time. On the one hand, it's less than we had planned, but on the other hand, it's **$3,500** more than we HAD to pay. I dunno why that she insisting he take the money, and his stark and adamant refusal has changed how I feel about it.\n\nI really want to confront my dad about it but I don't want to feel like I am \"Looking a gift horse in the mouth\" because, honestly, $3,500 is a steal for this car. It's only 4 years old, has 32,000 miles on it, and is in great condition. I'm extremely thankful that this happened.\n\nI dunno. I just feel so conflicted and wanted to know what others thought.\n\nSome additional info that may be relevant.\n\n1) He is in an assisted living facility as he is getting pretty old\n2) He has Parkinson's disease and while it's still early stages, it is starting to affect his mind\n3) He and his wife have been friends of my family for over 25 years.\n4) He doesn't have much in the way of retirement\n5) He is fairly isolated from everyone due to where he lives(cost of living and elderly care is substantially cheaper where he lives compared to if he was closer)\n\nWhen it comes down to it, he really *does* need the money, and I am honestly more than happy to give it to him for the car. I just feel that because my step-mom had this argument over it that I feel like, well, she was offering up MY money in a way. Cause yes, they paid the 3.5k out of pocket right then and there, but I was now on the hook for it. I dunno. I just don't like that she turned down a gift for me and instead made me pay for it.\n\nThe best analogy I can come up with to describe how I feel is: You planned to buy yourself something, however someone else buys it for you, and then makes you pay them, even though they could have gotten it for free.\n\nIDK... Am I the asshole in this? Cause I really feel like one.",

      "description": "I went on a date today with this girl I met on OKC. Truthfully she and I had nothing in common but I think she just had a fetish for Koreans - she kept mentioning how she watched K-dramas and liked K-pop (I don't really consume either). She texted me last night asking if I was around and I figured I had nothing else to do so we decided to go on a date.\n\nIt wasn't horrible, just awkward. She seemed super nervous and guarded. We went and got some Korean food, and she said she could take the spiciness but I could see she was kind of dying. I tried to ask her questions and draw her out more but she just... never said anything substantial? Turns out she had moved from another country when she was younger so she was held back a year, so she was still in high school at 19, which is fine but I think there was a bigger gap in maturity than I expected (I'm 22). I tried asking if she worked, if she did things for fun, etc but she seemed not to want to answer any of my questions. We just had a lot of problems communicating even though I speak a little bit of her native language and she speaks fluent English. \n\nAfter lunch we went to a thrift store and she was wide-eyed, she'd never been in one. It was fun watching her zip around the store but I got the sense that she grew up sheltered and I felt almost like her dad. I felt like it'd be sketchy of me to keep dating someone who's still relatively immature.\n\nWhen it was time for us to part ways I decided to be straightforward with her. I thought she also felt that we weren't going to work out so \"I had a lot of fun today with you but I don't think we're compatible. You'll find someone who's right for you, and I will too. If you want to get more Korean food as friends let me know.\" And we hugged and left. \n\nOn my way home I just wanted to make sure she was OK so I texted her that there's nothing wrong with her, she just needs to keep dating and meet the right person. Well she texted back saying \"thank you but I think I need a break from dating\". I asked her why and she started saying it makes her feel disposable, and that everyone is drawn to her appearance but leaves after seeing her personality, and that she should never have started dating... We exchanged a dozen texts, with me explaining it's not her fault and there are other people, and her being devastated and saying horrible things about herself. At this point I feel like I just kicked a puppy and left it roadside. \n\nI've been ghosted before and I've been rejected over text before, and neither felt very good. But I feel just so guilty now. AITA for breaking it to her like I did? AITA for even going on this date??",

Obligatory on mobile/throw away disclaimer. \n\nMy partner (31m)  and I (29f) knew we wanted to marry each other pretty early on, so we had had numerous conversations about what kind of ring I wanted. Not a diamond. Not a diamond. Not a diamond. That's all I asked. While he was designing the ring, he was making jokes about how I didn't want a diamond. I actively didn't want something traditional. Fast forward to him proposing to me, it's a diamond.\n\nFast forward a couple weeks later we were talking about the ring because it was a little too small to begin with, and I was asking him why he chose to get me a diamond instead of anything else. He said he didn't want to have to explain to people why he didn't get a diamond, that the purchase really represents him and how he values the relationship. He had the ring custom built. He chose everything about the design and stones. I mentioned that the ring is really for the recipient and not for the audience and I think this was discouraging to him because he said he thought I could change my mind about diamonds and we can just get everything changed.\n\nI don't want that, this is the ring he gave me, this is the ring he wanted to give me. It's an immensely beautiful and expensive gesture and I would never want something that he didn't want to give me. But aside from the size being too small, I genuinely do not like the design of the ring and I hate diamonds. I am blown away that he would go above and beyond to make getting me an engagement ring a massive, personal project. That's why I don't want another ring, the sentiment alone does it for me. We basically settled on he should have included me in the process.  He just wanted to make me happy, and he spent a lot of money to do it. (Which is another reason why I didn't want a diamond in the first place.)\n\nNow, I'm picking out wedding bands, the design I want does not match the engagement ring, I do not want to wear them together. \n\nI don't want to wear my engagement ring at our wedding. It's too small to fit comfortably with another ring on the same finger. I don't want to wear it on my right hand. Point blank, I dont want to.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I was honest to those who ask where my ring is? If I said it's not really my style? Any other excuse would contradict the fact that Im probably not going to wear my engagement ring much after this. It irks me that so much about weddings is showboating and I don't want to pretend. I got something I didn't want half because my partner was worried about what other people would think, and now do I have to continue that facade? Both of our mothers know how I feel about the ring. And my partner knows I probably won't wear the ring much after we get married. If that matters at all. ",

      "description": "Okay so, my house is being slowly renovated, DIY, room by room. I just got done with my son's room, my room is next...so my husband and I are sans room. We decided to get our son a bunk bed and sleep in the bottom bunk instead of the couch, until our room is done. \nOkay so here's the story...initially I was going to build my son a loft bed that hung from the ceiling but one day, as my family and i were perusing the community market (farmers market but with clothing, furniture, produce, etc.) we came across a really nice bunk bed w/trundle that worked perfectly for our needs. Our son loves bunk beds and we also could use the space for the family that visits, and for us temporarily. We asked if the mattresses were included in the overall price and the guy said yes. They did say they had mattress upgrades that would come at $60 extra for each mattress. We actually didn't like the upgraded mattresses because they came with a box spring and that took away significant head space (or the space between your body and the ceiling/top bunk). We decided standard mattress worked best for us. The sales guy said he could install the bed same day but that they only had two standard mattresses left, he said he would give us the upgraded mattress for the lower bunk temporarily and that when the shipment of standard mattresses come in he could trade it out. We asked why not just throw it in, why trade it at all and he said because he would lose money unless he charged us for the upgrade. We really didn't care for the upgrade anyway so we agreed. \n\nThe thing is, it has almost been a month and they still haven't called to change out the mattress! So this is what we have, top bunk standard mattress, bottom - upgrade, trundle -standard. My son sleeps on the top bunk and my husband and I are on the full size bottom. At this point we feel they probably forgot but aren't entirely sure. WIBTA if I refused to switch out the mattress if they called to do it at this point? It just seems super inconvenient now because his room is now done with all furniture in place, we'd have to make arrangements to be home for the switch, we'd have to make sure the living room and hall were cleared enough for the switch, we'd have to unmake and remake the bed. It just seems like a bug headache if they did decide to switch out the mattress now. It wasn't written anywhere on paper that there was an agreement to switch the mattresses anyway. So, WIBTA if I just told them we aren't switching if/when they call?\n\nTL;DR agreed to switch expensive mattress for cheaper mattress on purchase but business never called to follow through and nothing on paper stating OP agreed to change out the more expensive mattress for the cheaper one. WIBA to keep the more expensive mattress or refuse to switch?",

My dorms are kind of like apartments and she doesn’t share a room with me but just the bathroom and kitchen. Yesterday she asked if she could have a friend stay in her room while she was away, while I told her I’d have to talk to our other roommates too but there shouldn’t be a problem. She then included the fact that there would be 3 more guys with him staying in the living room. We’re also an all girl dorm. I asked where she would stay and she said at her boy friends dorm so they could have her room. We left it at that we would talk later.\n. The next day they showed up. She didn’t mention that they were coming so soon. After they got here she told us that they were staying for a week and she also said she doesn’t know them that well and barely just met them when they came. She does this often but never that many people or for that long. They are also extremely messy and leave the toilet seat up and there’s been pee on the floor, a problem that hadn’t happened before. They also change the AC so it’s so hot in the morning and her guests got mad at me when i changed it to a cooler temperature. Even though I live here! I want to tell her something and say they can’t stay during the  school week, and my other roommates agree, but we don’t want her to then not let anyone over ever. It’s not the fact that there are people over that’s the problem, it’s the length their staying and how inconsiderate they are. Would I be the asshole if I anonymously had our RA answer to a noise complaint and kicked them out???",

      "description": "## \n\nOff the top, It's important to note that I hate what bachelor &amp; bachelorette parties are all about.\n\nThe idea of screwing around on your partner before your marry them turns my stomach.\n\nI chose not to have a bachelor party before I got married as I saw no need to get drunk and get lap dances after having been in a monogamous relationship for seven years.\n\n2 years after I got married my sister was engaged and asked my wife to be a bridesmaid. Leading up to her wedding, my sister rented a cottage her weekend bachelorette party. While having reservations, I made no attempt to stop my wife from going. The only thing I said to her was to have no physical contact and no dicks near her face (I knew a male stripper was being arranged).\n\nWhen the girls returned my wife seemed as if something was bothering her. She eventually came clean and told me that she had gotten drunk (her inhibitions are obliterated when this happens) and made out with some random guy at a bar. Now I know for some people this may not be a big deal, but it crushed me. It is - to this day - one of the most challenging emotional traumas I have ever experienced.\n\nThis was very out of character for her. She was as as much in disbelief as I was and to say she felt horrible was a understatement.\n\nAfter an initial fight, I didn't speak to her for 3 days. We eventually talked and slowly worked things out. But for weeks, the image in my mind of my drunk wife making out with some random guy really tore me up.\n\nIn exchange for my forgiveness, I asked her that she never again attend another bachelorette party, especially one that involved alcohol (yes, I realize how unlikely this is) or anything overnight. I did, however, make one exception...\n\nMy wife's sister was the maid of honor at our wedding, and now, she is engaged. Naturally, I expect my wife will be her maid of honor and consequently involved with everything that title entails. Currently, my sister-in-law is living with her fiancé in Ireland and there has been talk about having a bachelorette party somewhere in Europe.\n\nI couldn't in good conscience tell my wife that she can't attend a local night out with her sister for her bachelorette party. But a week-long trip overseas is simply out of the question in my mind.\n\nWe now have 3 children (5, 2 and 4 months) and I would need to time time off work just so she could attend this trip. I could easily kibosh on the whole thing on this alone, but I'm looking for opinions from a moral standpoint.\n\nWe are in the process of trying to buy a new house and simply cannot justify the expense of a needless trip to Europe right now.\n\nAfter my sister's bachelorette, my wife said she would never again drink to excess without me. But the sting of that weekend has subsided for both of us and I simply don't trust that she won't succumb to peer pressure during a week-long trip abroad.\n\nWhat say you Reddit community?",

      "description": " \n\nI'll try and make this as cut and dry as possible.\n\nMy girlfriend works about a five minute drive from where we live, depending on traffic. The problem, is with traffic, it can become a 45 minute, even an hour sometimes drive. It's a 25 minute walk. We live in Florida, so it can be very hot and sunny, but it's right on the beach, so if she really wanted she could walk home, but I'm worried she would burn in the sun. We also have a trolley system, for 75 cents, no switching, but can still take the full 45 minutes too but it's air conditioned and you can read or do whatever. They do have a problem with not running consistently, but they shoot for every 15 minutes to 30 minutes, there is a covered waiting area along the road directly in front of her work. She takes the trolley to work, but leaves two hours early, because a couple of times she was almost late due to them dropping a schedule in the off season where its every 30 minutes to 45 minutes, while being reliably not set to their listed schedule time. I have never tried to get her to take and early trolley or a late trolley as my job always has mornings and nights open, as well as a lack of traffic. The traffic starts around 10 am and tends to end around 7:30 pm.\n\nI never have a problem taking 10-15 minutes to give her a ride to and from work.\n\nShe doesn't have a big problem with taking the trolley whenever I'm working. She obviously isn't a fan, but doesn't let it ruin her attitude for the rest of the day or bring it up every chance she gets.\n\nThey have an app that shows the trolleys, but her phone just doesn't have room for it I guess. I have it on my phone and she used to text me and ask, but that didn't solve them taking over an hour sometimes between pickups and one time, it said 5 minutes for like 45 minutes, so I guess it broke down, so she doesn't trust it anymore and we haven't used the app recently. It also doesn't have a great function to find stops you're not near since it uses your location, you need to go stop by stop to be able to select bus stops farther out of range.\n\nHer driving isn't an option, but it's being worked on, so I'd like to avoid that aspect if possible as it's 100% not her fault or anyone else.\n\nWhenever I'm not working and I even suggest I don't pick her up due to traffic and she just take the trolley, she gets the \"you kicked my dog\" sadness and spicy responses, along with plenty of \"you can't just spring this on me like this.\"  \n\n\nThere is plenty more to unpack, but I wanna try and keep this as pure as possible.",

      "description": "I know i sound like an asshole already but..\n\nSaturday was my (16M) birthday party. I didn’t want to have one, but after a few days I thought, hey, why not celebrate?\n\nThe beginning of March comes. I asked six friends what time they would be available, I didn’t want anyone left out. They agree on the 16th, at 5pm. I make a reservation for a restaurant. I ask again the week of the party to confirm. Everyone says yes except one person. No hard feelings.\n\nThey all assured me. My friend, lets call Mae, especially did, saying she would totally come, and how excited she was. She’s not the most reliable, but I still see her as a good friend. \n\n The day before i ask for conformation again, Yes, they are coming. The day finally comes. I text everyone at 12 pm for a final confirmation. \n\nOne person says they forgot, and couldn’t come. Another person just completely ghosts me. Three people left. I text them, including Mae.\n\nI arrive to the restaurant at 4:30. Since its popular, they can’t seat you until all of your party has arrived, i waited. 20 minutes later, two show up. It’s just Mae. I text her:\n\nMe (4:42): Hey, are you close?\n\nMae (4:50) Sorry, i might be late, im still at the mall :(\n\nI thought, shes at the mall in our town. I can wait. I realized that the app has a map feature that lets you see where your friends are, so i check on it.\n\nShe’s at the mall. In another state. 1-2 hours away.\n\nMy dad asked where everyone else is. I told him i was still waiting for Mae, who was in the next state over, he got shocked. He said, “Yeah. she’s not coming. Let’s go inside.” \n\nWe get seated. I wanted to leave a seat for her, but then another group got placed in them. I realized, even if she did come, she would have nowhere to sit. So I messaged her again:\n\nMe (5:25) Hey sorry, I think im gonna cancel the party. :(\nMe: Cause people aren’t showing up\n\n45 minutes later, she just texts me:\n\nMae(6:04) Ahh\n\nI felt bad for lying, since it wasn’t really canceled, but she wouldn’t even be seated with us. Checked the map, still at the mall.\n\nThe party was great, even if only two people showed. Im glad they came, but it still felt shitty. The party ended around 7:40. I came back home at 8.\n\nI checked the map out of curiosity, and it showed Mae was back home. Still feeling upset, I messaged her again:\n\nMe (8:12) Hey :/\n\nMae: (8:20) Hello\n\nMe: (8:25) So how was your trip to the mall?\n\nNo answer. No one has messaged me.\n\nSo AITA for lying, even if I wanted her to come? I see her and other friends tomorrow. Im scared of what they might say to me, if they want to talk at all. Not sure what to do.\n\nTLDR; wanted to have a party, ask all my friends weeks early if they can go, they say yes, including really excited friend, Mae. I ask day of to confirm, Only 2 show up. I text Mae to ask where she is, says she’ll be late, turns up in another state. End up saying it was “canceled” and not to show up. still had a party.\n",

      "description": "On mobile, not real names, sorry etc..\n\nLets start with some back story. My 2 friends John and Mark decided to do their 2 year working holiday visas in Europe and Mark left a small box of stuff with me. All of that was fine, I moved to the other side of Australia about 6 months later and Marks box along with some of my belongings went to mum and dads for storage. Gotta love mum and dads free storage cupboards.\n\nAnyway! This was over 5 years ago. I haven't seen them since they left (and subsequently returned to a different city in Australia) but have always kept in sporadic contact with John. Mark and I stopped talking 4 years ago, zero contact even through facebook because Mark has a facebook account but doesn't use it. We weren't exactly close and when he left it was kind of a relief for me to get some space from him. I sent him several text messages 3 years ago asking what he wanted me to do with the box because mum wanted to do a clean out. I also messaged John asking if he could talk to Mark about the box. No answer.\n\nI had never looked in the box before this, but mum wanted it gone and Mark apparently didn't care anymore. Inside was some photos of buildings in NY from a trip we did, a drawing another friend of ours did for Mark, some sketches, tarot cards, a silver bracelet with his birthday engraved and a broken silver watch.\n\nFast forward 3 years and John messaged me last week via facebook. We hadn't caught up in ages so we had a great chat with our usual jokes. He asks me if I still have Marks box, he wants it for Marks birthday. I tell him I don't have it anymore. It either went to recycling or the opshop.\n\nJohn: That was stuff from his 21st birthday, and his grandparents jewellery. OMG he is not going to be happy.\n\n*ahhhhhhh, fuck*\n\nMe: I tried to text him because I wanted to send him his stuff.\n\nJohn: Fb or text? His phone has changed since then.\n\nI apologised profusely and John tells me it's not him I should be apologising to, it's Mark.\n\nSo guys, how many years is acceptable to throw away someone elses jewelry? AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for disapproving of my cousin’s new relationship?",
      "description": "My cousin and I have always been close, and honestly, she’s the closest thing I have to a sister. We’re very close in age. I recently started college, and she’s now a junior in high school. \n\nDuring thanksgiving, I noticed a real shift in her personality. She’s been acting more self-absorbed, asking me if she can call me “bitch” because that’s what she calls our mutual friend who is my age, and when I requested her not to, she made a remark saying that’s why she sees our mutual friend more as a cousin than me. Most irritating of all, she constantly complained about not having a boyfriend, and though I told her that she shouldn’t have that be her main focus and that she should put her effort into school, she dismissed what I said and just kept complaining more about how her most of her friends were in relationships. \n\nFast-forward to now, she tells me she now is dating someone, and it so happens to be a boy I’m familiar with. I know this boy because his sister and I used to go to the same high school, and she wasn’t exactly the nicest to me. His sister (we’ll call her “C”) and I had a mutual best friend (we’ll call her “A”). C and I weren’t friends at all - in fact, she hated me and saw me as competition. I only know this because A told me every single thing C said about me after A broke off their relationship. \n\nC, A, and I went to a Christian high school. I am Catholic, and for some reason, the staff members there just really didn’t like me. The staff members didn’t really know me well, but they just assumed that I was a bad influence because I didn’t go to their church and didn’t attend youth group. C and A were a part of the church, and C tried her best to tear down my character just so A would drop me as a friend, using my religion as leverage against me. A eventually saw that C was being manipulative, ended their friendship, and continued to be friends with me. \n\nSo - I have a long-standing feud with C that I’ve definitely told my cousin about. She and her new boyfriend know about how C and I don’t like each other, yet they mutually decided it didn’t matter to them. I know my history with his sister shouldn’t matter when it comes to their relationship, but I still feel a little betrayed. Not only that, but I feel like she’s rushing it and wants to get into a relationship with him solely because she wants to be “cuffed.” \n\nAnother thing that I want to talk about is his parents. His parents are extremely strict. They’re also prone to blaming people other than their children, as I’ve had personal experience with since their daughter really disliked me. My cousin says they’re trying to keep their relationship a secret - from both his parents and her parents. And I know for a fact that both of their parents will be rational if any of them find out about this relationship.\n\nAlso, I want to add that I know he’s a separate person apart from his family. I don’t personally know him, and I don’t want to make any assumptions about him just because of my bad experiences with his family members. I just feel like she doesn’t understand that having a boyfriend will eventually mean the family will be involved, and considering that they’re already starting the relationship off by keeping it a secret from them when they’re already extremely strict, I feel like it really won’t end well. \n\nAITA for disapproving? I’m trying to be objective about the situation, but it’s overall just kind of messy. I’m very afraid that I’m making it all about me, and I really don’t want it to be that way. \n\ntl;dr - My younger cousin recently started dating a boy whose sister really doesn’t like me. I feel like she’s pursuing him just to say she’s in a relationship. Both of their parents are strict and will not approve of the relationship, which is why they want to keep it a secret. I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for immediately being disapproving of the relationship and not giving them a chance. ",

      "description": "Okay, so backstory here, i work in a very small office, and we had a very nice Accountant who retired at the end of last year.  We hired a new one at the beginning of the year, who is a very nice person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRewind about 2 months ago, I had to use the washroom, but she had beat me to it (we have 1 washroom in our office),   she was in there for about a half hour.  By the time I got to go in there, I was pretty desperate.  so I close the door, and sit down, see a spec in my peripherals.   THERE IS A BLOB OF POO ON THE WALL!  After thinking about it,  a small timid girl or a small town construction worker coming out of there, who would anyone believe?  I sucked it up and went to get TP to clean it off the wall, surprise, no TP on the holder, so i get a new roll, use half of it to clean it up.  I then go to wash my hands and throw out the paper towel, what do you know! Crap covered paper towel at the top of the pile!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago now.  she stays late usually on fridays, I go to use the bathroom first thing on monday morning.  Keep in mind she is the only woman in the office.  So there are driplets of blood on the seat, floor, and streaks of blood down the front of the bowl, and top of the wide open garbage can, is an open bloody pad!  No cleaning it this time, apparently for anyone the past week as it is stillll there!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, was the final straw, I go in to see if its clean, not only is it not, as she just comes out of there.  There is Pee all over the toilet seat!  I yelled profanities in there and pushed the door open, and slammed it as I left.  Yelled at her that you learn basic Hygene at 2 years old! and how rude it was, told her the dirtiest of construction workers know how to use the toilet properly, how come you can't????!!!  I left the office, and won't go back for the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow am I the ass hole for doing this?  I don't know how else this could have been handled?  It's not like any of this was hidden, it was all in plain sight.",

      "description": "My friend and I both are 21 F and have been friends since we were in kindergarten. Recently everything went down hill. I will call her B. \n\nA little thing about B whenever she is with a guy, she changes. Her personality changes, she talks to me less and all. I can understand that to an extent but it is weird when we were actually like sisters. I think the serious issue started when I was hospitalized for one week, needed to take heavy medicine. I didn’t expect anyone to come visit me. Whenever a friend worried about me and called me I just said ‘I have nothing to worry’ and ‘please don’t come’. It wasn’t as serious as a normal staying at hospital situation so I thought it wasn’t worthy to make them worry. But B said, she heard about me and she will come visit me. I realized I really needed a friend with me. I was lonely, bored and in pain also I hadn’t seen B for a long time, I had missed her. I was really happy she would come visit me but that day she didn’t respond to my messages until end of the day. She just said she had a laser appointment and couldn’t come. It felt pretty sad. (The worse thing is treatment lasts for 1 hour and her mother is the one working there, taking appointments so it was changable). I didn’t talk to her after I came home. \n\nThen she messaged me after 2 weeks. She said ‘she is sorry’’we are going to go out together always’ ‘she is going to buy me gifts and do whatever to make me feel better’\n\nI was happy again so I accepted her apology. We hung out for once and it was just once a week texting with no soul. My birthday came up and she asked me if I want to do something with her. I had an event in my mind so we made a plan for that. So the event was 9am - 6pm and we could have gone anytime. When it was my birthday, she texted me at 6pm if I wanted to do something. I just said no and after one week only thing she wrote was about if I still have my cat’s cage with me or not. \n\nI don’t think I did anything to deserve this from the person I called best friend for a long time and I want to learn if I am asshole if I dont speak with her anymore.

      "title": "AITA for objecting to my wife's work commitments and the burden they place on me with respect to child care?",
      "description": "My wife (K) and I are both professionals working in a big city. I never really wanted children, but K was very insistent about wanting a child, and I decided to put her needs above mine on this issue, given how important it is to her. \n\nSo we had a son 2 years ago, and I've thrown myself into it completely - the kid is great, and I put in a ton of effort trying to be a good dad. Essentially I work a full day every day, spend \\~3 hours hanging out with my son after I come home, then jump back on my laptop to do more work after he goes down to bed. I carry my weight in terms of diaper changing, putting him to bed, feeding him, playing with him, daycare drop-off, etc.\n\nThe issue that's arisen is my wife's work travel schedule. She's in a really demanding job, and in 2015 - 16 (before our son was born), she was put on a project that required her to be away from home / out of state quite frequently. At the time it was happening, she assured me that this was a pretty atypical project, and that I shouldn't expect her to be away from home so frequently in the future.\n\nFast forward to 2018, and another project related to the 2015 - 2016 one arises, so she ends up traveling quite a bit. This is in addition to a decent amount of social travel, as she has 3 separate friend groups she goes on out-of-town trips with once or twice a year. In total, between work and social, she's been gone about \\~60 days total in the past year. On those days, I've been left to fend for myself with our son. I love him, but it's a ton of work taking care of him 1:1 for long stretches, and it's started to really bother me from the standpoint that I've already stuck my neck out / completely rearranged my life to make K happy by having a kid (even though it's not something I'd have wanted on my own), I've fully embraced the role of being a dad, and now on top of that I feel like I'm having my goodwill exploited by her leaving me as a solo parent for 2 months out of the year. Full disclosure: I'm away for work \\~30 days out of the year, so I do this to her sometimes, but 1) that's a full month less than she's gone; 2) I've significantly cut down on discretionary social travel since our son was born; and 3) again, despite how much I adore our son, we had a child specifically to make her happy, and specifically at the expense of a life I was completely happy with.\n\nSo things came to a head a few days back, when she (on one day's notice) told me she had to go on another 2-day work trip. I told her we needed to talk about this, as I was unhappy about how frequently she's been gone, and I didn't want the rest of my life to be like this. She alternated between 1) getting super upset with me and saying stuff to the effect of \"fine, I'll just find another job\" in a pissed-off, passive-aggressive manner; 2) arguing with me that her travel schedule won't be as bad once this project ends this spring; and 3) insisting that she hadn't been away from home much more than I had in 2018.\n\nWith regard to 1), I'd honestly be thrilled if she found another job, and I told her that. The problem is she absolutely loves her current job and is good at it. There are other, related jobs she could move into that would have better work-life balance and fewer travel requirements. The downside is that they'd pay less and be less personally fulfilling to K. My sense is that she thinks my desire for her to change jobs is tantamount to my wanting her to be barefoot and in the kitchen, which is a little ridiculous - if she were to change jobs, she'd still be in a role that is very well respected (certainly more well respected than mine) and would still be paid quite well (albeit not as well as she currently is). \n\nWith regard to 2), it's possible that her travel schedule will normalize after this project is over, but that's what she told me in 2015 - 16 as well, and here we are in the present. So I don't have a ton of faith that this situation won't repeat itself in the coming years, and I'll be solo-dadding for large chunks of time on a semi-regular basis. \n\nWith regard to 3), I know she's wrong about this, as I've gone back through our calendar for 2018 and counted the days. It's a bit frustrating that she won't even fully engage with the idea that there has been a large imbalance in time away from home, and that it's unduly burdened me in terms of child care.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for hanging in there. As it stands, I've made my dissatisfaction clear, and I've left it in her court to decide whether to start considering other job opportunities. (While I think that would be what's best, it's ultimately her decision.) Meanwhile, she's taken this to mean that I'm strong-arming her into finding a new job, and so she's started putting out feelers while also acting incredibly pissed off toward me (snapping at me occasionally, sleeping in the guest bedroom) for the last several days. I'm debating whether I'm going to cave in and just tell her to stay at her current job (since I'm kind of a softie and really do care about her happiness), even if it potentially causes me to be miserable for the rest of my life, or whether I'm going to stay silent on the issue and see how it plays out.\n\nIn any case, I know the point here is not to ask for advice. AITA for objecting to my wife's travel schedule (and it's impact on me with respect to child care), and / or for how I've handled the issue regarding her staying at her current job vs. finding something new?",

They both work full time and then take off on weekends, often leaving the dog with my parents. \n\nWhen friend’s dog attacked one of my parent’s dogs, I was told it came out of nowhere, was brutal, vicious, and despite yelling, screaming and trying to pull the dogs apart, they just couldn’t. Friend’s dog has since been forgiven and spends time there regularly again. \n\nI have a 4 year old and a 1.5 year old. After the dog attack, I told my parents in no uncertain terms that I don’t want the dog around my kids. I don’t want to risk them witnessing a dog attack, I won’t risk them being involved in a dog attack. I’ve repeatedly been tricked into interactions. Either my parents invite us over and the dog is already there, or my children are at their house and somebody texts friend bring her dog over. Nothing bad has happened since, and that is their reason I’m being an asshole to maintain this boundary. \n\nMy kids were invited to a dinner at my parents house yesterday. I was going to leave the younger one there while I took my 4 year old to his music class. Until I heard the dog was also invited.\n\nI urged my family to reconsider inviting the furry guest, but they did not. I’m expected to suck it up because any dog has the ability to turn violent. If I’m going to keep my kids away from this dog, I should keep my kids away from all dogs otherwise I’m a hypocrite.\n\nI’ve never once brought my kid’s to family friend’s house. All of these interactions are out of the dog owner’s unwillingness to leave her dog at home. \n\nI’m not asking my parents to not have the dog at their house, I’m simply asking the dog and the kids not be invited at the same time and that I’m made aware when that’s happening so I can stay away. It doesn’t feel like too much to ask, but my extended family and family friend disagree and think I’m the asshole. ",

      "description": "So sorry it’s long! \n\nSo my mum asked if I wanted to come with her and my sister (she has additional needs) to see Mary Poppins. I wasn’t that interested in the movie but a day out sounded nice as I just quit my job. \n\nMy parents have said to me they don’t have that much money right now because of Christmas so I said I will pay for the movie for the three of us. \n\nI just bought my mum and sister a drink each and mum said we should get popcorn that was in this Mary Poppins bowl (this bowl was $20). \n\nI said okay because it was cute and I was being nice, I said to her let’s split it $10 each because honestly I didn’t see a problem with this. She said yes that’s reasonable. I also bought lunch for her and my sister. \n\nAfter the movie we go to Kmart because my mum wanted some clips for her hair. When we got there she picked some out ($4) she then said she needed to go to the Apple store really quick because she needed to get her iPad fixed and asked me to line up with my sister. She asked if she wanted me to give her the $4 which I said yes I did. \n\nSo she gave me the money and left. I paid and went to another store and found these cute Christmas decor that was on sale 60% off. I wasn’t sure about a few of them so I took pictures and sent them to her. \n\nI was waiting in the car when she rang and said I should get all the Christmas decor I had sent her. I asked because she was in the shops if she could get them and I will transfer the money right now. She said she will have to use her credit card and I said okay. \n\nShe got back to the car with the bags by the look on her face I knew she was angry. She opened the door and said “oh no the parking fee” I told her I’ll pay and got my wallet out. (Side note: when I was in the car scrolling I found this Christmas lights thing and it was 7 minutes away from this shopping centre and it was only $15, I had $14 in cash). I was in the middle of asking her if she had any cash/coins on her when she closed the door with me in mid sentence. I was shocked but whatever. She came back angrier and I asked how much it was, it was $17.50. I said oh I’ll transfer the money that’s a lot. She said back why bother and she was disappointed in me. \n\nTo cut a long story short we had a massive fight in the car with me telling her she was yelling like a child and her telling me I’m a disgrace and it’s my fault she can’t say no to me! She was mad because she had to pay for $10 for the popcorn and the $4 for the clips.I told her that makes no sense and she then just started screaming so I ignored her the rest of the way home. \n\nWhen we got home I told my dad and he said I should not have asked to go half with the popcorn as they are short on money. My answer was to say why did she say yes to buying it then? Mum cut in and said because she can’t say no to me because I’m a brat. \n\nI’m very disappointed in them and have cried for the last hour. I feel she is angry in general about having no money and took it out on me. Am I an asshole for all of this? \n",

      "description": "Hello All,\n\nI usually am quite polite and have working in retail before so understand that a customer being on the phone is kind of rude, but it's tax season!\n\nSo I changed jobs and homes last year and needed to make sure my previous employer was sending my tax slip to the correct address. I had been waiting to speak with HR for about 40 minutes before I got to the store and was still placed on hold. I realized that this is a bit rude, the store was pretty dead and the CSR worker kept looking at me as if she were about to ask if I needed any help, I look at her and made a comment along the lines of \"Gotta hate the HR wait times around tax season, if only everyone can email you the tax slips!\", she giggled and told me to let her know if I needed any help.\n\nNow I had some questions about some of the products I was purchasing and kept my phone on my ear (not talking into it as I was still on hold) and asked her my questions, she asked me to put my phone away and ask, I said that I'm just waiting on hold and it's been 50 minutes now. She helped me, I decided to purchase the products, I go up to the counter and take out my card to pay, she asked me if I needed a bag, I didn't hear her as I thought someone had picked up (but I was wrong) and then I  said \"sorry, what was that?\". She told me that I'm being rude at this point and perhaps I should be shopping and requiring service when I'm not pre-occupied. I rolled my eyes and said \"I'll keep that in mind for next time\" and she called over her manager to help me.\n\nI made my purchase and left, I didn't want to get into it with the manager as I was on hold still. FYI, I bought body lotion and eye liner. I feel kind of bad.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I'm 25 and recently engaged, my sister is 29 and has been married for 3 years. She and her husband have been trying to have a baby forever, longer than they've been married, and it's just not happening even after several rounds of IVF. They've dumped a ton of money into trying to have a baby and are starting to look at other options. Unfortunately, they think I'm one of those options.\n\nMy sister asked if I would be a surrogate for her and I absolutely do not want to. I'm not planning to have any kids of my own so I'm not exactly interested in being pregnant. I know it would be an amazing gift for her, but it seems like it would be a nine month nightmare for me. My fiance has also expressed that he is not comfortable with it. Also for as much as I don't want to be pregnant in general, I ten-times don't want to be pregnant or recently post-partum at my wedding, especially with a baby that isn't even mine.\n\nI love my sister, but to be honest the whole thing seems downright creepy (for me. if other women want to be surrogates for their siblings I don't think there's anything wrong with that.)\n\nHere's the sticky part. My sister was my caregiver for a little over a year after I developed severe mental health issues when I was 18-19. I had very strong agoraphobia and did not leave our apartment once during that time, and I was clinically depressed. My sister did all of my food shopping and meal prep, talked me off the ledge several times, and was basically my emotional crutch. After years of intense therapy I am now at a point where I am functional, happy most days, and in a healthy relationship. I regret the way I treated my sister during this time and that I made her my caregiver. And there's a little voice in the back of my telling me that if I give her a baby then I will make up for it. And she has implied the same in our few conversations about the matter. But I just really, really don't want to be pregnant.",

      "description": "Last year, I was a senior at a high school where everyone cares a ton about college acceptances. Most kids/parents at this school feel somewhat entitled to go to unrealistically selective colleges, especially the people who get good grades, but don’t apply themselves elsewhere. I applied early action to my top choice school, and regular decision between another school I really liked. Both schools are extremely selective, and I don’t have legacy status or anything like that, so I didn’t really expect to get into one, much less more than one. After I got accepted to School 1, I accidentally stood up my interviewer at School 2. I assumed this killed my chances for School 2, so I went home, accepted School 1, and told my mom I was withdrawing from School 2. My mom said I shouldn’t withdraw, and then offered to do it for me. I said ok, thanks. A few months later, my mom told me to check my admissions status at School 2, because she hadn’t really withdrawn. I got in, and I was ecstatic, and put it on my Snapchat story, and went to the admit weekend and seriously considered telling School 1 I changed my mind and attending School 2. I am friends with the valedictorian, who works very hard but doesn’t do anything outside of school and as a result, was rejected from School 2, which he had his heart set on, as well as School 1 and all the other schools he considered worthy of his talents. He was vocally very upset with me for “gaming” the system, and a little upset with me for letting it be known that I got in. In the end, I did reject School 2 and attend School 1, but I took a long time to decide. AITA for not immediately rejecting School 2 and keeping it a secret?",

Now, everyone payed the things they brought, including decoration, the cake, you know all that stuff. Now, before the sale started my classmate (F/15) messaged me about bringing stuff, but also asked for money so she can buy tissues and decoration. I told her that I have trust issues and don't want to. Now the thing is that after I told her about this thing with the money, I texted that I was fine with everything else. I didn't really tell her that I don't want to give her money, that was one mistake. Now: she bought her tissues and now wants me to give \"her\" money back. I think that It's unfair that everyone had to pay their stuff except her, and I also don't really think that the tissues costed 5€ (I live in Germany. Sorry for bad grammar or spelling.)\nNow, she slowly started to get on my nerves and I thought \"Nah it was kinda my fault. I should give her the money\" I was about to tell her that I will give it to her.\nBefore i could tell her, she started insulting me. She said that I will never find a girlfriend and die alone as a Virgin. She started saying that people only talk to me because they don't want to offend me, so they can stay out of trouble. It really insulted me, so i just called her a slut and didn't talk to her again.\n\nTL;DR: Girl (F/15) texts me (M/15) that she wants money for buying tissues for a cake sale. I refuse, but kinda mess up saying that. After she buys them, i refuse to give her the money, but in the end realise that it was kinda my fault and want to give it to her. She starts insulting me before i can, i call her a slut and dont talk to her again.\n\nNow, AITA for doing that?",

      "description": "I have had a close girl friend for around 12 years. We’ll call her Sarah. Her and have been through a lot together. We have great times. However, she is ALOT to handle. She starts arguments on a fairly regular basis with random people when we’re out, she flys off the handle over really small insignificant things. I can’t count the amount of times she lost it on me over small insignificant things. \n\nShe was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder a couple years ago and underwent therapy for a couple of years. She improved quite a bit. She’s seems more self aware and I’ll give credit where it’s due, she’s a lot less mean than when we were kids. However, she still goes off on me from time to time. And on more than one occasion threaten to hurt herself when we argue. It’s a total mind fuck.\n\nWe got into an argument about my flakiness. I’ll admit, I’m a bad texter and I’m bad at answering calls. I am also an introverted person. I like my space, my alone time and people, esp her really drain me. However, if I know that there is a problem, then I’m there. \n\nShe was angry that when she called twice I didn’t answer.  I was sleeping. I woke up a couple hours later and hung out with my bf (who I live with) and posted an insta story of him playing video games. \n\nShe then proceeded to harass text me telling me I was a shitty friend. After going back and fourth about it, and explaining to her that this was exhausting and I didn’t feel like talking she explained to me that she had broken up with her bf, and her car had gotten towed and I should have texted her. Yes, I should have but I had no indication she was upset until well into the argument.  \n\nThis has been an ongoing issue. I am not good at responding to text with anyone, but sometimes when I see one from her my first thought is “here we go” or  “what is it now” and it’s bad. I feel like a complete jerk for thinking that way because she has come a long way.\n\nWith that said, I’ve been dealing with my or issues. My dad was in the hospital recently and I also lost my job. When I’m feeling low I like to retreat into myself. She likes to vent. We’re different people.\n\nWe didn’t resolve the issue and I told her not to text me anymore because she was getting on my nerves. The next morning she post an Instagram story of her passive aggressively talking about me saying “just because you acknowledge a behaviour it’s doesn’t make it less toxic” and so fourth.... Basically about me, like she was some insightful person giving some kind of lecture. I lost it on her. We actually yelled at each other and very harsh words were exchanged.  I never thought I would be having and argument over social media post at almost 30. She’s since blocked me on everything. \n\nIn all the 12 years of friendship that has never happened. I think I might have just lost my closest friend. \n\nTL;DR- AITA For ending a 12 year friendship over a fucking Instagram story and bad texting.",

      "description": "So, this is a little bit odd but an interaction that happened today has made me feel really weird and bad.\n\nSo, i'm a junior Computer science student and I started classes last week. When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?",

      "description": "Little background, i work security for a gated community and i work the graveyard shift because i prefer to work by myself and asyou could imagine not alot of people are coming into a neighborhood at 3 am.\n\nSo i get to my normal post (office) at 10pm and i see a new lady there about 45-50 years old, she is covering 1 day for the normal guy who is out sick, i let her know im taking over and its no problem.\n\nI set up and let her know she can leave and she says \"o ok im just waiting for my ride\" and i tell her \"alright no problem\" I've had similar instances before and it was never a problem, so we start talking for about 30 minutes and i ask her \"so uh, when's your ride gonna be here?\" And she says \"o i don't know it should be soon\" and I'm thinking alright whatever i don't care that much so I'm not gonna push it and ask.\n\nAnother 45 minutes go by (11:15) and i ask her again \"so any update from your ride\" and she replies with \" no nothing yet\" so i didn't say anything but im kinda getting a little annoyed with having to share a 10'-5' room with someone i don't know and i have nothing in common with.\n\nAnother hour goes by and i ask again \"heard anything from your ride?\" And she said they had never answered after the first time so she didn't even know if they were on the way. \n\nShe asks me after if there were any nearby stores so i tell her walgreens and rite aid are about a mile down the road so she says she is gonna walk down there. We are in southern california so there is no rain or snow or anything, just some light wind and its about 40 degrees but she has a jacket and all that. And its in a very nice neighborhood so im not worried any serious harm will happen to her. \n\nNow here is where im not sure if im the asshole or not, i didn't kick her out and tell her to leave but when she brought up the idea of walking down there i didn't stop her i just let her go, i suggested an uber but she said she didnt have a card to pay it with so i said \"i dont know what else to tell you then\". \n\nam i an asshole for not saying something like \"o no don't walk you can just stay in the post with me tonight\" or are neither of us the assholes because she was the one who wanted to walk? \n\nIt would have been a shitshow if she stayed until the person who comes at 6 to take my shift came and she was still here so she would have gotten kicked out eventually, but should i have let her stay until that point? Or am i ok letting her go in the middle of the night? ",

      "description": "Hey Reddit I need a secondhand opinion from the internet. So some backstory.... 6 months ago, me, Dad, my siblings, Dad's Gf, Gf's 2 sons and one of the son's gfs (let's call her Bianca) all went on a holiday to New Zealand. My Dad is very well off and paid for 80% of the trip for everybody except Bianca because she is not immediate family. Throughout the whole trip there was a bit of a natural grouping between Dad's family and his Gf's family. But we would try to dissipate it by playing games etc. My Dad has Asperger's and he acts a bit weird and flustered over things he shouldn't be (swearing, pacing etc). Bianca, the 2 sons, and Dad's Gf would sometimes make fun of him for it. His Gf would sometimes gently tease but Bianca and the 2 sons were more malicious in their teasing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the last day I spent a day and night by myself with Bianca and the 2 sons so that we could have a night out in Queenstown and get to know each other (I still barely had had a conversation with Bianca or the boys by then). After a few drinks everything was going fine until someone brought up Dad's odd personality. For a while I laughed along but then it became an absolute roast session on the man who had paid 80% for the whole trip (and he also gave us his credit card so we could buy drinks and food for tonight). Bianca and her boyfriend continued bringing up awkward, antisocial things Dad had done in their house and calling him a \"scatterbrain\". At this point I tried to change the subject and defend him. But they kept speaking over me and began to talk about his finances. They asked me about his salary and that he probably earned x3 the amount his Gf was earning. They also brought up the topic about how my Dad had attempted to avoid tax through a loophole that still made it legal. I had known about the story but I was in utter horror that they knew this and so ashamed that they knew of the sketchy things my Dad had done. They then asked me \"so... How do you feel that we know all this about your family and your Dad?\" That night I felt interrogated and so disrespected. :( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of days after I came back home I informed Dad that Bianca and her bf were not to be trusted and how they had treated me and spoke of him behind his back. I censored a lot because most of the things they said were very degrading toward him. He understood that I didn't like them but waved away the accusations and insults and told me I was overreacting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFastforward to yesterday. It was a hot day and Dad invited his Gf to come swim in our pool. Gf wanted to bring along her family including Bianca. Dad invited them all! I was annoyed that Dad has disregarded my feelings. I hid in my room the whole time and considered just leaving but didn't want to seem immature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfterward I asked \"Why?\" and he said he couldn't really say no to Gf otherwise he would need to explain why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR;\n\nAITA for being annoyed and not wanting my Dad's Gf's horrible kids to come over while I'm here???\n\nOr is he the asshole for letting them come over even after I told him I didn't like them and how they disrespected us both.",

      "description": "Throwaway because he knows my main and we both frequent this sub.\n\nSo backstory,\nI have had this friend, let's call him F, since highschool. I met F when I moved with my family and started doing cheerleading at a local gym. \nF has always been adamantly \"not gay\" I think because he did cheerleading as a guy he got really insecure about that aspect of himself. However due to that he sometimes seems a bit homophobic.\n\nThen there is me, I'm transgender, I started transitioning when I was 14, before we moved and while I haven't had any surgeries, I look like any other girl and can tuck preeeety well, so it was just something I never bring up to anyone. Only people who currently knows I'm trans, besides my boyfriend, is my family. \n\nSo today, F, my boyfriend, and I are all going to see a movie at the mall. I really like dresses and I have this particular one my bf likes, so I wear it a lot. But this dress is short. Like if there is a breeze you can probably see my underwear. But due to tucking, it doesn't really bother me when it happens.\n\nSo we get our tickets, and start going up the stairs to our theater. I lead the way followed by my bf and F. F made some comment to my bf I didn't hear. I didn't think anything of it.\n\nDuring the movie my bf texts me and asks me not to hang out with F by ourselves any more because apparently the comment F had made was about my butt and how much he liked it. Apparently he was looking when I was walking up the stairs in front of them.\n\nI tell my bf not to worry, F wouldn't be into me like that, due to how adamantly \"not gay\" he is. But my bf says that doesn't matter because F doesn't know i used to be a boy. But my bf has never seen how F gets when someone questions his sexuality.\n\nSo after the movie I make a joke about F liking dudes asses, which I find hilarious(trans haha so funny) and F goes into his \"I only like girls, that's why I even did cheerleading in highschool just to be around half naked girls... You're just being judgy because cheerleading..\" blah blah. So I think it's good of a time as any, and so I tell him he's actually gay because he admitted to liking my butt and I'm actually a dude! \n\nWell, that didn't go over so well. He thought I was joking so I explained that I'm trans. He wasn't mad or anything but just got really quiet. He said he didn't care if I was trans but that he's not gay and I should have told him earlier so he wouldn't have said \"gay shit\" and that it's rude for me to call him gay even though I know he's straight.\n\nI felt kinda bad because he stayed quiet the rest of the night like he wasn't having a good time.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for calling my friend gay?",

      "description": "This is childish, well im a child but its cringe-worthy since Im at that rebel-phase.\n\nMy birthday is coming up and I decided to earn some money by doing my classmates group projects. 7 dollars is the total and that costs alot here, its to reward myself with some art supplies or whatnot.\n\nI am in a Science Unuversity and my dream is to be in an Art School or just track, anything related to my dream though parent's wishes and I just do whatever they say. But I'm feeling rebelious (which is often). Pronect deadline is today and I just received a messege from my friend saying if I could do their project and I agreed so I told my dad something like a lie? It kinda goes like this.\n\n\"Dad, Im not going to school since I need to do six videos, edit it, compress and pass it to my teacher.\" (Literally six lengthy videos. It costs literally 60% of my on-card grade on that subject. I also didnt include saying that I did this for money.)\n\nHe frowned and gets infuriated at me. He is like those stereotypical asian parents after all, \"youre going to skip classes and just do one project from a single subject? You could do that later.\"\n\nI insisted and he gave me those angry looks and stomped out due to stress, I feel guilty at this point but nevertheless I continued editing and do as I please.\n\nAfter roughly continious 9 hours of editing, still 5/6 done. Dad bursts into the door and told me, \"whats taking so long?! You have been doing that for hours!\" I guess he didnt understand that editing might be easy but takes alot of time. I feel really devastated and dissapointed right now since Ive been dealing with some personal and grades issues in school. He then told it my mom, an OFW and keeps telling how outrageous I am. I also fought back, copying his tone of voice. Its been a habit of mine and ego is taking over me. And it makes me wonder.\n\nAm I the asshole for this?",

Her cousin on the other hand is quite attractive, we've been on a couple of dates since the breakup and I like her. \n\nBut would it be wrong to take her on this trip with me?

      "description": "Okay so, I was made part of middle management the beginning of 2018 at my job, and at the time there were no rules about time off. I was told I would be given five paid days off, which I thought was amazing but was never told anything about unpaid days. After a long year I took nine days off, five of which were paid, in the end of December/start of January. I had requested said time off in October as I planned on taking a small trip on my time off. In the beginning of February I was told that the time off situation had been changed because of an employee taking off a bunch of days. I was now told that as middle management I was still allotted my five days paid, but now was only allotted five unpaid days. And that my time in the beginning of the year has been retroactively counted against me. \nI’ve been pretty salty about this whole thing since it happened, like I’ve complained to a ton of people because it seems unfair to change policy after the fact. And I’m mad now because I try to take two small vacations a year, which I can still do but if something else comes up like a wedding or concert or something I’m screwed. \nI should also add in, everyone else is allowed to take as much time as they want. \nSo WIBTA for telling my boss I’m upset about it?",

We go in today and we have a server who recognized our group, as she has served us a few times. I order a side salad with a cup of chili and my coworkers order similar items that don't cost too much. \n\nAfter we eat, the server came by with our checks and my bill was $10 and some change. I wanted to pay with cash and only had 3 $5.00 bills. So I hand them to the server and she says, \"I will be right back with your change.\" She comes back and hands me my receipt with a five dollar bill in it. I hand it back and say \"Sorry, could I have some ones?\" as I thought she was going to bring back the coin change and a few ones. As she walked away to get change, my co-workers look at me a little weird and asked what I planned on tipping her. I mean I planned on tipping $3.00 but they looked at me disapprovingly. I ended up leaving her $3.00.\n\nI worked as a server for 3 years and to me a tip was always a tip, even a shitty one, and I always thought a 30% tip was really good for any amount of a check. \n\nMy coworkers kind of made me feel bad, but AITA for wanting my change to leave that tip?",

      "description": "This hopefully won't be too long....\n\n\nSo, a few years ago I met a guy, and I really liked him and got to know him well. Well, things happened, and he ended up moving thousands of miles away. We kept in daily contact for a year, but as the days continued, my mental health increasingly declined. I grew obsessed with this guy, clinging on and memorizing every fact he told me, every secret. I really, really took advantage of my title as best friend. I wanted to know everything about him. This started to effect my other relationships, mainly with my family, since I never did anything but wait for him to respond to my texts. It got to a point where I started believing in fate, and that he was my destined one. I don't anymore, though.\n\n\nThen, one day last summer, I just... Didn't respond to his texts. He sent me a few messages, waited for a day, then sent me a call. All the while I kept looking away. I knew that if I picked up that call I would never give him up. So I stuck to it, for a long time. The guilt ate me alive. But every second of the day I spent texted him killed me and broke my heart more and more, knowing how miserable he was and how I couldn't help him. I was hopelessly in love. I did confess, and we still remained friends afterwards, as nothing really came from it. It's been a long, long time now since I've last seen or spoke to him. I want to know how bad I did, if I fucked up. AITA?\n\n\nAh, another important thing is he's very non-confrontational. I tried to talk to him about how our friendship was hurting me, but he didn't hear me out fully. I ended up apologizing and never brought it up again in fear that I would hurt him.",

I told him the truth to which he followed up with the obvious question as to why he wasn't invited. I told him the reason that I didn't invite him was because I didn't want him in my space. He then said he understood but a the end of the evening he then made a comment stating that I was one of those people who put up barriers to prevent myself from falling in love because I'm afraid of commitment - which I thought was fucking rude but I made no response. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to say I chose Kermit because he has seniority but it was mostly because I'm fine with him in my space. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Tonight we were invited to go to a friend's house and my SO mentioned they didn't really want to go for very long. I had to leave early anyways, so I'd be their getaway. They mentioned that they'd rather stay at home in the first place.\n\nWhen we were at the friend's house, we had a really good time, and I felt bad about having to leave. I started get up and say it was time to go. My SO started to get up as well, but without thinking and in front of friends I asked the SO, 'unless you want to stay and I can pick you up later?' and immediately knew I shouldn't have said it because I put them in a position to make the decision in front of friends. However, my SO without hesitation said, 'yeah, that works.' We kind of figured out how they would get home, and then right before I left, when I was saying goodbye to my SO privately, SO was like, 'what the heck? why did you do that?? You knew I wanted to leave!' and now they're angry at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel really bad, and I know I shouldn't have offered the opportunity to stay, but I kind of thought since they were having fun they started to change their mind. I also felt like they could just say, 'no, I'll just go with you,' and it's not my fault they felt the need to be polite..if that makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I am the asshole, thanks. At the least, I was an asshole innocently, and at the most I was being very cruel. I've since apologized to my SO because I felt bad and knew it was wrong in the first place, but I appreciate the varied responses and advice. Thanks!",

You can usually hear people talking out in the hall, but it’s usually not exceedingly loud. The problem is one family has a couple of kids, and since the apartments aren’t very big they send them out to the hallway to play.  \n\nI’m not exaggerating when I say there’s no place I can go in my apartment and not hear screaming. It’s so bad that I now have to wear headphones when watching tv or playing games because I can’t hear anything.   What pisses me off just as much is that they treat the hallway like a toy room. When I leave my apartment I’m stepping over a mine field of toys, shoes, and backpacks.   Management doesn’t seem interested in doing anything about it, as when I call them about it they just say they’ll talk to them “tomorrow”.   I can’t just talk to the parents because they don’t speak English, but it’s obvious that management is just letting it happen because they let their kids do this every single day. \n\nI’m now considering calls the cops.

No big deal, I go back to sleep. He comes in the room at 2:30, wakes me up  and tells me he brought his friend over and are gonna smoke and hang out in the living room. I got a little upset because of the weed (I use it to sleep and for my anxiety and had very little left) but I knew he'd go get more tomorrow so I let it go. But what really made me mad was that he KNOWS I had to wake up at 4 am to go to work, the walls are super him and I could hear every word they were saying. I called him in and asked him to keep it down cause I was having trouble falling back asleep. Nothing changes, I can still hear everything. So, I get up and angrily open the closet door, threw some blankets and a pillow in there since it's really quiet. Then I slammed the door ( I know I shouldn't have done that but I was just so angry at how inconsiderate he was being. He comes in the room cause he hears the door being slammed and asks if I was okay. I tell him how I'm feeling and at this point I'm very angry. I tell him it's 3 in the morning and his friend needs to leave. He replies with \"okay just have some patience\" \nHis friend leaves, and he just falls asleep in the living room (which he does when he's upset) \nNow I'm at work and won't be able to talk to him until tonight when he's off work. \nSo guys, am I the asshole here? \n",

      "description": "Hi Reddit! I’m hoping you can help me with an ongoing debate I have with my brother and father. One of my guy friends who I hang out with a few times a year admitted that he liked me a year ago. I told him that I think he’s an awesome guy, but I only see him as a friend and that I am not interested in anything more. I also said that I understand if he no longer wants to be friends with me but he said he didn’t want to lose me as a friend and that he will get over it. \n\nThe issue is that when I hang out with this guy it’s still obvious he likes me. When I was home visiting my family for Christmas this issue somehow came up in conversation and my dad and brother said I should cut this friend off to spare his feelings. They said even tho I shut him down he will continue to try to change my mind “because that’s just how guys are”. I said it was unfair because I made my feelings very clear and that if he was still choosing to pursue me he wasn’t respecting my decision and that is not my fault. My brother and dad said that it is my fault because I know his feelings and am still choosing to give him hope by keeping him as a friend and that I should be the bigger person and end the friendship. \n\nI guess this struck a nerve with me because I’ve been verbally and physically harassed by men (cat called, groped in bars more times than I can count, hit back when I finally hit the old guy who came up to me and started to grope me), and I’m sick and tired for having to control my actions because “that’s just how guys are”. Obviously those are much more extreme cases but I guess those experiences have influenced my mindset when it comes to this point and makes me more angry and stubborn and perhaps I cannot see the issue clearly. It even angers me that my dad and brother are saying my guy friend will say he’s ok and wants nothing more and it that it’s only natural he will continue to try to win me over. I think that’s deceptive and that if he is doing that then he is only to blame for any pain caused because he is the one who is lying to me and choosing not to respect my decision. I would understand if he was honest with me and said he had to cut me out because I have had another male friend do this in the past and have respected his decision. But then again I’ve also had unreturned feelings for people and so understand it can be heartbreaking. I guess where my issue lies is that the blame is on me to end the friendship because “that’s just how guys are”.\n\nSo I’d really love your input Reddit. AITA?\n\nTLDR: guy friend told me that he likes me. I told him I wasn’t interested and only like him as a friend and understood if he didn’t want to be friends. He said he could handle it and didn’t want to lose the friendship. It’s obvious he still likes me. AITA for remaining friends with him?",

      "description": "My mom and I have never really had an amazing relationship. Growing up she would only buy junk food and soda so she didn’t have to cook in the evening and then tell me I was getting fat and balding. I was 14 and didn’t have any options other than getting fat off junk food. She received child support from my dad until I was 18 and refused to buy me clothes after I grew and even refused to pay class fees in high school and told me to get a job to pay the fees. \n\nI don’t think she’s outright malicious towards me, she still made me breakfast pretty often and tried to care most of the time but I think she just lost interest in being a parent. The only time I remember her telling me she loved me in my adolescence was one time when she was drunk. I think she really tried but just couldn’t get it right, which ironic since she’s a children’s therapist. \n\nTo get to the point, I live with my dad and have since I was 18. I’m 23 now and see my mom once every month or two despite living a short walk away. Some of my friends said I was an asshole for not hanging out with my mom, especially since she texts and calls me all the time and I usually don’t answer or wait a day or two to do so. I admitted to them that I think she’s really lonely and doesn’t have many friends and that’s why she’s reaching out all the time and they told me it’s fucked up that I know that and don’t make an effort to see her. \n\nI just don’t have anything to say to her. It’s not fun being around her. She guilt trips me for not seeing her more every time I do go over. And all I can think about while I’m with her is how jealous I am of people who have a loving relationship with their moms. It makes me really sad. I wish I could be there to help her, she’s still my mom and i love her. But I just can’t do it that often. \n\nAre my friends right? AITA? ",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to go to a wedding with my GF?",
      "description": "So I’m incredibly conflicted about this, and created an account for my first actual reddit post ever just to get some clarity from you all.\n\n I’m a 28 year old male, and have been dating my current GF(25F) for about a year now. Before she and I met, a close group of friends and myself have been trying to plan a cabin ski trip together. One of those things that we’ve been talking about doing for about two years, but just couldn’t ever find a date that works for everyone. It’s been kind’ve an ongoing conversation for us, and we FINALLY decided to book a cabin for this February.\n\nA few weeks ago, my GF tells me that she just got the official invite for a wedding that she is a bridesmaid in. Turns out, she was invited with a plus one, which she didn’t initially expect. Do I want to go? Of course I do! Except, as we talk about it more, we piece together that it is the same weekend that my friends and I have already booked the cabin for our trip. It’s too late to change the dates, but I would only be out about $100 for my share of the cost if I bail. My friends would be bummed, but there’s about 13 people going on the trip so the group dynamic doesn’t really change that much with or without me.\n\nSince I know this would mean a lot to the GF, my first instinct is that I want to go to the wedding with her. I agree to bail on the trip. My friends and I all live in the same city, so even though our busy lives are making it harder to stay close, it’s not like we don’t ever get the opportunity to see eachother.\n\nAs a couple days go by though, I start to realize how much I wanted to go on this trip. We had been planning it for so long, and I was really looking forward to it. On top of that, I learn a few things about the wedding: 1) The only person she knows at this wedding is the bride (a former sorority sister of hers). Even though they were close in college, they’ve grown a bit apart and no longer have any close mutual friends. I was initially under the impression that this would be my first opportunity to be introduced to most of her long time friends which is part of why I wanted to go. 2) She is a bridesmaid in the wedding. Which means that for most of the weekend, she will have bridesmaid responsibilities to attend to. Makeup, pictures, rehearsal, etc.....So I would barely even be with her all weekend. The wedding has one of those head tables for the bridal party, so on the day of the wedding I literally wouldn’t be with her all day until after dinner at the reception (side note....i hate this concept any time I’m a groomsman #freedomforbridalparties). 3) SHE DOES NOT EVEN WANT TO GO TO THE WEDDING. She’s been dreading it apparently. Been going through some things in her personal life, was in a car accident and is experiencing some lingering (but manageable) pain, and apparently feels like she and the bride aren’t even friends anymore. Physically, and emotionally, she just doesn’t want to travel and dedicate a whole weekend to this wedding. But she agreed to be a bridesmaid a year ago, so she is powering through it, and thinks having me there will make it so much better (again, she won’t even have me with her for about 2/3 of the day)\n\nSo a couple days after agreeing, I asked her if she had RSVP’d us yet. She hadn’t. I explained that I was having second thoughts and asked how she felt about me going on my friend trip instead. She was not very pleased. Told me she felt like I was abandoning her, and that she is hurt that I don’t want to be there for her. It will also apparently make it even worse for her at the wedding knowing that I’m with friends having fun while she’s miserable. Gives me the old, “if you feel like your trip is more important, then I guess there’s nothing I can do” or something along those lines. I don’t have much patience for passive aggression, or thinly veiled guilt trips, so I told her that I’m not going to the wedding.\n\nAfter a couple weeks, she just finally let it go, after giving herself a major pat on the back for being “so understanding”. And making sure I knew that “she has every right to be a lot more pissed off than she is”. I still feel like I am in the right here, but I need some help.....AITA?",

They also offer (alcohol-free) drinks and food.\n\nAnyway I went there and the bartender (probably the owner idk) started explaining to me how the whole system works, since it's different in every gaming cafe. So he tells me what the normal hourly fee is, what deals they have if you stay more than three hours, etc. At some point he stops mid sentence and asks \"you've had alcohol right?\"in a completely different tone. I reply that I indeed had a couple beers before coming. He explains that this is advised against because they've had incidents before.\n\nAfter that he stops explaining and being friendly, and just tells me \"it'll be [price] please\". Uncomfortable, I tell him that I would rather leave - even though he says it's fine.\n\nFrom my point of view, I just found it a bit rude to make such a remark in the way he made it. I mean, when you're selling something you try to be gentle with your customers, no? I was not aware of that rule before coming. \n\nAm I an easily offended asshole who made a bartender waste 5 minutes of his time or is it fine by you? I realize I didn't sign a contract or anything but he was ready to seat me at a computer and offer me food etc.\n\nThanks to the 5 or so people reading this. Please do leave your judgement in the comments. I'm not trying to get people to tell me it's okay, I want to know if I have to apologize if I go back ",

Let’s see what reddit thinks. \n\nSo this past Tuesday I went to the grocery store to get a few things-I was skipping work the next day, so I just wanted to get a few things so I wouldn’t have to go out the next day I get to to grocery store and there is an empty spot right up front, NEXT to the handicap spot. So I park. As I’m headed out, this guy in a big van pulls up besides me and tells me to move my car and go park somewhere else. Claiming he needs it. \n\nThis has never happened to me before and I didn’t know how to react, so I just kept walking and ignored the man. In hindsight, I maybe should have been able to tell this guys van had a lift for his wheelchair. \n\nAnyway, I’m inside getting ready to pay, and van dude, now in a wheelchair, confronts me and calls me a heartless asshole for not giving him my spot. \n\nI was kind of annoyed by this and told him to fuck off and walked away from him to pay. \n\nAm I the asshole for not giving up my spot? I still don’t think I am\n\n",

      "description": "So two weeks pre-Valentine's Day, a friend of my and my gf is selling home-made strawberry chocolates and attached is a custom message, ready for pick on V-day. I don't usually celebrate much on V-Day but this year I decided the heck, I'll buy some chocolates for gf and help a friend with the side hustle. So I buy some under one condition - gf has to pick up the chocolates because I am a few hours away and both friend and gf live in the same city. Condition is agreed on. This is where it gets weird...  \n\n\nFriend asks me what I want on the message. Me being the person I am who doesn't really show much emotion (I am a firm believer that actions speak louder than words) tell friend \"idk lol something nice plz\". Now, when I bought the chocolates for gf, I did not buy them for the message part, I did not at all care for the message. Gf loves chocolates so I thought it would be something simple and nice and literally sweet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward to Valentine's Day. Gf picks up the chocolates while I'm at work, unaware of when it was picked up. I have no clue at all what the message says. Gf texts me \"I love the chocolates and the message!\". Ok now I kinda know I'm fucked... so I ask her \"what does the message say?\" She says \"hrmm ok did you really write this?\" I didn't answer (this is where I probably fucked up, I shoulda told her here that it wasn't me?). I didn't say anything back. She then posts the chocolates and the message on social media and it gets some likes and quick attention. Friend says in private msg, \"Hey your gf really liked the message... I was going to tell her you didn't write it but she liked it so much...\". In other words, friend let my gf run off with chocolates thinking I said the words... THEN friend later tells gf that I didn't write the words after seeing gf posted the chocolates and message on social media.  \n\n\nGf texts me again but this time saying she's balling her eyes out right now because I didn't write that and that she's embarrassed she posted it on social media... and then it goes on to alot of one-sided arguments from us both... Not the outcome I was expecting at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo.. Am I the asshole for trying something different this year and buying her chocolates, but telling friend to just write something nice??? I genuinely just wanted gf to have the strawberry chocolates because she loves chocolates and I was not at all concerned about the message, as I did not know friend was going to write something way extreme. I suppose I can be the asshole for not telling her that I didn't write it. But seriously I did not think it was such a serious matter... I just wanted her to have some awesome sweets for V-day...   \n\n\nTL;DR: Helped a friend's side hustle by buying custom strawberry chocolates with custom message. Told friend to just write something nice. Gf picked up the chosolates, LOVED the message, but later found out I didn't write it, then cried all night and we argued all night. All the while, friend w/ side hustle was gonna tell gf I didn't write it, but decided not to tell her and I was at work while this all happened unaware of the pickup and reaction.",

I was using a iPhone 6 with a really nice charging case and I wasn't too fond of it, but it really wasn't that bad, I could keep it charged all day with the charging case to make up for shitty apple battery life, and I used it for listening to music via headphones and using reddit/discord/youtube. The new phone, the iPhone XR has no 3.5mm jack for my music, it has no home button so closing background apps becomes very annoying, and because my mom got it in a deal swapping from Boost to Sprint, she said I have to pay the extra $15 a month to keep it, and I asked my mother since she got an S9 for me to go to the sprint place and swap out the XR for an S9 so I could listen to music and keep doing what I was doing without going out of my way to buy $200 Airpods. I tried to hide the fact that I was unpleased with my new phone but when one of my friends started to rant about how shitty apple is it put me over the edge and I asked my mother about it this morning, trying to not hurt her feelings, and after I told my sister I didn't care about face emojis and shit she snapped and me, I am now currently locked on my room by my own accord typing on reddit, so Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "Long story, sorry:\n\nMy birthmother was never my legal guardian. She gave birth to me and I was immediately put into foster care (but thankfully I have only lived with one family). My adoptive parents (aka \"parents\") have raised me since then, and I had only met my birthmother a couple of times, last when I was 3. I'm presently 25. Whenever my birthmother was brought up, it was revealed that she had been doing drugs when she was pregnant and the state or county or whatever made her give us up. It was also revealed that she had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and was mentally unfit to be a good mother. Since having been told that, my sibling and I have never really had any interest in meeting her.\n\nEventually, about 5 years ago, our birthmother (I'm getting lazy, so she's hereby referred to as \"BM\") reached out to us. My sibling wanted nothing to do with her. BM messaged them and they'd claim that she was writing tons of BS and they just told her to stop messaging her. I hadn't seen the messages she sent me, but eventually came across them. I'm more sympathetic than my sibling, and while I've always said as an argument for seeing her that \"if I were in her shoes, then I'd want my child to reach out to me. Because I'd want that, then by not doing that myself is an example of hypocrisy\", and I abhor hypocrisy. Despite saying that, I just feel uncomfortable in talking to her. I already have a family with its own issues, and I do not think that I could deal with having another \"mother\" here, as I'd surely feel obligated to continue talking to her with some frequency despite not wanting to, I just don't care to force a connection or anything. However, I read her messages and wouldn't bother responding, until...\n\nIt turns out that I can become an Italian citizen through my BM's father. I had done the research and had asked the appropriate officials, and they didn't say no, but said that they'd have to review the documents. I can't find too many reasons for why they'd say no, but this is something that I really want. Upon reading that, I had started responding to her.\n\nIn talking to her, I had found out that she had been sexually assaulted (probably multiple times) by her father as a child, and I wonder if that could've contributed to her having developmental issues (something I forgot to mention earlier, but I also don't know psychology), and also the drug abuse that caused my sibling and I to resent her all of these years.\n\nBM is still \"off\" in the head. It's really hard to describe, but her writing style is very off and off-putting. This goes along with the developmental issues of \"having the mental capacity of a 12yo\".\n\nAt this point, I again feel a bit sorry for her, but I still don't want anything to do with her and that's a bit of a different \"AITA\" question in its own right.\n\nAnyway, I had been messaging her for a bit to work up asking her if she'd help me. Eventually I outright told her that I pretty much just want to have Italian citizenship through her father, and that I don't want to promise a future relationship with her. Here, I don't really say no (as I don't like speaking in terms of certainty, and I also want to try to secure the documents), but I also don't really say yes. At least, I think I said it like that. It has honestly been a while since I had last looked at the conversation. She responded saying that she wants to help me and has said that she will help me get the documents.\n\nYet.. things just seem off. I feel like she doesn't fully grasp that I don't really want to talk to her. I feel like she just doesn't fully grasp much. She guessed who I was by messaging various Facebook accounts with my name, and then when she finally reached one of my accounts (this one had no photo of me), and eventually knew it was me by my responding and acknowledging it, she readily gave out her SSN and has since been forwarding so many \"forward if you want good things to happen\", and just a terrible writing style with so many mistakes, and gaps in reasoning, and whatnot. I'm worried that I cannot fully convince her that I just want the documentation to be an Italian citizen and that's it.\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry for the rant. I'm planning on messaging her at some point and eventually meeting up with her, and saying that I do not want a continued relationship. I only want the desired documents. If she isn't fully on board, then I'd offer some money in exchange for the documents, even though she had earlier said that she'd be willing.\n\nI feel like this is mostly an asshole thing to do, and is why I haven't done anything for the past ~3.5 years, but I have some people saying I wouldn't be an asshole because \"it's not hypocritical, as any parent would want to help their child out\" or \"you don't know that she's that mentally unwell\", yet I feel like the former counterpoint doesn't actually address the matter of hypocrisy, and the latter... idk. It's pretty damn convincing.\n\nAnyway, WIBTA?\n\n**tl;dr:** Separated at birth from birthmother (BM). I have had no desire to speak with her for the first 22 years of my life. ~3 years ago I realized that she could help me to become an Italian citizen, so I started responding to her messages. That is legitimately the only reason why I want to talk to her. I feel uncomfortable in talking to her otherwise, yet I feel obligated to. Partially because of this, I don't respond too often. I had mentioned that I only want to talk to her to get some documents, but I'm not sure that she has fully understood it despite having said that she'll help me, due to clues in our previous conversations supporting the claim that she is mentally unwell. I'm debating on offering her money for the documents and then not speaking to her after such an exchange. WIBTA?",

I turned around and explained I wasn’t hugging him, not due to him being autistic as I have an autistic brother, but because I don’t hug people I don’t know. \n\nHe then looked really confused and then just walked away mumbling something about how I was dressed slutty.\n\nOne of the vendors saw the whole thing and said I should have just hugged him, and another vendor who saw everything asked me if I was okay and wanted to sit down for a minute.\nI feel like an asshole and still feel really guilty about the way I acted or behaved, but my friends and my partner think I’ve done nothing wrong and he was kinda creepy.\n\nSo I’m asking you reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Backstory - Currently on Tindr, I (27F) matched with this handsome 29M. We talk for a few days on the app, switch to texting, and make plans to meet. \n\nIn one of our conversations, we're joking around about potential deal breakers in relationships. He reveals that he's straight edge. I'm pretty open-minded so I ask him about what that means and how he feels about being with someone who smokes weed &amp; drinks pretty regularly. \n\nI told him that I smoke weed anywhere between 2-4x a week and asked him how he'd feel about that. He said he'd just hang out in another room or watch a movie while I'm high. I felt really sad about that because it's not like I turn into a monster or something embarrassing when I get high. I just laugh a lot and want to hug. \n\nSo. I told him after a long discussion about what it means to be \"fully present\" with someone that I don't think we're compatible. He tried to convince me to meet anyway but I know myself well enough to know that i'd like to smoke &amp; cuddle with my partner. \n\nI feel like an asshole though for turning someone away who just leads a very healthy life.

      "description": "I work in an office with a group of nine women.  Our office dress code is very casual with only a few restrictions because we don’t work directly with the public.  However, there is one lady I’ll call “Mary”.  Mary has been working in the office for 25+ years and is used to the more formal dress code that was enforced for a number of years before the casual dress code became the norm.\n\nMary is a very nice lady, although, sometimes she seems clueless (in more areas than one).  She often stays in her own corner and out of the office chatter.   (I tend to be a loner at times too, as the work can be consuming.)  The only exception to her self-imposed isolation most days is the fact that she has to leave her cubicle to retrieve items she has printed multiple times a day, as the office shares a network of printers, and also to use the restroom, etc.\n\nThat’s all well and good, however, recently she began wearing one certain pair of heels that are NOTICEABLY louder than any of the other shoes she wears.  It’s almost as though they don’t fit her correctly.  It sounds like a goddamned Clydesdale horse is clip-clopping around our office, IMO.  \n\nFor a long time I thought I was the only one annoyed by this until I casually mentioned my annoyance to another coworker of mine.  She adamantly agreed that it is aggravating af.  Now, with Mary absorbed in her work and wearing earplugs 99% of the time (ironically because we are “too loud”) she was oblivious to this discussion.  Others overheard and chimed in.  The remaining eight of us (Mary excluded) are divided exactly down the middle with half of us being annoyed and half of us not caring.  \n\nI wear earplugs.  I try tuning it out.  I cannot, for the life of me, get past the complete and utter rage I feel when I hear her clomping around the office.  So tell me, am I (or, should I say, are we collectively) the asshole?",

      "description": "So a lot of people are probably going to knee-jerk react based on the title and say YTA but please hear me out!\n\nThree weeks ago I was hanging out at a friend’s house with my friend (HS) and his wife (LA). Both are longtime friends of mine. We were just hanging out, playing video games all that good stuff and we got on the topic of why I don’t currently have a girlfriend. When I was in my 20’s I had a two long term relationships, and after they ended I decided to take a break from being in a relationship (for my own sanity and because I didn’t want to hurt anyone else). I’m in my early 30’s now and still single, although I’ve done some dating but nothing serious.\n \nAnyways, this seems to bother my friends that I have little interest in a relationship (I’m always being told that that I should get a girlfriend). They both know my reasons/history for not getting back into the dating game but they are determined to “help me” find someone, always trying to introduce me to friends of theirs ect, ect. \n\nSo when HS, LA and I were hanging out and talking about this, they asked me if next time we got together they invited a friend of theirs over to hang out with us, with the primary goal of introducing us. Let’s call her TP. I say sure why not, I figure it’s been a long time and I feel emotionally ready/stable to have a serious relationship again. I tell them sure I’ll meet her.\n\nFast forward to last weekend, same scenario – hanging out chillin’ playing games except their friend TP is there. She’s nice enough, kinda loud but also really funny and we have some stuff in common. Pretty cool hanging out with her, no problems with her at all.\n\nSo as the hangout wraps up, TP says her goodbyes and leaves, I stay a little while longer to chat with HS and LA. They ask me what I thought…I said she was pretty cool but I’m not really interested in pursuing a romantic relationship/dating.. HS doesn’t push the issue (he already knows why) but LA won’t stop asking me why saying we seemed to hit it off… I was being evasive because I knew where this was going and I didn’t want to upset anyone but she was relentless in asking why and eventually said “is it because TP is fat?” (her words not mine). And I finally relent and say yes, that I think she’s a good person and seems nice but I can’t enter a relationship with someone that I’m not physically attracted to. It just wouldn’t end well and would be really unfair to both of us.\n\nLA loses her shit and starts calling me a huge asshole/shallow and all that. Am I? I genuinely feel bad about this whole situation but I’m also going to stick to my guns on this one… being physically intimate in a relationship is important to me and if I’m not attracted to her how is it fair to both of us for me to lie about it?\n\nAITA?\n",

Whenever he attempts to talk normally to someone, it would usually end up with him offending someone. He also has many other eccentric behaviours like talking to himself during lessons and enjoys showing off his knowledge in front of the class. This results in him having no friends as nobody is willing to deal with his insults or his eccentric behaviour. \nHowever, since last year, he has been very clingy on my group of close friends. He has since invited himself to our table everyday during lunch and as nobody is willing to strike up a conversation with him, he spends most of his time glued to his phone. I feel extremely awkward and annoyed by him sitting around with my close group of friends as he is hindering me from having private conversations with my own friends. I have tried giving him many hints that he should just go somewhere else, but to no avail. He always trails my group and this has been going on for over a year already. He has personally insulted me and my friends quite a number of time and I really want him gone as he’s starting to become a nuisance. \nWIBTA if I asked him to screw off and sit somewhere else?\n\nTL:DR A socially awkward person who thinks that he is too intellectual to talk to others keeps sticking to me and my group of friends and I want him gone.

All units are one bedroom and every person that has rented has created a friendly environment where we are able to hold a conversation to the point where if a unit was too noisy at night you can just knock on a door. It has been amazing. This month a new couple moved in who have been the complete opposite. They leave for 12+ hours and have two dogs that carry separation anxiety causing them to bark 5am on even on the weekends. I went to them in the beginning knowing that this couple may have no idea their dogs bark when they leave but they told me they did and to \"fuck off.\" I left it alone, but now I realize this couple also carry two young children under 10 who decide to run up and down the hall yelling and stomping, egging the dogs on to make them howl. I don't feel comfortable approaching them and am now having to go to the library more just too get some quiet.

She is normally a very mean person and me and her were on 'OK' terms. \n\nThis shift I was with her and it was alright but she was being mean to me like always, and ever since I was a trainee I would be a pushoverand just say \"ok\" and take it. But at one point she said \"I expect more from trainee of the month\". This made me slightly angry because she had voted me for that acheivement, but now she was throwing it back at my face, so I replied back with \"It isn't that hard to get, you just gotta work a sh*tload of shifts\" She then started going off at me about my attitude, and I assume she was taken back by me talking back. \nLater she started talking to the manager about my attitude which I called her out for and she finally stopped. We were very quiet for basically the rest of the shift.\n\nThen when my shift was supposed to end I still had more to do, that was vital for the people closing. As I was doing it, I was still managing helping in kitchen because Joane couldn't handle it. She thought that I was purposefully taking longer to get more money, so she asked me for my code, I was very hesitant but I eventually gave it, and worked for 20mins without pay, and everyone including the manager saw it happen.\nOnce I had finished my shift I went to change and I saw Joan not working but instead with a drink at the back (there were other people in kitchen at this point).\n\nAfter changing I apologised to Joane because I genuinely felt bad, I didn't realise I had upset her so much, just for talking back once. \n\nAITA? I feel really bad about it. I guess I should've treated my Superior with authority? But then again she doesn't treat any other crew members with that attitude.",

      "description": "So I’m getting married in a year, and for the most part, the planning has been pretty non-contentious. My fiancé and I have very similar visions for what we want the wedding to look like, and for the most part I’m just letting her pick what she wants to do. However, since the start of the wedding planning, she’s been very firm on having a no kid wedding. I’m not sure where she got the idea, but since she started planning she keeps talking about it. I thought the idea was interesting, but it’s not feasible. She comes from a very small family, maybe 10 total, and I come from a massive family, probably 80 cousins and uncles and stuff total, and a lot of them are still in the 7-10 range, and quite a few under 7. She hasn’t met most of them, but I have, and they’re all decently well behaved. Not statues, but not running around with juice box stains on their face destroying the house. Just regular nice kids, with the exception of the 3-4 actual babies, which are babies so I can’t vouch for their behavior.\n\nI’ve held firm on my position of saying we can’t say no kids, because everyone in my family either has kids or have kids who have kids. My sister for instance, just had twins about a year ago, and one of them is my godson (hers too, kind of, they were born before we got engaged). I kept saying not to worry about it, if people don’t want to bring their kids they’ll just leave them with a babysitter, and if they do bring their kids, it’s not like they’ll stay until midnight drinking. Keep in mind, these are all my cousins, not just people I know. None of my non-family friends have kids. \n\nAnyway, after months of trying to be nonchalant about it, I put my foot down and said we’re not having a no kid wedding. It’s the only thing I requested for the wedding apart from my groomsmen and the after party. She acquiesces, but then recently, I’m at dinner with her mother and her sisters, and the topic somehow comes up. Her mom is going off on all these crazy tangents about how the kids could get burned or hurt in some way, or they’d get electrocuted or they are having a fussy day they’ll throw fits, all kinds of things. I was trying to be understanding, like I said, it’s a smaller family. My fiancé only has one cousin, who’s around 10, and then her two sisters. But all four of them were ganging up on me. Her mother was still going on about how she’d be legally liable for hospital bills if a kid gets hurt (which I can’t imagine a scenario where that would be true) and there’s going to be a firewall and the church has animals, or if a kid gets hurt then the wedding has to come to a halt. The whole thing came off as very condescending, and the conversation seemed to turn from “It would be difficult to have fun at a wedding with kids running around,” to “well I’m paying XX thousand dollars and if you were paying for the wedding then you wouldn’t want kids there either” kind of thing. \n\nAt this point my fiancé was backing me up against her mother, but I shut the whole thing down and said we’re not banning kids from the wedding. I didn’t say the wedding was off if no kids, or anything like that, I just told her mother and her sisters the same thing I’d been saying since the start: I have a lot of young cousins, and we’re not going to alienate my family members by having a no kid wedding. Her mother and her sisters seemed to give in, but they were not happy, and the whole dinner was super awkward, and ever since then my fiancé’s mom has been a little chilly about wedding planning. \n\nI don’t think I was being an asshole here, but I wanted some outside input to see what other people thought.

      "description": "I’m going to try to keep this as unbiased as possible, as it is a huge decision to make and there are a lot of factors involved.\n\nIn the Summer of 2017 I proposed to my now fiancé. Shortly after, and before we could set a definite day for the wedding, we found out that we were expecting. \n\nImmediately we decided to prioritize becoming homeowners over the wedding. Thankfully I have a high paying job in a low cost area. Unfortunately my spending/saving habits were not a commitment of mine previously so we did not have the required deposit for a home. \n\nWith all options considered, we decided the optimal choice was to move back in with my parents for a year. This would allow us to buy all of the necessities for a newborn as well as potentially save enough for 10% down on our future home.\n\nMy parents were very accepting and helpful and offered us their basement. (It may be important to point out that my father makes a significant income and their house is very spacious). \nGrateful, we moved in 4 months into our pregnancy and began saving immediately. \n\nNow, I have a sister that is three years older than me and is married, with 4 kids. Naturally, she needs help with childcare and spends much of her time at my parents’ house (she had twin toddlers and two school age children at this time). It’s important to note that my sister is a very opinionated person. It is not uncommon for her verbally assault my parents. Unfortunately, my parents handle this by never opposing her.\n\n\nUp until this point I had always maintained a good relationship with my sister. She was very encouraging of us to becoming pregnant even before my SO became pregnant. \n\nA few months prior to our due date my sister began to display a more controlling attitude and began to demand that we buy certain car seat. Me, not being an expert when it comes to car seats, agreed that safety was an obvious priority. I told her that I would consider her recommendation. \n\nDespite her wanting us to buy a specific car seat, I decided to do some research and stumbled upon a high quality car seat that was gently used. The owner seemed very credible and stated that she had only used it for 5 months due to her child outgrowing it (bucket seat styled Eddie Bauer car seat). No accidents, very stable, and without any wear or recalls. Expiry set for 2024.\n\nUpon discovering our purchase, my sister flipped out. Screaming at us that we were going to kill our unborn child. To make matters worse, she made a very detailed post on our community Facebook page bashing our decisions and denouncing us as parents. We did receive support from strangers but decided to avoid the post. (We did eventually end up buying a new Graco car seat that can adjust to our babies size up until school age)\n\n\nA month before our due date my SO had her baby shower. It was a great turn out and everything went as planned. My sister decided not to come. That night we noticed that all of the cake and treats were missing. My sister had stopped by and taken them to her house. We didn’t bother with trying to get it back, but it was obviously annoying. \n\nIn April 2018 our son was born healthy and I experienced the best day of my life! Even having the opportunity to catch my son on the way out. \nWe decided that our son needed his aunt in his life and she visited him in the hospital.\n\nMy sister is also an advocate for breastfeeding. My SO was very excited to try and although she experienced a tough first couple weeks, she soon became very comfortable.\nMy sister was very helpful with the process and this actually strengthened our relationship. \n\nSkip to mid-June, my sister decides that she agrees with the anti vax movement.\nAt this point my nephews, her two toddlers, are spending every day at my parents house. All 4 of my sisters children become sick, the toddlers significantly more so with respiratory infections. \n\nThinking of our 3MO newborn sons fragile health (only having T cell immune system and antibodies from breast milk) we courteously asked for my sister to keep her kids away from him until there infections had passed. Do not mistake this for asking her to not come to the house, but alternatively, just to keep them physically away from him and clean surfaces etc..\n\nMy sister decided to take offence to this and blew up at my SO, screaming that she was not a member of the family and that she could not tell her to stay away from her parents’ house. My sister then went outside and made claims to my family members that my SO was telling her to leave. My SO came downstairs hysterical and crying. I had been catching an hour sleep prior to a night shift. Irate, I ventured upstairs and began trying to sort through the miscommunication. \n\nBy this point my parents had already made up their minds that we were in the wrong. Livid with the how unfairly my family was treating my SO, I began to argue and disagree with them. Essentially resulting in a 3 against 1 argument. After a few harsh words were exchanged and no momentum was being made towards resolution, I decided to leave and prepare for my shift. \n\nFollowing this, my son developed a high fever (39.0 Celsius), tightness of his airway, and a cough. With us being vigilant and keeping a close eye on his temperature and medicating him accordingly, his temperature and cough resolved approx. 1 week later. \n\nAt this point it’s safe to say that our relationship with my family was fragile. As if on point, conversation among my grandparents surfaced that they had been openly calling my son racist slurs (my SO is 1/4 native 3/4 white, my entire family is white). Equally bewildered and confused with the bigotry, we investigated and discovered that these slurs had been commonplace since his birth and that my family had decided to keep it from us to avoid confrontation. Apparently my family did oppose the use of these slurs (but did nothing???)\n\nImmediately, I contacted my grandparents to give them the chance to explain themselves, only to find out that my sister had already done so. This resulted in my grandparents giving us a quick apology over Facebook with my sister tagged in the conversation (more so to ensure a future relationship with my sisters children). I then asked for my grandparents to arrange a time/place to meet to have a proper discussion to which they declined. I also asked my sister to leave the conversation so that it could remain private, she refused. \n\nWith no true effort to explain themselves or meet with us, we cut our relationship off with my grandparents.\n\nThe last piece of information I need to provide for you to establish an understanding of our situation involves my parents. \n\nIn 2018 (around when we moved in) it became apparent that my mother had cheated on my father with another man (a man that she met in church no less during a mission trip). \nMy father decided to move into a rented duplex. The idea was that this would give him time to digest the information and come to a decision whether to stay in the relationship or not (my mother was regretful despite the affair lasting a number of years). \n\nEssentially, their marriage is confusing and I would have to create a new post to give you the entire story... but, to spare you the details, my father decided to forgive my mother and move back into the house. Albeit, with a great deal of passive aggressiveness and no true forgiveness. \n\nIt then became apparent that my father had cheated on my mother with a coworker, as well as sleep with a number of escorts on his business trips and that this had been going on for a very long time (why did i even need to know this?? 🤢) \n\nIn the fall of 2018 things spiralled out of control and came to a climax after they returned from a neighbours party. They came home fighting and screaming. Hearing the altercation, I ran upstairs and separated the two of them. After things had settled I made my way back downstairs only to hear further altercation, then a guttural scream and my mother repeatedly stating “he broke my wrist”. Being trained to deal with injuries such as this I separated the two of them, assessed the injury, noticed that my mothers wrist was indeed broken, and splinted it. My father had pushed her to the ground causing the break. I spent the night with my mother in the hospital until she came home with a cast.\n\nMy sister and I packed up necessities for my father and told him that he needed to stay elsewhere for the time being. \n\nThis was close to Christmas 2018. Incredibly, my mother decided to “let things go for Christmas” and acted like nothing was wrong. My father moved back in. I also have a 13 y/o sister and this had traumatized her as she had witnessed the altercation the night of the injury. I felt that they were setting a poor example for her and confusing her. My parents saw no issue with this.\n\nShortly after, the verbal fights started once again and my SO and I decided it was beyond time to move. We began to meet with financial advisors and look at the surrounding real estate market. \n\nIt is important to note that at this time, our relationship with my immediate family is practically non existent. Something that I did not mention is how our sons sleep schedule has been a complete mess. My sister brings her kids over every night and keeps then here past his bed time. This wouldn’t be a problem if we didn’t live in the basement, below the living room where they run around with no supervision and no effort on my sisters part is made to stop the noise.. this has been going on since our sons birth.\n\nThis came to a climax one night with my dad babysitting all 4 kids. I had previously asked him to move the kids upstairs to the second floor after our sons bedtime. My father did not respect this and allowed for the kids to continue to stay above our room with the kids. \n\nIrate, I went upstairs and told the kids to go ",

      "description": "Just some context : I'm in high school now was put into a new class at the start of the year. I made friends with this edgy guy(friend) I thought was cool. We became closer and closer and eventually I found out he was depressed due to having been bullied and ostracized by his former classmates. I stuck by his side and tried to comfort him when he was feeling down for the next 3 months. At this time he began to trust me. \n\nThere's this girl in my class who was objectively attractive. Now my friend was humorous and one day that girl admitted to having a crush on him. He texted me that as we were close friends. At that time I felt happy for him, even though I was trying to cheer him up daily it didn't really help. I thought maybe a gf would make his depression better. He was unsure about his emotions towards her though. We talked daily and discussed about her and how he should go about her liking him.\n\n After around 2 weeks he realised he liked her back, and they got together. They had a good relationship for the next 2 months. As I got to bond with my class more I became friends with his gf too. However, one day she texted me that she was losing feelings towards him due to the relationship becoming one-sided and he did not care much bout her feelings but she was expected to help his depression everyday and she felt tired and overwhelmed.\n\nI didn't tell him that she texted me that because I didn't want to betray her trust. We started texting about her predicament. She wanted to end things but minimize the damage to his feelings. As we texted and talked more I began to feel attracted to her. However I didn't want to complicate matters so I didn't admit that yet.\n\nShe ended up breaking this off with him but it left him hating her(really really really long story). With their break up, his depression amplified ten fold. He would send multiple depressive texts to me daily and I tried my best to comfort him but I began to understand what she meant by feeling overwhelmed by his depression and how even out friendship became one sided. He was on a downward spiral. At this point I had multiple classmates tell me about how he was attention seeking and basically just screamed \"I have depression\" at everyone. For that reason and more(even more long stories)I broke off out friendship(I did it in an asshole way and left him hating me too). \n\nHis ex and I became closer and closer friends and one day I manned up and confessed to her. She had feelings towards me too. We started dating(not publicly).\n\nP.S. I know there's a lot of **long stories** that probably has an impact on the verdict but I don't have enough time to write them now. I might later if people ask for it when I get the time.  \n  \n",

      "description": "My mother-in-law was diagnosed with cancer a couple years ago, went through chemo, and is now in remission.\n\nMy husband and I only see her once a year due to the distance and their strained relationship. She and my husband talk on the phone about once a month. Typically, she will ask him how he’s doing, how I’m doing, and then she will talk about herself for the rest of the conversation. For example, on his birthday, she asked what we were doing for his birthday and then shortly after he answered, she started talking about how she’s scared the cancer is going to come back. (My husband’s birthday is around the time of her second birthday.) My husband said he preferred not to talk about that on his birthday (this was the first time they had spoken in weeks) and tried to steer the conversation in another direction. Then she started talking about someone else she knew who has cancer. He said he had to go and he’d talk to her later. \n\nA couple months ago, we invited her into town for a big celebration for my husband. We invited her, her husband, and a couple of my husband’s friends for dinner at a nice restaurant. My mother-in-law started talking to one of my husband’s friends about her cancer treatment and started playing a slideshow (complete with music) on her phone of her during treatment. My husband told her to turn it off as it wasn’t the time or place as we were in the middle of dinner. It was very loud and other people in the restaurant were starring.\n\nMost of the conversations with her seem to be focused around her cancer story, someone she knows who is sick, her final wishes, etc. Like clockwork, if there’s a lull in the conversation, she will start up about something regarding her treatment. I will politely listen but my husband will usually chime in that we should talk about something else.\n\nAre my husband and I the assholes because we don’t want to listen or talk about my mother-in-law’s cancer the few times we talk or see her every year? \n\n\n",

      "description": "Pretty simple stuff. At work, I am covered by a union. A big one, spanning every store in the company AFAIK, albeit with different branches obviously for different markets and stores.\n\nI pay around 9 dollars **a week** in union dues, and so do plenty of other people in the store, and in each store.\n\nThis comes out to over 450 dollars a year. \n\nI am covered by the union agreements whether I pay dues or not. I understand that dues are necessary to fund the union's actual goings-on, but I feel like after working here for 9 years and paying 9 dollars a week for those 9 years, maybe I should be allowed to opt out without anyone being upset about it.\n\nNobody will know- it's not information disclosed to union stewards. I do work directly with a union steward and am a little worried about him finding out, though.\n\nIf he does find out, he will get upset. New hires are also told that union dues are opt-in, \"but the union guys will be mad if you opt out\", as just a friendly warning to expect them to get a little upset with you about it. \n\nAdditionally, I have worked here this long and am still not next in line for full time. I work part time and I get inconsistent hours. I average pretty good hours but some months I hover around 20-ish hours a week, though I do make a bit over minimum wage (about 5 and a half dollars over at the time of writing). But 9 bucks a week is more than I pay for dental and optical insurance. 9 bucks a week would pay for 2/3rds of a month of rent. 9 bucks a week is more than I spend on eating out. 9 bucks a week is money I could be adding to my savings.\n\nAITA for deciding to opt out? Are people assholes for deciding not to opt in?\n\n450 dollars a year is a lot of money. ",

      "description": "We are both mixed race and both have brown skin just to clarify. I have a close group of friends we are both in. He and his best friend always make fun of each other. They use the N word with one another, they use the same kind of terms to me too. Most of the time I dislike using terms like that because it makes me uncomfortable to say. However I take no offense in them using those terms towards me or one another because I recognize it's just joking between friends.\n\nNone of us would ever use these terms outside of our friend group. \n\nWell, one night I got a bit drunk and I called said friend \"colored\". He decided to then block and mute me in our discord group and refuse to talk to me . (Not just online friends btw we've met in person several times ) this went on for months. I couldn't talk to him because he'd blocked me and I was so hurt that he'd done this that I didn't try too hard to talk either .\n\nI finally got fed up with him asking our friends to do things specifically excluding me, and talking with them like I wasn't even there. His best friend has said FAR worse to him than me who rarely even uses terms like this. \n\nI did eventually own up and apologize that I hurt his feelings, leaving out the fact that I didn't understand why they were hurt given the nature of our friend group . I gave an honest apology.\n\nI did mention how him blatantly ignoring me and refusing to talk me, making plans with friends where he knew I could see etc destroyed my trust with him.\n\nFrom his point of view I used that I was drunk as an excuse for saying the word , and that there are some words you just can't say to him and that I should know that. \n\nSoooo.

      "description": "So me and a few friends went to a semi fancy restaurant, and our waiter was pretty awful to say the least. It took him 10 minutes to even take our drink orders, and we saw him probably 4 times over the course of 2 hours. We came to the restaurant when it was daily full and were unable to leave until we were the last table because it took incredibly long to get anything from him. He had other waiters bring over our appetizers, and it took him over 10 minutes anytime we requested anything. The only time he was anything resembling quick was when we requested the check, which we made sure to do in advance because of how long it took to get everything else. I don’t have high standards, I don’t need to be fawned over, but this was fast food levels of quality service. And he wasn’t busy, he was waiting on two other tables and wasn’t spending much time with them either. When the check came I left no tip, and one of the people I was with was upset about it. My argument is that if I had been at a fast food restaurant I would have gotten faster service and left no tip for it, but she claims that we should have left something even if it wasn’t a large tip. So AITA? I don’t feel good about it, but I feel that’s part of tipping culture. Do a bad job, get a bad tip. Let me know",

I wasn't allowed to date til I was 18 and this was my first relationship so I was very naive.  Definitely neckbeard kinda guy, definitely an asshole in himself.\n\nSo one day he ask how my parents would react if they found out my bf was something or other (I don't remember), maybe going to film school?🤷. So I told him that my parents couldn't recognize him as my boyfriend when I first told them because I was only 17 and wasn't supposed to date for another year. \n\nIf I had told them even a year later, they would realize I had dated someone when I wasn't allowed.\n\nSo I guess he low-key took this to mean we weren't bf and gf, even though I told him that we were still bf and gf even though I couldn't tell my parents.\n\n\nNow the situation\n\n\nThis guy hates his dad because he's generally disapproving of anything and everything he does. \nAn overly critical and pretty controlling father,I have a similar type so I'm pretty empathetic.\nHis date tells bf that he has a girl he should date because this girl is the daughter of some business man who could give bf a job in the field he's trying to break into.\n\nI asked bf why he didn't just tell his dad that he just had a girlfriend. He gave me some b.s. answer like he wouldn't care or wouldn't approve of me if I wasn't extremely rich. (Now my dad is Dr and pretty well off and everyone in my family is in the medical field and I'm going in too, so everyone in my family is pretty well to do).\n\nThis wasn't enough, he didn't tell his dad he was seeing someone. He saw this girl and decided that he that she wasn't for him Cause She Was Into Kinky Stuff. THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON HE TOLD ME. He seemed very interested in the size of her chest. \n\nAnyways, I didn't stand up for myself because I was naive and afraid that he would end the relationship (he was kind of manipulative so he would try to give off the vibe that he might end it over nothing).\n\nLater on he told me he didn't think we were actually bf and gf because we didn't have enough \"traditional dates\" (even though every time I asked him to do something he would say \n\"we don't have to go out all the time\").\nSo I guess he didn't really think of me as his gf.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting this guy to go out with another girl even though we were only a couple months in and hadn't had a firm discussion about our relationship status?",

      "description": "For a bit of context, my sister is almost 13 and I'm 16. So, as teenage siblings, we don't want to share our stuff if we don't feel the need to. We both enjoy both traditional and digital art. I got a computer for Christmas and my sister keeps asking me to get stuff for her on it. I occasionally get her a few steam games that are $5 or less that she likes (This is out of my own bank account/steam gift card, btw).\n\nShe recently broke up with her toxic boyfriend and is now asking me for stuff more frequently. Today she wouldn't leave my room when I asked nicely, so I started to raise my voice at her to get out and she laughed it off like it was a joke. About an hour ago she came back into my room and asked if she could use her tablet to draw on my computer. As I was in the room and not doing anything on my computer I gave the ok. She couldn't figure out how to connect her tablet and went to Google (Again, I gave her permission to do this). After she still couldn't figure it out, she asked to use my drawing tablet. Now I don't like sharing my tablet because, well, it's mine and while she is careful with technology she's not great with putting my things away, so I told her no. She kept asking why not and I gave the shitty excuse of \"My cable isn't that great\". I would have just given her the truth of \"I don't want you to use my tablet\" if I hadn't done that in the past and she tells me to give her a good reason. \n\nI keep telling her no and insisting that my cable is broken, so she takes to trying to find a substitute cable, which doesn't work. She goes back to trying to figure out how to connect her tablet. She figures out that she needs to download something onto my computer in order for her tablet to work. She asks me if she can download it, and I tell her to give me a minute and I'd look at it. I was reading something on my phone and I didn't want to loose my place, so I decided to finish reading and then come take a look. When I told her this she flipped and asked, \"Why can't you look at it now?\" Again, I've told the truth in the past and she doesn't buy it as if I'm lying or something. I give her the excuse of \"I'm really busy looking up something for class right now\". She's still pissy at me. We have a fight and she eventually leaves angry. I saw she put my drawing tablet in the middle of my floor once I was done reading (which took me less than 2 minutes to finish). \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to use my tablet or download anything without me reading it first?",

My grandmother really wants us to go, but we just found out we are pregnant. A little background: This is a high risk pregnancy, and our last pregnancy ended at 20 weeks to unknown causes. I’m on a daily blood thinner and a few other medications to hopefully prevent a second loss. This vacation is planned for when I would be about 6 months pregnant, so in theory I should be able to travel, but the vacation is to Yellowstone and I’m pretty uncomfortable being away from easy doctor access. It’s also either a full 24 hour drive, or a short flight plus a 6 hour drive to our destination. \n\nI told my grandmother about the pregnancy today, and we had previously talked and I had told her we wouldn’t if I was pregnant, but she was still being pretty insistent that I come. I don’t get to see her often, she is getting up in age (and has some chronic health issues), and we are very close. WIBTA if I don’t go?",

      "description": "Ok reposing, this got removed because I didn’t format correctly, sorry!  \n\nSo I live in a different part of the country than my family.  They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I’d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents’ house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn’t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n“Really.  REALLY?!  You can’t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?”\n\n“She has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.”\n\nWhen I didn’t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like “I can’t believe how selfish people are.”  “I have to call in to work because some people can’t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don’t get fired.” “Wow.  Just wow.” “You’d think family would be there for you.”  “Must be nice not to have any responsibilities.”  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of “must be nice” type comments.  And I haven’t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond “yeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.”  I’m pretty sure they think I’m selfish anyway so I guess what’s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don’t see my family often and I don’t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody’s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn’t want to.  I didn’t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don’t even live there.  She’s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don’t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I’m in town.",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago with my then girlfriend, but this story to me always stuck out and I've wanted some perspective on this.  \n\n\nMy girlfriend was driving from Boston to New York to visit her family for the weekend. It's about a 5 hour drive, depending on the traffic.  \n\n\nAbout 1-2 hours away, in the middle of Connecticut she gets into a car accident on the highway. Thankfully nobody is hurt but her car is destroyed beyond repair. Naturally I get a phone call from her shortly after this happens, and she tells me the situation. I immediately tell her that I'll be on my way right now to come pick her up from being stranded, but she says to not worry about it because her father is already doing that.  \n\n\nAfter her family visit she comes back home and we hang out shortly after. That night she asks if she can use my car to driving to/from work and any social/networking gatherings she needs to attend to. I respond that I don't feel comfortable with that because it's under my name, and god forbid anything happens to her in the car, I'm legally liable for her actions. I tell her while I'm okay with driving her around to places when I'm able to, that I'm uncomfortable with her driving my car and can't do it currently. She immediately gets upset and tells me that I'm not a supportive boyfriend and have been unhelpful from this whole experience. I took offense to that because when she got in the accident, I was ready to drop everything I was doing to drive 3-4 hours to come help. In her eyes, that action doesn't count because she didn't need help from me \"in that way.\" She reaffirms her stance that I'm being shitty because I should let her use my car given her circumstance, despite how I feel in regards to law.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I made it clear that I wanted to sit in my room and do absolutely nothing because they’ve made the mistake of confusing “nothing” for “hey I have no expectations so just throw a small last minute get-together. \n\nI said nothing because I’ll be going back to college in a week and I know my friends are throwing me a party and I’m not really the type of person to enjoy a lot of parties. \n\nSo back to today, I wake up and repeat that I want to do absolutely nothing but alas I get called downstairs in the evening and my mom tells me to change into nicer clothes and come greet our guests as she’s invited a whole bunch of neighbors and friends. \n\nI don’t want to make a scene so I change and come downstairs but I take my mon aside and I’m like ??????  and asking her why tf she did this while also getting mad at her. Her response was basically that my sister wanted to cut a cake(she’s 9 and I just turned 20). \n\nSo I basically got really mad at my mom and I ended up crying a little because I really hate parties and social interaction with people I don’t want to spend my birthday with.

      "description": "So my now-ex broke up with me a while ago, and some of the things she listed as reasons have stuck in my head. So, am I the asshole for:\n\nWe were having sex, and she was on top. We were cuddling for a bit, and I started (lightly) drumming on her butt (lightly slapping). She said that it kinda turned her on, so I asked if she wanted it a little harder, and she said definitely yes. So for the rest of that particular session i was just about continuously spanking her while she was on top. (Asking \"more?\", \"too hard?\" Etc every now and then or whenever it seemed like it might have been too much. Immediately afterwards she was glowing a little and was kinda giggly etc. So we cuddled for a little while before going and cleaning up. \n\nThe next day she sent me a message saying \"omg my butt is super bruised maybe not so hard next time\". Ok, that's fair. \n\nLater on occasionally when we had sex I'd ask her if she wanted to be spanked, and sometimes she didn't, and that was okay, and sometimes she was excited for it (vocally), so I'd spank her (but nothing ever as intense as that first time), and try to avoid too much overlap on her butt so it didn't mark. \n\nHickeys were in a similar bag, she gave my my first few hickeys, and I tried to give her some too. She told me to avoid certain places due to not wanting it to be exposed while she was studying or working, so I kept them all under where her work clothes covered.\n\nNow after breaking up, she says she can't forgive me for hitting her and \"sending her home with bruises every weekend\". The only times I hit her were when i was spanking her, when, to the best of my knowledge she had consented, continuously and enthusiastically. After the first time, she didn't mention any bruising again, and stayed (apparently to me) enthusiastic about it right up until breaking it off.\n\nSecond thing:\n\nImmediately after the breakup she said that she was trying to work out how to reconcile our friendship, so I told her (in reasonable detail and backed up with examples) the things that she would have to change for us to be friends. Later she told me that this was me being insulting and treating her like a child. \n\n- her method of solving interpersonal problems consisted of telling someone they were terrible, then refusing to help fix or even discuss it (mutiple times with me, and screenshots)\n- when someone went to her with a problem she shut it down immediately. (Seriously, you're hurt by that? *Really?*) (multiple times with multiple people, lots of screenshots)\n- When she went to people with problems she expected them to immediately understand. If they didnt, she got mad and stopped talking to them for a bit. (Multiple people, multiple times, handful of screenshots)\n\nOf course, in line with point #2, she immediately said no you're wrong and didn't contend with any of the points or screenshots.\n\nAm I the asshole, one of two assholes, or not an asshole?",

I managed to herd them through the grocery store and was obsessively counting and recounting them but we turned a corner and I realized I was down a kid.\n\nI put the other three in the cart so I wouldn’t lose them (my original plan for the whole trip but the store employee yelled at me and said no kids could be in the cart) and go running back through the aisles and can’t find him. I immediately call 911 and alert the staff.\n\n911 keeps me on the line until the police get there. It was an insane scene, with like 5 police cars pulling up at once. They locked down the store and as soon as I stopped talking to them I called my brother.\n\nThey found my nephew immediately, he was sitting way back in the shelf, eating cereal out of one of the boxes. I was literally still on the phone with my brother when they found him.\n\nI get home and my brother lays into me for almost 2 hours. Screaming on and on about how irresponsible I am and how he should’ve never trusted me with his kids. I kept trying to leave and he blocked the door and kept screaming. He told me I’d never be a mom, how my children would be taken away by social services because I’m a fat slob who can’t properly do “what women are born to do.”\n\nI finally got out of there and will probably never baby sit his kids again.

And when I talk to him I can see his eyes glaze over after about three seconds and I know he has checked out.\n\nThis has been going on for a while now, and I finally forced him to talk about it. He told me it’s because all I ever talk about is “boring chick stuff”, like relationships, celebrities, family drama, etc I was hurt by what he said, but I have to admit those are the subjects I’m mostly interested in. I don’t think this makes me boring, but I’m determined to improve my relationship with him.\n\nSo when I get a chance during the day I try to learn about the things he likes, such as watching history documentaries or reading about sports. But to me, those things are boring and I can’t focus on them. \n\nBut I can’t just not talk to my husband, so when he gets home from work I just talk about what I want to talk about, and hope something sticks.

      "description": "Apologies if this isn’t the right place for the content of my post, and for any formatting issues, I am on mobile. This is about a video game so it’s no big deal or anything, just something that’s bugging me a little. \n\nSo this morning I had some extra time before my classes started, and since I usually spend my evenings reading I decided to start up Overwatch and play a competitive game of three. For anyone who doesn’t know, Overwatch is a FPS multiplayer, and the competitive mode in Overwatch involves two teams of six either pushing a payload or getting control of a certain point in the map.  If someone leaves the competitive mode of this game, no new players are allowed in so you’re left facing a team of six with five players. You get penalized if you leave a competitive match, you lose 50 points and you’re not allowed to play in that mode for 10 minutes. \n\nDuring my the second game, everything was going fine until one of the members of my team left the game. My team tried but there was just no winning, so everyone except for me left. I wasn’t sure of the extent of the punishment I would receive for leaving a competitive match, and since there was only about 4 minutes left I figured I would just stick around and lose this game so that I could play again immediately after the game. No malicious intent on my part at all. \n\nAt first the other team was sympathetic, but then two or three of them started complaining that I was punishing them by wasting their time because I was salty for my loss. I wanted to explain that this wasn’t the case, but then I figured that no matter what I say they will believe what they want, and there was only a minute left anyway. The messages got rather nasty and I was accused (among other things) of being a bad person and I’m pretty sure they reported my account. I didn’t get mean in my responses to them, just said it wasn’t my fault my team left either and that they were getting a free win, not how you’d want to play a game but not bad for them either. \n\nMy reasoning was that they just needed to wait for a little while and get a free win, and we could all be on our merry way, but after thinking about it I’m feeling guilty. Maybe I should have just left and copped the admittedly mild punishment, and not wasted anyone else’s time. \n\nSo I want to ask the benevolent members of reddit, was I an asshole for not leaving the game?

      "description": "I (17M in CO) recently started a long distance relationship with a girl (17 in Germany) when we met at the open day for a university in the Netherlands. Everything has been going well, but her time zone is 8 hours ahead of mine, so she goes to bed at around 15:30 (3:30PM) my time. Today, we said goodbye at around that time, but then she texted me around 16:30 telling me that she was crying because she had been watching a bunch of videos from PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). As a side note, I still am I unsure why she watches videos that make her so upset.\n\nFor additional context, I have never liked PETA. When I first heard about them, it was mostly the ridiculous shit they said like having a pet is slavery. However, a friend recently told me about the side of PETA that's not just a joke, and that they kill animals ([https://www.petakillsanimals.com/](https://www.petakillsanimals.com/)).\n\nSo when my S/O reached out, I told her that PETA is actually horrible and is responsible for the deaths of thousands of animals. I realize her being upset and in tears was almost definitely the wrong time to tell her this, but I thought it was really important that she know this stuff as soon as possible. When I told her, she said she would do some research and we'd talk tomorrow. It was 0:30 her time at this point, so I wanted to let her rest, but I worry she also felt really hurt by my response because she was probably feeling vulnerable and sad and looking for comfort, and I provided the exact opposite of that.\n\nSo AITA for dropping that truth on her, or should I have just said nothing? Frankly, I would feel conflicted either way.",

      "description": "So a few months ago I got engaged to my very best friend and boyfriend of six years. We’re thrilled and are in the middle of planning. My two sisters are in my wedding party. One of my sisters really enjoys being the center of attention and has been that way since we were little, which I’m fine with. However, when I booked my very first dress consultation at David’s Bridal, she immediately asked if we could look at bridesmaid dresses during the same time-slot. Now, I’ve always been eager to please and do not want to become a bridezilla, but I kind of felt that the dress appointment was my time, especially since it was the very first one. I ended up telling her “no” and that I’d be happy to look at bridesmaid dresses another time. She seemed hurt when I said this and so I felt bad. \nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole?",

He's pushing about 50 I want to say. During the training we were alone in his car. He began talking about how the college nearby does an \"underwear walk\" every year. \n\nI brushed off the remark as \"traditions are cool\". However, he began to talk in detail about how the college girls have \"such perfect and tight little asses\" and was talking about \"just what he'd do if he wasn't married with a child\" this made me very uncomfortable, so I stayed silent. He kept talking about all of the girls he saw there, with \"such great fucking tight little bodies\" etc etc. \n\nEvery time I've seen him since he talks about women like this, and it makes me hella uncomfortable. Whether its how the redhead on game of thrones would be \"such a good tight fuck\" or whoever else, it always makes me extremely unsettled. I'm afraid to talk to my manager about this, because since he's been there for years, I don't think anything will happen to him, and I'll be stuck dealing with an angry pervert. I also think it'd be weird if I got him fired, cause I'd worry my other co-workers would think I'm an asshole?\n\nWIBTA if I reported my weird co-worker for his really sexually charged remarks about people I don't even know?",

      "description": "Short back story:  I am awaiting a judgement for my disability case and have not worked in quite a few years.  I have been living at my mother's house where I do everything I can to stay out of her way, not leave a mess anywhere, and I purchase (with food stamps) and cook my own food.\n\nSoon after I moved in, my mom started just taking what she wanted of my food, even though she has 2 full size freezers full of food, much of which is years old, and she is in no way hard up for income.  She goes to the store at least 2 times a week to catch the latest deals, then just shoves it all in the freezer.  I have to use her car to get to the store myself, maybe twice a month, and I prepare all my own food.  Every time I do, she just helps herself.  I've confronted her more times than I can count about this and she sometimes denies it, but other times just says I can go get more at the store.  It takes so much time and effort for me to be able to do my shopping and food prep, and I have told her in that if she wants something from the store I will get it for her.  I rarely spend everything I get every month so I can usually get her up to $15-20 if she asks.  For the past few months she hasn't asked for anything even though I offer as I'm leaving for the store.  \n\nAfter another issue where my mom gave my food away to the neighbor last month, I told her to not touch my food every again.  Yesterday I made a loaf of bread, and of course I go out today and my mom has helped herself to it and the lunch meat I had for my lunch.  I feel like I'm being taken advantage of here as I have always kept my stuff separate from hers and if I need something that she has and I don't, I ask first.  If I continue to confront her and demand she leaves my stuff alone, am I being an asshole?  I feel like I've made myself very clear so many times and she just doesn't care, because what am I going to do about it.   ",

      "description": "This happened 5 years ago, but sometimes I still question it. So 7 years ago I had a friend whom I was really close with, we would talk every day. I was 15 at the time and she was 16. At the time I was always her ‘sidekick’, she would forbid me from going out with my other friends for a long time, or labelling someone as my best friend if it’s not her, she also told me she had a crush on me and when I rejected her because I am straight she blocked me however a few days after she added me again and I had to apologize for it.\nOne day she invited me to a party where I met my future boyfriend. We instantly got interested in each other we both loved video games and I fell in love with him in an instant. He asked me for my number etc. When he left my friend asked me if I liked him and I said that I do have a crush on him. A month later I asked him out on Valentine’s Day because I really liked him, and I told my friend about that, but then my friend started crying and said how she likes him and wants to ask him out instead. I felt pretty bad at the time and cancelled my date with the guy so she can ask him instead. A month later they started to date, I was completely heartbroken, but at the same time I was happy for her. A few weeks in her relationship she forgot about me, called me rarely, told me how I am boring, annoying, too negative and depressive and that she needs positive people in her life. A few months later she cheated on him, he forgave her and they moved on...after 6 months in their relationship she cheated again, but this time she directly told me instead and automatically wanted support from me. I was conflicted a bit because of how she mistreated me and I felt like she was using me, and also I felt bad for her bf. Her boyfriend vented to me a lot and told me that she is really toxic for both of us and that we should leave her. Me and her bf did go out with our other friends at the time behind her back, we were not dating yet tho just friends. I realized after that how happy I was going outside with other people and not being bound to one person. I also still loved this guy I was really in love with him, so we decided to break it off with my friend and the next day he confessed to me that he really likes me. He is my first boyfriend and after 5 years we are still together and I love him a lot and I genuinely feel happy and not controlled anymore. However sometimes Id feel like an asshole for doing this to my friend, my mom said I was an asshole but my dad and my therapist say that I should have done that for my own mental health considering her manipulative nature.\nI want to know your opinion on this?",

      "description": "I fully realize that anything I post is going to be from my viewpoint, but I’m going to try my utmost to keep things as objective as possible and keep my feeling/theories out of it. I’m not trying to get pity here. I honestly want to know if IATA. My life motto is “Love above all”, and I’m absolutely torn apart that I might not be following that, but I also do not want to be emotionally taken advantage of (the money is a separate issue for me, but is necessary for context). So I really do need to know if IATA, though, if I am…. be kind, please? This is my first time putting myself out here on Reddit. Also, I have struggles keeping things brief, so please forgive the length. Seriously. It’s long, but I don’t know how to shorten it and still give enough context.\n\nI have had a best friend since 9th grade – 24 years now. We haven’t often agreed on many things, but we’ve managed to maintain a relationship in which we talk almost every day through a lot regardless. A few years back, her husband lost his job and they were jobless for a year and a half. They got a settlement for disability discrimination from his former job and were able to live off of that, but when they finally got an offer for another job in a different state, they had no money with which to move. The new job promised reimbursement for much of the move, but not until the first paycheck, so they needed money upfront. My husband and I had lent them a sum of money when they were on the verge of eviction ten years ago without repayment, but I could not bear the thought of my best friend not being able to take a job for such a ridiculous reason, especially since they were about to be foreclosed on. We knew the risk, because they have never been great with money, and we already had the experience of not being reimbursed, but given that they were getting a job that paid half again as much as our income and was also paying them back 3/4 of what we would be lending, we decided to lend them a very large sum of money from our line of credit (i.e., not actually money we had, but money we had access to, which would be accruing interest. It has saved us at times between jobs, and we felt that since we had the blessing of a safety net, we should help when my best friend did not have said safety net).\n\nOver the last almost eight months since we lent the money, payment has been almost nonexistent. First we got only part of what the company reimbursed. Then it was two months before we saw another small amount. They always seemed to have money for what was important to them, but never enough to pay us back. The original agreement was all of the money that was reimbursed, and then a monthly payment after that. $1k/mn was discussed, but I told her that any good faith payment was enough. I struggle with anxiety and after not receiving payments, told her that I was very sorry, but every time I did the budget (weekly), I was having a massive panic attack. I tried very hard not to bring it up too much, because I do NOT want a friendship marred by money. But every so often, after doing the budget, I would send her a message asking her if anything was going to be coming. \n\nA bit before Christmas, two months since the last payment, I sent the following:\n\n“I really hate doing this, but every single week when I reconcile the budget, I have a panic attack. It’s been two months since we’ve received anything. I need to know that something is in the mail. Current standing is $xxxx.xx. Thanks!”\n\nReply:\n\n“Our account balance as of Thursday was under $10. I know you don’t believe me but we are trying.”\n\nMe:\n\n“Ok”\n\nAfter that… nothing. No calls (we usually talk almost daily), no texts, no messages, nothing. Now, it was over Christmas, and her son and his girlfriend were visiting, so I assumed she wanted space, which is why I didn’t contact her either. But then on New Year’s Eve I had an emergency appendectomy. Both my husband and I had multiple posts about it on Facebook. No calls, no messages, no likes even. Ok… well, maaaaybe neither she nor her husband saw? I was in a lot of pain and on pain killers, and wasn’t really on the phone with anyone, so I didn’t notice at first. But then on budget day I sent this message:  \n \n\n“So… appendectomy and panic attack really don’t go well together. :(“\n\nRadio silence. She didn’t even open my message. The next day I was feeling very hurt, and panicking about the money, and had admitted to my mom that I’d even lent her the money, and mom was ready to call her up and chew her out. So I decided to write a letter (I will copy it at the bottom of this). I admit that the first draft of the letter had a lot of angry hurt in it. But I tried my best to make it so that in the end it reflected my true feelings and not just the emotions I was having – that she was my best friend, that the way she was acting hurt, that the money thing had to be dealt with, etc. Had my mom, husband, and sister look at it to make sure it was as loving as possible. But it’s hard to know, you know? How it will come across to someone else. So maybe I failed. I sent it to her email (titled Feeling sad), text, and facebook messenger. She never opened it up on facebook messenger. I have no idea about the others. No response or acknowledgement. I gave it two weeks, then sent this:  \n \n\n“Please. Another paycheck has come and gone and I’ve not heard a single word from you in four weeks. You gave your word, and you have always claimed that your word and honesty is how you define yourself. I am hurt and confused. I don’t want to take legal action, but that is the next step at this point.”\n\nNothing again, but we did receive a check for somewhat over half of what was owed later that week postdated the day I sent that message. There was a note, and it was civil, but definitely not the tone that our friendship usually is:\n\nAritavashkai,\n\nDH’s bonus was just deposited. This is the entire amount. We should be able to repay the remainder by/with our tax return. Please let me know what that amt. will be.\n\n\\[Name\\]\n\nSo then I WAS a jerk. The day before we received the check, I came back from counseling and I ended up posting a thing on facebook that wasn’t quite a rant, but kinda was. My counselor had been helping me through the pain that I had clearly lost my best friend, and I didn’t know why. I understood after I sent that letter, but I didn’t, and still don’t, understand why that last time right before Christmas she decided to act like I was dead to her. It’s not like we hadn’t talked about the loan before, and at times much more clearly than that message. And then for her to not even give any care about my appendectomy or the fact that I have been having a really hard time healing from it (I’ve ended up back at ER four more time since then in three and a half weeks and have been in insane pain). So I was terribly confused about what had happened to our friendship, and my counselor (this was a culmination of multiple sessions) told me that obviously she couldn’t diagnose someone she hadn’t met, but from everything she heard, my best friend certainly had some sort of personality disorder, at the very least narcissism. So she told me about discarding and about how narcissists will do that when you are no longer useful or desirable to them, and that I needed to heal and accept that. And also that most times, they will try to “hoover” you back – rekindle the friendship basically, but always with ulterior motives – and that she felt I was in an abusive situation and needed to be strong and realize what was going on and allow myself to heal either way, but stay strong and resist getting sucked back in if she did try to hoover. Honestly, that realization explained SO MUCH and I immediately felt a huge weight off my chest, and a lot of my pain over the lost friendship went away. If she was doing all this on purpose, was purposefully hurting me and had no remorse, was playing with my emotions, anxiety and guilt… well, I wasn’t very sad anymore if I could look at it like that. So I stupidly went on facebook. I didn’t say things like I did here. I was trying to work through my feelings. I do that too much. I have really good facebook friends, not toxic like so many seem to have. So I tend to open up when I’m working through things. So I posted about narcissism and friendship, and whether I should continue it, etc. But I didn’t hide it from her. I don’t know if I was trying to be spiteful, or if I was truly trying to find a way to let her know where I was coming from so she could understand. A mutual friend commented something about loving me, and then that true friends don’t make ultimatums. I don’t know if that was directed at me or at her. I think it must have been me. I think that my “best” friend had probably told her that \\*I\\* was the one ending the friendship if she wouldn’t pay or something, which is the opposite of how it was. Anyhow, I took that post down, and I don’t know if my “best” friend ever saw it or if our mutual friend told her.\n\nSo here’s where I am with asking AITA. I’m trying to build up the courage to end the friendship in my head and heart. If she tries to come back with or without apologizing, keep it ended. Be civil, but that’s it. That’s what EVERYTHING about narcissistic relationships says to do. DON’T let yourself get hoovered back in. Apologies aren’t real and are manipulation. Etc, etc. But it goes against all my instincts. If I accept that she’s a narcissist, then I can release her control over me. I don’t hurt. She has no emotional power over me at all. But…. What if I’m wrong. What kind of person would not forgive someone who’s sincerely sorry. I’m sure it’ll seem like I’m doing it because of the stupid money, and that that’s what she’ll bill it as to our mutual friends. But it wasn’t that that’s made me decide that she’s gone fro",

      "description": "Yello. Dummy account because reasons\n\nI’m 14, my older sister is 15\n\nMy sister, we’ll call her S, is..a piece of work. She’s done a lot bad things. Here’s a timeline\n\nAt Age 13, She gave away our address and other personal info resulting in a loss of phone and computer privileges\n\nA few months later, she was caught sneaking onto my iPod after I fell asleep, doing the same kind of stuff. I don’t remember how she was punished\n\nShe earned back privileges over time, gaining a phone again and also using my iPad mini a lot (my parents won it in a raffle during the time when she wasn’t allowed to use tech, but once she was able again she basically claimed it as her own.)\n\nAt 14 She then had those privileges dashed when it was revealed she had a pornhub account. I found out because she left the email app open on the iPad mini, and I saw it as one of the emails and I snooped a bit. I didn’t go to the website so I don’t know if anything was posted but I fucking hope not. She got everything taken away again.\n\nFast forward to about maybe a year later. She works at our family restaurant, she doesn’t have a phone or access to one (anymore, she used to manipulate me into letting her use mine, but I put a stop to it after finding a really fucking gross video on my phone that I don’t wanna get into detail about. She got mad and really upset with me and still is, but I’m not budging.) and she bought an xbox one with her saved money and that’s all she does anymore.\n\nThat and go get stoned off her ass with her coworkers. She constantly is coming home high, and I have to cover for her, using air freshener when she forgets and lying and god I’m so mad I ever did any of it for her. \n\nWe live with a single father, my mother is an alcoholic and frankly, a terrible person. I feel my sister may be acting out because of her but I really don’t know.\n\nBut anyways now that there is some context, on we go.\n\nShe has this Boyfriend, I’ll call him B. S and B have been dating for a few months and I’ve known for a few months, I didn’t say anything because I figured it was harmless. \n\nThen I found out he was 18. Still, I didn’t say anything. She had dated an 18 year old a few weeks prior and he was very sweet (my sister treated him terribly and even though I don’t agree that they should have ever dated, I sympathize with him.) but B is different. He’s also a pothead, he does shrooms and all that too, he’s a brother of one of my sisters coworkers, the one who she smokes with the most. \n\nFor a while I just let sleeping dogs lie. I figured it was fine, she had learned by now to be cautious but again and again I’m proved wrong and I don’t care to make excuses for her anymore.\n\nSo I find out she has been having sex with B. She, a 15 year old CHILD is having sex with an 18 year old Man and I am appalled. I felt really uncomfortable asking but I asked if they used protection and guess fucking what THEY DIDNT because  course they fucking didn’t.\n\nI’m livid. I was in the car with my dad earlier and I told him everything. Not about the weed but he’ll find out, I can assure that. I just couldn’t bring myself to like more on, I feel awful enough and my father was crying at that point. For my sisters punishment, hd said he would probably fire her from the restaurant and take away her xbox. And got B,He said he’d think about pressing charges for pedophilia or something and that he was proud of me for telling him\n\nI just feel terrible. I get that what they’re both doing is fucking wrong as hell but jail? He’s only 18, I mean god if I ruined somebodys fucking life I don’t know how to live with that.\n\nI’m so angry that I didn’t say anything sooner, I’m angry that I said anything At all, and most of all I just feel betrayed. My mother left a gaping hole in my heart and my sister helped fill that void. She was almost like a mom I never had for a bit, she made sure I ate actual meals, she helped me clean now and then, she hung out with me, it was wonderful.\n And, I feel terrible that this person could possibly be arrested. And now my sister is gonna hate me, and things were finally starting to look up and get better and Jesus Christ I feel like I’ve just ruined everything again.\n\nSorry if this is just rambles, I’m really freaked out kinda.\n\nSo reddit, AITA? What do I do? I can provide more info and clarification if needed",

My brother has been mentally affecting the family because of his anger issues. He is always making everyone upset and even makes my mom and grandma cry and i personally don't like seeing that. He argues every day with my grandma, my sister and I, and for the smallest reasons which annoys me even more, and i can't do anything about it but ignore him or just apologize for no reason just to make him go away. He's been \"kicked out\" before but he usually comes back because my grandma is very forgiving. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love my brother to death and i feel bad if I'm being honest. I'm aware that he suffered at a young age, but so did everyone else, either just as bad if not worse, and they are doing just fine as far as i can tell. We don't live with our parents, but we talk every day, so that might have to do with his anger issues. its a fairly long story as to why we don't live with them, but if i have to tell the tale i'll do so.\n\nIm only 14 so i might not think as maturely or with an open perspective, but thats no excuse and i will accept my assholeiness if i end up being one.

She gave some mediocre excuses of her having a rough week, thus she got too drunk and lost control of her actions. She said that she wanted to talk this out in person, whereby I responded that she should kindly fuck off and never speak to me again. \n\nThe thing is she's writing her finals exam this Thursday, and failing the test would mean that she'd probably end up getting kicked out of her course. I'm a bit worried that me telling her I don't ever want to speak to her again may inflict so much emotional trauma on her that she ends up failing this test. I potentially fucked up her future.

      "description": "Hi everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm having a conflict with a friend of 6 years and I would like some outside eyes on this.\n\nI've been trying to hangout with one of my best friends throughout the Summer since I can tell she was feeling pretty down about Law School. Back in August, my friend told me she couldn't hang out since she was studying for LSAT and taking on a weekend job to get money since her parents are making her pay rent now. Cool, no worries. I totally understand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast Friday, I got an email from one of our favorite stores that was having 40% off everything. I texted it to her and she said she wants to go. I asked if she wanted to go after work and I agreed. We decided to grab something to eat and while looking for a restaurant, she let slip that she's been party every weekend SINCE LATE AUGUST with someone we knew for less than 2 months (\"Abba\"). I felt some kind of way, but held it in until I can think about my emotions. During dinner, she asked if she can invite one of the friends that she's into that she met via Abba. Odd, but whatever. Dude is nice so I didn't mind at the end. After dinner, I told her privately there's a high chance I might have cervical cancer and she apologized about being in her own bubble and not checking up on people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got home, I sent her a text that I felt some type of way that she told me she couldn't hang out due to finances and tests and she's been hanging out with someone she knew for &lt;2 months. No response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSaturday she responded to a snapchat story I had. I said thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday I asked her to send me a Venmo payment then she asked if I got her text. I didn't so she sent me a long text that basically said she was feeling stressed by a lot of things. She tried studying, but it didn't work, she tried going to the gym and it didn't work. Then Abba got in touch with her to go for drinks and Abba told my friend she's been dealing with a breakup hard and they've been partying/dancing with guys to feel better. She said it's not me she's trying to avoid; she wants to dance with friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI responded saying I get it but I feel naive and like I have a big L on my forehead because I was trying to adjust to her needs by backing off and giving her space and now someone we knew for &lt;2 months is another story. I told her I 'm going to stop initiating hangouts because this has happened in the past with other people and I'm tired of giving more than I receive. No response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that day, she responded to a Snapchat story. I said thanks. Tuesday she sent me a snapchat. I didn't respond. She's not the type to do use snapchat daily, so I'm guessing she's doing this in a way to be like \"I'll show my friendship this way!!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWednesday, I followed up asking her if she got my text. No response and she stopped responding to my Snapstories and stopped sending me snaps, but she's still looking at my Snapstories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kind of regret telling her about my cancer situation. She doesn't deserve to know in my eyes with her current attitude. Am I overreacting?",

      "description": "So I was at a store and it happened that my dad needed to pick something up from there. When I finished inside I noticed his truck parked nearby. I called him he didn't answer so i figured I'd mess with his truck a bit. I moved the side mirror on the driver's side all the way inward. I figured no harm was done because he could just move it without getting out.(older truck with non electric mirrors)\n  Later at home I asked if he noticed anything different about the truck. He got mad and said \"Some things you don't play with. I was getting on the highway when I noticed it. What if i crashed? All because you wanted to play a \"joke\" \"\n   My argument was that a driver should check their mirrors before driving away. I share a car with my mom and don't think it's a big deal. When the mirrors are wrong I just adjust them and keep driving. But I can sort of see his side. What do you guys/gals think?",

      "description": "My (22f) SIL (30f) claims that she’s from NYC. She reps NYC *really* hard. Way harder than the people I know who are actually from NYC. She’s not from there. She’s from a small town in the south, as am I. Some of our family is from New York but me and my brother are not, and she doesn’t have any relatives from there. Her and my brother moved to NYC when they first got together, about nine years ago. They lived there for like four years then moved back.\n\nI don’t constantly pick on her, just every once in a while when the opportunity arises. Like a jab or two every 3rd or 4th time I see her. I just think it’s so funny and easy to pick on her about it. She’s *so* asking for it.\n\nShe has in her instagram bio something about “just a couple New Yorkers trying to make it in suburbia” or something like that. She often posts on social media about missing home with a pic of NYC. She even picked up a slight accent. We recently went to our cousins wedding in NYC, she posted a selfie on instagram with me and the bride and was like “you know you’re from new york when you’re the only white girl at a dominican wedding” (my family is dominican, she is white but there were a lot of other white people there so idk what that was about...plus she’s not from NYC anyways).\n\nShe said something and her “accent” got really thick for a second so I responded in the worst, over exaggerated NY accent that I could and then laughed about it. She got mad at me and stormed out of my moms house last night. My brother told me to stop and that I needed to apologize. I told him I would stop now that I know that it bothers her that much, but I’m not going to apologize. I told my brother, first of all she’s asking for it. Second of all if she wasn’t my his wife my brother would be making fun of her just as hard. Plus she made fun of me when I got really obsessive over the keto diet, I didn’t get all butthurt about that, I knew I deserved it.\n\nI feel like dumb stuff like pretending you’re from new york is fair game to get picked on about.\n\nAITA?",

Us five guys wanted to have a guys-night-out-thing and eat at a nice restaurant and afterwards we would go out drinking. We had this planned out for maybe two or three weeks in advance, since we all are pretty busy considering we all have commitments and jobs to worry about. \n\nNow, an hour or so before we were meant to meet up, the guy in question, let's call him Larry, impulsively invited his crush to join us without asking how we all felt about it. Considering it was supposed to be just the guys, we were all a bit \"oh come on\" about the whole thing. Larry informed us through Facebook that he had invited her and we all told him how we thought it was supposed to be just us guys. Larry started to guilt trip us a bit, saying that he had already invited her and that he didn't want to un-invite her. We then told Larry that his crush could join us afterwards and join us for drinks. That wasn't an issue at all - the more the merrier, when it comes to drinking. But we wanted to keep the restaurant thing just for us. \n\nTen minutes before we have to go Larry tells us that he won't be joining us and that he would rather eat with his crush instead. So that's what he did.\n\nWe were all pretty disappointed in him considering he chose to eat with this girl even though he had a thing with us planned out two or three weeks in advance.\n\nThis happened a few weeks ago now, and he still doesn't understand why we were angry with him. He feels like we're idiots for not understanding his choice. \n\nNow... AITA for thinking what Larry did was in bad taste and that he is totally out of touch when it comes to friendships and agreements? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think.

They kept touching each other, more intimately than a father would usually touch his daughter. At this point it was clear it is not a father-daughter relationship. Then they started kissing each other on the lips and I thought \"This is not ok.\"\n\nI stepped outside, called 911 and told them my location and that there is a man inside who is kissing and inappropriately touching a child. I am going to testify before a grand jury on Tuesday. Turns out the guy was 34 and the girl is only 16, young enough to be his daughter. Luckily, in my state the age of consent is 18, but the horrifying part is that in some states, the age of consent is 16, and this pedophile would have been able to get away with it. There really needs to be a law that consent cannot be given if there is a large enough age disparity, even if they are above the age of consent. I remember when I was a 16 year old girl and I definitely was not ready to consent to a relationship with an older man.",

      "description": "First, some background info\n\nI have a teenage daughter who is a Freshman in high school from a previous relationship. Her mother and I get along just fine. The mom has sole custody and my daughter stays with me once a week and every other weekend Friday - Sunday. My daughter and I have a great relationship, she’s as open to me as one would expect a teenage girl to be. I am her only father figure in her life because her mom is single.\n\nI also got married a few years ago and have 2 young children with my wife. My teen daughter loves her stepmom and her siblings and everyone has a great relationship with each other. No fighting, no animosity, no jealousy from anyone. \n\nI am able to provide for my family and also have never missed a child support payment to help with my first daughter and also give her money when child support is not enough on occasion. My wife and mom of teen daughter get along well also. We live paycheck to paycheck but I wouldn’t  categorize us as struggling, we are lower middle class.\n\nMy job background:\n\nI currently have a job making 35,000 a year, I have a BA in Business Administration and an MBA. I recently applied for a job and was offered a position with a company in another state. The driving distance from where I am now to where I would move to if I accepted the job is 12 hours in California. \n\nThe salary for this position ( and I don’t know if this is good money in California, but I think it is) is 180,000. That is a huge increase in pay and I would be able to provide for my family better than I ever thought I could. I don’t think this job is a once in a lifetime opportunity, but I also don’t know if an opportunity like this will come again for a long time or ever again. I definitely would never be able to make that kind of money in the town I live in currently. \n\nMy conundrum is WIBTA if I took this job and moved my wife and 2 young kids out of state and left my teenage girl with her mom?\n\n(Her Mom would never let our teen daughter go with us and I also would not want to pull my daughter away from her friends and rest of her family and the life she knows to go to California)\n\n I feel like this time in my daughter’s life I need to stay and be supportive for her during her teen years, but then also need to consider the life I would be able to provide to my wife and 2 young ones if I did move.  \n\nSo, good folks of Reddit, WIBTA?\n",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to cut contact with my female best friend over a new romantic relationship she can't come to terms with?",
      "description": "Some years ago I met a girl - Sophia [21F]. We instantly found a lot of common interests and despite living in different cities, we soon became very close friends. Inevitably I fell for her. She didn’t. But after meeting her in person a few times we became fuck buddies on her initiative.\n\nOver a course of a year I found myself devoting a lot of time to her. I remember moments where Sophia would demand I talk to her over the phone, despite being away with family. But everything else was amazing as I never had such a close friend.\n\nWe would talk everyday over the phone. Every few months we would meet and have sex. While Sophia was away at home she would have one night stands with other guys.\n\nI felt unrequited love which really hurt me. There would be moments where I wanted to walk away but she would just beg me not to leave her as I was her only friend. And she would shower me with affection and intimacy. This would make the pain go away and I would stay. I really didn't want to lose a friend too. I wanted to simply stop loving her.\n\nThis cycle of pain and affection would repeat for years until I became numb to it. In the meantime - she would become more and more depressed and thinking about ending her life. I tried to be there for her but it started getting harder and harder to console her and deal with it as she was against getting any real help.\n\nFor the past half a year I really improved my life and met a lovely girl wich whom I started a relationship. Even thou Sophia was supportive of it - soon she became very jealous.\n\nOver a course of a month it spiraled from being needy to threatening ending her life if I would not leave my current girlfriend. Sophia would constantly barrage me with texts and calls. She would say how much she loves me and made a mistake. How she would change and make everything right. She would send me nude photos of her. After saying a hard NO to her - Sophia ended up in a psych ward. She was diagnosed schizotypal personality disorder. After starting new meds and therapy she felt better and decided to work on letting me go and just being friends.\n\nThe problem is that Sophia still is very needy and paranoid. Sometimes I catch her trying to manipulate me so I would spend less time with my girlfriend or flat out her telling me she wishes that my relationship fail. I am sick of all this behavior and want to cut contact with her and move on. \n\nBut I feel like an ass for throwing out more than 6 years of friendship and adventures with Sophia over a couple of months of problems. In addition her diagnosis sounds awful. I don't want to push her away for being unwell. For the first time in years she started getting help. Maybe I should just have more patience with her? I really miss the friendship and enjoying our common interests.",

      "description": "Context:\n\nMy ex from college (dated for about 6 months) broke up with me 2 years ago because he realized he didn't care enough about the relationship to continue over long distance. He was my first love and broke my heart, so things were rough for me. We had no contact for about a year in which I had a casual fling and got over him 100%, but started talking again and got closure about a year ago (right before I met my current bf). \n\nWe're on good terms now. We chat on facebook or catch up over facetime every few months or so. We've stayed friends because we were best friends before dating, same college friend group, dated for only the end of college briefly, and it's just nice to stay connected to someone who meant a lot to you from the past, especially from such a formative time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have now been dating my current bf for almost a year. Everything is amazing, and I love him. It is a way more serious and mature relationship than my last. Last week, we were talking and he expressed he is insecure about my ex, specifically because it was a \"first love\" type thing. I have reassured him there is literally nothing going on and I am not interested in my ex romantically at all anymore (all true!!). Any romantic feelings feel so far back in the past. I am way over it and 100% into my current bf. He trusts my reassurances and is also friends with an ex, so he somewhat understands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Issue:\n\nToday, I was scrolling through my phone and my boyfriend saw 2 things that upset him:\n\n1) While my current boyfriend and I were in the hooking up/not sure what we are stage, ex and I had a life update chat with my ex on facebook messenger in which I told him \"I miss you (definitely not in the same way I did before) ! Hope you are well, hope to see you soon!\"\n\n2) A few months ago (after my boyfriend and I started dating), my ex was in town and asked to hang out. I couldn't make it at the time but offered to facetime to catch up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis point of view:\n\n1. He is worried that I was still into my ex (by saying I miss you) at the time we had already started hooking up.\n2. He is very upset that I have never mentioned that I facetime my ex occasionally, and that when my boyfriend and I saw each other/texted (don't remember which it was) that day I didn't mention it happening. He thinks it is disrespectful and that I meant to lie by omission.\n\nMy point of view:\n\n1. The I miss you was completely platonic on my end. It happened a few months after we had that good closure conversation and I wanted to express good will and friendship. I was hanging out with an old college friend at the time so naturally I thought of him and missed that he wasn't there too. IN A FRIENDLY WAY, which I tried to express! And current boyfriend and I were not yet serious, so it reflects nothing on our relationship, in my opinion.\n2. The idea that talking to my ex would be disrespectful to my current boyfriend honestly did not cross my mind :( , as I do call my other college friends sometimes and never mention it either. Not on purpose! Had it come up, I would NEVER lie about anything, it just wasn't thought of. It also was a quick call for mayyybe at most an hour and we haven't hung out in person nor been romantic/sexual at ALL after our break up. Also at the time, my boyfriend and I had only been official for about 2 months and I had ZERO idea he was so insecure over my ex. So, it was literally a non-issue to me at the time, and to specifically bring it up would make it sound like I thought it was a bigger deal than it really was. I think it would have been weird to bring it up with no prompting or any reason to. \n\nSo am I in the wrong? Please let me know if anything I did was me being the asshole! I just seriously can't tell what would have been the right choice of action each time these things happened in the past, and I want to be better in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Okay it’s a little more complicated than the title, and also know this is in high school so relationships aren’t extremely serious. However, feelings are feelings and I’m just not sure if I’m in the wrong on this one or not. \n\nThe relationship I had with this ex, I’ll call her Anna, only involved a couple dates last June. I didn’t feel much of a connection so I ended things after only about a week, but we remained friends in a mutual group. She seemed somewhat okay with how things ended, I could tell she was hurt but since it was so short I thought it wasn’t that bad. \n\nA few months later at the end of August, one of her longtime friends (who I’ll call Sarah) started to hang out with us for the next few weeks. She knew other people in the group, so it wasn’t just like Anna’s friend. \n\nAfter a while, I thought Sarah was a really cool person and I started to like her. I figured since it had been a while since I had been with Anna, she would be okay with it. I also thought it would for sure be okay since she had done the same and expressed interest in dating one of my longtime friends a month or two prior. \n\nTurns out I was very wrong about this, as soon as she found out from mutual friends that I liked Sarah, she said she would never talk to me or Sarah again if we did date and got furious at me for even thinking about it. She also said we can’t hangout together anymore and stopped bringing Sarah. The mutual friend who told her in the first place later told me that Anna still liked me and wanted to get back together. However, the thing is, all this was communicated through friends telling friends and if Anna would have just told me directly she didn’t feel comfortable with me dating her friend I would have understood and it wouldn’t have been a big deal, but a lot of drama was created and she become very passive aggressive towards me and I got kind of annoyed. \n\nI ended up just leaving everything be and decided it wasn’t worth the drama and I also didn’t want to break their friendship, even if Sarah would have wanted to date me back in the first place.\n\nThings between the three of us are still kind of tense, as in the past month Sarah and I have started talking more and I still like her and feel like it’s more mutual this time. Another friend tells me Anna still kind of likes me and would still hate to see me and Sarah together. I understand that Anna would still like me a little because I see her almost everyday, so we’ve gotten to know each other better. But I feel like it’s been such a long time since we dated (for only a week) that she’d understand I just want to be friends with her and it would be kind of controlling of me and her friend to stop us from even talking.\n\nI never felt like I was totally in the wrong since I was only doing what she did first, but based off her very emotional reaction, I’ve been wondering about it and whether or not if it’s justifiable to date her friend.

We kept it small cause we just wanted it to be that intial friend group. We let a few more people in as they were becoming part of the friend group, but the new people started adding their friends even though we said not to. As owner of the server, I ddint wanna be an asshole so I decided to let them in. \n\nA few months pass and theres about 40 people in the server even though we started with 5. Some of the people are really toxic and swear all the time. I don't like swearing as my now divorced parents used to get into fights all the time and swear at eachother.\n\nAt first, I just asked them to tone it down a little, but they immediately  started spamming swear words. I kicked one guy from the server. I didnt ban him, just kicked. He joined back and I made a rule of no swearing. They refused to obey the rules.\n\nStill trying to be nice, I added a discord bot thqt deleted messages with swear words. That was a month ago.\n\nFast forward to yesterday and the guy I kicked, along with one other person are trying to make me take out the discord bot.  I refused to take out the bot but wouldnt give a reason why. I know these people a little bit but I wouldnt tell them about my personal life. I only talked about my parents divorcing here cause i dont have to worry about anyone knowing me.",

      "description": "My friend Jesse and his fiancée Evelyn (not real names) are getting married in July and of course, me being a pro wedding photographer, they asked me to shoot the wedding — annoyingly assuming I’d do it for free, which I absolutely would, but I felt a bit sad that they didn’t value my work enough to even offer. Anyway, I said yes, but asked that they cover the cost of my accommodation for an extra night (as I’ll have to be up fairly early to do bridal prep shots and the wedding is a seven hour drive for me), which they said they would do. A few hours later I get a message from Jesse:\n\n“Hey dude. This whole thing seems to be turning into a business arrangement and really you’re coming as a guest — we want you to have fun and we’re only asking for a few snaps and your food is already being covered. I don’t want you thinking we want loads of pics because we don’t.” I feel like the undertone was that they’re paying for food so they don’t expect to pay for the hotel/accommodation for the extra night.\n\nI sent back a polite message detailing why taking wedding photos take so much work and pointing out that I don’t want them or me to feel bad after the fact because I wasn’t 100% on the ball and have heard nothing back and word on the grapevine is I’ve ruffled some feathers. I feel really hurt because a hotel room costs roughly $150 and clearly, they don’t even think my work is worth that much, which was a bit of a blow to my ego.\n\nThat being said, I feel like a $2,000 wedding photography package is a gift in itself and I shouldn’t have to fork out an extra night for a hotel room, but part of me is wondering if I should have just avoided saying anything at all. I feel really anxious and guilty about the whole thing, should I be?",

      "description": "so my friend(timmy) has known this guy(Richard head) for a few weeks, works with him and they became friends pretty quick. Both are really good gamers. So this richard-head is talking about selling adderall to gamers, but claims not to do it much, but within a week later he is talking about getting some and wants to give my friend some. Now, I've seen adderall do bad stuff to people... I was going to talk to my friend away from this kid, but I couldn't help myself and put him on the spot and started to question him .... if he really didn't take it much why do you have some coming so soon after you claim that..., I was sort of treating richard-head like a scummy drug dealer... insinuating that he's gonna give timmy the first one free then try to sell it to him... like a drug dealer. I don't want my friend taking adderall, because I know it can be really addictive and bad for you and seen it turn people into addicts. Am I the asshole for being aggressive with this kid and insinuating he's being shady instead of being more gentle with it? It got a little tense.\n\n",

      "description": "Just found this sub, so thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nMy brother and his GF came to visit myself and my BF during their university's spring break. Brother's GF had never been to my city before, so they'd thought they'd come to visit. Great! First time we've had people stay with us (BF and I moved here in October 2018).\n\nTo preface, BF and my apartment is (barely) 1 room apartment that's approximately 650ish square feet. So really, not that big. Having 4 people in it was very tight (they've been sleeping on the couch)\n\nBrother and his GF got here last Sunday night/early Monday.\n\nThe first day, Monday, brother was feeling fine. Then Monday night, BF and I noticed my brother was coughing a bit while sleeping and kind of 'moaning' (the painful, not feeling well kind)\n\nThen Tuesday, brother he wakes up feeling pretty sick so brother and his GF decided to just spent ½ a day exploring. Brother had another terrible night on the couch and woke up today feeling even worse. Brother and BF decided to go to urgent care and my brother finds that he has the flu.\n\nMy BF and I talked and said that since our apartment is so small, and we really can't afford to get sick and miss work, that we'd just like my brother to stay in a hotel close by for the last 2 nights of his trip. BF and I thought this was very reasonable, since we didn't want to get sick. But also on my brother's side, so he can get a bed and not a couch.\n\nAll hell broke loose - my brother was NOT happy. He was not happy that he drove 8 hours to see BF and I and now he has to stay in a hotel; Not happy that he had to take all of his belongings to the hotel while he's sick, etc. (which I would have helped him with if he offered, but he said he didn't want to wait for me).\n\nBF is saying that I am not being unreasonable and that I am doing the right thing, but deep down I still feel like a terrible sister...

      "description": "This is a bit complicated, so please be patient. I had a very abusive childhood. My dad was a religious, violent and controlling man. He abused my mum my whole life, until she ran away when I was 14. My dad has hit me, locked me in my room, destroyed my belongings, and controlled almost every aspect of my life including what I could watch and listen to (only christian music), or who I could be friends with (he threatend  friends he didn't like. I lost a lot of friends because of him). He did the same to my brothers. It has taken me YEARS of therapy to get to a place where I feel okay in the world. Up until a year ago, I hadn't spoken to my dad in three years and I was happy with that and moving on with my life. None of my 4 brothers speak to him either, but he has a new wife and two more kids and he seems pretty happy. \n\nLast year my brother told me my dad had cancer. I went to see him in hospital because I got told he was dying. It was hard to see him like that, but he pulled through somehow and was sent home. I went to dinner a couple of times with him and his new family but found the whole experience too uncomfortable. Dad was always very charming and he kept the conversation light and happy, and he boasted about his new kids and how wonderful they were. He tried to hug me a lot. In the end I had to tell him that I couldn't see him anymore, that it was too painful and weird, and that I can't just get over the years of abuse and be his happy little quiet daughter. \n\nHe claims to not remember abusing me. He even called up my mum and asked her about it, and called up my brother complaining about me. They both told him he was abusive, and gave him examples. He claims that all of us children are spreading lies about him. It's really weird and sad. After he spoke to Mum and my brother he sent me a text saying he \"apologises for everything\" but it's so vague and I know that he doesn't even think he was abusive at all. \n\nNow he just sends me messages, one every two weeks, saying he loves me and that I'm precious to him. And lately he's been trying to call me asking me to go camping with him and his new family. His wife sent me a text saying that he's crying all the time over me, and that he doesn't have long left. I just stand the thought of going camping with him. I can't stand seeing him be kind to his new kids, when he was such an asshole to us. And everyone is pressuring me to see him because he's dying but I can't bring myself to care about a man who didn't really ever care about me. \n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway because she uses reddit. \n\n\nI recently broke up with a girl who I had been dating for a couple months. I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she’s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost. Before I knew this, I hadn’t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn’t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah. Eventually, a month or two ago, we got to talking about what I was doing at that point in my life, and not wanting to cause conflict but also wanting to be truthful, I told her that I served in the Marines but never deployed. She was a little upset that I didn’t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn’t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she game me this spiel about how I should’ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal. Apparently her sister told her that she “shouldn’t be in a relationship with a liar” so she broke up with me. \n\nAITA for not telling her the truth?",

      "description": "To start, I'm not exactly sure what I want with this post. Maybe I just want to vent, I probably want advice.\n\nI have been a squatter for the last 3 or 4 years. I'm from the Netherlands so it might be a bit more common here, I don't know. Anyhoo, last november we heard that we (me and my roommate) have to leave our house. Nothing much I can do about that, that is just how it is with squatting. You win some you lose some. All this time I was under the impression that if it was ever needed, I could stay with my mom, because she has said so.\n\nI own two lovely cats, and for me it was implied that if I was to stay with my mom temporarily, I would take my cats with me. We are a package deal. However, since my moving out date has been closing in and so far I have no other options, she has been backtracking. She's been saying that she enjoys her house how it is, without pets. How clean it is now, and how little she has to do in terms of cleaning. I understand that, I love not having to clean.\n\nSo today I had a conversation with her, how it is very unlikely that I will find new housing within 4 weeks, and that my only option is to go stay with her with my cats until I find something else. That is when she said she doesn't want me to stay there if I bring my cats. My mother is not fond on animals in general (which I don't understand at all but whatever, you do you) and I can understand her not wanting animals in the house but for fucks sake, I am her daughter and I will be homeless in 4 weeks. I feel so rejected and I am so hurt and pissed, because to me it seems like she doesn't understand how much my cats mean to me. She straight up said that I would be welcome, if I dumped my cats somewhere else.\n\nOf course this turned into a huge fight, and I'm wondering if I have been unreasonable... to me, me and my cats are a package deal, they are family. I feel rejected because she is my mother and I have always felt like I could count on her no matter what, and it now feels like she wants to help me only under certain conditions. I haven't spoken to her since because I know I shouldn't say things out of anger or sadness, and that's why I am coming to you Reddit. AITA?",

      "description": "So I’m a thrifter.  I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I’m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I’ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of “I’m buying them for a friend” or “for a family member.”  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a “flipper” and a “scalper.”  I wasn’t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That’s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how “I’m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit” and “If I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy’s.”  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman’s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I’m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn’t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they’d call the police.  AITA?",

      "description": "This guy has been my best friend ever since elementary school. We’re both 25 now, and ever since he met his fiancé in high school we’ve talked about me being his best man. I was honored at the time he told me I would be. I guess I would still call him my best friend since I haven’t made any closer friends than him, but we haven’t seen each other in almost 2 years.\n\n\nHe went to college, I didn’t. We had pretty similar tastes and lifestyles in high school but as time went on we just became totally different people. I’ve never been the type to give a shit about fancy things or tradition, where as he’s alll about the finer things and following tradition. He moved out of the Midwest to the East Coast and I stayed.\n\n\nSo their plan was the wedding will be close to our hometown. Now last night he tells me the bachelor party will be in NYC, and he wants me to fly out there in May for the bachelor party. I admit that I came off as not that receptive to it, and he got heated about it and said it seems like I don’t care about being his best man. He compared me to his fiancé’s maid of honor who has already planned the whole bachelorette trip out.\n\n\nTruth is, I don’t care about the bachelor party. A lot of shit has changed in my life since he left. I don’t care about weddings, marriage certificates, diamond rings, or parties of any kind, much less bachelor parties with a bunch of guys I’ve never met.\n\n\nI just bought a car, I’m trying to build credit, I’m working my ass off to get ahead. It’s 2019, life is hard. Anyway, I’d have to take vacation, buy a plane ticket to NYC, plan and partially fund a bachelor party he won’t internally groan at, and then come back home and buy a $300 linen suit he wants everyone to wear for the wedding. I can’t bring my girlfriend because I didn’t ask him about it soon enough so they’d have to uninvite someone.\n\n\n\nI really love my friend. He’s a great guy with a good heart, and I know he’s head over heels for this girl. We just don’t relate anymore, even though that friendship chemistry will always be there. We aren’t the same anymore. So I want to know if I’m the asshole for being pissed at him. Am I being unreasonable?",

      "description": "Today I brought something up to my girlfriend that I have wanted to talk about for a while. You see, about six months ago my girlfriend went off her birth control because of the unpleasant side effects for her. She has tried numerous methods over the years and none of them have really “fit” for her. I was totally cool with going back to the standard condom program and thought it was the best move for her/us too, so no worries. We leave it with, “let’s talk about this in a few months and see how it’s working”.\n\nNow a brief note on our sex life - sorry. \n\nSee when we are in the passion of the moment, she always wants me to not actually wear a condom... She’s say, “let’s just do it without for a little bit”  and after a while when I go to grab one she’ll tel me to just pull out. If I insist on getting one she is super bummed and it kinda kills the mood. The whole thing makes me really nervous. \n\nAnyway, today the subject of birth control came up and I thought it would be a good time to follow up about her feelings towards birth control and if she wanted to keep off of it. She said she enjoyed not having to mess with her hormones and would rather stay off it. Great, I am stoked because I want her to do what’s right for her body and I told her as much. She said if we have an accident we could always use plan B and that she isn’t opposed to other measures either. \n\nSo I then bring up the condom situation and calmly tell her that it makes me really nervous. That I don’t think the pull out method is effective and that I need her support if we are gonna not have germinal birth control as a backup. \n\nShe responded to what I get was a heartfelt statement about my feelings with a simple “Ok”.\nI asked her what she thought about it and she was super dismissive, just said a few times how she didn’t think it was necessary and that she didn’t think she could get pregnant anyway. \n\nI just wanted to have a conversation about why she get this way and see if there was some middle ground solution we could arrive at but she was just shit down and wouldn’t talk about it. We were walking the dogs during all of this and she split off and said she needed some space and she’d see me back at come later. I took the long way back and she wasn’t here when I got back.\n\nI’m I the asshole here??\n",

      "description": "Ok, so this happened about four months ago, and it's still eating at me, and I'm just curious about other people's opinions.\n\nI'm in university in the US. Our Thanksgiving break was Thanksgiving and the day after. I booked flight tickets in October to see my sister during break, since she lives on the other side of the US. My cousin called me from the UK (our home country) a week before Thanksgiving, wanting me to come back over my break to visit him. He's one of my best friends, and I hadn't seen him since June when I went back to the US for an internship (I had two weeks after classes ended in May to see family). He was also really sick at this point, though I didn't know how sick when he called.\n\nI hadn't seen my sister since last Thanksgiving, and I had already booked the tickets and couldn't get a refund if I cancelled. Even though it was only £200 roundtrip, that was more than I could afford to lose as a broke student. I also looked at prices for flights home that week, and to make my schedule, the cheapest I could find was about £1300. Given all this (and again, not knowing how sick he was), I told him that I couldn't swing it, but I had two weeks between semesters, so I would come home then. He wasn't happy with this, and we didn't talk for like two days, but I think his wife or mum yelled at him because I was trying. He called me back and told me not to worry about coming over Christmas and to just save to come back over the summer.\n\nDuring my finals, my cousin had two major health episodes, and was in hospice before the end of the year. Because I didn't get the tickets home during Thanksgiving, they were now about £1800, and I didn't have the money to cover it. He passed just after my semester started, and though his wife set up Skype so I could attend virtually, I still missed seeing him in his last few months.\n\nHe didn't tell me about his health declining so rapidly, and I was focusing more on my finals after he called the second time and said not to worry until the summer. I still feel like such an asshole, though. AITA?",

      "description": "I (22F) live with my boyfriend (24M). We're both on the lease for my current apartment. I have two cats, a hamster and a mouse. I have wanted to get a dog for years, ever since I had to put down my childhood dog. I think it will help with my anxiety and depression issues as well as just be a great addition to my life. With our current apartment we have a fenced in yard and what I think is enough space to add a medium sized dog. I take care of all the animals, since they are mine, and would do the same with the new dog. My boyfriend has had to feed the cats like once or twice mostly when I was out of town but otherwise does nothing for their care. I want to start looking for a dog to rescue and add to my family. He doesn't think we have enough space and doesn't want to live with a dog \"yet\". We're planning to stay in this apartment for a while, so I don't know why the space would be an issue now and not later. I asked what I could do to help him feel ready for a dog and he didn't have an answer. I'm currently working part time and in school full time with most of my classes being online. This means my schedule is flexible and I'm home most days, which seems perfect for introducing a new pup. I feel like he'll never be \"ready\" to live with, not even take care of, a dog and that since he won't have to do anything with the dog it shouldn't be that big of a deal to get one. So what do you guys think? WIBTA if I get a dog? ",

      "description": "So, a little bit of background. My mother and my stepdad recently purchased a property in my city, where my mother plans on living in a tiny house. However, in addition to the tiny house, she would need a permanent address, as well as a place to do laundry, shower and store her things. Also, when it gets too cold in the winter she would live there. So, my parents have been looking for a suitable place (it ought to be ideally freshly renovated) for a really low price. So far they haven't had much luck.\n\nToday my mother called me to make me an \"offer\". She wants to come to my place to shower and do laundry 3x a week and live here a maximum of 2 months per year. In exchange, she wants to give me her expensive new living room furniture and a new kitchen, (which are things she insits on having in my flat, even though I have a kitchen and furniture which I would have to throw out). Also, because my flat is not up to her standards, she wants to renovate it (put in new tiles, paint etc.). Now, we did not intend on renovating the flat and also don't need furniture, however in exchange for these things she would like to have my bf's current bedroom rent free for the first 9 months and then pay 50% at the beginning of next year.\n\nNow, if my bf and I had intended to renovate the flat and needed new furniture this would be a great deal, but honestly living in a pile of rubble for months while they renovate my flat and then having my mother come live with us for two months in the winter just doesn't strike me as a good deal. My bf and I love living alone, since this is the first time we are able to live without additional roommates. Also our flat is quite small and my mother does not work, which means in the winter she might be here for two months constantly. She also wants to bring her cat, who is used to being outside 12 hours a day, and she can't go outside where we live. \n\nI thought my parents would understand that the deal they were offering me just wasn't that good for me. Yes, the furniture is expensive but I don't need expensive furniture and I can live in this flat without fresh paint on the walls. However, when I told them no just now they said that they were \"extremely disappointed\", because they apparently thought I would jump at this offer. Now, I feel like I am being harsh telling them that I don't want to live with my mother, even if it is only two months a year tops. So AITA? ",

      "description": "I've been seeing a girl for three months now; it's been getting serious for the last month (seeing each other multiple times a week, sleepovers at least once a week). She has two twenty-pound dogs who are kind of her babies... she's deeply attached to them, coddles them, brought them to the bar on our first date, etc. I also have a dog who I adore, so I'm sympathetic to her feelings about them. \n\nWhere I do not enjoy their presence, though, is in the bedroom. One of them in particular is deeply neurotic about us having sex and alternates between panicked attempts to get between us or panicked attempts to get out of the room. We've discussed some ways to fix this but she hasn't taken the initiative to actually solve the problem yet. Then, both of them sleep in the bed at night. The neurotic one spends a lot of time trying to get close to me to lick me, and the other one likes to lay right in between us, preventing any cuddling/spooning if I don't beat him to the spot right next to her. Because of them all sleepovers so far have been at her house so she can be there for them (I'm able to leave my dog with a friend some nights to be at her place).\n\nI really like this girl and I respect that the dogs are really important to her. I've dealt with it up til now, but I'm starting to get frustrated with all this. Bed is a sacred space for me to relax and be comfortable (my dog is never allowed into mine), and the cuddling/touch/sex that happens there is one of the main \"languages\" that I feel loved in. AITA if I tell her we need to start having sleepovers at my house without her dogs if she can't keep hers out of her bed? And what if that's an okay compromise for now but not long-term? If we were ever to live together I think it would be a dealbreaker for me if she insisted on letting them in all the time. FWIW I would be okay with the dogs in the bed by invitation, but the majority of the time I want them out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I are both college students.  She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? ",

      "description": "I am 17 years old and I have a mother who always seems to blames me or my older brother almost everytime something goes wrong around the house, like yesterday me and my mother share a phone charger since my own charger broke last month and the charger we shared became faulty (I guess because it was being plugged back and forth between our phones in such a quick time) and when it was my turn to use the charger it wouldn’t charge my phone, and so I told my mother and she started blaming me for it, even though she was the last person to use it. I told her, that the charger likely stopped working because we were pulling it around too much but she blamed me anyways and when I would constantly explain to her what possibility happeneded she accused me of talking back to her and then started yelling at me dead in the night and told me to leave her room in which I did. Now I could’ve bought my own charger some days ago with my own money, but my mom wanted me to spend my OWN money on some fast food for both of us and I didn’t have much money either, and when I mention her paying me back for it she would guilt trip me. This is one of the millions of times that she has made a big fuss out of things that were beyond my control and when I would correct her about it and I’m ALWAYS right when I correct her, she would fuss at me and go for low blows that she knows that I’m sensitive about and that would kind of ampt me up a bit but I would cool down and walk away.

      "title": "AITA for staying with my exhibitionist husband when I'm an asexual?",
      "description": "Throwaway account because my husband is a redditor.\n\nProbably should include a trigger warning for sexual acts and marital rape.\n\nMy husband and I have been together for almost four years, married for about a year and a half. I always thought I might be asexual (my parents used to think I might have been sexually abused as a really young child because of how sex repulsed I've always been). I didn't know for sure until I got married. Because I grew up in a Christian family, we never really explored that until after we said, \"I do,\" and it was a little late to find out the extent of my asexuality once we were officially married and I was having a hard time getting into sex, wanting sex, or feeling like I was being raped because I wanted to keep my husband happy, but I didn't like to have sex.\n\nIn a lot of ways, I do think I've experienced marital rape. In small ways, like the fact that I used to say no a lot, and he'd proceed with, \"Please, just let me.\" I took it because I thought that's what I was supposed to do. My husband is not a mean man. He's very very broken, not good socially, and I have to take responsibility for not being good at communicating with him what I like and don't like. I think that's partially because I have really bad anxiety and I go into shock when things I would rather not happen are happening to me.\n\nSo, recently, my husband came out and told me he'd been performing sexual acts on a chatterbox account for money. He said he started the account in September and hadn't done it again since November. Of course, this was the same night he told me he had quit his job without any notice because he was tired of dealing with assholes at work. \n\nTo my husband's credit, he's been working the night shift for seven months now. It's very difficult for us to see each other if he doesn't go to bed and get up at a decent time. Some days we will see each other for ten minutes total. I didn't want him to have this job, but it seemed like he wasn't interested in looking for a different one. So, he walked out of his job, then told me about the chatterbox account.\n\nI've told him before how sorry I feel that we are so different sexually. I've told him that I wondered if I would be able to stay with him and let him explore other things sexually if it would keep him happy, but he said he didn't need that and wouldn't want to do that. I know, it sounds really stupid that I even brought this up as an option. But, I try very hard to be a wife that lets him make his own decisions and doesn't clutch to traditional marriage ideals so much that I can't be reasonable if he wants to do something I'm not immediately comfortable with. I really do feel bad that I can't be what he needs sexually, and if I was to just suck it up and have sex when he wanted it, he wouldn't like that either. He knows I don't enjoy it.\n\nI told him last night when he broke the news to me that what he did was cheating. He said he didn't want to ask my permission because he knew I'd say no. I told him that was a pretty clear red flag that he shouldn't have done it. He disagreed with me that what he did was cheating. However, he made money off of masturbation, using toys, and who knows what else, received messages and solicitations from strangers off the internet, and used the excuse of, \"I never want to be with anyone else but you, it was just for the money and the sexual release.\"\n\nMy aunt, who is the only other person that knows about this, suggested that I leave him. This, of course, isn't the only thing wrong with our relationship. We have a lot of problems right now, but I told her I couldn't imagine my life without him in it. It sucks, but he's my greatest friend. My only friend. Despite how this post may appear, he really is a creative, talented, kind individual with some really deep-seated issues.\n\nAITA for wanting to stay with him even thought its miserable for me and possibly selfish for me to want to keep him to myself even though he isn't getting what he needs sexually? Thanks in advance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; My husband has been performing sex acts for strangers on the internet without my knowledge or consent, and I can't help but feel it's because I'm asexual, and I should just let him go.

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years. She was born in Brazil and moved to Michigan with her parents when she was 10 years old. Obviously she is fluent in Portuguese. I have obviously picked up some words and phrases through out the relationship but I will admit that I haven't put that much effort to learn the language. In high school I was never good with Spanish and I am just not good with languages. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA year ago when we started getting more serious and started talking about marriage she started insisting  I HAVE to learn Portuguese. She went on about how our kids will have to be bilingual and started trying to teach me but I didn't really have the patience and she got frustrated. For my birthday she got me a Rosetta Stone program and signed me up for Portuguese classes and said she would really appreciate it if I put in the effort to learn. To make her happy I said I would but after doing it a few times I got tired of it and dropped it. I told her this and obviously she was annoyed but let it go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe recently got in a huge argument over this because we were panning a trip to Brazil in a few months and she just got mad that I can barely speak any Portuguese and that I won't be able to communicate with her family. I thought she was over reacting and obviously I'll try my best to communicate with her family but in the end I' not dating her family I'm dating her and both her and her parents can speak english. Honestly if she wanted her boyfriend to be able to speak Portuguese so badly why is she dating me? I just don't get it. She then started going on about how would we be able to raise our kids bilingual if I can't speak Portuguese and I said that she can speak to them in Portuguese and I can speak to them in English and it will be fine. She's still angry though and wants to cancel our trip to Brazil. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here? Should I really be forced to learn an language when I'm bad with languages and I don't rally need to?

He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I’d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, “never listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they’ll work, but trust me, it’s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.”\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?",

She was 4 at the time we met(ex’s kid, not my ex) She never really knew her dad. Being the only father figure in her life I tried to be a decent person even after the breakup to hopefully prevent her being exposed to any of the issues. \n\nWe lived together for the last 3 years of our relationship and thus we were suppose to share the responsibilities of the financial obligations. However she ended up moving from full time work in a hospital where she made good money to weekend shifts at a retail store and going back to school full time. At the time of her decision to go back to school we agreed that with the money she would make from work and the money I currently made. I would pay all of the bills and she would use her money to supplement those bills as she could. We also agreed that when she returned to work after school, which was only a 14 month program that she would resume paying those bills and I would be able to go to school for an upgraded license for my industry. \n\nSkip to the last year of our relationship. At some point in time she came across $4000, and decided to give me all of it to help pay the bills that I had been struggling with for the last 12 months. (Part of the precious arrangement was me working additional hours to cover the added expenses) The deal was that I would give her $1000 back when she finished because she had a few things she wanted to do with that extra cash.  I agreed to this and told her that it wouldn’t be possible until she finished and we were both earning again. \n\nSkip to a nasty ending to the relationship. She cheated, and after discussing the relationship issues caused from that. I broke up with her, helped her move and removed her from our rentals lease. I also gave her immediately the $1000 we agreed on back, from my savings. \n\nCurrently, over 3 months after all of the break up. She calls me asking me I’m returning ALL of the money that she “let me barrow”. Being confused I asked what she meant and she basically played silly, and decided to pretend that she never agreed to these arrangements and that she wants it all back. I asked her why she thought that playing a game about how she “didn’t remember” and “would have never done that, because she would regret it”. She then hung up and texted me saying that I would hear from her attorney. \n\nNow I’m not stressed about the attorney because I have a chat log where we briefly discussed this during the break up. It clearly shows her initiating the conversation and asking if she was still going to get the money I agreed to return. In that conversation she says that “I know you don’t have the 1000 right now, but I will eventually need it.” I think that’s enough to disregard the fact that she didn’t know about what we had agreed on. \n\nSo really I’m just wondering if I’m the asshole for not wanting to return the additional money because I paid for everything up until the end, beside that money. I am financially better off than she is, and I could afford to give it to her, which she is using against me saying that I’m basically stealing from her daughter by not giving it back. Her saying that has made me feel like a complete ass hole for not giving it to her, and I am honestly very conflicted about this situation now. So now I’m here. \n\nI left out some of the context to try to prevent a bias towards her or I for anything outside of this specific situation but will provide the rest if this isn’t clear enough. \n",

      "title": "AITA for dumping my cat on my girlfriend's sister?",
      "description": "Before we get into it, here's a quick summary of the events leading up to this. My girlfriend and I were living with her grandmother because she needed people around to help her with general living and we were looking for a place to move into together. There with us was our cat, Turnip.\n\nHer grandmother decided to move to a full assisted living facility after being diagnosed with dementia. As such, my girlfriend and I had to move out. We were able to rent the downstairs of my aunt and uncle's place while we looked for something more permanent. We, of course, also brought Turnip with us. A few weeks after that, I had decided to go back to school for EMT training. I ended up failing the class but wanted to try again. Unfortunately, I had used all my savings already as I couldn't work full time and keep my grades up.\n\nLuckily for me, my parents are very generous and offered to have my girlfriend and I stay with them while I attended school again. The down side was that my parents had 3 dogs, one of which had killed my mom's cat not too long before we moved in. Because of this, we asked my girlfriend's sister if she would take Turnip until I finished school and found our own place, at which time we would take Turnip back. I estimated this to take 4-6 months (3 for school then 1-3 to find a job and a place to live). However, before we moved out of my girlfriend's grandma's Turnip had stopped eating. We took him to the vet and they said it's either IBS or cancer. In either case, they gave us a steroid to help him start eating again.\n\nIf it was IBS, he would just need to take the steroid for the rest of his life. If it was cancer, the medication would eventually stop working and he would starve unless we put him down. He was given 6-9 months in that instance. My girlfriend's sister took him 5 months after that.\n\nTurnip's current living situation is being confined to my girlfriend's sister's room at all times. She already had 2 other male cats, and Turnip was also a male. He didn't have any experience with other cats and they tried to integrate him in but he and the alpha of the other two did nothing but fight and piss all over everything. So the decision was made to keep them separate. Another thing of note, is that ever since he was born, Turnip hasn't been very nice. If you try to pet him he will most likely try to scratch you. Heck, even if you stand next to him he might take a swing. He's been this way since he was a kitten and he's only ever liked one person, a friend of the grandmother.\n\nIt's been almost a year since his diagnosis and he seems to be doing fine. I decided not to go back to school (which I would have started this month) and am looking for work. We still intend on taking Turnip back when we find a place to live. However, my girlfriend's sister is now demanding we take him back because she doesn't want to deal with him anymore. We've explained why we can't but she still demands I convince my parents to let us take him. Nobody in my family thinks it's a good idea. Neither I nor my girlfriend do either. She insists we can just keep him confined in our room at my parent's and it won't be an issue. I think that, unlike her other cats, my parent's dogs (one of which is specifically bred to hunt wild boars) will just leave it alone.\n\nI also don't think it's fair she ask this of us when she agreed to keep him for what would have been a longer period (had I attended school it would have been at least another 3 months before I found a job). I think she was counting on him dying after a few months and realized he's not going to and is trying to make us take him back.\n\nSo what do you think? AITA?\n\ntl;dr girlfriend's sister agreed to watch cat until we got our own place, she is now trying to make us take him back even though he could easily be killed",

When there are competitons and team practices, we both go but he doesn't go as much as I do. Our team captain says that there is a competition that is on March 9 and I say I join but I didn't sign a form yet because I didn't have one. \n\nSo fast forward to, like 5 minutes ago. I just told my dad about the competition because I thought he knew (he's friends with the coach who works at the place  where the competition will take place) and he told me that we're going to another city during March 9 because of his Alumni Homecoming. I was like \"Ok, let me just tell my team that I won't be able to go then.\" I go to our group chat and I say \"Eyyy, I can't go to the competition because my family and I are going somewhere.\" So then my supposed-to-be partner texted the group that Kevin and him will be partners instead but Kevin ain't replying (he didn't see it yet too). The soon-to-be leader then texted the group \"He joined the team but he doesn't join the competitions. Sorry but this is really irritating me.\" So then I text \"Sorryyyyy but they just told me like 2 minutes ago\". She then texted me personally and not the group \"it's not you\". And then she proceeded to leave our group chat. I don't know if she was actually reffering to me but just said that she didn't or if she was reffering to Kevin instead.\n\nAITA? ",

I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever.

What she has is Schizophrenia and OCD and she told me that she didn’t plan on staying on medication while in college because it would stifle her art and that she would be just fine if I helped her. \n\nWhen she told me this, I didn’t reply to her for a few days and took time to think, I decided that she’d hidden a big secret from me and that I didn’t want to be her caretaker, if she decided to be unmediated, that was something she could do without my help or my approval. I told her this in those exact words and called the housing office and got a different friend, Mei, as my roommate. \n\nAfterwards, Gemma blew up in the group and told me that I was being ableist and discriminatory against her and that she’d take medicine if we could live together and how I’d promised to be her roommate. Now I’m feeling like I should call and tell the housing office that I wouldn’t mind having her as a roommate, I’ve never been in a situation like this and surely it wouldn’t hurt to give her a chance? \n\nAITA in this situation?

She's not getting paid for this, it's totally volunteer, and it's 15 months from now. She's not even trying to find a replacement. She's flaked. \n\nI feel like she's choosing a volunteer position over my wedding.  She has said that dance is a big part of her life and it's really important to her.  She says I should be more understanding.  I can't see myself staying friends with her after this.

She got a great sense of humor thanks to me (a trait the two of us share but neither of our parents does), as well as a love for videogames, anime and other nerdy stuff. Some of my best memories were spent with her, playing games side by side, or her watching me play through something that's too difficult for her, or me helping her beat her first game. \n\nAnd then she entered high school (this was a few years ago, when she was 13), and things changed. She suddenly matured a lot, both in terms of her personality and body. She started getting interested in make-up, fancy shampoos and clothes, which I (despite being female) never quite cared about, these things have always been a means to an end rather than something to obsess about. She got her own group of friends her age for the first time (she's often had 1-2 close friends but has never been part of a group). Eventually she found a boyfriend too. And you know what? That's fantastic and perfectly normal. I was a loser in high school, the weird kid everyone bullied and made fun of, but she's a popular girl, a cheerleader and overall highly social. Which is great, and I genuinely could not be happier that she's having fun in school.\n\nThe problems started to emerge when her personality shift suddenly made me second fiddle. Obviously our relationship could never be the same as it used to be, she's a teenager and I'm in my 20s, with a job, I get that we wouldn't be able to spend too much time together. But we barely spent *any* time together at all. Every evening she brought along her group of friends to girly scream all night, which sucked considering the fact that I was trying to sleep. Requests to do this less often were rebuffed by both her and my mother (who considers me the disappointment of the family and is beyond happy my sister is turning out so different from me). This ultimately led to me moving out. \n\nAfter that, whenever I tried to initiate contact with her I'd usually be rebuffed. Half the time whenever I said hi to her on Messenger she'd leave me hanging on \"seen\", and when I asked her about it she used the excuse of \"Oh, the messages are not showing up for me\" (bullshit). Whenever I asked to hang out, either at my place to play something or watch a movie, or maybe hang out at the mall or go for coffee (I try to meet her halfway, interest-wise) she'd say yes, and then when a day before the date or sometimes on the date itself she'd message me saying she's made plans with a friend of hers and won't be coming. I'd invite the family to dinner at my place, and last-minute I'd get a call from my mother telling me my sister doesn't feel like coming.\n\nGradually we lost touch. The first time this happened we didn't speak for about a year, and us getting back in touch was mostly orchestrated by my mother. She was overjoyed to have me back in her life, and I was too, and for a while things were great! This lasted maybe a month, maybe two tops, and then she was back to her old self again, and the same thing happened, we stopped speaking. And that brings us to our current situation. A few months ago she messages me out of the blue and is like \"Let's hang out\", so I say sure, why not, olive branch and stuff. We hang out, it's super fun, and she off-handedly mentions that her boyfriend has a D&amp;D group that he refuses to let her into, and she'd really like to play. I say \"Don't worry, I've ran D&amp;D games too, I'll invite a few friends over and we can play.\"\n\nI organize everything, invite her, her boyfriend and three of my own friends to play, and it was without a doubt the worst D&amp;D session I've ever had in my life, mostly because of her. Her character was completely wrong for the setting (she wanted to play Connor from \"Detroit\" in a fantasy setting), she had almost no usable skills, and despite the fact that a few days prior we went over this and told her to make a paladin with certain skills, even going over the character backstory together, she listened to none of that. Halfway through she completely refused to participate at all, just sat quietly on her phone while the rest of us played. Surprise-surprise, after the fact she whined to her boyfriend about how \"left out\" she felt, and he happily invited her into his own D&amp;D group. The three friends and I planned to continue playing, and I invited the boyfriend over with us since he seemed to have fun, but he said my sister told him he wouldn't be a real man by her if he went. So he refused. And it's really hard for me not to see this whole thing, with her suddenly getting back into touch, as a plan for her to get what she wanted and couldn't have, namely a place on her boyfriend's group. \n\nI'm thoroughly disgusted by her behavior in front of my friends and cut contact, and she doesn't try to contact me either (I haven't blocked her anywhere but neither of us write). Very recently I happened to adopt a kitten, the sweetest, most lovable snugglebug in the whole world. My mother came over and fell in love with her, and she regularly comes by to play with her while I'm at work. This week she took my sister along with her, and apparently my sister really loved the kitten. Right as rain, today I get a call from my sister out of the blue saying how sorry she is for the D&amp;D and asking to come hang out. And I wasn't mean, I wasn't rude, but I honestly explained that we're not really friends anymore, we've grown too far apart, and this has been working out for me. It's amazing to not have someone who treats you like you're nothing most of the time, it really is. And she said \"Okay, I'm sorry\" and burst into tears. \n\nAnd now I feel like an absolute ass. Because on one hand maybe she contacted me out of the blue, like before, to get something she wants - namely time to spend with the kitten. After all why contact me now, of all times? She had plenty of time before. Not to mention even if her intentions are 100% unrelated to the kitten, what's my guarantee that she won't start treating me like dirt in 2-3 weeks? After all this behavior is nothing new, she's been doing it for years, and I doubt she's matured enough in just a few months. But on the other, what if this was a genuine attempt for her to try and change our relationship for the better? What if she truly wanted to turn over a new leaf and I shut her down? I'd love to have her as a friend, I really would, but only if she was willing to put in the work to be my friend rather than making me do it all. If she's planning to go back to her old tricks, or just uses me as an excuse to come pet my cat, then I don't really need her in my life. \n\nI don't know her intentions and this is really the source of my conflict. Should I have given her yet another shot hoping she'd matured and learned from her mistakes? Am I the asshole for rejecting her?",

      "description": "prepare to pass judgement on a seven year old. \n\ni was a girl back then. i had three friends that where boys. we where tight (though we very much went separate ways once we became teens) we had bonded over our love for pretending to be dragons at recess.\n\nOur school was having a dance. this was the first year that i was old enough to go and i was very excited, everyone was, we didn't know that school dances sucked yet. I went home and gave my mom the hand out some dumb teacher made in word in like two seconds and begged her to go. she said that more than likely we would be going to my aunts that day, so probably not (remember that probably for later). \n\nI came to school the next day. it was raining so indoor recess. We couldn't play our dragon game inside very well, so the boys went to play some other game while I was playing blocks with another friend. \n\nSuddenly one of the boys comes up, we will call him Runny Nose, for reasons you can probably figure out, and asks \"hey do you wanna go to the dance with me\" well, mom said i probably cannot go to dance, and your saposed to want to kiss the boys you go to dances with. I did not want to kiss Runny Nose, so I said \"no, we are probably going to my aunts so I cannot go\". He goes away.\n\nA little later boy 2, lets call him Tantrum, comes up and asks if i want to go to the dance. Tantrum, well he had a lot of Tantrums and while he is fun at recess hes actually pretty scary sometimes (later in life he does go to juvie multiple times). I also tell him \"my parents say we are probably going to my aunts that day\". He goes away.\n\nI shit you not boy three, Ginger comes up. Ginger asks me to the dance. I like ginger. He is quiet, smart, nice, seven year old me thought he was kinda cute, and he takes his dragons very seriously. His dad is part of a secret organization that catches real life dragons and studies them. Sometimes he gets to go to work with him. Looking back now I see some flaws in these claims. I actually kinda want to go to the dance with him. My mom did say we may not go to my aunts.... so I tell him \"maybe\". \n\nThe next day during lunch there is a fist fight, to my suprise it was my three friends. what could they be fighting about? They are taken upstairs. I ask my other friends if i can play tag with her group since it looks like there will be no dragons today. Half way through recess I am called inside. I was a good kid so i was very nervous and confused. They bring me to the classroom where my three friends sit. The teacher asks the boys why they fought. Runny Nose says \"because we asked them to the dance and they said no to us, but yes to \\[Ginger\\]\".\n\n I didn't get in trouble or anything. Looking back im pretty sure the teacher thought the whole thing was adorable. Honestly i don't really remember what happened after except that I ended up going to my aunts. So was seven year old me an asshole for turning down two guys but then saying maybe to the third? My fate rests in your hands.",

      "title": "AITA for yelling at my aunt on Thanksgiving because she kept making passive aggressive comments about a crime I committed 10+ years ago?",
      "description": "Using a throwaway account b/c I have friends who know my regular username, and don’t really want to call to attention this issue I’m having with my family. \n\n\nSome background: I committed a crime about 10 years ago (I agree I was an asshole at the time, but time marches forward). This particular crime is something the people of reddit demonize others for - I was at a friends house for my birthday and my friend made me dinner and had bought some wine for us to share. I had 2 glasses of wine over the course of about 2+ hours and felt tired. I got pulled over for doing about 6 miles over the speed limit and blew a .09, I blew several more times and my BAC kept going down each time. Both my lawyer and the cop told me it would have probably been under a .08 if I had waited another hour. I never would have driven if I knew I was over the limit, my group of friends were always the type to play it safe. We shared cab fare, had DDs, rented hotel rooms downtown, or spent the night at various friends places whenever we planned on drinking. It never occurred to me that my body couldn’t process wine in a little over 2+ hours. \n\n\nI was devastated when this happened, I fell into a deep depression. I was convinced I would never have friends again, no one would care for me, I would never get a job again, I was not worthy of love, etc. My depression was compounded by the fact my my aunt (mom’s sister) and my aunt’s son (cousin) would basically tell me that I was a total piece of shit. They told me that I should be locked away and forgotten about. They told me I was worthless. They would refer to me as “criminal” and not my actual name. They would call me an alcoholic. They told me I would never get married because no one could love someone who is criminal scum. And for the first year after this happened I believed them. I stopped seeing any of my friends, I was terrified of even having any sort of alcohol in my apartment, I stopped having any sort of life because I knew I was absolutely worthless. \n\n\nI’d visit my parents occasionally and sometimes my aunt would be there, and she would turn the topic around to me and what I did. I’d see my aunt and cousin around the holidays and various family events, they made sure to spread the gossip around so everyone knew. It was so incredibly embarrassing. Prior to falling in to a deep depression I was the type to hike, run 5ks, participate in bike marathons, lift weights and volunteered a lot of nonprofits with my friends. Our group frequently volunteered with Habitat For Humanity multiple times a year, and I stopped doing this. \n\n\nThis happened back in 2008, it’s now 2018 and my aunt and cousin always bring it up everytime I see them. They couldn't help but to call me out whenever they saw me, they would make a snide comment and I'd feel like shit all over again. It took me a long time to get out of my depression because of them. I finally managed to lose weight and become a better person over time. \n\n\nI finally snapped this past Thanksgiving. Just like the last 10 Thanksgiving and the last 10 Xmases they spend a good portion of the day making horrible “jokes” at my expense. I hosted Thanksgiving this year, and my mom really wanted aunt and cousin to come, she said that she had talked to her sister and that she wouldn’t bring up my dwi this year. I was skeptical but my husband and I really wanted to host and cook this year, as it would be our first thanksgiving as a married couple. \n\n\nAunt and cousin didn’t keep their promise. Cousin saw our wine rack, asked if he should call “the betty ford clinic for me.” They asked my husband how he could marry a criminal and if he happened to be a felon, unemployed or an alcoholic - because they couldn’t imagine any other type to marry a low life like me. Aunt asked if my job had found out about my past yet, b/c they’ll probably fire me when they discover it. She asked how I was able to have a \"real office job with computers\" and not some shitty retail position with a criminal history like mine. She inquired how a criminal was able to own a home. She asked if I had started to drinking as soon as I got up that day. She wonders how it’s possible for me to be so thin when alcohol has so many calories in it and implied I must have a \"liquid diet\" and only eat solids on special occasions. They kept making passive aggressive comments like this throughout the evening. My husband opened a bottle of wine (he doesn’t give a shit what these people say, and if he feels like having a glass of wine with dinner, he’s going to have one. My ability to care was also fading, so I had him pour me a glass too). So, I had a glass of wine (in my own fucking home) and my aunt said “I hope you aren’t planning on driving after that, we all know you can’t control yourself.” After she said that I kinda lost my shit. \n\n\nI basically said something along the lines of - \n\n\n“For a criminal scumbag I sure have accomplished a lot more than you and your son combined. Your kid is in his 30s and hasn’t left home yet, and is a college drop out who never found a real job because his only talents are sitting on his ass and playing video games.  I’ve been with the same company for the past 7 years and just got another promotion with a hefty pay raise, alcoholics can’t do that. I have a house and a wonderful husband, you’ve had two failed marriages and can’t seem to keep a new man for more than a few months. Also, have you noticed how thin and muscular I am? You can’t build muscle when you’re an alcoholic! The only thing you and your idiot son ever have to say is about something stupid I did 10 fucking years ago. And I think I know why - you literally have nothing interesting going on in your life at all, the only thing remotely interesting you ever have to talk about is ME. Maybe if you found a hobby - how about dieting and maybe trying to eat a vegetable for the first time in your fucking life - you could perhaps come up with a new god damn topic other than something dumb I did when I was in my early 20s for fucks sake.” \n\n\nIt was awkward after that. My two siblings thought it was hilarious, they never liked aunt much anyway, and would be quick to defend me in the past. Mom tried to play shitty mediator by saying I shouldn’t have yelled or swore, but it’s okay for me to defend myself, and told my aunt that she’s always too hard on me and to let it go. Dad never liked aunt basically told aunt she was asking for it. Cousin responded with just a “fuck you” and was huffy and silent until they left. Aunt was in hysterics about being spoken to in a such a manner, and that I’m an entitled and ungrateful “little girl”. Husband asked aunt and cousin to leave, they say more mean things and finally leave. Mom is still kinda angry with me for making a big fuss and told me that her sister likes to be crass and make jokes, but she’s still family and I should eventually apologize to aunt and cousin. I don’t share this feeling with my mom. Wanted to see if I should apologize and just accept they will continue to say horrible things to me. ",

I knew I didn't have anything worth stealing and I had idiotic delusions of whatever badassery I may be able to do if he actually tried anything. most likely could have died in any other scenario.\n\ntake the deal after going inside to piss and get soda. let him in and start driving. this would be around the time my phone died.\n\nhour 1 (10:00pm)\n\nthe road is quite and calm. the radio is useless given its only tuned into san angelo radio frequencies. kinda silent accept the guy getting religious, calling friends saying that i'm a nice dude for doing this. my ego is feeling nice. more compliments that first hour then i've gotten in a week.\n\na little chatty and annoying but I deal with it because cash. still dont know where the frick lubbock is.\n\nhour two:\n\nstill lost, getting annoyed now. finally explained that his wife dumped him there after an argument, apparently they where there to visit there son, wasn't aware san angelo had a prison but coolio dudeio.\n\nhour 3:\n\ngas is getting low. but manageable, think i'll stop at a gas station. nope, I missed the exit. dude got alittle annoyed but told me there was one up further ahead.\n\nhour 4\n\nno gas station. he admits were lost. im ready to fucking cry because i realize how stupid this entire thing was, guy offers extra twenty to keep going.\n\nhour five.\n\nhad to turn around, guy getting extra pissy, told me my driving sucked. found self serve gas station, gave him back the money and told him im sorry. were both sobbing. I sit in my car and panic for a bit.\n\nhour 6:\n\nI make it to another gas station, call my grandparents. no one picks up, gose to bathroom to panic a bit more, im fucking lost in the back roads of texas.\n\nask for directions, get some decent directions from nice cashier.\n\napparently my grandparents called back the moment I left.\n\nstop at another gas station to get more directions, then one last one just to make sure Im heading the right way. dude was nice enough to let me look at his phone map for a little.\n\nhour 7:\n\nI finally make it back to san angelo, spend a good amount of time crying tears of utter euphoria as I hear the radio blair the same shitty pop songs, drive down streets, my autistic mind finally associating a clear path home. got home, cried and went to sleep.\n\nI feel like shit about having to drop him off, I just knew I wouldn't be able to find my way back if I actually managed to get to lubbock. am I an asshole?\n\nI feel only a little bit better about giving him the money back but fuck man.",

      "description": "I and my gf have decided to go on trip for holiday season which also happens to be her birthday. I did all of the booking and trip planning as she was not interested. I've asked her would she like get a nicer place or something more frugal and go wild in the city with shopping and whatnot. She suggested the latter.\n\nAnyway I got a great deal on airbnb private room that was well reviewed which turned out to be a disaster. We arrived there, the conditioner was loud and a lot of other minor issues like shared bathroom. After spending there two nights I convinced her to move a hotel in city center. We moved there in the middle of the night as she couldn't sleep because of the loud aircon and at the new place she just lashed out to me in all sorts of ways for not caring for her and stopped talking to me.\n\nI've already got her an early birthday present before we left to boot so the trip is not her birthday present per se.\n\nI feel pretty terrible that my trip didn't go as planned and I feel that I've back packed and traveled enough to build up a thicker skin but maybe I wasn't thoughtful enough for her. And I kinda enjoy adventure. \n\nShe said this trip supposed to be special for us but I can't really afford a high end hotel and all of the extra expenses.\n\nNow that I write it out I'm rather certain that I'm not the asshole here and have to rethink parts of this relationship but maybe can someone prove me wrong here or at least get some entertainment from this story.\n",

It's blown over now, I'm just asking.\n\nSo for some context, in a reddit-related discord server of mine (that is very loosely related to Stan Lee/Comics) I commented:\n\n&gt;[...] referring Stan Lee's death [...] **I'm not sure why it's such a big deal but apparently it is.**\n\nThis ticked off some people in the server who called me rude, insensitive, dismissive and disrespectful, to which I elaborated that as a non-American who isn't really into comics I had no personal investment so I wasn't aware so many people did, to which people started calling me ignorant and responded increasingly aggressively.\n\nThis discussion went on like this for a few minutes, until I got temporarily banned from the channel I was talking in while no one else did.\n\nQuestion is, was I the asshole here?

      "description": "Things aren't looking too good right now.\n\nI will try to keep this short. I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year now, and we have a really great relationship. I truly love her and she's amazing, it's been going very well between the two of us.\n\nMy girlfriend has a best friend who is often with us when we're hanging out. They've been friends since they were 5 years old and they're now 22, so you can imagine how close they are. Whenever I go over to my girlfriend's place she's there. Naturally I became pretty close with her too as we were spending a lot of time together. \n\nFor the past few weeks I've been trying to distance myself from this friend because I realized that I have a huge crush on her. This hasn't worked at all, because she noticed that something was up and started texting me more and more saying I can talk to her. I told her I was fine and to not worry about me. She's so sweet and caring that she came by my place to check on me and brought some of my favorite food. We talked a bit and ate dinner until I made up an excuse that I had to leave. \n\nToday I didn't know what to do anymore and I decided to tell my girlfriend. She thought I was joking at first, but once she noticed I was serious she got mad. She was crying and very angry, calling me all sorts of names. She did thank me for being honest but asked me to leave. Since then I haven't heard from my girlfriend but have received a few supportive messages from said friend, and that she wanted to talk. I don't know what she knows and I'm afraid that I screwed up everything me and girlfriend had. \n\nI feel terrible. I don't have much words for it.\n\nAm I the asshole for having a crush and telling me girlfriend? Is this something I should have kept to myself instead? I don't know.

Instead she wants me to say something like “shall we ask the attendant” or “lets go and ask them”. I don’t say “ask them” as a command or with any malicious intent. I just say that because it’s short and quick and it’s how I always talk with my brothers and friends. Am I in the wrong here? Idk how to explain to her that this is just how I say it without her getting angry at me. \n\nPlease note that my Chinese is pretty broken so I can’t successfully convey my questions to the attendants myself and their English is equally broken. That’s why I don’t ask them myself. ",

Anyway, we recently met up again at a nightclub with my friends and she dragged me away from my friends. We were both pretty drunk and I said that I liked her and she said good, and told me she wanted to get more drunk. She then brought me to a sofa to cuddle, before her friend came and told us to go somewhere else. Anyway, she kissed me on the cheek and told me to hold her stuff while she went to the toilet. I waited for over an hour and got super pissed so I left her stuff there to hang out with my friends.\n\nAnyway, she got her phone back and I said that if she wanted to go out, then I'm fine with that. She immediately just tells me that we were not flirting at all and that I was misreading signs. I tell her she obviously led me on and making me wait that long was a really bitchy thing to do when I could have been with my real friends. She says that she doesn't know how she can make it up to me, I tell her she can't and we stop talking. ",

      "description": "I have a very close friend group of 6 friends. We have all been friends since high school and we tell each other *everything.* We were around 19 and one of them (say Kate) was single and still a virgin, but she was looking for a relationship and someone she loved.\n\nAt my job there was this cute guy (say John) that I hadn’t actually met. So with Kate’s permission, I gave John her phone number. They ended up getting together after their first date. A week in, Kate happily tells us that she’d lost her virginity and that 2 seconds after they’d finished John had written ‘V card’ on index card, asked her to hold it, and then taken it out of her hand saying that ‘he stole her V card’. \n\nWe told her that we were happy that she was happy, but we thought that it was pretty soon, since she had said she wanted to lose it to someone she loved. We also questioned his intentions considering the whole ‘V card’ thing and that he’d sent a picture of the ‘V card’ to all of his friends. She said she’d sent us the picture too because it was funny.\n\nA couple weeks later we hung out with John and Kate. The whole time John was constantly being overly sexual with Kate in front of us. He slapping her butt, heavily kissing her, making sex jokes and talking about things he wanted to do to her. Later, Kate again asked us what we thought about John. Some of us told her we still questioned his intentions because of how he’d been acting. Kate started to feel uneasy about it so she went and talked to John. I tend to be the most vocal one in our group, so of course I had been one of the main voices. After they were done talking John comes over to me and yells at me asking what my problem is and saying that I should be happy Kate is happy, stay out of their relationship, stop making her think he’s an asshole, come to him if I had a problem and stop being a bitch. I yelled at him, telling him I’m not a yes man and if she asks my opinion, I’m gonna tell her what I think because I genuinely care about her. By this point I was pissed of at John and at Kate just standing there watching. \n\nKate is my friend! I wasn’t bitching behind his back, I was expressing my concerns to my friend when she asked what I thought. He spent the rest of the party bad mouthing me while Kate was with him. Later Kate and I got into a fight. She was angry because I ‘wasn’t happy she was happy’ and she ‘just wanted things to go back to how they were’, but I was pissed at John for coming at me after I said he was sketchy and at Kate for letting him talk about me like that without saying anything. We all made up eventually and Kate and John are still together. But every time it’s brought up it still irks me. She had known him for 2 weeks, but had been my friend for 6 years. I still personally don’t think I did anything wrong. So, am I the asshole?",

Not just a day visit, but two long weekends, and then recently for her birthday Emily’s parents have now been here for 10 days. The parents are divorced but always visit together. They won’t speak to each other, so they all sit in the living room silently and make it hugely uncomfortable for everyone.\n\nI want to ask Emily  to stop them visiting, or at least reduce the visits so they’re shorter and less regular, but I feel like I’m an asshole for not wanting her parents to visit. She clearly loves them very much, but it’s very uncomfortable for me and for flat mate number 3. It’s our house too, and we both avoid being at home when her parents are around.\n\nThoughts?",

      "description": "So i (21f) have been with my boyfriend (21m) for almost two years. I love him very much and we have a pretty stable relationship. There’s only one problem- he doesn’t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn’t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn’t want to push him into something he’s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we’ve been together he’s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn’t look normal and that’s why. He responded that he doesn’t even mind, he just doesn’t like doing it cause he “gets nothing out of it”. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he’s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don’t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I’ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he’s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn’t want to do it because he’s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I’m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I’ve stopped giving him head, cause I’m sick of choking on dick and getting “nothing out of it”. I’m planning on bringing it up with him again tomorrow, if he refuses to compromise I don’t think I can ever go down on him again unless it’s reciprocated. I don’t know where our relationship will be if that’s the result. All I know is that I’m angry I’ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary. So reddit, WIBTA if I stop giving blowjobs and potentially damaging an otherwise decent relationship all because I want head?",

She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I’ll be on them. My response was “probably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.” This comment she didn’t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you’re only going to meet struggle.” I’m normally very indifferent and don’t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I’m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I’ve been dealt. But I told her “we don’t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you’re the one being close minded.” She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there’s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive.

To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up.

      "description": "Okay, so first time posting on reddit so I'm sorry if I mess anything up.\n\nI'm in an art class that lasts around four hours everyday and theres there's around 21 people in there. One girl in our friend group in particular, lets call her L, has a lying problem along with only talking about her sex life and everything negative that has happened to her. Now I would be okay with this if it wasn't an everyday thing. It was constant, and made everyone at our table uncomfortable and it stressed some of us out as we were dealing with our own problems, and hers on top of ours made it worse. After it got bad I left and a couple of my friends, K specifically, followed and I guess it made L really mad. L ended up leaving as well to sit with some of her other friends. That table we sat at was empty for a couple of days and we decided to move back now that L was gone. \n\nSkip to this present day. \nI'm sick with the flu and didn't go to class today. K messages me and told me that our friend E let L come back and sit at the table without asking if it was okay with any of us first. Obviously a few of us were upset. I messaged E and asked if she did let L come back and why, but she ended up getting really defensive so I took that as a yes. Turns out L got kicked out of her other table and didn't have anywhere to go so she asked E if she could sit with us, which she did. I ended up blocking L for obvious reasons and E because she supposedly was done with L and didn't want to talk to her, but ended up inviting her back. AITA here?\n\nTL;DR- Ex friend with lying and drama problems moves back to table after being kicked out of our table then her friend's table. I blocked two people, the ex friend and another friend that wasn't being completely truthful. AITA?\n    ",

He always had his vehicle, but when it died I bought him a very terrible (im dumb) car from my Dads friend thinking it would last long enough for us to save up and buy new. It caught on fire on the road not even a week later and had to be taken to the junkyard. We borrowed his Dads old car, but the transmission blew within a couple of weeks. Mind you all of these cars were on their death bed and had 200k miles r more, except my mistake buy which had 280000. I am learning how to buy vehicles now.\nLong story short he was fed up and bought a 2017 vehicle with 45000 miles.\nHere is where it gets complicated. Me and fiance live with room mate/landlord. He's a cool guy and goes out of his way to be nice and help us out. Thing is, he got a temp job working with my Dad in the city 2 hours away, which was fine when my Dad was taking him. My Dad got hurt and has been off work for over a month now, and room mate/landlord has been using the new car to go to the city every day since to continue work. He took rent off for the month, 300 for it. He got side swiped by an old woman in it (not his fault, but still) and the car now has almost 70,000 miles on it and we have had it less than six months.\n\nToday was supposed to be his last day, but my boyfriend told me last night he asked to borrow it until Saturday without giving us any more leniency on rent or money.\n\nI'm furious, can't even really think too deeply on it. It feels like we are being used and walked on, especially my boyfriend. AITA though for being so mad? Should I calm down and ntgaf because it's not my car?",

I had some medical problems, so I dont wated to join them, but said it was ok for the two of them to go out.I also made clear that bf should sleep on the couch (I didnt want to have my sleep interrupted) and that as long as friend is there the bedroom is mine to use as I wish (including watching videos etc.).\n\nLong story short they drank a lot and were both not feeling well the next day, vomiting, the whole works. I have no problem with that. At about 3pm bf said that he will go sleep in the bedroom (friend was still occupying our couch). I told him no and that the bedroom was mine. Bf acted annoyed, friend saw it and decided to leave because he didnt want to start an argument. I told friend he could stay until he felt save to drive. He left nevertheless.\n\nBf then went to bedroom, I stayed in the living room. I heard friend call and heard bf say \"yes, this is so stupid\" in an annoyed tone. After the call ended, I went into the bedroom and told bf that Im sad he thinks my actions are stupid after I communicated my conditions clearly beforehand. He said he didnt say that and ignored me the rest of the day. I feel shitty now both for annoying bf and for driving friend out. Also I feel like a foreign body in my own home.\n\nAm I the asshole and should have let bf sleep in the bedroom and just stayed quiet?\n\nTldr: Bf was annoyed when friend stayed over after a night of drinking (that I did not join) that I wanted the bedroom to myself.",

      "description": "My partner and I recently adopted a kitten from a rescue group in NYC. We live in NJ and usually take the train back from the city but decided to take a Lyft when we picked up the kitten as it was Thanksgiving weekend and we didn’t want to stress our new kitten out in a crowded train. We called the driver as soon as he accepted the ride to let him know that we were going to NJ and we have a cat with us. He was cool with it. \n\nThe ride was absolutely terrifying! This guy was nice enough but he was a horrible driver. He kept slamming the brake and, worse, he couldn’t even follow directions on the app. At one point, I was checking the app to see how much longer it would take until we get home and realized we were not on the route we were supposed to be on. Turns out, he took a wrong turn and couldn’t follow the maps to get back on track. He was circling around Newark Airport and didn’t know how to get out! \n\nAs soon as I realized what was happening, I tried to help him navigate by giving him directions. He was a foreigner and didn’t seem to understand me very well at all. I tried to only give him short, simple directions and he seemed to get it but still made wrong turns sometimes. At one point, he stopped in the middle of the highway for no reason and was blocking other cars from entering the NJ Turnpike. We kept getting honked at by multiple cars, and for good reason. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time, fearing for my life and trying to stay focus so I can keep track of where we were and give him directions, since he clearly wasn’t capable of following the app. What was originally supposed to be a 1h20’ ride ended up taking almost 3 hours. \n\nAs soon as we got home, I rated him 1 star, left a long comment, and called Lyft support to ask for a refund. Lyft fully refunded the ride, which was about $140, and I don’t know if the driver got any money out of the trip and if he was able to continue driving for them afterward. I feel like I was well within my right to give him a bad rating and ask for my money back given how awful a driver this guy was and how he put us in physical danger. However, I also felt bad for him since he seemed nice and was genuinely apologetic. Also, as I’m an immigrant myself, I understand how difficult it is. This guy probably started driving with Lyft to support his family and I didn’t want to take that away from him. This trip probably ended up taking him 6 hours in total and I don’t think he got any money out of it. On the other hand, it’s not my fault it took so long, and had he not been such a horrible and unsafe driver, it would have taken him less than 3 hours and he would’ve earned the $140 plus the $30 tip I usually leave for these trips. Also, I didn’t want him to stay on the road and put others in danger if that’s how he drives. \n\nThis happened two months ago and it still bothers me. AITA here? ",

      "description": "This happened a while ago, but there was a popular AITA post today about a similar topic so I decided I'd ask for y'alls opinions too, for future reference. I'm genuinely confused about if I'm in the wrong about this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I had extremely loud neighbors that would have a good crowd over on the weekends, and sometimes during the weekdays too. They'd play very bass-heavy music, play Rock Band with their windows open, girls would be screaming every minute, and I'm pretty sure they were high half the time. It's college, so I get it, but my window was immediately adjacent to their opened windows so I could hear everything and my walls would shake due to the bass. My other roommate and I have contacted the leasing office on separate occasions about this, but either they didn't do anything about it or our neighbors got the warning but just didn't care. The issue went on and it was heavily impeding our studying. So eventually, when we got a bit fed up, we left a note on their door asking them to keep it down. We worded it as politely as we could, since we didn't want bad blood between us. They ignored the note and the issue went on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt got to the point where my roommate and I did call the non-emergency police number, and requested that an office come by and just ask them to keep the noise level down, since the leasing office didn't help and they ignored our first note. The next morning, we found a note on our door telling us that we should \"be adults\" and come talk to them in person. Personally, I don't think there is anything wrong with leaving a note, and like I said before, we were very polite about it. They left their number and wrote, \"Text me once you decide to grow a pair.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn retrospect, we really should have asked them in person, but at the time, we genuinely did feel uncomfortable approaching them directly since we're small-built females and our neighbors are tall males. The area isn't necessarily safe, so we did what we thought was best at the time. But are we the a-holes for handling it this way? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Background: My roommate owns the house and may be selling it soon - so he has been fixing it up recently. He spends the majority of his time with his girlfriend at their house and I see him rarely. His sister has also been temporarily staying at the house too, though that probably doesn't matter? She's cool. We get along. I'm currently on crutches from a work related injury so I've been sleeping downstairs on the couch because the toilet upstairs needs to be fixed and stairs are the bane of my existence right now.\n\nIssue: Today my roommate and his girlfriend came over with no warning and and started painting the living room. Everything is moved away from the walls and it's difficult for me to walk through on crutches. I've had to use the stairs a lot and reorganize my life quite a bit which is challenging given my situation. This isn't the first time they've shown up unexpectedly like this and started doing something major in the house. I can respect that they need to get things accomplished, but it offends and inconveniences me when they don't communicate their plans to me so that I can make alternative plans for my day. Had I known, then I could have stayed at my sister's house or something.  It also kind of bothers me that they have time to clear out the basement or repaint the living room, but can't be bothered to fix the upstairs toilet or chronically clogged sink (which could easily be done on a day off). AITA for feeling peeved about this or am I just over-reacting? Should I talk to my roommate/landlord about this?",

      "description": "Using a throwaway for this. My son is close to 14 months old now, and since he was 8 or 9 months I have taken him to the couch almost every night to sleep on my chest. He wakes up late at night/early in the morning, usually from 1-3, screaming, and I either come get him or climb out of bed and take him out with me to the couch.\n\nThis started when I was trying to calm him down one night and was so tired I fell asleep there. We were surprised it worked so well and just kinda went with it. Thing is, I do it basically every night now. I don't get to sleep in bed all night anymore.\n\nJust a little bit ago tonight, my wife woke me up after I'd been asleep for about 20 minutes (went to bed late) and asked me to take the baby to the couch. I responded with, \"yeah but I'm getting sick of doing it all the time.\" That's where things went very bad. For context, we've been having serious marital issues for quite some time now, and they got worse about the same time this started (not related at all). We've finally got to the point where she's wanting to try to work things out and seems to be happy around me more often.\n\nShe took this the wrong way from how I intended and got really angry with me, threatening to throw me out if I didn't want to help. I don't mind helping, I love my kids and it's part of my job as their dad to take care of them, but I hate how I never got to stay in bed anymore. I was kicked out of the bedroom for months and the couch really isn't too comfy all night every night. Plus I move around a lot in my sleep, but with the baby my subconscious seems to keep me from doing that, so I wake up stiff often.\n\nShould I have held my tongue until day hours when we could have discussed it without being angry?

      "description": "I'm not very active on social media. I have a Facebook account that I made over a decade ago. It's mostly just family members, old high school friends, and work stuff. I rarely actually use it. \n\nI occasionally use Instagram. My instagram is mostly pictures of my pets and just random shit that makes me happy, but it's kind of personal. When I started using it, I didn't really think about the fact that it was linked to my Facebook or that my account would be suggested to my facebook friends. \n\nRecently a bunch of my relatives followed me on Instagram, probably because of those suggestions. They are all distant relatives that I haven't actually seen or really spoken to in over a decade. They are aunts and cousins who seem to want to have a connection with me and my life, but I don't really want a connection with them. \n\nThey aren't bad people. They haven't done anything wrong, but knowing that they are following me and seeing them like my posts makes me uncomfortable. Even seeing their names and their faces is upsetting to me. \n\nThey don't know this, but I experienced a lot of abuse as a child and pretty much any reminder of my childhood (including them) can be really upsetting. I like to go on instagram to calm down and look at pictures of dogs, not see names and faces of people who remind me of this really painful part of my life. \n\nThe other part of it is that I don't know how much contact they have with the person who abused me (who is not tech savvy and I know isn't using instagram or following me). So now I can't post without thinking, \"Are they going to tell my abuser about this? Would I be okay with them knowing this?\" \n\nI don't want them to follow me, but I feel like I would be a huge asshole to block them when they haven't done anything wrong. I don't really want to make my account private either, so they'd probably figure out that I blocked them. I don't want to hurt people who didn't do anything wrong. \n\nExplaining the situation to them and asking them to unfollow is not an option, because I'm not confrontational enough and because it might get back to my abuser. So I either just live with them following me, block them, or abandon my instagram account. \n\nWould I be the asshole for blocking my relatives who did nothing wrong just because I don't like seeing them \"liking\" my posts and don't like knowing that they follow me?",

Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I’m really grateful for the free help, I don’t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn’t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds “no. My feet get cold. I’d rather fight with you about it.” And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn’t take off her shoes? I don’t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can’t respect the rules of my home, she’s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it’s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. ",

      "description": "Little backstory. We met on a breakup support chat and developed a friendship. We've really been there for each other. Her breakup was 4 months ago, mine was 3.\n\nI'm finally starting to feel better. My breakup was rough and I could barely hang on for 3 months. Slowly, things have gotten better. The excruciating pain stopped, I can see things clearly. I've accepted my ex no longer wants to be with me, and I don't want to be with her either.\n\nMy friend, on the other hand, is still stuck. I totally get it, I've been there too. She has depression as well. \n\nWhenever I start feeling a little better, have a good day or move a step forward and I share it with her.. she is seemingly supportive. But also throws in there things like 'you'll crash again later'. Or talks about her own situation, how she's still stuck. I say I'm moving on, and she tells me about her pain, her struggles, how she can't get out of it. She's still stuck thinking if her ex only changed, things would be ok. Or that he is sabotaging for wanting to start dating again.\n\nI started feeling strongly like this was counterproductive. Everytime I felt a little better, she would bring me down. And so after the last time this happened, where I could not sleep and felt like absolute shit, I felt I needed some time away to gather my thoughts.\n\nI contacted her again after 48 hours explaining this as kindly as I could. That I want to be friends and be there for her but hearing these things all the time is unhealthy right now.\n\nShe started acting passive aggressive. Said she's disappeared that I didn't talk to for two days. I said I'm sorry but I won't apologize for needing some time alone or asking you to please stop using me as a venting space when I finally am getting out of this after so much pain. You need to consider my state when you tell me all these things.\n\nIn her eyes, I'm the asshole. So am I ?",

I've confronted her about this and she has countered with \"I can't control it\" which I understand that the clog is not her fault, but I feel as if cleaning it is controllable. She also offered to come in and clean up when the water drains (because she says cleaning it before is gross) \n\nThis bugs me a bit, because it is way grosser to **Stand** in it and after removing the hair you can just wash your hands (which I do).

      "title": "AITA for supporting my mothers divorce?",
      "description": "My mother is going through a difficult divorce with my stepfather. My Stepfather has drowned both my mother and himself in dept manly due to drug related problems. Rather then a divorce my mother attempted to send my stepfather into rehab, for the 3rd time, before the divorce process official started. My mothers plan was to get my stepfather clean, sell off all the assets, pay off as much dept as possible and split the remainder of the dept/resources and move on. \n\nI live out of state, and was admittedly not present for the intervention, that lucky ended with my stepfather checking into a rehab facility. \n\nMy problem is that during the entire process my grandmother, the matriarch of the family, has been against the entire process, yes including the intervention, divorce, etc. \n\nI got word from several members of the intervention and family that my grandmother continually advocated for allowing my stepfather to continue to use/abuse the shared funds vehicles etc. My Grandmother even spoke out against the divorce despite the emotional, health, and legal trauma that ignoring treatment could bring about. \n\nWhen I spoke to my Grandmother about the issue, she told me that marriage is sacred and my mother, the breadwinner of the family, has to do right by my stepfather. I found fault with this logic as one it would be enabling a drug abuser to continue to endanger his life as well as everyone around him. I also found fault with her belief that marriage is sacred and my mother should do right by my stepfather seeing as how my Grandmother is herself legally separated from my grandfather and continues to support my grandfather, who is himself an alcohol abuser. \n\nThis resulted in a stalemate, and ultimately I told her that her actions are her own and she has to do what she believes is right, just like I have to do what I believe is right, and that our own actions reflect on each of us.  I told her that in the end I support my mothers decisions, not just because she is my mother but because if the situation was reversed I would still support this course of actions. \n\nThis ended with my Grandmother telling me how wrong the situation was and how wrong I was for supporting it. After sometime the state of my mother and stepfather became all my grandmother wanted to talk about, I get it that is whats going on in your life so that's what you have to talk about, and I politely but firmly told her I did not want to discuss it with her anymore. \n\nThings escalated when my grandmother found out, I do not know how, that I sent my mother a small amount of money to give her a little breathing room. I should point out that although I had the money, it was not exactly an easy financial decision to make, one I did so only after talking it over with my partner, and that my mother did not ask for any financial assistance. It actually sent the check without informing my mother as she is extremely proud, and I was not aware of just how bad things had become. This infuriated my grandmother, as I had no business meddling in my stepfathers affairs as she put it. \n\nAs things stand now my Grandmother refuses to speak to me, and I really do not see any need to make an effort to speak to her. I am not ignoring her but simply not reaching out to speak to her, if for example she called and wanted to speak on any other subject that would be fine, but that has not happened yet. \n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "Sorry if the formatting is horrible, currently on mobile. TLDR at bottom \n\n\nI met this really great group of friends I would say about a year ago, and they were really welcoming and we shared a lot of common interests. We didn’t live super close to each other, so most of our communication happened between discord and Skype. My best friend was sorta the “leader” of this group, planned a lot of the meetups etc. Everything was normal for a while, but then a lot of stuff started happening with GF (girlfriend)\n\n\nI didn’t know GF that well, and I didn’t know whether she was a pathological liar and just wanted to make her life seem more interesting, but she lied about a lot of touchy subjects. (sexual assault, for example) I was really skeptical of a lot of these stories, and to confirm my suspicions, did a quick reverse google search or 2 to find out most of the stuff she was talking about were lies. This was also around the time best friend and girl friend started dating. \n\n\nI started calling her out on her lies, but being that she was dating BF and he was the leader, everyone took her side and she had a lot of control over the group. Eventually, I stopped getting invited out more and less people talked to me, though BF and I kept talking. GF seemed to be really controlling in the relationship, and apparently threatened suicide if they ever broke up, which made me really concerned for BF. He also really enjoyed anime and visual novels, but she even limited that and reprimanded him for liking any characters that were girls and said “yeah I get it, their prettier than me and you’ll never love me like you love them” \n\n\nAfter a while, I decided that enough was enough and I need to do something to break this up. I texted GF and basically called her out to which she denied and became very aggressive towards me. She kept accusing me of breaking up the one thing good in her life and said that I shouldn’t be jealous and that she wasn’t purposely pushing me away, (which was a lie, as she had texted others that she didn’t want us hanging out with me) I sent the convo between me and GF to BF, and told him. He decided to go through with it, and it was a huge mess, GF went off on him and kept on denying the lies which I had proof for, and eventually blocked all of us before a grand old “F*** you!” to me. \n\n\nShe ghosted is, but everyone has been really concerned she killed herself or something, and the mood of the group has been down ever since. I eventually found out she isn’t dead and that she made new accounts for everything, but our attempts to reach her have been hopeless. I feel horrible for ruining a friendship and making the overall mood of the group sad, but the relationship was very controlling and emotionally abusive\n\n\nAITA? \n\n\nTLDR : GF was emotionally abusive and blocked me from group, I told BF to break up with her, mess happens and people blame me, AITA? \n\n\n",

Fair. I get that. I’m sick of hearing it, but it’s at least a legitimate concern. \n\nThen it went on to discussions of me as a child. My mum likes to cherry pick, and was talking about how normal I was as a kid. I’ve learnt there’s nothing you can say to contradict her or she will go off the rails.\n\nThen, after ten minutes of being pissed off steadily, came the kicker.\n\n‘I feel like that little girl is dead. I’m grieving for my child.’\n\nI hate that. For more context, I was really ill and could easily have died a few years ago, so this really rankles me the wrong way. I asked her if she thought I was an imposter, then, and she listed off ways I am worse now.\n\nI got fed up and snapped. I told her that if she wanted to complain about me, not to do it to me. I already listen to her problems a lot (always have done) but this stuff is just not okay to say to me. She got angry and said she was allowed to have feelings. \n\nWe got saved eventually by McDonald’s. \n\nAm I the asshole? Should I be listening to my mum’s complaints about me?

      "description": "I was seeing a girl for just over 3 months, we would see each other roughly 4-5 times a week so it was quite often I saw her. We did a lot of fun activities in this time that it was like we were dating, but not with the official \"relationship' tag yet. We had talked about this quite heavily and we were going to wait until sometime in the early new year (this year), we both wanted to wait until this year so it was all mutual. We both were quite regularly in each other's lives that we had met friends and parents etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now on to the question, it was New Year's Eve (just been) and we had already agreed to a plan that I would hang out with my friends earlier on in the day for a few drinks and then we would catch up together when we went out for the night life. Once it got to New Year's Eve she tried to persuade me to spend the whole day with her without getting to see my friends at all &amp; I of course said no, because this was the plan for my friends and I before I started seeing her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't like this answer and told me that she didn't wanted to speak to me (just for not wanting to spend the whole day with her when I was going to see her later on in the night anyway). I tried reasoning but to no avail. I put on a happy face and had a good New Years. I then wake up on New Years day to a text from her telling me that she was really sorry and that she kissed someone last night, and that she would do anything for my forgiveness. I was upset but I wasn't going to let a little kiss (presumably when she was drunk) ruin the amount of time we've spent together. So we sorted it out, but 2 days later I found out that she also had sex with this person from a mutual friend early morning. Since she wasn't staying at mine that night I sent her a text message about it and she told me everything, my very last response to her was \"I don't know what to say anymore\", I was in utter shock. I didn't contact her again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I The Asshole for not telling her that I didn't want to continue what we had? It's been twenty-ish days since this happened and I still feel guilty I didn't properly tell her. Also keep in mind that she has tried contacting me a few times since then &amp; that we weren't technically in a relationship but I still was 100% invested in her. ",

      "description": "I dated my ex, \"Tom\" for 9 years. For the most part our relationship was amazing, but I hit a rough personal spot a couple years in &amp; had to process some trauma/issues. Tom loaned me money to pay my rent/food and did his best to support me through all of it, but it changed the dynamic of our relationship in a fairly negative way. Over time, my anxiety and depression progressed to the point where I had trouble leaving the house without having a panic attack and I leaned heavily on his willingness to help me avoid dealing with my problems. It took me over 6mo to get back on my feet &amp; start paying him back (to the tune of about $10k) which left him feeling taken advantage of (and me feeling like a piece of shit). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, back then Tom didn't really understand depression as an illness. He was convinced that I should just be able to 'decide' to change things, and that by not doing so it just meant I didn't care enough. So while I remember feeling very lost, ashamed, and in crisis - in his mind, I was just being lazy or manipulative. He's not an awful guy by any stretch, just very action-oriented. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsurprisingly, the situation fostered a lot of resentment in both of us. Even when I was eventually able to claw my way into a good place both personally and professionally, I couldn't share that progress with Tom because I was still dealing with the emotional fallout of his resentment &amp; disbelief that depression was really a thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI broke up with him about 2 years ago, and shortly after, his dad passed away. It happened suddenly and I tried to drop everything and support him, regardless. Things were okay for the first couple weeks, but eventually he started talking about being depressed. I don't know why, but it was kind of hard to see the concept suddenly legitimized only when he started to struggle with it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried not to think about it, but I started to notice myself veering dangerously towards the same old depression cliff - and I spent weeks stuck in this tug-of-war weighing my own personal mental health against my desire to not be awful. In the end, I distanced myself, and more or less abandoned him to deal with his grief on his own. The thought of it still wrecks me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward to now: Tom has been trying to rekindle a friendship and he's said he forgives me for what happened, and apologized not supporting me more years ago - but I just can't shake the feeling that I did something unforgivably selfish. Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "So I attend university, currently living in a singles dorm. We have white boards next to our rooms, and on mine I usually write awful jokes or puns. Last week I wrote \"Netflix and Clinical Depression\" on my board.\n\nWell I got an email yesterday, turns out a student working on security saw my board Friday night and tried knocking on my door. Unfortunately I was at work so I had no idea. I was then reported to the Resident Hall Director. \n\nI got the email notifying I had to meet with her because of this yesterday. I then sent an email that read as such:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hello RHD's Name\n\nMy name is AaronBurrSer and I have an incident report for a message on my room board. It read \"Netflix and Clinical Depression\". I just did this as a joke and a play on the \"Netflix and Chill\" meme. A security guard was worried and tried to knock on my door at around 10:30 Friday night, but I was working my 9pm-2am shift at my on campus job so I wasn't available to answer. \n\nI have since changed my sign to a Vine quote, with no indication of mental issues. I didn't make the joke as belittlement of mental issues or indicative of my own mental state. I know how serious those issues are and I do have a support system in place for when I am having mental health issues. \n\nI was wondering if we could forgo the meeting for tomorrow. If you still feel the need to meet I am able to do so. \n\nThanks,\n\nAaronBurrSer\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then replied we still had to do the meeting. So we met today, went over the same stuff I essentially said in the email. Then she starts telling me I should have thought of the impact it might have on someone. I replied that my floor mates thought it was funny, and if they had an issue they could have and would have told me. She said I had no idea if someone was too afraid to speak up and I just told her no one's ever been afraid to tell me if I go too far and I have always been open to criticism. Now she wants me to submit a 2-page paper on the impact I could have had on my floor community by posting that. Which, considering I am a 23 year old man paying thousands of dollars to be here, makes me feel infuriated and embarrassed due to how \"middle school\" it all feels. Part of me is pissed the security guard didn't just leave a note, erase my board, or ask my RA to talk to me about it. I felt I had made the right actions to repair and correct the situation, and feel a mountain has been made out of a molehill. Still, I recognize my own perception can be flawed, so am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So I am on spring break but the school my girlfriend goes to is still in session this week. Today while I was playing a video game she asked me to come pick her up within 10 minutes of her class ending. She had a different schedule than normal and the time she finished class was much earlier than usual, on top of this, we did not make plans for me to pick her up today. After I requested to finish the game I was in because if I left I would be banned, she got upset and just said she would take the bus so \"I could just play my game.\" I told her I wanted to make it work so if she could just wait a few extra minutes I would be there to get her, she told me no again. At this point I was getting upset because I didn't like her tone toward me, she was being rude. She explained that no matter what she would drop everything and anything in my situation and I don't really feel like that's fair to say because she is probably just saying that to prove her point.

      "description": "So,  \n\n\nMy colleague and I joined along with 3 others last January. We were in training for about a month and got to know each other and started a mission in February.   \n\n\nSo far all have been good except for my colleague. I'll call him Mr. Ananas (and not pineapple). Him and I were the most junior (although I has some prior experience) so we had the base salary.  \n\n\nHim and I have been put on the same project, this is an office job so we sit net to each other and work on laptops all day... Well work.... Mr Ananas is on 9Gag, Discord, soundcloud or youtube most of the day, if he's not then he's on his phone... the worst part is, when I look his way, he's quick to just switch tab to a blank google page as though I was a teacher or something like that. I've been there when I was in school so I kinda understand but I'm not his superior and I'm not his teacher, I frankly don't care what he does !\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...until 12 days ago... two things pissed me off: First, we had some checkpoint with the superiors and we were 10 days late (2 weeks) the project was started about 15 days ago and we were still a little bit training so we were supposed to have 10 days of work each. I had 9.5 and he had like 0.75... If we are late, I or the manager will have to work extra to complete the thing before deadline and I don't want that. Second, I had my paycheck and the thought of him having the same pay as me while doing nothing but staring at his screen and going on discord really pissed me off. Also, him being a dead cost for the company is at least unethical.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow. about being late on the project, I managed to catchup last week and he started to work a little, basically I'm at 18 days or so (yep, 8 days of work in 5 days) and he is at like 4... We'll manage to end the project in time. He will be sent to an other project after so I won't have to work with him anymore very soon.  \n\n\nAn other thing, he was received in my boss's office to know how he was getting along and such. basically they thing he has some bad time adapting and want to give him more time/opportunities, also I think it was meant to give him some warning as to work more. This last part wasn't very effective... He's still doing the same things.  \n\n\nNow, I am not his superior or anything, I had friendly relation with him before working with him and I don't want to be an asshole. That said, there are some good arguments to be made in favor of telling on him.",

And im still kinda getting shit for it now everytime anybody brings it up\n\nIm not asking for any help on bullying since everyone gets around the same treatment \n\nBut they told our classwatch (the person in charge of the class.,usually not the actual teacher) and hes going to talk about it with the principal if i really need to pay for it\n\nI can expand on things if you have questions\n\nTL;DR: i broke classmates phone on accident and probably have to pay for it (also kinda in a hurry) ",

Since I live in a boarding environment I know exactly how much work others have been doing, and I am doing just as much as everyone else, my grades are suffering. Last year I *barely* passed with Merit (NCEA, NZ curriculum) we have Achieved Merit and Excellence, so it's roughly top 40 ish % I think. Now because it's a boarding school my parents are paying a pretty penny, but they both have stable jobs and are choosing to build a new house, I fully support them as we sold our last house for a $400k (NZD) profit, after a lengthy legal battle with my fathers employer which cost us significantly.\n\nMy mum &amp; dad want me to give my mum my assignments to 'proof read' I've done this once before with a history essay last year, she hi-jacked it and got me an excellence mark (pretty much an A/A+) I'm thankful for this, I truly am, but she  then gets angry for me not doing anything, and I swear with this current assignment she said something on the lines of *I will take care of it you worry about your other assignment*. Then she called me today asking why I haven't done anything on it, (it's a Saturday) and why I've not done much work (I've been doing other assignments due at the same time.) I want to have a weekend, a life, friends, socialize which is something I need to do as an extrovert and socializing really helps me stay positive with depression and stress etc, but again she doesn't know this.\n\nI Just don't think I can cope with school, I find it to stressful, I used to be a 'Grade A' student, top 10%, but over the past year I've just been *incapable*, every time I get given work and I sit down at night to do it (it's regimented, 7-8:30 every night minimum prep time) I look at my screen and I just can't. I have a breakdown inside or something just stops working, I just want to run away from my work and pretend it doesn't exist.\n\nI already am going to avoid university and any form of desk job, once upon a time I wanted to be a software engineer, but I've decided that all I want to be in life is happy, I don't care if I'm poor if I have enough money that I'm happy and I job I am passionate for I will be happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I can't cope with stress, mum is pissed that I don't study for the entirety (I don't believe it either, she means the **whole** weekend) of the weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Every year, my girlfriend\\[F35\\] and I\\[M36\\] participate in her company's golf tournament. There's like 150 people there. Some playing golf. Some helping out with food and drink and such.\n\nA colleague of her's is this guy, Gary. She and I have been in social situations before with Gary and we both just do not like this guy. He's a meathead gymbro alpha type. Which is fine. Up to the date of the forthcoming story, he'd never directly been a dick to either one of us but he just wasn't the kind of person we'd hang out with. Now, he *had* been really awful to my GF's friend in the past by promising her sex then laughing and backing out of the arrangement when the friend tried to get intimate. That was really awful but I wasn't there so, who knows?\n\nAnyhow, on the day of the golf tournament last year, Gary wasn't playing golf. He was selling raffle tickets on the 11th tee. Now, for context, know that this golf tournament is a booze-soaked affair and just about everyone was toasted pretty nicely at around 1:30 in the afternoon. GF and I approach Gary and another colleague. Drunken pleasantries are exchanged, no one is rude or anything, yadda yadda yadda, Gary offers my GF a ride in his golf cart. But, she'd have to stand on the back and hang on because both front seats were occupied. Apparently, in her drunken state, this seemed like a good idea. After the fact, she said she was doing it \"to be nice.\"\n\nSo, they tear off in the cart, GF standing on the back. They don't go 100 feet before Gary quickly cuts the wheel and tips the cart over. GF falls off the back and goes rolling. Gary is of course laughing his ass off at what he's done. He was safely seated in the front so he's mostly unharmed. GF has some scrapes on her elbows and bruised legs. FORTUNATELY, no serious damage. She walks away fine. I immediately just went to GF to make sure she's OK. She vigorously assures me that she's OK then starts pushing me towards the next tee because I have that beer-infused confident fire in my eyes that says, \"I need to have words with this guy.\"\n\nInstead, we all just move on and forget about it.\n\nWell, this year's golf tournament is coming up and this guy is going to be there and he's probably going to want to do his gymbro thug hug when he sees us. WIBTA if I just ignored him completely?\n\nTL:DR: WIBTA if I snubbed a guy who tipped over a golf cart my girlfriend was riding on?",

Anyways... also sorry I'm on Mobile.\n\nI got some money for my birthday, my boyfriend and I were a bit tight on funds so I offered it for things we needed so he wouldn't be so stressed. He felt bad and said so several times, I said no worries just surprise me with little things here and there like little birthday presents and I'll love that! He happily agreed. \nToday he gets a bit of extra cash from selling something, he almost leaves it at home before going out but then comes back in and takes some of it and winks at me and says he'll need this.\nHe comes back with stuff in his hands. A backpack for his camping trip in a month. I assume there's stuff inside. There isn't. He explains he didn't know what to get me so he said he decided to come back and talk to me about what I wanted. I wanted to be surprised so I didn't know what to say. He asked if I wanted him to go to the thrift store to get me tshirts (something I would love) but said I've also been wanting to go, so he asked me if I wanted to go with him instead. I'm sick and haven't been wanting to go anywhere the past day and a half so I try explaining like I'd love to go but I don't feel like going and like also I wanted it to be like more of a surprise.\nHe then tells me we'll go Thursday when I'm feeling better and then says he's gonna go get us something to eat and gets up. I'm a weak woman guys, I accidentally let a couple tears fall. I'm sick, I haven't been able to sleep and I've been feeling terrible lately just physically and emotionally so I didn't mean to and I tried to wipe them away before he saw but he did. \nHe got mad and asked what was wrong and I tried explaining in a calm voice that I was just a bit disappointed cause he made it seem like he was going to surprise me with something when he got back, told me the things he thought about getting me (a video game, shirts, boxing gear, all I would have loved!!), didn't get me anything and  instead got something for himself and that I was just a bit hurt. \nMy voice cracked a little though and he can't deal with me crying so he cut me off saying he knew this was going to happen and then stormed out of the house.\nI know I shouldn't have started crying I know I need to grow up and stop being a cry baby, but was I the asshole for being upset? \nI'm going to apologize for crying when he gets back but what else should I say or do?

      "description": "My spouse and I are at an impasse over my not wanting to share. \n\nSome relevant background first: we have two kids (5&amp;2), we've been together off and on for around 7 1/2 years (mostly on). And we're smokers.\n\nNow for the entirety of our children's lives I share my stuff with them. That's not an issue. We would order pizzas (3 because they have a deal and we like left overs) I would get one with toppings I like, spouse would get one he likes and then the other would be for the kids. I would normally eat total about half my pizza, the kids would switch between mine and there's (fine with me) and he would ear all of his some of the kids and the rest of mine... Okay sure that's fine. \n\nWe get cases of pop and don't I've the kids any, so I expect half the case to be mine to drink as I please and the other half his. He'll blow through his (an admitted bad habit) and then start on mine. \n\nWe'll get a pack of smokes and he'll blow through a bunch while im sleeping and then smoke the last one... Which bugs me because if I did that he'd be mad. \n\nSo just in the last two days, we had some people over so I expected if we shared anything it would come out of both our portions. Out of a case of pop he had a bunch, his friend had a bunch and I had two cans. Annoying but okay.  Last night, his friends stopped by supposedly for a minute, he asked if I wanted to offer them some of the pizza we had delivered (showed up just before friends did) I said no because I only had a medium (pizza place screwed up the order, they're discounting our next one) and would be sharing with the kids for lunch today. I went to change the baby and get him resettled to bed and when I come back one of the friends are eating some of pizza... Later in the night when I asked spouse about it he said he offered his own and she didn't like his because of the jalapenos he gets on his so he offered mine instead..   wouldn't have been an issue except I already said no..\n\nAnd then before bed we had two smokes left, one of his and one of mine. He had his, I didn't have mine, was saving it for later. I dozed a little and when I woke up went for my smoke. It was gone. First he said he didn't know it was mine and thought it was a splitter. But he didn't wake me to see if wanted to split it or ask if he could just have it. This has turned into a huge argument because I'm tired of having to share literally everything all the time. I don't get anything that's just mine. He thinks I'm being selfish.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to share?",

      "description": "A few months ago, I caught my sister’s husband in bed with another girl, both naked. It was during a Christmas party at our mutual friend’s house. My sister was spending the holiday with my parents. Due to our works, my brother-in-law and I would only join them on New Year’s Eve.\n\nI confronted him about it and he told me he had no idea what had really happened that night since he was so drunk. He also told me that the girl I had caught him in bed with had been obsessed with him since high school and ‘will do anything to win his heart’. But he has never had feelings for her let alone slept with her. He loves my sister and their son so much. He believes, based on this obsession, she had slipped something in his drinks. At least that’s what he told me. I couldn't tell if he was lying or telling the truth.\n\nI told him that whatever might have happened that night, he still gotta tell my sister because that’s what a married couple should do. And I believed my sister will be able to tell if he’s telling the truth or not. He promised he would when the time is right.\n\nThe following weeks, I found out he had not told my sister about it though. So I decided to do what I thought was the right thing to do. My sister flew off the handle when I told her and proceeded to file for a divorce. I encouraged her to sit down and talk about it with him. What if it was not his fault? What if the girl had indeed drugged him so she could force herself on him? But my sister told me that it was not the first time that he had cheated on her. He had once been involved with a sex worker during the 2nd year of their marriage.\n\nHe called me afterwards and confronted me and blamed me for ruining his marriage. He also told me that he had indeed cheated on her years ago but she forgave him. This time though, it was not something he had wanted to happen, but she refused to believe him now. To make me feel even worse, I recently found out that the girl he was caught in bed with, is indeed mentally unstable and obsessive and has had history of drug abuse. But no matter what I say to my sister, she will not change her mind. Now I think I believe my brother in law that he did not cheat on my sister the second time with that girl. Am I The Asshole here?",

      "description": "I work at a residential treatment facility for kids with behavioral issues. I’ve dealt with my fair share of shitty situations (literally), usually work 70+ hour weeks, and am losing my mind trying to manage my unit (which is absolute chaos right now). \n\nI’m in unsafe situations almost every day and am honestly used to it; however, today an oppositional and defiant kid threw a packet of SALT in my eyes. It was seemingly out of nowhere, I had just prompted him to sit in his seat while he eats. He was in my face and he threw it at me. And it really fucking hurt. I was alone in the cafe with 6 of my boys and (because I’m a small, young girl) I do my best not to show that things bother me. But this did. More than when I got bronchitis from a kid spitting in my face last week. More than when I got a chunk of my hair pulled out while in a restraint weeks ago. And when this kid got upset and said my not accepting his apology makes him feel bad, I said he SHOULD feel bad because that means he’s holding himself accountable for his actions. Even his negative ones. \n\nAnyway, my evening went on to consist of 7 more physical restraints for unrelated incidents with other kids (though the salt incident would have warranted one if I could have seen/do anything at that moment). I usually leave work exhausted, but ready for the next crazy day. But today I just left angry. I left irritated and fed up, and mentally and physically unprepared do this same shit again tomorrow. So I called out for the morning. And I feel guilty because that means an overnight staff will be mandated to work in my place on Christmas Eve. But I’m trying to tell myself that it’s okay to think about myself and my needs right now, especially after getting salt thrown in my fucking eyes tonight. Because they still burn 10 hours later. \n\nSo AITA for calling out on Christmas Eve?",
