      "title": "AITA for being upset at my friend who does not take her medication?",
      "description": "Backstory; I've known this girl for a few years now. We dated for a year, broke up, but are still good friends. She has struggled with Borderline Personality Disorder, depression, and anxiety for as long as I've known her. She has been hospitalized previously, and has struggled with self-harm.\n\nSo for as long as I've known her, she's had issues around taking her medication properly. Every few months or so, she'll alter her dosages because she thinks she \"doesn't need it anymore\", or will skip it because she \"forgets\", or was \"being lazy\". Every time she does this, her mental health rapidly declines, she gets back on track, and says she'll be more diligent in taking it. She does not frequently go to her doctor to discuss how the medication is going or alternatives, nor does she go to therapy frequently (both due to cost, and skipping appointments).\n\nThe other day, she was complaining about feeling sick, tired, and just generally being in a poor mood. I inquired if she was still taking her medication, to which she said she had quit cold turkey a few days ago, because she was \"feeling lazy\". I told her to take the medication, and she tried to alter the dose, saying that she didn't feel like taking the proper amount.\n\nAt this point, I told her that I was upset at her and feeling frustrated, because this happens so frequently. I suggested that she get her family to look after her medication for her, or that she come up with some other way to be consistent with taking it. I told her that I was there to support her, and that I was sympathetic to her mental illness, but that I can't hold her hand and check every single day that she's taking her medication properly.\n\nShe responded by saying that I was not being a nice friend, that I was making her feel guilty, and that I was not being supportive and too judgemental.  She said that I was making her feel like she's a burden.\n\nAt this point, I don't know what to do. Over the past few years I've been strict with her, more relaxed, pleaded for her to get help, listened to her vent, offered to take her to counselling, talked to her family, and brainstormed ways for her to keep her mental health up. AITA for getting mad at her for not taking her medication? How do I support her while she self-sabotages, without letting myself get burned out?",

      "title": "AITA For not wanting to learn to deal with my roommates cats?",
      "description": "Since moving in with this girl we've had issues with both of her animals. \nThe first after four months of fighting us she dealt with kind of. Her male cat gets in the trash, on our shelf in the pantry, and was aggressive to my chihuahua to who is half the size of her fat lard cat. She numerous times implied the issue was my dog wasn't smart enough to stay out of the cats way. Which she has since apologized for and stopped doing because I snapped and yelled her that her fucking cat tracks my dog down to start shit. Anyways. We fought tooth and nail to get it dealt with. If I wasn't reminding her to keep trying things to help it wouldn't get done and she would try to blame me because I'm the one that wants it done. Finally my BF told her to lock it up unless she's watching it so now it lives in our other roommates room because she can't keep her own pets in her own living space. So now anytime we get in an argument she throws it in our face how her poor cat is locked up all the time because of us.\n\nAnd now the issue is her other 14 year old cat. This one is female and anorexic as all get out. She started it on a medicine to help with it thyroid to stop the constant puking. But now it still pulls every other day and has rancid diarrhea daily. And it constantly yells for more food most days. Me and my boyfriend would like to relax but its hard sometimes when it won't stop yelling.\nThe other night I spent half an hour trying to stop it before I put it in her room. Which a month ago she told us to do if the cat was too problematic. Well she comes home and I nicely try to tell her and she goes off yelling at us that we need to learn to live with it she is just vocal and she doesn't want her in her room cause she'll puke. Turned into a two hour fight.\n\nAnother issue we have she throws in our face every argument is she put her litter box in her bathroom like we wanted. Which we did because she only cleaned it everyother day at most and didn't sweep the litter her cat throws everywhere.\n\nAnd I know I'm not the best person. I have lost my temper and legit been a dick at times over things. Like when her cat shit on my bed. I was not nice or adult at all. \n\nSo anyways. Am I The Asshole for wanting her one cat locked up and wanting the other to not be left to yell half the day? I get animals can be vocal and cats are opportune hunters and her cats scarred from a dog getting it before. But am I the Asshole here?",

      "description": "Yesterday my mom took me shopping. I tried on some dresses and left some shirts in her cart.  When I decided which dresses I wanted I put on some sweats and a sports bra to go get the shirts to try on.  My mom got upset and told me I shouldn’t expose my sports bra in case men or children were watching. My reasoning was that a sports bra is more concealing than a regular bra or  even a bikini top, people work out in a sports bra and sweats all the time, and I wasn’t actually exposing my boobs.  Who is in the right here, Reddit? Is it appropriate to walk out of the fitting room in a sports bra and sweats?\n\n In case it matters my boobs are not overly large either.",

      "description": "Some context here - I’ve generally had a good relationship with my grandparents throughout my life. I love on the other side of the country, work a lot, but still would make time to call them semi-regularly. Typically once a month or every other month. \n\nWith that said, conversations started getting a little tense. Questioning what I was doing w/ my life... telling me I need to go back to school to get a degree.. etc. It’d be one thing if I was sitting on the couch everyday playing games, but I’m at a pretty good place in my life professionally. All of this to say I stopped calling as often.\n\nAnd then I proposed to the love of my life, who they’ve met a handful of times. We decided we were getting married in Bali. I called them when we made this decision, so that they had plenty of time to make travel plans. They were pretty irritated I wasn’t having it at their farm..... in a small city in the south... But they said they’d come, so awesome. \n\nFast forward a week or two, and my mom (their daughter) lets me know they won’t be coming. Not a big deal, I understand. The reason is that it’s “too expensive” which is a bit odd because they’re fairly well off. My mom has said they’d call me to let me know. Which never happened. But I did find out they bought a brand new car a few weeks after this. \n\nSo to sum this all up, they never called me to tell me. They never called me on my wedding day to congratulate me. They didn’t call on my birthday (which they always have) and didn’t call me for Christmas (which again, they always have). \n\nAm I the ass hole for not wanting to call them? I feel like they’re treating this as if I didn’t invite them to my wedding &amp; insulted them. ",

      "description": "CONTEXT: \nI'm still part of a pretty large group of friends from high school that organise gifts for everyone on their birthdays. Usually a separate group chat is made and we all end up chipping in around $10-20 each. I'm always included in those and have chipped in for every person for the past few years. This year I didn't get a gift for my birthday last month and I don't think there is a plan for one.\n\nSince it is a big group, I'm not super close with everyone. Trying to look from their point of view, I don't make my birthday public on Facebook/other social media so they probably didn't realise - but I still received birthday wishes from my close friends that did remember.\n\nIn the past I've contributed to every single gift as well as purchased another separate personal gift for a closer friend. \n\nWIBTA if I asked if I was getting a gift? Or asked for one if they didn't plan on it?\n\nI didn't want to ask since it sounds incredibly petty and entitled but this year it felt as if I was overlooked and ignored.

      "description": "we met in high school when I was a freshman and she was a senior. we were both in theater and we kinda just clicked, she saw herself in me and was very supportive and a kind gal. we didn’t really hang out outside of school other than a small party she had last year (or maybe the year before, not sure).\n\nabout 6 months later, i started dating my boyfriend, and we’ve been together for about 2.5 years now. He’s about 2 years older than me, so i went to his prom my freshman year, and she offered to take pictures for free because she was a friend of mine and took a liking to him. that was fine.\n\nnothing really went sour, or at least i didn’t notice how uncomfortable i was until i finally hung out with her again over the fall. before then, we kept tabs on each other and had conversations about 1-3 times a week. \n\nshe always commented on how attractive he is, how cute we are, and how she’s our number 1 supporter etc. it was a bit much, but it really didn’t bother me too much. \n\nwhen he came back from boot camp, she kept telling me how extremely attractive he is, especially now. he has such pretty eyes etc. and insisted that we visit her. we did visit her for a short amount of time before we had to go visit other friends, and she wanted to take pictures of us, the three of us together, and then just him and her. i was a bit more uncomfortable. \n\nafter he left for the second time is when it got really weird, and this is the specific comment that really stuck with me. he used to have a good amount of facial hair before he enlisted, but obviously had to shave (this is relevant). she was going on again of how lucky of a girl i am when i hung out with her for a night in the fall while she was home from college for thanksgiving. there were other people there, also listening. she told me that, when he comes back, i’ll “hop on that real quick.” yea, because he’s my boyfriend. i didn’t appreciate the unsolicited super personal comment, but i was gonna let it slide. then she said “and if he grows out his facial hair again, you’ll hop on that even quicker.” \n\ni had never mentioned that i preferred him with facial hair, he looks great either way. that’s what made that comment *especially* weird to me. she was genuinely taking her own desires for him and projecting them onto me. directly to my face.\n\ni really couldn’t deal with it anymore. it was too much and i know how boy crazy and flirtatious she can be, and i wanted the comments to stop and i didn’t want it to get to the point where the thought it was ok to say things like that to him. over the next week, i left her on read until she stopped texting me entirely. she’ll text me on rare occasions, like tonight. she sent me one of the prom pictures she took *over two years ago.* she sent it along with a text that read “i found some treasures” i gave her a dry response of “:)” and left it there. \n\ni’ve been thinking about it a lot lately. we weren’t best friends but we were still pretty close friends for 3 years and i just kinda cut it off without saying anything.

      "description": "Some context so this makes more sense. \n\nMy eldest brother is almost 30. He graduated from a rather good university a few years back but it's been difficult to find a well-paying starting job even for his level of education. As such, he's been settling for temporary jobs such as administration work, etc. However, recently he found a job, that although has a below-average pay, offers him a wider variety of better job opportunities in the near future. \n\nIt's important to note that he has NO student loan debt because our parents borrowed money from our aunt, so that he does not need to pay interest fees, and instead can pay the original debt amount to my aunt directly. Our aunt is generally well-off, but only because of the compensation she got when her daughter (our cousin) passed away. She still lives a rather good life even after lending our family the $30k+, but that has barely anything to do with this. My brother has barely paid any money back in the past 3 years. Even if he did, I assume it's less than $5k from the way my mother nags. \n\nNow, my brother is someone whom you might describe as having a high IQ but low EQ. He's a good and kind person but sometimes his lack of common sense and initiative pisses the heck out of me, and he doesn't seem to understand why. He's not really sociable in real life settings, but he has made some good friends online from games, and I can see that it's something that have really added on to his happiness, although I've never actually made any comments about it. \n\nNow, last night after his work, he was carrying a bigass carrier, and the conversation went like this:\n\n*B = Brother, M = Me*\n\nM: What's that?\n\nB: A laptop?\n\nM: You bought it?\n\nB: Yeah it's below $1000\n\nM: Uhhh. Your new job needs you to have a laptop? (I knew it doesn't, and also, he already had a functioning laptop that's pretty okay)\n\nB: It's to play games\n\nM: You do remember you owe (aunt's name) money?\n\nB: Yah I'll get to that next time (visibly annoyed now)\n\nM: And your leisure is more important than repaying a debt of $30k? When are you going to pay even a little back?\n\nB: June. \n\nM: How much?\n\nB: A few thousands?? Why? Is that any of your business? Why are you interfering in this?\n\nM; (hecking pissed now) To remind you of your responsibilities because you seem to greatly lack in that aspect and also you seem to put your leisure above the need of paying someone back ASAP? You're not someone that can be counted on apparently. \n\nB: Well then don't count on me. (I could hear that he's hurt at this time but hiding it, but I was too pissed to care)\n\nM: You better bet on that, and I can't remember having count on you for a few years now. \n\n\nThe thing is, after I calmed down, I could understand that buying a laptop for gaming could serve as helping his mental health, knowing that he was treated rather badly at his previous job, but I still got upset and said those things. In this case, it would have been me saying those things while he was just prioritising his mental health over the payment of the debt, but he had also previously bought an expensive decorative monument not long after he started working his first official job, without even paying my aunt ANY money at all at that time (this I am sure of, as my mother came crying to me after being stressed that her daughter would never pay back the money). \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTldr: Brother who might be unhappy, bought new laptop to (presumably) make himself happier, while still owing an aunt a debt of $30k+, having paid little to none to her yet in a span of 3 years. \n",

      "description": "Ok so for a bit of context, I’m on schoolies with my best-friend, she is 18F and I am 17M. Here in Australia, we have a yearly celebration called “schoolies” where everyone who finishes highschool goes a town or city to celebrate their 13 years of schooling. This week of fun is usually fuelled by a lot of sex, drinks and drugs, which is why police dread this time of year.\n\nFast forward to my situation, my best-friend (who we shall name “N”), turned 18 yesterday while we were on schoolies and so for the past 6 months we planned for the best booze-filled day we could image. And just that happened. Originally on the trip, it was only me and N that had a room booked, but we both had friends visit throughout the stay, with most being their for N’s birthday.\n\nAs the night of partying had went on, things got rowdy, music got loud and people started to passout. What did happen though was that at this small gathering for the birthday, I managed “get lucky” with and “do shit” with a person we’ll call “J”.\n\nNow J is N’s best friend also but we don’t know each other very well, only that we have a good mutual friend. Fast forward to this afternoon and word had got out that me and J had slept together for the night and N got very angry at me for doing such a thing (everyone else had left at this point so it was only us two again to have the house). N argued at me that although I am younger than J, she knows that I’m a mature guy and that I should have known better than to have gotten with her best friend of 10+ years.\n\nNow she won’t talk to me or even look at me but I’m now not sure what to do.\n\n\nNote: This was originally in r/AITA and got deleted and reposted here because I noticed it was the wrong sub reddit",

Any of them could have answered, but Jessica answers first. Sebastian quickly loudly speaks over Jessica just seconds after she start talking. This makes me bust out “Hold on, I think Jessica was talking first.” Seems harmless first, but then I couldn’t help my self to keep going because I’ve been in this situation before with Sebastian. So I continue with “you’re always doing this”. He became pretty upset about it. He did t say it, but I really felt it. I think I overdid it, but still I think I’m correct. Though I feel guilt because I kinda hurt him. \n\nThe thing is I’m closer to Sebastian and he’s been there for me when I’ve been down. So it felt pretty shitty of me to attack him. \n\nShould I apologize for being an asshole?",

I post the present to facebook and my best friend and two of my  other friend just start flooding the comments with stuff like \"oh so you can buy these but cant pay me back, oh what about these two games you just got (also presents) I inform them that they are presents but he and the other friends keep going and calling me shitty and a bad friend. \n\nSo I txt him and say how about you just message me about the money instead of putting it on the internet, cause I did have full intention on paying him back soon but he says \"if I have owed you money for 9 months you would have freaked out\" which isnt true, he has owed me close to 400 dollars from our 7 years of knowing each other, so I say fine I'll pay you back but after that I think we should be done talking since you think our whole friendship revolves around money, so Am I The Asshole?",

      "description": "(This is a throwaway account etc.)\n\nThis is about saving a bit more money to comfortably cover solicitor fees, moving fees, new stuff for the house, etc.\n\nSome background: My SO and I have been together for a few years and we're in the process of buying a house. We're both around 30 years old. My SO is contributing more money to the mortgage deposit - they previously owned a reasonably lucrative business and were able to save around £15k from that, it's been sitting in an account since the business folded a few years ago. This money was all earnt/saved some time before we became a couple/before I even knew my SO. Meanwhile, my contribution is quite a bit lower than theirs - think 10% to their 90%. I've not had quite the same \"luck\" with work, I'm currently on my first good-paying job and have only been able to start saving since last summer, at around £100 a month with whatever else is left from my paycheque at the end of the month. I've got that £1k and not much else in savings at the moment. \n\nAlso to note, my SO earns more than me - not much, around an extra few hundred a month after taxes.\n\nThe issue: Now, we're all set for the mortgage stuff, we've had an offer accepted on a house, we just want to be extra comfortable for the solicitor fees (maybe they need to do extra checks about the area around the house, or something goes wrong with the sale, there's delays etc). I told my SO I'll still be saving what I can every month, but they say they won't be doing the same. Because they've contributed enough with their 90%. I asked if this meant they'd be spending all of their salary each month, the answer being \"Well, I won't be silly about it...\" \n\nI think we should both be saving each month still. I want that extra security, and I feel anxious that my contribution won't be enough by itsself. And I feel kind of bitter that I'd be scrimping whereas my SO doesn't plan to do that at all. \n\nSo, AITA? Should I just suck it up as I only contributed 10% to the deposit? ",

I should probably mention I used to have no issue with her until I learned she mentioned to a couple other coworkers her whole family including herself are racist against mexicans and muslims (once one of the coworkers mentioned shes Mexican she immediately started saying it was a joke) \n\nTo be honest I'm neither Mexican or Muslim but I have a VERY bad opinion about racists. Anyway the day started out with me showing a different coworker my new tattoo and telling her how excited I was about it. The day went on about normal and ms. racist seemed pretty busy which to me is all the more reason not to talk to her (also if I have nothing nice to say I keep my mouth shut especially at work)\n\nShe mentions something to me about getting last names for anyone wanting to schedule a party which to me is kinda *duh* so I just stared and continued eating my doritos. A little while later I leave the front desk for a brief moment and come back and my other coworker mentions to me ms racist said \"what is vanna0banana's problem why is she ignoring me? She shouldn't be shift lead if she ignores me why is she being such a bitch what's her issue\" I kinda just laugh it off and say I dont really care whatever right?\n\nCut to my break (we have 15 minute paid breaks and longer shifts you get a 30 minute unpaid lunch) I ask my coworkers if they're good if I go outside since it's pretty slow. They say no problem and I get my jacket and start to walk outside and say BRB and ms racist snaps \"um did you clock out\" to which I reply \"nope 15 minute breaks are paid\" and we stare at eachother for a solid 5 seconds while she's giving me the stink eye.\n\nI come back and my coworker said her response after I left was \"did you just see that? I can't believe the attitude I'm tired of being disrespected around here I'm gonna call assistant manager and tell him how disrespectful she's being\" and she leaves so my coworker immediately text my manager and says \"idk what ms racist is gonna say exactly about vanna0banana but I just watched the whole thing and I dont think she's being disrespectful at all in fact ms racist has kinda been rude to her all day\" \n\nWhen ms racist comes back she says to me that we need to talk so I go into the office and say what's up and she starts screaming at me about how I'm being disrespectful and she doesn't deserve my attitude and I'm too snappy and need to be professional in the work place and what's my problem, to which I respond \"I didnt snap, if I had I would have been a lot louder, more rude and had a lot more to say.\" She kept pushing me to answer what my issue is with her and after deflecting multiple times I finally said \"tbh after what I heard about you being racist I just have a completely different opinion of you\" she says \"it was a joke I have opinions too you know\" I say \"joke or not doesnt make it any less horrible\" she says \"I already talked to general manager and we're passed this plus I talked to Mexican coworker and she wasn't offended so what's your problem\" (Mexican coworker told me she was offended and wasn't sure if she should tell the GM and I was the one who urged her to do so because joking or not what she said was not ok) I say \"I have no problem I just dont like racists\" she said \"It was a joke!\" I say \"ok?\" And she continues to yell at me and of course gets all teary eyed and I force myself to maintain my cool because we are in the managers office and being recorded and I dont need to look like I have an attitude when in reality I didn't, I just dont like her. \n\nAnyway it ended with her asking if we're good to which I respond with \"as far as I can tell, are we done?\" She was almost in tears and fuming at this point and says \"I guess we are\" and I go back to what I was originally doing and she storms off while on the phone. I tell my two coworkers \"now if either assistant or general manager asks you what happened just tell them what you saw and one responded with \"I saw she's a fucking bitch\" and I was like ok maybe don't say that\n\nAnyway I'm trying to wrap my head around what happened and I am kinda nervous to talk to my GM because I dont like confrontation and hes really nice as far as I've seen and I don't really want him to be disappointed in me so I just need to know AITA for being \"snappy\" or \"unprofessional\"\n\nTL;DR racist coworker said I was disrespectful and snappy and cry/yelled at me in the managers office and I didn't really care cause I dont like her anyway.",

      "description": "Please read the full text before judging. There is a lot more that a simple title can't say.\n\nIt's my first time doing a AITA but I'll try to answer all the questions you might have. And I will take your comments seriously if IATA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this all started  early summer of 2017, so a year and a half ago. I was then at the 2 year mark of a relationship with a girl I can only described as shy, closed and who has difficulties speaking whats on her mind (We'll call her Ex). So, during those 2 years, I became an expert at seeing the signs when something wasn't right with her. So, early summer, that situation happen. She comes to my place and I instantly know something is wrong. Fast forward about an hour of trying to get her to talk, she finally tells me she cheated on me... With my best friend. Ex was crying and saying how sorry she was and how she knows it was a bad idea. \n\nNote that my Best friend was in a relationship with a girl at that time too.\n\nNow, you have to know that this girl was what I considered and still are, a girl that was waaayyy out of my league that I got lucky with. Smoking hot, funny and smart. She was Asian (I have a weak spot for them) and she was just perfect physically and sexually. So, I was.... kinda of  emotionally dependent of her... So, when she told me that, I wasn't angry. I was surprised... I told her that it was fine, that we can work something out (Bad move I know, I regret saying that now) so I contact my Best Friend (We'll call him BF) and I tell him that I know what happened and that I was ok with it. He was confused and claimed he didn't know what I was talking about. When I told him what Ex told me, he said \"Oh... that\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the following week, I kept thinking about it. Non stop. I question Ex loyalty and I was always afraid she would go off with another dude. After a week, I couldn't take it anymore and we broke up.\n\nNote that I've been friend with BF for about 9 years at that point, we met in High School and we stuck together since then. We were very very close and since BF only have an older sister, I was kinda of his Brother he never had... In a way.\n\nAnyway. A few days later, I talked with BF and asked him if he's gonna say what happened to his Girlfriend. He told me that he doesn't want to talk about it to anyone and that he want that event buried because he doesn't want that fact to hurt his relationship.\n\nWhen he says that I go \"Ok, so you're telling me I should be the only one suffering in this? I should keep that secret and not say anything to anyone because *YOU* don't want your relationship hurt?! Nah bro. Either you tell her what happen in the following 24 hours, or I'll do it. And trust me, my version will be a lot harder to take than if you are the one telling her.\"\n\nI hang up the phone and I decline any of his following phone calls. The next day, his girlfriend message me, saying that he told her the truth and that I acted a bit rough on him. Confused, I asked her what did he told her. This is what he said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently, a few months prior to me discovering Ex had an affair with BF, she came to his house (It was normal for her to know where he lived since we hang out there a few time). She told him how she wasn't in love with me anymore but she couldn't face me and tell it to me. She didn't know how to tell me so she wanted to make me leave her. So, her stupid mind came up with the idea of making me believe she slept with BF. Which would make me leave her and all BF had to do was to explain everything a few weeks later, when the dust would have settled. BF claimed that he refused instantly, saying that I'm a good guy and that I don't deserve that treatment. He said that she needs to tell me directly and honestly what she feels (Or doesn't feel anymore in her case) about me. But, she didn't care and went on with her plan anyway. That's why BF was confused when I told him I knew. I obviously didn't believed him so he contacted my Ex and she called me, telling me that it was true, it was a plan she made up to make me leave her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here start my question of, was I the Asshole?\n\nSo, *IF WHAT HE SAYS IS TRUE,* that it was all fake and they never slept together. (FYI, it's been over a year and a half and I'm still not sure which version is true BUT, I kinda believe it cause, during our 2 years, she always played the victim. Problem at school? She's the victim. Problem with friends and family? She's the victim. Problem at work and gets fired? She's the victim. And now, she got me to leave her so she can play the victim, with her family. But that's not the point of this post.)\n\nI told BF, why didn't you tell me she came to you with this plan? He told me that he thought she would consider something else and maybe come talk to me and we would resolve our situation. He didn't wanted to fuck up our relationship. So, I'm pissed at him at that point and tell him to fuck off, and that I need to think.\n\nGood timing since my family and I went on a road trip for a week.\n\nFast forward a week later. I decided I had enough of BF bullshit. This whole situation + other stuff I hold against him made me choose to cut the bridge between me and him. I was done.\n\nWhat I didn't know was that, at the same time, his girlfriend started having doubt about this whole situation and left him. At the same time, he also lost his job. So he lost his job, his girlfriend and his Friend of over 9 years. That pushed him to do a suicide attempt...\n\nHe failed for X reason. He called my father (He had his number cause he help him in the past with PC stuff since he's an IT) and asked him if he could come to our house to talk to me. I had blocked him from everywhere so he couldn't asked me directly. My father knew what had happened but decided to let him one chance to talk to me. He comes to my place, with the fresh razor blade mark on his wrist, crying. We talk for over an hour. I tell him that I want the truth and he stick to his story about being a plan from Ex. He said he will change and that all he wants is my forgiveness. He did change a lot since them. He is a way better person since then.\n\nI started to forgive him in the following weeks and months. Now, over a year and a half later, I am now engaged with a wonderful women I trust and BF and I repaired all the broken stuff behind us. But I still have trouble trusting him with meeting my fiancee...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, was I the asshole in this thing? AITA for forcing him to tell the truth to his then GF, which ultimately led to her leaving him. Which, combined with the other stuff, pushed him towards suicide. AITA for not believing him and wanting to cut all ties with him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nThen Girlfriend made me believe she slept with my best friend, which was just a \"Plan\" to make me leave her. I was so pissed off at my best friend that I was responsible for the breakup of his own relationship and OUR friendship which led him to try to kill himself. AITA here?",

Regardless, I said yes. \n\nBesides the fact that she did ask me to be her ‘date’ there hasn’t been any other indication that she is interested in me in that way.

      "description": "So background, I have a hard time understanding relationships of any kind. It has gotten better over the years, but navigating social situations does not come to me easily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for the situation. My ex-friend C and I have been friends since high school. But I recently have only considered to drop all contact with her after reviewing an event that happened 5 years prior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had gone bar hopping for her 21st birthday. I didn’t know my limits yet nor understood how dangerous sugary drinks could get and got really drunk. Before my black out period I was talking to a guy in one bar. My friends know I don’t flirt and this guy and I were talking about video games. My friends eventually want to leave and say I should stay with the guy. C gives me her phone to contact her if I need a ride since I didn’t have my own. I agree to this without thinking about anything other than wanting to continue the conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest of the story gets fuzzy because I was super drunk, but not long after that I was outside on the beach. It’s pitch black and the guy was getting aggressive with me so I start trying to call my friends for help with C’s cellphone. Next memory after that some guys were asking if I was okay and getting me a cab so that I can get back to C’s apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I come to the next morning my other friend tells me that C is beyond pissed at me since I had lost her phone on the beach. I didn’t have it with me when I got back and couldn’t tell her where it might be other than it is on the beach. I had also lost my glasses in the event and missed my flight home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nC didn’t contact me for months for losing her phone. And if the mention of the event ever comes up she still says how pissed she was that I lost her phone, and how irresponsible I was for missing my flight. Some of our friends came to my defense and said that C shouldn’t have left me there in the first place and that we should be thankful nothing bad happened to me . But she doubles down that the whole thing was my fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt super bad at the time for losing her phone and apologized profusely for it. I was able to pay her back for it in other ways since I did not have the money to buy her a new one. And she accepted this and we moved on with our friendship. But after going out clubbing with other people and seeing how everyone actually does look out for each other do I now see that her actions and attitude about that night were probably not right. I could have been seriously hurt and the fact that her phone was more important than my well-being just shows that she might not be a good friend and to split off the relationship. So I have stopped talking to her, but have not said to anyone why just yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess the questions are am I the asshole for wanting to split off the friendship for this one event? And/or am I the asshole for wanting to do it five years later?",

      "description": "As I was waiting for my truck to warm up to get food, I suddenly see my dog out on the road. He was close to being run over and I was able to quickly grab him and put him in the backyard. I noticed that my sister took him out to the washroom by himself and left the backyard gate open. She was already upstairs and had the door closed because it was cold. I was not in the mood to talk to her. Half an hour, after getting dinner, I see my dog again in the side yard by himself with my sister at the front door. I confront her about what had happened. And she didn't seem geniunely sorry for that, she just turned her back and just walked upstairs, and I pinched her traps and she started crying and saying I attacked her.\n\nI just want to know if I was the asshole and and how much of an asshole was I for doing that.\n\nIm pretty sure I was the asshole for doing that. Just wanted to hear your opinions.",

I don't know exactly what happened ( I wasn't there) but when I jumped into the conversation it seemed that they had worked their problems out. But the other day the problems started again out of nowhere they started (It was three of them) Lets call them P, J and A. Well it started with P telling my other friend E that he cant take criticism he was the one they were upset at before). After he deleted the previous conversation (he is a mod) to try to put it behind us and he just wanted to get along. Then as he and I continue to defend his actions to the three of them (P, J, and A) but they just wouldn't give up about 10 min of conversation later P just flat out calls E and idiot (Not that exactly but things I don't what to repeat here) and the conversation continues in his and my DMs well after about 20 min of him defending his point (E cant take criticism)  and me telling him it was borderline harassment of E. He calls the whole thing moronic and calls mean idiot (again more intense language) and that I'm over reacting. After that I banned them from the server and blocked them on all other platforms. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know some people will think this is a SHP but I'm really wondering AITA for flat out blocking a friend of 2 years?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone involved sees this (I know you have a reddit account) I still stand by my decision.",

      "description": "Today, my (17M) great grandma rode with me for the first time in a couple months. She started bitching, as usual, about me taking corners too fast and just generally going too fast. Yeh thing that really pushed her over the edge was when I drove through 2 empty parking spots between parked cars to get to the other side of the parking lot faster. She asked me to try to take my corners slower, at around 10-15 mph. I did just that and she still said I went to fast. She then (very snidely) asked “If the sign said 55 or 60, would you go that fast?”, to which I said yes. She then said I was crazy and that she was afraid of me getting a ticket or worse, getting into a wreck. My dad drives in a similar manner to me and she doesn’t seem to care much when he’s the driver. She also says that my great aunt (her daughter) is a much more careful driver (not really true if you ask my great aunt) and that she doesn’t always feel the safest with me. She said that I was better when I first got my license a year ago (I doubt that lmao) and that I’ve gotten worse. In the past she’s threatened to not ride with me any longer if my driving doesn’t get better/less risky. It hasn’t changed and she hasn’t followed through with her threat. The main reason it pisses me off is that I’m doing her a favor and she takes the opportunity to bitch about how I drive my car. ",

      "description": "My ex and I dated a long time (like 7 years) and then my ex broke up with me unexpectedly. I was upset during it but we remained friends after still.\n\nSometime later my ex wanted to get back with me but I didn't really want to, but being friends was ok, sometimes my ex would push boundaries a bit and I'd not stop them but overall it wasn't attention I wanted. I think I mostly remained friends because of how long we were together and felt like removing each other from our lives would be difficult and we liked being friends overall. \n\nWell sometime last year I got a new partner and my partner had me remove bad influences from my life that I desperately needed to do, one of who was my ex. I completely ghosted my ex and despite my ex trying to contact me asking what's wrong, am I okay, how they wanted to remain friends with me cause I'm important to them, I never did respond.\n\nSometimes I consider messaging the ex and explaining why I ghosted them, but at the same time it's been about a year since it all happened, been about 4 years since they've broken up with me. Should I just leave it in the past, given how long it's been? My ex has still tried to talk to me through family so I know they're not over it completely still. \n\nThe main reason I cut them out is because they were emotionally abusive towards me at times though it was mostly because their mental health wasn't good and I was always willing to bend over backwards for them no matter what. There was one time when we were both drunk that they got physical towards me but nothing other than that incident aside from yelling at me and it always came down to it being my fault, gray area for who's it actually was. \n\nWIBTA if I contacted them again? I don't actually want to keep talking to them but everyone says ghosting is bad so it makes me feel worse knowing I did it to not just them, but others as well. Most of who I cut out were people my current partner said were manipulating me which is true, I was put in many uncomfortable situations that I didn't know exactly how to get out of and figured that's how life is for me and dealt with it rather than making it stop. \n\nTldr, WIBTA if I contacted my ex to explain why I ghosted?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years now. She had depression, but she goes through good times and bad like always. Recently though she is hitt 25 years old and feels like she should have stuff figured out. She doesn't at all. I work in a very stressful job (emergency medicine) and see  a lot of mental health issues that get out of control. I recently confronted her about how she doesn't seem to want to get better because she has access to free services and won't use them. She has lost friends because she comes off as completely desperate for approval, so I am really the only person she talks to outside of work. I told her as such and she got extremely upset as if I was insulting her. She is still refusing to seek help and is saying that it's \"just who she is\" that has driven friends away and that nothing will change it. I have gotten frustrated to the point that I get angry with her very easily. I am afraid to go home sometimes because I feel like depending on the day I may spend every second of free time trying to comfort her instead of doing my from home side job or even just enjoying my life. AITA? Should I be okay with being her only source of comfort and respect her decision? ",

      "description": "I work in a print shop in my colleges union. There are about ten employees all students, and one manager who's an older guy, He's rather lazy and hates having to do anything more than he has to. There is almost always only two of us and our manager working at rather sporadic shifts around classes. A lot of our orders come in through email.\n\nSo, I come to work for my shift with my friend. We do the opening routine, and then get to the emails. I take one ordering a scientific poster. They had already been talking to another employee last night.\n\n The customer had asked if the poster and the images inside of the poster were high enough resolution to print correctly at 3x4. \n\nThe employee said yes it should be fine (which unknown to me or the customer was a lie).\n\nThe customer asked how much a poster printed on fabric cost (so she can fold it).\n\nThe employee quoted her the correct price of 60$.\n\nSo i get in and her email says to go ahead and print the poster. I print it since the other employee said the resolution was fine. I watch it print the first foot and the resolution was fine, then I had to help another customer. \n\nWhen I get back to it, there was one picture that had a pretty bad resolution. To be fair, when printing on fabric the quality does lower and it was a very dark photo so not the best for quality printing. Anyways I call over my friend because this is a 60 dollar poster and I don't know if we reprint it or if it's the normal quality or what. I have only worked here for a little, my friend has worked here for years. She says it's fine and to roll it up and tell the customer it's done. \n\nLater after I leave, the customer comes to pick it up and apparently she gets pissed and freaks out.  My friend tried telling her that she can just reprint the poster and she won't be charged it's our fault. My manager hears this and gets pissed at my friend and yells at her. \n\nIn my mind it's kinda all of our faults, the customer was being a little unreasonable, and my manager didn't need to freak out. Mistakes happen. I mean I don't think I'm an asshole since I'm new and yeah I will double check my coworkers from now on.",

She didnt really respond to my texts that much so I really didnt even get a chance to talk to her much.\nWhen the day came around I messaged her again and asked if we were still on. She said she totally forgot and was busy but suggested another day to go out. Usually I follow the rule that if a girl cancels a date without suggesting another day, it means shes not interested but she did so I kept going. \nA few days later we were supposed to go out again and she texted me earlier in the day and said that she was busy and had tons of homework but again suggested another day.\nThird times the charm right? Wrong. She cancels our date for the third time but says she feels super bad and says we can hang out the next day. \nThe next day I'm trying to iron out the details of the date and she says that we should just meet on campus and have a \"study date\" in the middle of the afternoon. This doesnt sound super fun to me for a few reasons: \n1. I wouldnt actually be able to get to know her\n2. I dont really study anyway\n3. We study completely different things so it's not like we could help each other\nThen she stopped responding before we could even pick a place to meet and stuff. At that point I just decided it wasnt worth it and gave up. \nThe other day she texts me, mad for standing her up, AITA?",

      "description": "okay, for some context, i am a freelance artist who mostly works off of Deviantart (it's not the prettiest place to work, but at this point i'm used to it) and i wanted to make some adoptable characters over the span of thanksgiving break and Christmas break, as the school i work at wouldn't have work, since of course all the kids were gone, and i wanted to make a tiny bit of money on the side. so i made three batches of 12, with two of them coming out thanksgiving and the last batch coming out before Christmas, however where this story gets interesting is with a person who was buying from me, who i am just going to call anon for privacy purposes.   \n\n\nhe had gotten a adopt from each batch, however i initially didn't really like doing business with him too much, as he would only say one word replies. and didn't have any common courtesy to say thank you me when i gave the adopts to him. but that was no reason to not sell to him, so i still gave them to him. the thing is, the way i set up the adopt buying process was that it was an auction, you'd pay me a minimum bid, or larger then that, and then people could bid more money after that. if 24 hours had passed since the latest bid, i'd put the adopt on pending until i got the money, but if you didn't pay me in 24 hours, it'd go back on sale with the bids reset. i did this as i am a busy person and i wouldn't always have the time to go and edit the like, 10 things i would have to show people the adopt was sold, give it to you, and make sure you had a reference sheet and color palate, so it helped to know when i was going to have to do all the editing so i could set time aside for it. but on the last batch, anon had gotten the highest bid on something for the third time, and i told him he had 24 hours to pay for it. no response from him at all. now, 26 hours later, way over the time limit by this point, he sent me the points and didn't even bother to apologize for being late. but the thing is i was going to go out with a friend 10 minutes later, where i'd be offline for a while, so i didn't have the time to maybe make the exception to him and give the adopt anyway, so i sent the points back, with the explanation of that he was too late so i had to refuse. about four hours after i got back, he said, and i quote;  \n\n\n\"N\\*\\*\\*a i was asleep\"   \n\n\ni was rather tired by this point, and admittedly really annoyed, so i sent a long winded reply about how he couldn't be asleep for 26 hours, and if he was going to be gone all day, he could have told me in advance and i would have given more time in advance. and also telling him that calling me a racial slur is really rude. but then he just proceeded to call me stupid and block me before i could explain to him further. however the thing is, even if he was rude after that, i feel like i might have been hard of him for not just waiting until tomorrow to give him the adopt, and that the rule was dumb and i was just picking on him for the reason of that he was slightly standoffish at first, but never was acting mean. so was i the asshole here for doing that?  \n\n\nTL;DR: i refused to sell an adopt to someone as he took too long to get back to me, we got in a fight afterwards, even if i could have made an exception to the rule despite it being a hassle to have to do.",

      "description": "Sorry in advance for any formatting problems, I’m on mobile.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom \n\nEarly in the school year, a friend of mine told me that she a guy was watching her. With her permission, I befriended the guy so I could talk to him about her. It was a success. But he still thought himself my friend after.\n\nI know he has other friends, but he tries to spend more time with me. I feel like he’s invading almost every aspect of my life without me wanting him to.\n\nHe moved to sit behind me in math. That’s fine, I can’t stop him from sitting there even if he sometimes talks while the teacher’s talking. He moved to sit at my lunch table, disrupting the established order of seats. He tries to sit next to me whenever there’s a space available, and sometimes when there isn’t.\n\nObviously that’s not everything, but it’s very much in the little things- him asking me about my private life and other things that are none of his business. \n\nNone of this would be awful, but I’m embarrassed to be seen with him. He randomly yells (and he doesn’t see what’s wrong with it), talks in a high, incoherent voice when he’s imitating someone, and makes repetitive, obscure jokes. He talks and argues when he’s not supposed to, including with teachers, and asks stupid questions (stupid because he’s been told the answer and he’s smart enough to remember). He admits that he tries to act stupid, and he’s very sheltered, which isn’t his fault, but it does cause some social problems in high school. Most people either think he’s weird or are annoyed by him, including me. \n\nI’ve grown tired of his lack of boundaries/social sense and I’ve been trying to distance myself from him by avoiding him when I can, making sure there isn’t anywhere to sit near me, and angling myself away from him when I’m talking to people and he comes over. But a few days ago he decided he could listen and contribute to a private conversation between my teacher and I about my schedule next year, and for some reason that really upset me. \n\nI invited a friend to sit behind me in math, where he usually sits, and said “I have a friend now!” without consciously meaning to say he’s not my friend. But he was upset and I didn’t want him to come back when I’ve been trying to get away from him for months. If it were someone else, I wouldn’t be worried, but he’s diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. (He is getting professional help already).\n\nTL;DR: I started talking to someone who annoys me and completely invades many aspects of my personal/social life. \n\nAITA for trying to stop being friends with them even though they’re severely depressed (but getting professional help), and didn’t do anything majorly wrong?",

      "description": "In high school a now former friend, Alice (Junior), confided in me (sophomore) that her father raped her when she was little. Alice also told me her mom knew and didn’t do anything about it.  \n\nBtw Alice was 16 when she told me, and I was 15.\n\nFast forward almost a year and our friendship fell apart. We grew closer with others, and one day we just stopped talking. A mutual ghosting, if you will. There was no blow up fight. Just lots of little things we never talked about due to us being dumb high schoolers with no communication skills. \n\nFast forward many months and it is almost Alices’s graduation. Alice is 17 but close to 18 and I’m 16. \n\nI told the school everything in an anonymous letter. (Weak of me to be anonymous, I know). I wanted to tell the school before she turned 18, but I didn’t want to see her in the halls at school (I was still a junior) So I waited until she almost graduated. \n\nAs far as I know nothing came of it.  I never found out and didn’t pry. Never told anyone and it’s been almost 20 years.  Never spoke to her again.\n\nWhy did I tell? Because I was angry at her parents and wanted them punished; and because I felt guilty knowing and not helping her. \n\nIn my heart I knew she didn’t want to report it. I took that choice away from her. She told me she didn’t want to report it, but I felt so guilty knowing the secret, I wanted to get it off my chest and, selfishly, feel better.  \n\nSo only a small part of me thought: she should be rescued while she is still a minor. Mostly it was: holy shit I can’t just sit on this info, it’s driving me crazy not acting. \n\n\n\n\n",

I've had a lot of friends do coke of the years, and generally it's not a major issue, they do it once every while at big parties and such. That's how this particular friend started as well a few months ago. But I've had a few friends who have completely fucked out and ended up ruining their lives from it.\n\nRecently she's being taking more and more often. Initially it became every weekend, then sometimes during the week, and now multiple days in a row. From what I can tell she started using around 4 months ago.\n\nI've tried speaking to her about it but she gets really angry, and lies to me about it saying she hasn't done when I know she has. The other day (on a week day) I asked if she had done coke the night before and she claimed she hadn't. I later accidentally saw a text conversation between her and someone else talking about the night before's coke.\n\nI've told her that I'm considering talking to her parents because I'm worried about her. She got really angry and told me it has nothing to do with me.\n\nWould I be the asshole for telling her parents? She will know it's me and I'm sure she'll never speak to me again if I do.

      "description": "I really like wasabi, I put it on things people probably shouldn't put it on (like hot dogs.)  So, we were having a family meal with my grandma and a couple of cousins and I put some wasabi on my plate to have with dinner.  My one cousin, let's call her Amy, is a very adventurous kid.  She likes to be included in everything, but in a healthy and not obnoxious way.  She's pretty chill.  So, Amy is looking at me and wondering why I'm eating this stuff that the rest of my family is giving me funny looks for eating.  I told her that it was wasabi, but it slipped my mind to mention how it was spicy.  She asks if she can have some, so I put a bit on her plate.\n\nQue disaster.\n\nWithout me watching, Amy got the same amount that I normally use with her fork and put it in a bite of rice. Big mistake, I have a large tolerance because of how much I eat.  Then she starts yelling at me about tricking her into eating something spicy.  She called me plenty of names while trying to find the closest drink.  Of course, wasabi doesn't burn for long, and she laughed it off afterwards, but the rest of my family looked at me like I was a dick.  I even got told off for it by my wife, her saying I shouldn't assume everyone knows what wasabi is.\n\nThings to consider:\n\nAmy is into plenty of pop culture, loves cartoons and comedies.  She also really likes video games and learning in general.  She's also pretty popular at school, so, definitely not a sheltered kid.\n\nAmy is very smart for her age.  Out of all of her siblings, she probably has the most potential.\n\nI always joke around about sharing the wasabi, since nobody else likes it, and everyone else vehemently refuses, I thought she would catch on that there's more reasons than one as to why nobody else wanted any.\n\nAmy has seen me eat extremely spicy things.  I like spicy challenges.\n\nThis is probably the most I've hurt my cousin in terms of physical pain. Well, maybe the couple of times I accidentally pulled a knot in her hair when brushing it, but still...\n\nAm I the asshole?",

So I put the key back in my pocket and go back to work.\nA few hours later, I checked my pockets to look for the key and it was gone. I looked everywhere but I couldn't find it. I lost the key.\nI know it's not my fault, but I think that if I would've let the key, maybe she could've find it.\nSo, am I the asshole for \"stealing\" a usb key and losing it, ruining the chance of the owner to find it?",

      "description": "Tldr: dad wants phone call every night son is with me but some nights I don't feel like it and I dont want to encourage son on nights he doesn't feel like it.\n\nBackground: My ex and I coparent very well for the most part. I have our son 4 nights out of the week. His father wants to talk to him each of those nights. Sometimes its not convenient, or one of us just doesn't feel like it. I have to be there monitoring because my son is 5 and will walk away from the phone, get distracted, or just not hold it right so his dad can see his face. Calls are between 5-15 minutes long. We use Facebook messenger as there are face filters that make it more fun for son.\n\nThey (dad and son) have a close relationship. Dad is a present, loving father which I am grateful for.\n\nEx is willing to call me the nights son is with him but I am usually busy. My son and I are very close and I dont feel like our relationship is negatively affected by not talking to him every night. In fact, I feel forcing him to phone talk sometimes makes him resentful too. The few times son has requested to talk to me I've always made myself available.\n\nTonight when ex called, my son asked for 30 minutes because he didnt feel like talking right then. Ex called exactly 30 minutes later and said because I didn't force the issue that son is walking all over me. He also requested that I be more involved in monitoring. Some nights I have walked away to brush teeth, do dishes or just my nightly routine. \n \nI'm becoming resentful of the fact that we dont seem to have an option to not have phone calls certain nights. AITA for feeling resentful? Are these phone calls necessary for my son's relationship with his dad? I don't get the feeling they are, I feel like I'm doing it more for his dad. \n\nSet me straight please, I'm not 100% sure whats right here.\n\nCross posted in parenting.",

We also work together and she told me that she fell out of love and has feelings for another coworker. I've been a heap of sad emotions and managed to get blocked on snapchat and facebook for not shutting my mouth.)\n\nMe: *Her name*? Can I ask you a loaded question so I can finally move on...before you block my number too. I'm not trying to get you back because I know you're 100% moved on\n\nHer: What\n\nMe: Does the new guy make you happy? No ill intent behind that sentence\n\nHer: He does.\n\nMe: That's great. I truthfully mean it. I just wish I was able to make you happy. The only reason why I kept talking to you was because I thought I could make you happy again but I failed. I didn't want to break up with you because I didn't want to hurt you but...I'm definitely the hurt one lol. I honestly love you but could feel no love when you talked to me. Hopefully we can reconnect in the future as friends but I definitely need to get over you.\n\nHer: You can't force someone to be friends with you, I needed space and you weren't giving me that and yeah I was losing feelings and tired of having to babysit my boyfriend basically. I was over it.\n\nMe: I completely understand. I definitely feel the hostility from you.\n\nHer: Well that's what happens when you aren't happy\n\nMe: I wish we've could of worked things out but what's done is done. To be completely honest, it devastated me knowing you fell in love with someone else.\n\nHer: I wouldn't say I love him\n\nMe: Okay. I just want you to be happy *her name* and he makes you happy. Seeing you today(seen her at work while clocking in) just showed me how much I'm not over you. I just need to heal. I'm sorry for not respecting boundaries. I was distraught. I honestly wish you the best and I'll love you as a friend for a long time because you were there during some shitty times and I really appreciate you. Do you ever see us making amends and being cool again?\n\nHer: No. I have no desire to be friends\n\nMe: Thanks for the honest answer.\n\nHer: I'm okay with everything that happened but I have no desire to be friends. \n\nMe: I just don't want to have an awkward vibe if we clock in at work. I have one last question\n\nHer: what\n\nMe: Do you hate me now?\n\nHer: I told you I don't\n\nMe: Okay I'm done talking before some more dumb shit flies out of me. I really wish you the best.\n\nRereading these texts and typing it out, makes me hate this weak person I've been during this whole breakup.",

He has a better job than my mom and has had a better career overall than my mom. I would always hang out with my dad every opportunity I got. I got my temporary permit and then got my license. As I got my license, my sister got her temporary permit. She let that expire. And then another set. One more set on top of that. She finally decided to go to driving school and then as she had her fourth temporary permit passed the driving test. She never claimed she wanted to drive. She liked to boast about being chauffeured around. My dad's credit was improving and he decided he wanted to get a new vehicle. He got one, but didn't want to trade in his old SUV. He had it for a few years prior and knew the transmission has been replaced. He put a few hundred dollars into it over the few years and he let me drive it around. Usually I would be going to school or work. He said that I was financially responsible for it. In the summer of 2018 my sister got her license and got her car. She worked all summer to save for it. I found an opportunity to go to Europe so I was working toward that goal. About 10 days after my sister got her car totalled. The insurance covered her car but it wasnt as flashy as my sister likes. \nToday she sent me a screen shot of a tweet that said, \"The Toyota that boy bought is worth more than the range rover handed down to that other kid.\" Or something along the lines.\nAITA for using my dads vehicle?",

I told the manager I couldn't come in as I had already made plans but was told since I didn't request off I had to find someone and if not I have to go in. I feel like I shouldn't have to request off on a day I don't work. I wasn't given a heads up that the person had requested the weekend off, and am sure that they called out last minute.

      "description": "This might be a long post because I'm covering two years of a relationship with a co worker, so I'll try to keep it as brief as possible. Thank you to those who stick with me because I really need some perspective. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've worked at my job for a little over two years now. I have two co workers who are in a relationship, the guy who we'll call Caleb has been there for 8 years and his significant other who we'll call Ashley as been there for over \\*12.\\* It's not a hard job, probably one of the easiest I've had and for the most part it had been pretty enjoyable for the first year and a half. I have a pretty decent ongoing relationship with my boss, who actually asked me to accompany her on a trip out of the country about six months after I started working there (she's older and physically needs help, she even flew me first class, nothing \"weird\" happened just fyi). \n\nThey told me when I started working there that there are no \"managers\" and that everyone is a manager. This was a red flag for me based on previous experience but I kind of ignored it because I was having fun. Another thing that started bugging me was the amount of shit talking about the owner that they'd do (especially Ashley), calling her a crazy manipulative bitch and such to the point that I started believing it. Now, she has a very big personality and can sometimes be a bitch for sure, but our relationship has been pretty solid over the years and someone who owns a store like that HAS to be a bitch sometimes. I hate to admit that sometimes I'd partake in the shit talking, and it kind of became an in joke with everyone else. I am not proud of this. It was very much an \"Us against her\" attitude and they were all very tight nit with it. \n\nI also noticed that Ashley, who was basically the store manager despite having any official title would constantly treat me like an idiot and be very cold to me from the moment I started, then would weirdly turn around and be very nice to me. I didn't understand because she was basically the one who interviewed me and got me hired. I consider myself a good worker, have had quite a few jobs and was only fired from one when I was 16 and irresponsible. I'm 31 now and while I don't consider myself the most gregarious person in the world I believe I have a good work ethic and attitude, so this was really strange for me. I'd do what I was told, not give any sort of attitude and do it the best I could. When I fucked up on something, I took it seriously and tried to fix it (I can be very forgetful sometimes). I spent way too much time trying to figure out what I did to deserve such attitude, so I worked very hard to get on her good side because she was the only one preventing me from really enjoying the job fully, so I started getting to know her better, asking her about her relationship with Caleb and trying to do things to make her job easier. \n\nFast forward a year or so and I actually got to know Caleb and Ashley decently well and found myself pretty good friends with them, especially Caleb despite him being a very big intimidating guy (I've seen him put people in choke holds). We'd hang out at their house and have a good time watching movies and cooking food, go to each other's birthday parties, buy each other gifts, and the coldness that Ashley was projecting onto me previously wasn't really around anymore. I was really happy about this, and it continued on for about a year until recently. \n\nI have a slight problem sometimes where when I get pushed into a corner I say white lies. Not my best quality, but it's something that I'm working on. The more aggressive someone comes at me, the more it happens. I'm not proud of this at all, but the reality is that it's usually over petty things and when it comes to serious issues I'm a pretty honest person and see the importance in that. I had lied about a couple of things here and there to Ashley, nothing really that major or done out of malice, basically just trying to save face because I have self confidence issues I guess. \n\nOne time it was about accidentally taking one set of store keys home with me and not immediately turning around and bringing them back. I had told her that I had put them in my sweatshirt pocket and forgot about them when I left, when in reality I noticed they were hanging out of my back pocket about half way home, and told myself I'd bring them back the next day because I was being a lazy ass. Well she checked the cameras and saw the keys hanging out of my back pocket on my way out. \n\n\\*Strike one.\\*\n\nA little while after that my boss had taken a big spill head-first while walking through the store. She had actually hit her face on the ground and had a big welt on her forehead. The next day Ashley and Caleb told me about it, and Ashley offered to show me on the cameras. I watched and we all chuckled at it, but later that night after reflecting on it I felt really bad. The next day my boss asked me if I had heard about her fall and I replied with \"Yeah I saw. It looked really painful.\" She realized that I had seen it on the cameras, it was mostly a slip I guess because I wasn't really in the mindset to feel I needed to cover for Ashley, yet didn't really go out of my way to tell the boss either, it just kinda came out. The boss confronted Ashley and said I had mentioned that I'd seen it on the cameras. The boss was furious and revoked Ashley's access to the cameras, saying that she was abusing her power and trying to embarrass her. I agreed with that decision, but when Ashley found out she was furious at me for it, thinking I had run to the boss and proclaimed that Ashley was abusing her power. I believe she still holds a grudge against me for this because she still brings it up as if it's \"no big deal.\" I am not as stupid as she thinks I am, and know this to be false. She is very prideful and jealous of other people, so when she takes a blow she holds a grudge for a very long time. I know this about her. \n\n\\*Strike two.\\*\n\nEven the boss's son, who worked with us for awhile and was being treated like shit by her (he was admittedly somewhat lazy and tried to get out of work, but it very much reminded me of the way she treated me when I got hired despite me having a better work ethic), confronted her about it and guess who got in his face? Caleb. Caleb is very protective of her, because she has a panic disorder and doesn't handle confrontation very well. This may make me sound like a complete asshole, but I have started to notice that her panic attacks mostly seem to happen when she is confronted for her mistakes, and Caleb is there every time to swing his dick around and call everyone an asshole for treating her like shit. \n\nRecently, things have gotten A LOT worse at work. Ashley hasn't been communicating with people or the owner properly and it's basically me who has to pick up the pieces almost every time. She changed the schedule without asking any of us, so someone didn't know they worked and didn't show up, which resulted in me having to work a double shift without overtime pay (it's a small business), her and Caleb were over two hours late for work and I had to stay and cover for them one time, despite them being late for doing work related stuff, there was no call or anything just an assumption that I'd stay and be cool with it. All of this happened without a single acknowledgement or apology from her for fucking up. I had a conversation about it with my boss, who was beside herself trying to figure out what was going on. We speculated that maybe something was going on in her personal life, maybe her anxiety was worse and she was getting forgetful, and agreed to leave it alone for awhile. After all, Ashley has worked there \\*twelve years.\\* \n\nAshley somehow found out about this conversation, and even went as far to confront me about it. She successfully twisted the whole thing to make me look like the bad guy proclaiming \"I want to be your friend again, but how can I do that when I think you'll run to the boss every time I say something? How can I trust you? You can't trust the boss, she will play you like a fiddle and turn you against us.\" The crazy thing is: I ended up apologizing for it and believing her. Fuck me, right? I literally can't have a conversation about this with her, because honestly I'm scared that if I criticize her, her boyfriend will get pissed at me and do something stupid. That is what made me furious more so than having to work extra the more I thought about it. So I had another conversation with the the boss and told her what happened, and we agreed that the whole thing is highly suspect, and to be really honest with each other by not giving Ashley any room to figure out what's going on. The boss told me that she thinks it's time for a replacement for Ashley, and I (feeling somewhat sick and heartbroken over the whole thing, realizing that my friend really wasn't a friend at all) told her that if I was in her position I'd do the same.\n\nAshley now thinks that the boss is playing favorites with me and suspects something it going on, when in reality we have a good working relationship and haven't had any trouble with each other mostly because I've been honest to her about what's going on in \\*her\\* store. Ashley and Caleb have this attitude that the store is theirs and walk around like hot stuff, somehow impervious to criticism as if they're so important that they can't be replaced. Now Ashley is attempting to manipulate me again, by being overly-nice in some cases and extremely cold in others. Some nights she won't even talk to me, turning her back towards me while laughing with other people, bringing them food etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for going over her head, reporting it to the boss, and forced to have secret conversations about someone who has seniority over me?

      "description": "This just happened, and I’m being yelled at for it, just wanna check in with y’all. \n\nI live in a major city in an apartment...I go off to a friends house up the street and get a frantic call from my roommate who is hollering and having damn near a panic attack about a mouse in the apartment (First one I ever heard of in the apartment). I stay on the phone with her to understand what is going on, basically the mouse was running around the house and it kept going in her direction. She got scared, but managed to trap it under a piece of Tupperware on the floor with a shoe on top. I told her that she had a few options...throw it out the window, put it in the trash, or take it outside and let it go in the park across the street. \n\n\nShe seemed to calm down so I let her go and came home about an hour later. I walk in and she is laying on the couch and just points at where the mouse STILL is over an hour later. There were no air holes poked in the Tupperware, nothing had been done at all. I proceeded to get a bit frustrated and put my shoes back on to deal with it, saying in an exasperated tone “you didn’t deal with it?!” Which agitated her greatly. I took the mouse outside and let it into the park. \n\nIn my mind, she scared the ever loving shit out of a defenseless animal, and deprived it of oxygen for no reason other than her inability to acknowledge that she could kill this creature without even a thought. She could have dealt with this animal in any way other than leaving it to die where it was. She said she was going to deal with it whenever she left to go to the gym, and needed time to not think about it. She also kept harping on about “What if there are more!!?” To which I responded “It’s a city!! There are DEFINITELY more.” She’s now furious with me because I brought up that I want to be able to trust her to deal with problems in the house when I’m not there, and now she’s not talking to me. \n\nAm I just being insensitive to someone being more afraid of a mouse than I am? Or is this something that should be easily handled without dramatics and a whole argument?",

      "description": "For starters I broke up with my ex early last year. We agreed to replace him on the lease so he could leave, and I could have his portion of rent covered. I do not make enough to cover the expenses alone. I work full time without much downtime. This was supposed to be a two month arrangement. My friend agrees to be my future roommate but he quits his job where he is at (a state away) because he cannot stand it. Ok so he continues to struggle to get a job there. It takes so long I ask my ex to delay moving out and thankfully he agrees.\n\nHowever after a month and a half past the two month agreement, I didn't feel right asking him to stay any longer. My new roommate still cannot get a job. He says he's trying but I had/have my doubts. I have to pay all the expenses for two months. Then he moves up with money from his parents with still no job. It takes him another month to get hired and I'm still paying for everything during that time. He does help clean up and stuff during this time at least. This all put me back a couple thousand dollars which the interest is killing me even today.\n\nI've never been in debt before. He agrees to help pay off some of my debt. Great. He starts paying about half the average rent and expenses great even helps out buying groceries often. However I'm really struggling due to this debt. I asked him for about $300 to help me catch up on debt. He didn't want to and begrudgingly gave me $200 and told me it's a \"one time thing\" and \"I'm only doing this to be nice\" and I felt really bad. It's been several months since then and I haven't asked again but I'm not making progress paying off that debt.\n\nAITA I'd I ask for money to help pay that debt off which only occurred because he took far longer than we agreed to move in?",

      "description": "Today, after months of actually wanting to leave, quit on my boss. I worked at a franchised liquor store, working part time but eventually became full time because my boss wanted it that way. I went from working weekends to 5 sometimes 6 days a week. I worked two jobs, one there at the store, another working for my mom taking care of her, she's a 350 pound bed ridden woman, she can't do anything, I do get paid for it by a third part program that pays me to take care of my mom, similar to a home health aide. I get no sleep because my mom's ethics are.. off, she doesn't allow me to sleep for very long, I usually wake up to my name being screamed throughout the house, it's become a psychological thing where the sound of my name makes me angry. She takes advantage of me, to put it short. My job at the liquor store was great until my boss changed my schedule, without asking me if it was okay to change, me, being the guy that I am, I'm more prone to just keeping quiet and accepting the change rather than argue about it, my part time, weekend only job turned into a full time job, on top of taking care of my mom, I never got proper sleep, and my boss would blame all the mistakes done in the store on me, I was her scapegoat. The store made me miserable, I hated being there and always told myself I would never stay at a job I hated yet I did, for some reason. Long story short, a few hours ago I told her I was done, I respect her as a boss and I appreciated the time she gave me there but I couldn't do it anymore, the job made me absolutely miserable, I have my mom to take care of, a baby on the way, and roughly 30 animals to take care of, they're all my responsibility. This job killed my enthusiasm, killed me inside. The way my boss treated me was beyond anything I accepted, she treated me like dirt, as she did any of the guys who worked there. Only the guys but I was her favorite to fuck with, I never stood up for myself until I quit. Am I an asshole for just quitting on her? ",

Because we're so small most of us are acquaintances if not good friends.   \nOne of our guys, let's call him John, has a myriad of mental disorders ranging from schizophrenia to depression and sometimes doesn't show up for weeks at a time due to his mental health. Everyone more or less deals with his absence because one, he's one of the joint owners, and two, know him. Personally, I went to law school with him and would consider myself good friends with him. The issues didn't appear (or didn't get diagnosed) till he graduated.   \nA couple days back we got a massive immigration case involving an entire family. Normally, we all work separate cases but because of how much work there is this time the other joint owners have decided that me and John would work together on the case and split the money.  \nNow, John has just come back from his longest absence yet, almost two months. I don't think he's ready mentally to work on such a big case. He seems extra out of it this time and I would know because I've known him a very long time. He's unfocused and is borderline apathetic to everything.     \nI don't want to work with him in this state as I would do most of the work as John doesn't seem to be able to, or want to do any of it. Also I feel there's a risk that John would break down again halfway which would be even worse than going solo.   \nI raised this issue at our last meeting and everyone seems to think I was being a dick to John. John himself seems really shocked and hasn't talked to me since.  \nWas I being the asshole and should I apologize?",

We had a big heart-to-heart that seemed to sweep away lot of the messy initial dating debris and all was sexy sweet. Just before she left tonight, she said she doesn't want to go out to the club on friday and just wants to stay in an fuck. This struck me unexpectedly cold. BTW Our sex has been amazing. \n\nI have been enjoying getting close to her (It felt mutual) and exploring each other physically and mentally. Going to this club was a end of year blow-off and would involved a wonderful mix of dancing, drugs and intimacy. I dont really give THAT much of a fuck, but it did feel to me part of a formative process. \n\nAITA for feeling insecure?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I moved to a new house on a street that is used as a shortcut to the freeway. Its an old and low income neighborhood and its pretty obvious when people actually live here or are just driving through. There are 3 parks and an elementary school within 200 yards of my house, so there's a lot of foot traffic (dog walkers, joggers, cyclists, kids walking to school).\n\nThe fact that its a shortcut to the freeway means that we get a LOT of traffic coming through and people drive pretty quickly through the neighborhood. I understand going 5 over, but its common to see cars going 45mph with a limit of 30. I've had people road rage on me while i ride my bike, I even have people use the wrong lane to pass me when I'm in my car.\n\nI've gotten tired of these people abusing our neighborhood and endangering people that live here. I recently started purposely driving 5mph under the limit within neighborhood limits (so 25mph). I also take my sweet ass time pulling out and into my driveway to make people have to slow down a little. I do a full stop at stop signs and wait a few seconds before continuing even when its clear. When turning left, I am extra cautious and wait till its completely clear before beginning my turn. I do this 1. To hopefully remind the shortcut people that this is a neighborhood and they need to drive carefully 2. To hopefully make people rethink using this street as a shortcut and 3. Because I LOVE to see these people flip out in my rearview mirror when all I'm doing is driving cautiously. AITA for roadraging back?\n\nMy most recent incident was yesterday. I was leaving for work and began to pull out of my driveway. I noticed a truck further down the street that was driving noticeably over the limit so i made sure i took my time to reverse out of my drive, come to a stop, switch gears, and calmly speed up to 25mph. The way I did this meant that the truck behind me needed to slow down to about 15 mph while i finished. He then proceeded to tailgate me the entire way up the road while flashing his highbeams. When we came to the stop sign, he switched to the opposite lane and ran it before i could even come to a stop.\n\nI know that this can also be considered road rage. Yes, I know that i can petition the city to install speed bumps. A neighbor tried that process but failed because we didn't meet minimum traffic requirements. They just lowered the minimum and I think we can easily get it, but I have to wait till next year before we can apply again. \n\nThere are 2 ways I've thought about this behavior. One is that I'm just following the rules and hopefully slowing other people down in the process in a 'malicious compliance' type deal. The other is that I'm going out of my way to antagonize these people who are just trying to go about their day, and possibly even angering them to the point where they drive even more aggressively (like with the truck).\n\nAITA for passive aggressively road raging?",

I have two dogs and have trained them to listen and to stay off things they don't belong on, that's what I expect.\n\nEverytime I sleep there I wake up pissed off because my sleep was interrupted multiple times, she gets pissed at me being grumpy and gets even more pissed off when I say something because \"I'm insulting her babies\" \n\nShe makes it out as me being a jackass for not being okay with this but I don't think a reasonable person should be okay with it.\n\nOpinions?

      "description": "I’m not religious.  My family is Catholic and when I was little we would sometimes go to church, but eventually we just stopped.  All I remember is a lot of standing, then kneeling, then sitting, and basically just repeating that.  When my boyfriend asked me to come with him to his church I figured why not, it couldn’t be that much different.  \n\nThe church was really small and not so much a church as just a regular looking building that they used as a church.  I’d say there was maybe like ten people there give or take a few.  It started out fine.  It was really like my experiences with church, there wasn’t the kneeling thing.  The pastor just read from the Bible and explained what it meant in more detail, it was actually kinda interesting.  \n\nThen came the music part.  During that is when people started acting crazy.  Not all of them, but the majority started speaking total gibberish.  Not just a word here or there, like all through out the songs.  My bf wasn’t, but he wasn’t fazed by it at all. \n\nAfter church my bf asked me what I thought.  I told him I liked the Bible explaining part, but the music part was crazy.  That the people speaking gibberish were really weird.  He just said it wasn’t weird and it’s shitty of me to judge people who welcomed me.  I didn’t want it to turn into a fight, but I mean it is pretty weird to be swaying back and forth talking in complete gibberish for an extended period of time.

      "description": "Not sure if this is the correct place to post, if not please give me directions.\n\nI share a flat with three other people. I want to talk about one of my flatmates.\n\nI don't want to sound mean about it, but she seems like a spoiled, privileged kid. During the start of out rent, when everybody moved in, I already knew this girl was something else, literally nothing you told her would impress or interest her (she even admitted it herself that nothing satisfies her), then she'd tell you with how bad she was treated by her ex, and all that. Every time something goes not her way in the flat (fe. somebody leaves their laundry on until 10 PM), she would rage because she needs to sleep, even despite the fact that she goes to sleep way past midnight. She's not doing her house chores; we've got a system in which every person does all the cleaning chores weekly to make stuff even, everybody minds their own business in the other aspects. This did not take long enough for us and pretty much everyone on the flat to stop talking to her.\n\nI think it's important to add this to context, so I'll state it: I am a young adult that moved out on his own in order to cut out from his toxic family. I've never felt loved or taken care of, I'm also a youth mistake. I recently cut off my family because they're alcoholics and they don't want to change themselves, even though I told them multiple times this is a problem (one of my highschool teachers told me she came to a parent's meeting kinda drunk one day, which made me kinda die inside).\n\nSo here's the thing. I hear her talk over the phone with her mother daily. I don't want to sound like a stalker, but it's hard not to hear when you're in the kitchen preparing food. She would talk about all that's happened during her day, and what not. I have no idea why, but it just pisses me off being around this.\n\nAITA for feeling that way about her? Is she genuinely a pretty mediocre person, or do I project some of my own insecuries on her in a way I don't realize? I also feel like an asshole for giving a fuck way much than I should, and I should mind my own business.",

Me and her had a semi toxic relationship but we were  still very good friends during and after the relationship and continued  to have an on again off again relationship for the year or 2 after our  breakup. she could be manipulative but was all around a nice and  thoughtful girl. When we broke up she and her friend brayden got  together and cheated behind her female best friends back (was currently  date brayden).\n\nafter that situation was  dealt with she and another guy called tyson started dating. at the same  time my friend Jamal had fallen in love with her (my ex girlfriend). I  was not opposed and i was fine with it. He would talk about how he would  seriously harm himself anytime that she talked about her new boyfriend  around him and i was very concerned for him\n\nHe  was harming himself more and more frequently and i felt i needed to put  an end to it. She is experienced with self harm herself and i told her  to refrain from talking about her and her new boyfriend and to lookout  for him. He stopped self harming and the situation was resolved or i so  thought. It could've been seen that i did it out of jealousy but i was not worried about this because i knew she didnt like him back and i wanted what is best for her and her new boyfriend.\n\n2 months later Jamal found out i  had talked with her through my friend nate and he went off the rails.  Started trash talking me to everyone and saying he wants to fight me.  tensions were high he was jeopardizing relationships with me and the  rest of my friends and in my eyes i was helping him even if it could  have been seen as a betrayal of his trust. The fight was hyped up  throughout the school and i was taken to the principals office and  locked there until i agreed i wouldn't fight. I left and went to the  fight anyways as lots of my peers had my back and it turned into a  situation where other people who were at odds were backing one of us in  the fight because of their personal beefs with eachother. i showed up to  the fight and we got ready. i had a  last minute change of heart and  didnt fight back because i was still upset that my best friend was mad  at me and i wanted to mend things. He didnt see it the same way and he  fought me while i only defended myself. He since moved away and we  havent talked since other than hearing about him talking bad about me to  mutual friends.\n\ni  stand by everything i did and i feel like i handled it with the best  grace that i could but it could be seen that i betrayed his trust\n\nsorry for grammar i was typing fast\n\nAm i the asshole? ask any questions needed.",

      "description": "This morning, as I was getting ready to head to school, I was in a rush to pack everything up and make it on time. Computer, notebook, iPad, everything. \n\nAs I was headed for the door my mother asked me if I had everything, and listed off the things I needed, to which I replied “yes” to all of them. \n\nThen as I turned to leave, that was when my dad made a joke about school shootings that I found hurtful. He asked “Did you pack your gun?”\n\nI turned back at him, said nothing, and gave him a look of disgust as a proceeded to storm out of the house into the garage to get into my car. My mom asked why I didn’t say goodbye to dad before I left, and I told her why, that he asked if I had a gun with me and I didn’t take it lightly as a school shooting joke. \n\nSo after she heard that, she went back into the house and yelled at dad for doing that, and when she came back she told me that my dad had not replied anything when she yelled at him, probably out of embarrassment. We proceeded on our daily routine, I headed to school and the day went like any other. \n\nWhen I got back home, I was still pissed at my dad for making a joke about school shootings when I almost went through one myself, no joke. The day after the events at MSD, I had to hide in a dark locker room for 1 and 1/2 hours not knowing if I was going to die or not, when it was in fact a false alarm where a cop’s pistol went off accidentally. \n\nNonetheless as I entered the house I avoided him and got right to my homework. Everything went well for me, and he in fact ignored me too. He sent a text as I got home to try and get my attention but I ignored that too. When dinner came we sat next to each other at the table and I didn’t say a word to him or even look at him since what he did made me uncomfortable being around him. \n\nAnd so today I pretty much went all day without talking to my dad because of that joke he made. \n\nI feel like I may have overreacted and I could have done something else, but I felt that I was just too hurt and offended to be around my dad after what happened. \n\n",

      "description": "AITA for not returning to work after maternity leave despite planning to and leaving my husband to be sole provider unexpectedly?\n\nI have fairly severe postpartum depression and anxiety that I can’t afford treatment for (I could if I went to work, but my symptoms would be 10x worse, so I can’t win there...). My husband said he would be cool with me staying home and caring for baby but he would have to get a second job to make up for lost income. Therefore, he couldn’t help with the house or baby as much. I agreed on these terms and said I would do the majority of baby and housework I possibly could due to my appreciation of him not getting pissed at me for unexpectedly quitting my job and offering to let me stay with baby. \n\nMade perfect sense to me, except now he never got the second job because “he was too stressed and tired”. So the income situation got worse, which made him more stressed out, and now I feel like there’s no reason I should have to do all the work by myself. But he disagrees. He says he is exhausted from work and having to get up early and “works his ass off so we don’t go further into debt.” I know he probably is legitimately stressed out of his mind so I feel terrible but also...seriously? I didn’t agree to the terms of him working a normal full-time job and then NEVER helping with the baby. The agreement in the first place was that I did majority of the work, not all of it. Now I’m just confused and hurt that all he wants to do after work is play video games and avoid caring for this baby I thought he wanted just as bad as me....\n\nTLDR I unexpectedly left my husband to solely provide for me and new baby, agreeing to take on majority of household responsibilities but now he literally does nothing. Am I the asshole for blindsiding him with cutting our income in half and adding the extra stress in the first place? ",

      "description": "For fairness' sake I'll give their perspective first:\n\n- They had 830 plans but still wanted to hang out. \n\n- They wanted to start earlier than usual to give everyone a good chunk of time. \n\n- They said they were available \"early evening-ish\" and solidified the plan at 530\n\n- Their friends weren't ready until 7. Then they canceled because there wasn't enough time left. How inconsiderate of them.\n\nNow here are the other details:\n\n- They did not tell us there were 830 plans, and there was no way for us to know about them. \n\n- They did not tell us that the confirmation (530) was also the intended start time. It's earlier than usual. \n\n- We communicated every step of our process. Finishing a show, working out, showering, etc. \n\nIm struggling to see how this isn't their own fault. \n\nIf I knew about the 830 plan, I wouldn't have agreed in the first place. And if I did, I would have gotten there faster\n\nIf I hadn't found out about the 830 plan, we would have driven over, got settled in, and kicked out soon within an hour. That seems just a smidge more inconsiderate than showing up at 7 on a Saturday. ",

I've recently decided to be blunt with how I feel to try get her to realise what's happening but it's just come off as me not supporting her through her issues.

Incidentally parents are leaving for vacation to Italy, first time to Europe/out of country, the following weekend. Which they have been planning for probably 6+ months now. \n\nIn my wife's defense she claims there are undertones of not showing up for things. I would argue it goes both ways.  We used my (and some of my mom's) airline points to fly mom and grandma into town for our baby shower. We ended up not heading down (5 hours drive) for brothers graduation (wife was 8 months pregnant) where whole family (my side) was present. We did travel down the previous weekend for her sisters baby shower. \n\nThe next bit is important, for context as it puts more importance upon every baby related event. Dad missed still born birth of first child, albeit I believe he was going to come down for a funeral service because he wanted to be there for that, which didn't end up happening. This is the one that really sets the undertone as my wife believes dad will fully missed, where as I believe it to be a miscommunication to our plans to remember. Doesn't help that we've never talked about it. \n\nAm I the asshole for not being annoyed, and conciquently not sticking up for my family, with my parents for not being able to make it to said birthday party?

      "description": "Here's some context.   \nThe university I attend provides transportation services for students who are interested. So, the students in my bus play loud music on the bus speakers, everyday during mornings and evenings. When one student gets off, the other uses the aux cord, and when that person gets off, the next student takes it. And the cycle continues till everyone gets off which is to the second to last person (I get dropped off last and picked up first).   \nWhen I told the student who plays music to turn it down a little, she told me to plug my ears with cotton, I didn't say anything then because she a year ahead of me and it would be disrespectful (it's a huge thing in my country). And other one does lower the volume but she is only one of many (around +5 students who play music).   \nSo a few days ago, I complained about it to transport service head, and he said he would take care of it. And then they weren't allowed to play anymore. But now the students are writing applications to the transport head and the advisory to get permission.   \nKeep in mind that I am perhaps the only person who objects to this. They don't know that I'm the one filed the complaint.   \nToday, a 4th year student said that she would appeal to the advisory to get permission and I am thinking about countering it when she eventually does.   \nAITA for doing what I'm doing? Even if I'm just one person, I think my choice should also be taken into account. I already told them that I object to this behaviour and that if anyone wants to listen to music that badly, then they should bring their earphones but they hell bent on playing music on the speakers.",

However lately something has been bothering me during sex over last couple weeks. Now my gf is overweight but I never really cared as she goes to the gym with me and watches her intake like me. Yet I can't help but lose my erection earlier than I ever do in any time in my life during sex. I keep thinking about it but I think I'm turned off over her weight and its bothering me a lot.

I had no insurance, could not afford treatment or rehab and have had pain and difficulty with an ankle and hip ever since. Constantly hopping in and out of my car to grab orders and walk to people's doors or dorms in sub-freezing weather makes my life unbearable. As in, unable to walk upstairs at home to the only bathroom, or sleep normally. The roommate knows this.\n\nThe other problem is that when I'm doing deliveries, I can't work (I rideshare fulltime) because instead of doing a day or two of solid delivery work or a couple hours a day throughout the week, he spaces out the deliveries, changes the schedule multiple times every. Single. Day. so I'm working for him 25-35hrs/we instead, and I can't accept uber fares on the chance I get a long ride or he scolds me for \"ruining his business\". Of which he has 3.

      "description": "So a little backstory. I’ve been dating this girl for about 5 months now. Everything was going well until about a week ago. Last week we had a date and everything seemed perfect until I arrived home from the date. That night she said that she was tired of me being “helpless and indecisive” and that she needed time to consider our relationship, but in my defense I’m currently living in a foreign country and am still relatively new to the country. I agree that it would be best for her to think the relationship over and give her time to think. A few days go by and we end up speaking again and get back together.\n\nOne thing to add about my girlfriend is that she wants regular updates — at one point she got angry because I hadn’t updated her to let her know that I was busy.\n\nJust yesterday we say ‘good morning’ to each other, something that we do regularly, and I ask her how her day was going. It wouldn’t have bothered me had she explained that she were busy, but she left me on seen for 10 hours, until she finally responded with a single-word response.  I am normally a level-headed guy, but this got me a bit annoyed. I asked her why she couldn’t give me an update after she had gotten angry at me for the same exact reason, but this only got her angry, saying that she was busy and couldn’t respond. Also to note, I had seen that she was active on/off messenger throughout the day. I was just asking for some reciprocity, just a simple update. I would have understood completely if she were busy, I just wanted as little as a, “Sorry, busy rn.” \n\nThe relationship is even more strained after what happened and might end in breakup. I feel a little guilty because maybe she was just stressed out and I only added to her stress and possibly at a time where she might have needed my support. So AITA for wanting reciprocity in the relationship?",

      "description": "Sorry for the wall of text. This turned into a bit of a rant...\n\nI’m a person with typically no drama in my life so this whole situation was an out of this world experience for me. I (28f) have been friends with Slim (35m) for over a year now. He sells drugs low key (Ike 3 customers) and I never really cared cos he was fun to talk to, always surprised me with his intellect, and we just had fun times together. I knew he had a gf named Hops (20f) when I first met him. \n\nHe and I first connected because he was in a relationship with a junkie and I had just gotten out of one so needless to say I had a lot of solid advice that I wish I had known sooner and hearing about my failed methods seemed to really give him perspective. This developed into a strong friendship and although he sometimes got a little too close I never went there because of his relationship and my lack of attraction. \n\nLong story short, their relationship went from trying to work things out to - broken up then back together for a day and broken up again etc. I only met Hops once or twice and even she told me she was leaving him the next week. So one night he and I took a popular club drug and ended up doing the deed. I didn’t feel guilty cos they weren’t together. the drug made me horny, and you skip the awkwardness when you fuck a friend. \n\nMonths go by during which they are mostly broken up and she is moving out but as these things go, they end up together again. Slim and I remained good friends and Hops knew I was a friend and thought I was a customer. I never wanted this girl at my home but Slim talked me into it one night. Saturday before Halloween. Three of us were partying pretty hard and planning to go out once dressed. Hops offered to do my costume makeup. During this time I got REALLY fucked up and ended up passing out in her lap. \n\nI woke up at 3am with my phone missing, work laptop, engagement ring, and other valuables. And my dog howling to be let in as she had been let out on a dangerous street. No word from the perps for 12 hours. Finally Slim contacts me. Apparently Hops broke into my phone and spend hours going through my messages. She found maybe 3 sexual ones from months ago but she also found some shitty stuff Slim said about her like he wanted to get her to pass out so she wouldn’t bother us (I never replied to those kind of comments cos WTF?!) In her (righteous) hurt and anger, she started going through my belongings. Slim tried to stop her but she said it’s either that or she pummels me in my unconscious state. He said he watched everything she took and made sure it ended up only in his trunk and then His storage unit so he could return it to me. \n\nHe told me she was hurt and I should take it easy. Being someone who was cheated on, I decided to oblige. He ended up bringing back a lot of my stuff (work laptop was vital) and I talked to her for 5 hours instead of sleeping. She claimed if I answered her questions I’d have my stuff back. I asked if she had my things and she lied and said she did then got hostile when I asked for proof. \n\nAnyways, my point was that I was as nice and understanding to her as possible considering the situation and I felt and still feel like a shit human even though I don’t feel I did anything morally wrong. Here’s where i decided to be an asshole. She left her makeup bag and a go pro during her get away. I planned to give it back but never offered and was eventually asked (begged) by Slim to do it because it was her bday. \n\nI couldn’t just give it back however. So I mixed some rancid shit together (piss, toilet water, dog shit, drain cleaner) and dipped every brush and painted it on every item of makeup. Then I took apart the go pro and disconnected some cable so it didn’t work but wasn’t technically broken either. The makeup thing is gross af but it made me feel good knowing she is putting this on her face. \n\nI felt like she deserved it because of how she acted... that victim woe is me mentality. When I was in her shoes (mind you my husband had a year long affair so my shoes were much worse) I still had the sense to take some responsibility. So did my husband. His mistress acted just like Hops did, like she did nothing wrong and deserved all the sympathy. \n\nThis girl violated me and I say with complete seriousness that I would rather relive my rape than that Halloween night. I know I’m an asshole for what I did. I guess am I THE asshole? \n\nTLDR: girl violated me by robbing me in my sleep after I opened up and was vulnerable to her. To retaliate I drowned her makeup in piss and shit. \n\nAlso, how would this story fare in pro revenge? Worried they’ll hate on me there but I am still proud of my revenge despite feeling sympathy for the girl and remorse for how the situation went down. ",

      "description": "Tldr : broke up with a rebound that helped me through a rough time in my life with the reason “romantic feelings are gone”. \n\n\nThe relationship started out in March and to be honest it was kind of a rebound. My dad passed away November and my girlfriend (ldr) at that time broke up with me on New Year’s Eve. Pretty devastated and just moving into a new city I was really just lookin for someone to help me out. I guess I did kind of finesse her into the relationship but there definitely was romantic feelings.\nFew months have passed and it’s become a very “comfortable” (or boring) relationship and it’s just not what I had pictured. I’ve mentioned this about a month ago that my feelings were starting to fade and that I thought it was unfair of me to continue on. She convinced me that I was only having a phase (as you do). It never really changed back though, the romantic feeling were gone. \nLast night she asked me again how I felt about this whole relationship and I told her that it hasn’t gotten better but probably a bit worse (feeling wise). Then she asked me if I still wanted to be in a relationship and this is what I answered “you’re really important to me and I don’t want to hurt your feelings but if we were to stay together I would only be doing it for you” I know I should have just been straight up with her but I’m a sucker for tears and she really is important to me she did help me through a very rough time. She said I was her first true love and that kind of just made it all worse.\nI can’t help but feel guilty for hurting her as it probably seemed kind of out of the blue from her perspective. And im a real sucker for tears so it’d be nice to get a second opinion. \n\n\n\n \n",

      "description": "A few months ago, I was admitted to hospital after a suspected overdose, which I can't remember. I do know that on this night, I tried a new medication (a non-benzodiazepine) for sleep and, according to some message logs, I redosed with this medication for some reason. The first thing I remember after this was waking up in the mental health unit of the hospital. A lot of stupid stuff happened while I was at the hospital, involving privacy breaches and highly unprofessional behaviour on the part of the doctors, which lead me to apply for my records.\n\nNow, to be clear, though I have tried heroin in the past, I was never a daily user and never had withdrawals. Plus I had stopped by the time this happened. In the records, it said that I had been calling out for help which lead to someone coming to my room and calling the ambulance. No blood tests for the presence of any drugs was taken, and I the only thing that could indicate I was possibly overdosing was the fact that I was \"difficult to rouse\" which is very likely due to the fact that I had taken sleeping medication.\n\nI do not believe that it makes sense for me to be calling out for help outside of the context of some kind of psychotic episode that resulted from the new medication. This is simply contradictory to what a heroin overdose involves (you pass out without realising what happened about 30 seconds after you take it).\n\nOf course, whether I actually did overdose or not, the hospital told my boyfriend that I was there for that reason. He recently told me that he called his family because he didn't know what to do (this doesn't make much sense to me because what can they tell him that he doesn't already know?) and now his family thinks I'm a fuckup and a bad influence. I feel like I've lost any hance I had at making a good impression on his family.\n\nI had previously made it very clear to him that I did not want anyone to find out about my drug use, so he knowingly went against my wishes in telling them this. Obviously the stereotypes associated with addicts are horrible and harmful to me if people find out.\n\nI got upset with my boyfriend about this but he got defensive, because he believed he was justified in telling them about it.\n\nExtra note: I am not using heroin now, though they forced me onto suboxone after being in the hospital because they believed I would overdose \"again\" if they let me out eithout a treatment plan. I tapered off this and am not taking any opiates.",

      "description": "  \n\nMy parents got divorced when I was very young. When I was 14 my dad got remarried to a woman with a daughter we’ll call Jane. Shortly after Jane and I had a brief physical relationship (yes, my step-sister). According to her we stopped fooling around because she turned 18 and I was still 15. Eventually I stopped speaking to my dad over his alcoholism and she moved back with her dad.  \n \n\nA few years ago, Jane got divorced from her first husband and moved back to where home. I live on the other side of the country now and had been married several years at this time. After a visit to see my parents where I saw Jane, we began talking through facebook more frequently. This led to us talking about long-held feelings and the possibility of me leaving wife and moving back home. I was still married and she had a serious boyfriend but I was miserable in my marriage for quite some time. After a few months, I had decided to leave my wife, but Jane decided to stay with her fiancé, Joe. I still left my wife a month later. Shortly after, Jane’s fiancé found the messages between us. They broke up, then reconciled, and he sent me a message to stay away from her or he would “hunt me down”. Our parents know about the breakup, they don’t know about the cause. A few months later, Jane and Joe broke up again, and Jane sent me a snapshot of a facebook message between Joe and my ex-wife offering to send her the messages between me and Jane to help her against me in my divorce. Jane went on to marry Joe.  \n \n\nI’m now remarried and have a new baby. Talking to my father over Christmas, he mentioned that he and my step-mom are having Joe, who has a law license, but doesn’t work as a lawyer regularly, write their will. Because of the past, I am concerned about this. I have tried getting my dad to use someone else without telling him why, and tried asking if I could see the finished product since I am listed as an executer on the will, but neither approach has worked. I now feel like I have to tell my dad and step-mom everything that happened between Jane and me in order to ensure that Jane’s husband cannot let his bias against me influence the will. However, I worry doing so would strain my father’s marriage, my step-mother’s relationship with Jane, and affect both parent’s relationship with Jane’s elementary-aged daughters. However, the amount of money I would get after their death would be enough to help significantly with my own child’s college tuition.  \n \n\nWIBTA here if I told my dad and step-mom about previous relationships with my step-sister in order to prevent her husband from writing their will, knowing full well that doing so may have serious implications for a number of relationships?  \n \n\nTLDR – I want to tell my dad and step-mom about past inappropriate relationships with my step-sister because they want to use her husband to write their will, and I’m afraid he has a bias against me.

I absolutely adore dogs, and don't want them to have to give up their dog. What I do want them to do is clean up their dog's mess.\n\nIt's been bitterly cold this past winter and I've seen my neighbors just leave their dog's droppings on the top of the snow.

Add to that the backlog of ..err logs, and you can see a slushy shitty situation. The droppings are getting soggy and making a gigantic disgusting mess.\n\nI've tried catching them in person, but I almost never see them. When I do, they're usually in the middle of a heated argument and I really don't want to mess with that. I recently fired off an email to the company that manages my apartment complex.

They just crashed into a kid (I think middle school aged) and he was sitting on the ground just starring at the ground under the car. The woman driving came running out and a guy jumps out of his truck to go run over there as well. \n\nAs I was about to get out I hear sirens and a police car comes up right before I jump out to run over with my first aid kit. \n\nAfter seeing the cop get out of her car I decide I’m not needed so I turn around and take a different route home. This route passed by the accident and by the time I passed by there where two cop cars, an ambulance, and a fire truck speeding on the other side of the road to come to the accident. \n\nI’m not sure if Im the asshole for not getting out and seeing if he needs my help. Please let me know what you think. \n\n\n\n ",

      "description": "Basically it's my nineteenth birthday next month and for the last few months I've been telling my mum that all I want for my birthday is a microscope. It's mostly to help me with college (currently doing biology) and just cause I think they're cool. So about half an hour ago I sent her a link to a decent one from amazon which is on sale for £75 which is relatively cheap as microscopes go. \n    Well she didn't see it that way and said how im eighteen not five and I shouldn't be asking her to spend that much on me. I do accept that it is a lot of money but it's something I really want and will use and I have been telling her for months that it is the only thing I want. \n     Here's the thing, in previous years she has spent over a hundred on my brothers birthday on designer shoes and clothes that don't end up fitting him in six months time so it's not like she doesn't spend that much money on birthdays. \n   So that paired with other recent events I feel like it's more of a personal thing than a money thing. But I don't know, I'm just so confused right now, am I just being a spoilt brat? ",

      "description": "This is kinda long but I think context matters. TL;DR at bottom. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy friend has always been overweight. I have been in fairly decent shape throughout our friendship, but have gained about 15 pounds in the past couple years. It kind of crept up on me and I didn’t realize it until a few months ago, when I weighed myself with the scale in her bathroom on a whim (I don’t own one). I was shocked at the number and told her about it. I immediately took steps to eat healthier, joined a gym, and started walking on my lunch- and 15-minute breaks at work (I have a sedentary office job). \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nI’ve mentioned these lifestyle changes here and there (for example: she called me while I was driving and I answered on speakerphone; she asked where I was going and I said the gym. Or we had a conversation about developing healthy hobbies and I told her exercise is becoming a habit for me, but not a hobby yet). My friend confided in me she was feeling bad about herself because of how much weight she’s gained, so I offered to bring her to the gym with me. She declined (for legitimate reasons: she has a foot condition that makes even walking painful, and my gym doesn’t have a pool). I’ve been cooking a lot and have invited her over to share some healthy meals with me. (I didn’t put it that way, I just invited her over for a meal or offered her food when we were hanging out, and I don’t make unhealthy food anymore.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI still don’t own a scale and there isn’t one at my gym. I think it’s better to focus on being healthy and not obsess about the numbers, so I have decided not to buy one. I’ve been over her house several times since this lifestyle change and chose not to weigh myself. But last night I gave into temptation and weighed myself on her scale. I was excited to see I’ve lost four pounds! I shared the good news with her and she seemed happy for me. After a fair amount of drinking, she got really upset at our other friend for paying more attention to “the cute skinny girl” than her and had a bit of a meltdown. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nI talked it out with her and she told me it’s upsetting to hear me talk about weight gain when I’m so much smaller than her. I listened to her, told her I understood that I wasn’t being respectful of her body image hangups, and apologized. But this morning I found myself wondering: Am I really the asshole? She didn’t tell me my comments were upsetting her until she started yelling and crying.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR: I told my overweight friend I lost four pounds. She got really upset and told me I was being insensitive. ",

My brother texted me and said “please let me know in the future if you are having money issues, please don’t ask mom again”.  My mom is secure financially and I am going to pay her back.

Just for a little more background, we are all in our mud twenties.\n\nI have a good friend, call her Sam, who I meet about 5 years ago. We have been great friends since we met, but she has had a BF for years and years so we never thought about eachother in that way.\n\nRecently it has seemed that the relationship between Sam and her BF is coming to an end, and Abby believes Sam has been showing interest in me. Sam and Abby get along fine, but recently Abby does not like to be around Sam since she thinks Sam is trying to make a move on me. Abby has also asked me not to hang out with Sam anymore due to this.\n\nI would never cheat on Abby (nor do I even want to) in the first place. I don't even think about Sam in that way at all. She is a good friend who I enjoy spending time with, but that's the extent of the relationship. I don't personally believe Sam has a thing for me but I'm also an emotional idiot and couldn't take a hint if it was written on a brick thrown at my head. If Sam actually does want to get with me and made a move, I would tell her no, that I value her friendship but if she tried to take it any further than that I would have to terminate the friendship. But this has not happened.\n\nI told this to Abby and told her while I understand where her feelings are coming from, I don't think it is fair that she ask me to not hang out with a good friend of 5 years based on what, at this point, is just a hunch. I've promised her that if she proves right, and Sam tries anything with me, then the situation changes and i will absolutely comply with her wishes. She isn't happy about my  choice, but ultimately does not like telling people what to do.\n\nAm i an asshole for continuing to hang out with Sam, knowing Abby doesn't trust her?",

      "description": "Okay this might be a long one so I'll leave a tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nBACKSTORY: A couple of years ago my parents divorced - I didn't really care (yada yada yada we get the point). The KEY thing from this is that my dad was a lazy asshole and for 20-odd years my mum got used to having to do loads of stuff herself - gardening, mowing the lawn, basically single-handedly raising myself and my brothers. Whilst bringing in some heavy-ass wood in from the garden to heat our house (it's a long story), one massive lump fell on her head - she wasn't unconscious or anything but was knocked down and taken to A&amp;E (By my brother because my dad refused to drive her) to check her over. This left her with a weakness in the back and neck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast-Forward two years, my mum has a new boyf (who I get on with just fine) and I've been doing some renovating/landscaping in the garden when I'm not full-time at school. We get a new washing machine which I EXPLICITLY SAY TO MY MOTHER \"Give me a shout when you want me to bring it in, I'll just be watching TV in the lounge\" (Which is right next to the kitchen). Fast-forward 20 minutes, I hear metal creaking, bit of shuffling about, the washing-machine is definitely getting moved. I think to myself that I'll let her sweat over it, because she's got to learn that I'm actually around to help her now that I'm more of an adult (I would have been 16 at the time - whilst they were divorcing I was a fairly young 14). TURNS OUT that she royally screws her ankles and it'll be like 6 months until she regains full movement. Queue me feeling bad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward 4 months - I've been doing some digging in the garden for a patio, and have left a massive pile of dirt around, which I say I'll clear out at the weekends in chunks as It puts loads of strain on my back (I'm a slim 6'7\"). It's a Thursday night and I hear shovelling - She's moving the dirt herself which I'd ASKED her not to do, due to her bad neck, back, and ankles. I pull the same move, HOPING she'll learn the lesson.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe screwed her ankles more and her shoulder as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm now approaching 18 and don't want to feel like a parent all the time. My mum's mentally kinda reverted back to her early 30s since the divorce (she's 50 now) and no matter how often I ask her she doesn't look after herself. I don't want her falling apart at the seams because she's naive and thinking she can do everything herself (Her Boyf is a handyman and has as little sympathy as I do - she's got capable people in her life who will GLADLY do anything for her but still does stuff herself which gets her hurt)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not helping her on these occasions, and do I approach her and tell her how I feel as I'll be leaving for uni in September? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Naive mother keeps injuring herself whilst doing chores I'd told her I'd do for her when I could (I'm busy with school). AITA for letting her do the work on her own to teach her a lesson or should I have intervened?",

It hits 30 and I message them asking where they are at to which they respond they are already inside eating, I told them that I didn't appreciate itand I was just gonna leave, they obviously wanted me to come and eat but I decided against it and left anyway. So I went home and got some taco bell. \n\nNow they did apologize and I don't hate them and am still gonna be friends with them,  the reason I left was mostly because I felt like I wasn't necessarily expected nor wanted so I just bailed.",

      "description": "I've been spitballing the idea of going to a gym for a few months now and after a recent checkup I decided to finally go for it to try and lose some weight. The gym I had in mind has a pool, included classes, is close to me, and a few of my friends go there already. The downside is a $100 fee upfront and $25/month membership. \n\nI put out a feeler to see if my gf (just over a year dating) would like to go by first asking what she pays now for her gym, that she has stopped going to for the most part due to a creepy trainer and lack of time. I figured if the prices were comparable maybe she'd want to switch over since the times are roughly the same. She currently pays $15/month. This led to a minor fight about why I want to go to that gym and why I want to go to this other gym. I was content with not working out together (we worked out together just 1 time), but she pressed the issue and seemed to ignore my reasons for wanting to go to this other gym (pool, its closer to me, already have friends going), and then said she'd only go if I paid her initial fee cost. Her gym is also within walking distance from her apartment so I understand her desire to not switch to a gym that requires her to drive. ",

      "description": " \n\n*TL;DR at the end*\n\nSo I’m a 20 y/o student, and since last year I made like 4 friends and we always hang out with each other at uni. But this years things began to shift in my perception of two of my friends which I love dearly but I’m kinda fed up with their attitude. \n\n**\\\\for context\\\\**\n\nIt all began when I was taken with one of the other friend from the group (let’s call him Jay) to go abroad together for a semester which made us happy. However, I was really sad for my friends who were not chosen. I try to be as supportive as I can be, and I told them about other way to go study abroad etc. but they always made commentaries about me and J going there and being annoying about the whole thing, when I feel like we never were bragging about it and we were just excited to live together and have the other guys around for holidays if they wanted to come which they never actually seemed to take that as a real proposition. \n\n**\\\\the event leading to this post\\\\**\n\nI acknowledge my sense of humour might not me the finest of the finest not the lightest, but if I am going too far I will apologise since I don’t like conflict, even when I’m not in the wrong. Few days ago, 3 of us go to a free classroom to work and as we procrastinate I draw funny portraits of us on the blackboard, I draw all my present friends and Jay and I laugh a lot at our deformed facial features. But Tina and Harry do not laugh, so we just stop and go back to work. I did not though much about the caricatures, in the group we often do offensive jokes at each other on various things, I never took those too serious. Mind you, this morning Ouna (who was not there for the caricatures) came to me and said I should stop with the jokes about the physic (which I only do to Jay as he is the least sensitive about it). I was kinda shocked at first, like it’s caricatures, not criticism about all the thing they did wrong in their life. I just said “well okay now I know” and just avoided her for the rest of the day.\n\nIn the evening I send Ouna and Tina a message saying that I apologise for the jokes, and I never meant to upset them. That I do those out of fun, to take our body image less seriously and be less complexed. Which is true, it always was a way of body acceptance for me. Ouna responded saying “okay but we should talk about those matters in real life”. I’m just shocked, how far can she go about those caricatures… It was obviously just some childish drawings, I apologised and don’t know what she wants to say more.\n\nI want to know if I’m in the wrong here, to know what to say tomorrow when we will “talk in real life”. I don’t plan on apologising again as I feel like I did enough for such a unimportant thing. Should I avoid Ouna and Tina from now on as I’m getting tired of their attitude.\n\n*TL;DR : I did caricatures of my friends (who all say quite offensive jokes), one of them is offended, sends my other friend to confront me. I apologise on messenger but they say we should talk in real life.*",

I texted my mom and told her that I was going to be out, but not that late, and would be home around 10. I got home at 10:10. \n\nI had some drinks, but enough to feel comfortable to see my mother when I got home.\n\nOnce she opened the door she became immediately hostile. I went upstairs to pee, and went back downstairs to talk about how fun my night was seeing people I HAVEN'T SEEN IN TWO YEARS. \n\nShe immediately started with \"so obviously, you plan was to go get drunk the minute you made plans with [said friend who I went for coffee with]\"? I told her no, and that I found it unfair that she refused to talk to me. She claimed that I \"wreaked of booze, [and she] didn't want to talk to me\" when I had 4 beers and came home on curfew. (Pretty early curfew for legal drinking age!!!) \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to spend time with friends and drinking alcohol even though she is sober and I never promised to live a sober life? ",

      "description": "hey guys, I'll make this as short as possible. My parents are weird about me sending stuff via. mail sometimes, so i asked my very close friend if it was okay to send it to hers. we're with eachother most of the school day, and we're in the same grade. note that she is one month pregnant, and her parents (father &amp; step mom) are ok with this. me and her mom even talk sometimes (: we've done this a couple times before too. she also doesn't have a phone.\n\ntwo packages came over the weekend. cbd gummies and a bottle of similar stuff. not drugs. we talked about this on friday. today, she said her aunt stole them. I'm like, oh, what the fuck? i paid for that? and she's like yeah haha crazy.\n\nher step mom messages me about the packages and i reply saying they were stolen by her aunt. the step mom is confused and sends a photo saying her father took the gummies away because she was BRAGGING to her friends about having edibles. edibles... they're cbd! and they were open so i said it's okay to just throw them away. she said she found the bottle, too, but it was open. i told her i don't want her or the father to repay me (the friend has no job or permit/licence), but she said she'd meet with me to sometime anyways and i showed her the receipts of it all. \n\ni actually met with the friend and asked her while she stole my stuff, and she just calmly replied 'i didn't' &amp; 'I'm pregnant anyways, why would i do that stuff?'\n\nI'm talking to her again tomorrow and not sure of what all to say. aita for being upset even though it was sent to her house? it's all about $35 worth, though, so not very much - but i feel very betrayed.\n\ntl;dr: friend &amp; friend's parents said it's ok to send stuff, i do for the 3rd time and the friend steals the stuff and lies about it.\n\n",

To the best of my knowledge, nobody can accept AB+ blood except for other AB+ people.\nThing is, AB+ is the universal recipient, meaning anybody who’s AB+ and needs blood can have literally *any* blood.\nGiven the lack of specific requirement for AB+ blood, I’ve never felt like going out of my way to donate.\n\nDoes this make me an asshole?\nThanks guys!",

      "description": "The four of us all moved into an off-campus house about two weeks ago. (We are all graduate students.) For the most part, we get along okay, but there have been a few incidents. I think it’s a good idea for us to agree to some ground rules before anything gets truly out of hand. \n\nThe incident that prompted me to suggest putting a few rules in writing involved one of my roommates borrowing my truck without permission, then ignoring her phone for three hours, causing me to miss an appointment. I woke up, went to leave for my appointment, and my truck was just gone. (Public transport barely exists out here, and an Uber to where I was going would have been pricey.)\n\nThe rules I suggested are mostly just matters of common decency— nothing unusual or nit-picky. \n\nBasically, “ask before you use/eat something that isn’t yours,” “don’t go into other people’s bedrooms without permission,” “take your dirty dishes to the sink and wash them within about 24 hours or so,” “give us a heads up if you’re bringing people over” and “kick in $3/week for communal supplies.” \n\nThe “heads up if you’re bringing a guest” rule isn’t because I want to stop people from bringing guests. It’s because all four of us are ladies, and due to the layout of the house, everyone has to cross a common space to get from the showers to our bedrooms. Plus, since we are all women, it’s pretty normal for one of us to walk around in our skivvies or revealing PJs, etc. \n\nBy “communal supplies,” I’m talking about the kind of crap where it doesn’t make any sense for  each person to have their own, such as toilet paper, dish soap, mopping fluid, milk, etc. \n\nWhen I broached the idea to my roommates, one was on board. The other two got mad at me and basically said they’ll do whatever they want since they pay rent. One of them told me that I’m the one who gets upset when dirty dishes sit in the sink for more than a day I should wash them myself. The other told me I was being childish by trying to set up any rules. \n\nI told them I was willing to discuss the rules, that I wanted all of us to agree, and that we could include any rules they thought of within reason.\n\nI’m not trying to be the damn Soup Nazi, but it’s frustrating when I come home during my break and whatever I planned on having for lunch is just gone.\n\nAll I want is a few reasonable standards so I can have be comfortable where I live. \n\nAITA?

I get home about 4:30. My parents force me to go to bed around 10:30. So from the time I get home I have about 6 Hours of actual free time. \nNow, my parents really want to spend time with me and all, and I understand that with me being the only child left, but I only feel as if I'm losing out on alot of my own life. My parents expect me to watch TV with them, as its pretty much the only thing they ever do, and I do watch TV with them as much as I find TV boring, but they expect me to watch for as much as four hours. I feel like I'm losing out on my time. Two hours a day simply doesn't seem right to me. I like to play videogames, do art, and study philosophy. Normal teenage stuff, maybe minus the philosophy haha. If I don't spend enough time with my parents they tend to make that know. My dad is excellent at guilt tripping, and my mom is better than my dad. I don't think I'll ever do anything about it, but I just feel as if my years are slipping away doing things I simply just dont want to do. I'm sorry if I didnt do well enough explaining myself, I just want some other people's opinions",

      "description": "I'm going to try and include as much detail here as possible, though it's hard to depict the whole picture, so I apologise if I omit some details. If you would like more information, just let me know and I can provide more. I should also say that as a person, I like peace and quiet, and that find I loud noises to be overwhelming. \n\nI'm in my second year of university accommodation and I'm sharing a flat with four other people, all of whom moved in about 10 weeks ago. Two of them very much keep to themselves, while the other two, who I will refer to as Flatmate #1 and Flatmate #2, I find to be loud, with their resting state of voice being as loud as if they were in a bar. It got on my nerves for the first 6 weeks but I tried my best to ignore it.\n\nAt first things  were good. I hung out with the two loud ones quite a bit, and we had fun together. Flatmate #1, unfortunately, ended up developing a thing for me, which wasn't reciprocated, and made me uncomfortable, and was eventually something I thought I needed to nip in the bud. The two of us went to a salsa society taster session together, which she didn't like, but I was very much into. The impression I got was clear that she would not be okay with me going, so I tried to, indirectly and as nicely as possible, tell her that I wasn't interested in her, and that I just wanted to be friends. She understood, saying that she herself had dealt with an incident where a guy had been interested in her and the feelings had not been mutual, and how uncomfortable that had made her feel. Later on, however, she started talking about arranged marriages and her belief in them over marriages for love. I should mention that she is from India, which is why she has her opinion on arranged marriages, and that this conversation did not change her from expressing feelings of infatuation for me through music and singing for a couple more weeks. \n\nOur relationship ended up deteriorating the more often I ended up going to salsa. I noticed that both her and the other flatmate were increasingly insulting to me, as well as rude, with them both no longer inviting me to hang out with them. On one occasion Flatmate #1 and I ended up having an argument about something frivolous, and later on in the same day Flatmate #1 came to my room, saying, rather confrontationally, that she didn't like me keeping my shampoo in the shower as she had to move it out of the way, asking me to instead take it back into my room when I was done using it. We later agreed that instead I could just move it out of the way so it wasn't troubling her. \n\nOne night, on which I tried to go to a salsa social, I ended showing up, but no one else came, which upset me. I shared this with the other two flatmates as I was still on speaking terms with them at this point, and I feel as if they were more willing to talk to me because of this. Later on it turned out that I had just gone much earlier than everyone else. The improved disposition of my flatmates towards me changed when it turned out I was still willing to go to salsa events, as they thought that I no longer would because of the experience, with Flatmate #1 becoming argumentative after I said I would still be going.  \n\nAfter a while longer of them both making fun of me, I eventually sent a message to flatmate #2, asking her to stop calling me strange as I found it to be rude. She apologised, but tried to place the blame on me for not having told her at the time. After this, I felt as if I had had enough. I stopped trying to reach out and talk to them, instead spending far more time in my room and ignoring them both. During this time I noticed that Flatmate #1 was still being friendly towards me in texts, for instance sending me a message asking me what the matter was, as we had been having so much fun before, to which I responded by saying that I was upset and I didn't want to talk about it. She then wished me well, hoping that I get better soon. However, in person, her disposition was completely different, as I found her to be either frosty or rude.\n\nAfter passing the common room area enough times to hear them both laughing together, knowing that they weren't inviting me to spend time along with them, I finally decided that I had had enough of how loud they both were. On two occasions I told them both that I thought that they were being loud and that I would prefer for them to be quiet. One was in the kitchen, the other in the corridor that lies between our rooms. Flatmate #1 did not appreciate this. Later on in the same day that I told them both to be quiet when they were talking in the corridor, Flatmate #1 and I were in the kitchen, doing our own thing in silence. As she was about to leave, she said:\n\n\"I don't know what's going on, but if you're going to get upset every time that the other flatmate and I are being loud, then I'm going to be upset whenever you are loud\".\n\nI responded by saying:\n\n\"Okay. Let me know\".\n\nAfterwards she left, and I continued preparing breakfast for the next morning, thinking about what she had said. As I do play the guitar, sing and listen to music/videos while in the kitchen as they're both there, I thought that what she had said had been fair enough. Then I considered how I didn't tell them to be quiet every single time that they were loud, but instead just when I found it to be unbearable. Thinking about this for whatever reason really irritated me, as it seemed to me that Flatmate #1, rather than being considerate towards me, was instead trying to make my life difficult. I ended up going Flatmate #2's room and knocking on the door, as I could hear them both talking. I asked if I could speak to Flatmate #1, to which I was obliged. I spoke with a raised voiced, saying that I was not trying to be spiteful when asking them to be quiet, and that instead, I just wanted there to be less noise, as it bothered me. As she was talking, saying that she was then going to be quiet if I asked her to be, I turned on my heel and walked out of the room, only to look back in as she was finishing, giving me a thumbs up as she finished.\n\nAround this time we all got an email concerning the showers, saying that they needed to be kept clear of any toiletries to be prepared for the next person to use it. Thinking back on how my flatmate had been rather confrontational concerning my own toiletries within the shower, I couldn't help but think that she had made a complaint, so I sent her a message asking her if she had complained about me. She evaded the question, saying that we had all received an email. I agreed, but said that it would just help me if she said yes or no to the question. She responded by saying that had I asked her face to face or at an earlier time (this was at 11 at night) she would have answered, and that she did not appreciate me making an accusation against her. I told her that I wasn't accusing her of anything, I was asking her whether or not she had done it, and that was the end of the message exchange.  \n\nThe next day, the two of us were in the kitchen, with Flatmate #1 playing a video on her phone. We hadn't shared a word with one another while together, until I asked her if she could turn the volume down on her phone, as I was finding it to be a bit loud. In response she lowered the volume by a single pip. I asked her if she could make it quieter. She then snapped at me, telling me that I should put up with it, that I am not the only one who lives here and that I was harassing her, telling me that I needed to learn to compromise. I responded by saying that I was willing to compromise: that if she found me to be too loud, she could tell me to be quiet, which I would agree to, and that in return, I would expect the same from her. She agreed to this. As I was quite shocked and annoyed that she had accused me of harassing her, I said:\n\n\"So I'm not harassing you. I'm not harassing you at all\".\n\nShe then stormed out of the room. The next day she apologised to me, though I felt it was insincere. A couple of days later I talked to her in private, because I wanted to address the seriousness of what she had said to me. I got another insincere apology, before being asked why I had cut myself of from her and Flatmate #2, to which I told her that they had both been rude to me and I had taken offence. She apologised. I was then told that I needed to be less rude in asking her to be quiet, as she did not like the direct way in which I spoke, instead preferring for me to be more indirect instead, and that I also needed to expect her to be loud at times. I apologised to her for being rude. This conversation, unfortunately, ended up achieving no sense of resolution between us at all. \n\nThings between the three of us remained frosty until it boiled to a point earlier this week. It's important to note that the email that we got concerning the shower drew attention to how it was a communal space, and that it needed to be cleared and prepared for the next person to use. That being said, there is only a single counter within the kitchen on which you can prepare and eat food. People within the flat also used it as a space on which to store their various belongings, such as spice, oils, dishes and food. Over time, the amount of items on the counter grew to the point where there wasn't any space whatsoever on it on which to cook or prepare food. When I found it in this state, I sent a message to the group chat we have, asking whether or not we could start clearing it of stuff, as I wanted to use it to make myself dinner. It should be noted that within the group chat, whenever I ask people to do things, such as clean up the hob after using it, or wiping off the toilet seat after use as well, no one ever responds. As usual, no one responded to me asking whether or not we could clear the counter. \n\n\nSo, feeling rather fed",

      "title": "AITA for expecting my partner to be there for me while I am terminating a pregnancy?",
      "description": "To make a long story short I am in my second year of college out of state. Due to a sexual assualt that happened to me at the start of the semester, that I had not told anyone about until recently, I had been acting very distant from my partner.\nFast forward and I ended up cheating on him, not physically but the texts I had sent still count. No they were not sexual in nature, but that still doesn’t justify what I did. The distance had taken a tole on me to the point that I had forgotten the whole reason my partner and I were distant was due to my actions and not his. Thankfully I am fortunate to be with someone who is giving me a second chance, and we had agreed to take time to ourselves for a bit to help with the healing process and to come back to the relationship in a healthy manner. It is important to note that once the cheating had been revealed I did explain that I had been assaulted by a close friend earlier in the semester, not to gain sympathy but to simply explain why my behavior has been so odd the past few months.\n\nFast foward to this past Thursday and I find out that I am pregnant. I had prior concerns that this was true since I have missed my cycle the past two months. He was present for the test and reacted in a supportive manner. I ended up taking temporary medical leave off of school to fly home and get  help for the assault and to terminate the pregnancy.\n\nBefore I left we had agreed that this week would be good for us to get time apart, but that he would also be there to support me with the pregnancy. So far I have only reached out to him to give him updates on the pregnancy, however he has chosen to ignore me. I know that he needs time and space to heal which I am trying to respect, but this is obviously a very serious ordeal that just happened to occur at a poor time with everything else occuring in our lives.\n\nObviously this is a very brief synopsis of everything that has been going on the past two weeks, but I guess what I am asking is that if I am the asshole for feeling hurt and upset that he hasn’t been there for me for this process?\n",

      "description": "Basically I’m an event planner. This means I work odd hours in addition to the 9-5 we all know and love. \n\nLast night I reminded my DH that he needed to pick up our son from school because I have an event today-an event that goes til midnight. It’s been on the calendar for a month, but he was still shocked and a bit upset that I’ll be gone so long. No biggie tho, he’s happy to have some one on one with his kid. \n\nWe go to bed late and he’s trying to get something started. It’s been a couple days, but I’m just not feeling it. Not in a bad way, I’m just really content with the day and for the life of me cannot think my way into sexy time right then. I told him we could have sex if he was determined, but that I wasn’t in the mood. I feel bad for turning him down, but I got really cuddly which he loves. \n\nThis morning it’s pitch black out and I can tell DH is trying to get some sexy time started again. He keeps moving me around to cuddle closer and tries to kiss my neck and such. He also keeps pulling the blanket off my butt and I’m freezing to death. I’m clearly trying to sleep and roll over to signal, not now, buddy. After almost 40 mins he’s like “okay, gotta go, last cuddle!” Right as my alarm goes off. So I yelled “I just want to sleep damn it!”  Right as he goes in for a last hug. He says “fine!” And gets up. I hit snooze. \n\nNot two minutes later our son (3years old) starts whining in my face about how daddy left and he wants his TV (he gets 30 mins before school so I can get dressed). I’m furious and call DH and tell him next time he refuses to let me sleep, at least take a minute to take care of the kid. DH said “I know you hate me so much, but I’m not even gone yet, I’ll fix his TV.” \n\nI don’t hate him. I’m just about to go into a 15 1/2 hour work day with only 4.5 hours of sleep and I don’t see why wanting to sleep til my alarm is a crime. I feel bad I turned him down twice in a row, but can’t a guy take a hint that I want to keep sleeping? ",

      "description": "For some background my gf (f 21) and I (m 22) met in college and have been together ever since for about two and a half years now and it’s been great and we’re both very happy with our relationship. A little while after we started dating  my gf found out about a friend I had at college who was a girl the same year as me (f 21). For convenience’ sake we will refer to the friend as Jane. I became good friends with Jane over a year before I met my gf and we met through a mutual friend who Jane was dating at the time. We would frequently have lunch in between classes and such and occasionally hang out outside of class. And as a disclaimer from my perspective it was honestly a genuine friendship and it doesn’t go any further than that nor did I ever intend for it to even before I met my gf.\n  \nSo my gf found out about Jane when she was using my phone for something and I got a text from Jane asking to get lunch later. Of course she asked about Jane (who is she/do I know her/why are you texting another gal) the typical stuff and I explained our friendship and how Jane is also in a relationship and how we met etc. Despite that she expressed how she didn’t like her and how she wasn’t really ok with me being friends with her. I’ll admit at the time I got a little defensive cause I didn’t think it was a big deal and I knew that it was really just a friendship and it wasn’t what she was thinking (talking to some gal behind her back). On a side note my gf has several male friends who I know personally and I’m 100% ok with it and she knows them from mutual friends and sports as she’s a student athlete. I would never cheat and I love my gf very much and she knows that and she’s feels the same towards me and we trust each other completely but of course she gets jealous. In an effort to try to show her how Jane is a nice person and that we are just friends I proposed all four of us get lunch together one day (me and my gf with Jane and her bf). At the time I thought it went well but after lunch she still told me she still doesn’t want me hanging out with Jane and that she doesn’t trust her. \n\nAfter that we just forgot about it and I didn’t cut ties with Jane cause I thought my gf was being ridiculous. After I graduated this past year (roughly two years after my gf found out about Jane) I hadn’t talked to Jane for months but my gf brought her up recently out of curiosity (do i still talk to her/am I still friends with her). I told her I haven’t talked to her but I didn’t exactly stop being friends with her. Til this day there hasn’t ever been even a shred of romanticism or anything to hint at something more than a friendship between me and Jane but my gf is still upset about it even tho we haven’t spoken in months since school. AITA for not breaking ties with Jane when my gf asked me to?",

      "description": "Ok the title sounds really bad, but hear me out.\n\nI have family in central America on my dad's side that he is very close to. We talk and contact them frequently, and recently they started a WhatsApp group chat to coordinate their activities. \nThis Tuesday my grandmother added me thinking it's my dad's account , and I was flooded with messages (for my dad, no one knows it's me) of greetings. \nNow I love them very deeply and was happy to hear from them, even if they didn't realize it's my number, However I was dead center in the middle of my finals week for a physics course that I have to pass with a B or higher and I was not able to respond quickly. My schedule (until TODAY) was school at 8 am, work, home at 6, 40 minute break, and study until 12 at night. In the heat of studying for my finals I completely forgot about the group chat or to tell my dad about the messages for him.\nWell I told him today and he was furious that I did not bring it up sooner and believes that now he will look bad for not responding. I apologized and explained that while I realized what I did was wrong, it slipped my mind because it was simply not a priority at the moment. He wasn't satisfied with that explanation and assured me that from now on he would take the same attitude with my personal \"priorities \" as I was clearly too selfish to consider telling him the few times I saw him this week, which I will agree, I did see him a few afternoons for like 30 minutes.\nI feel really bad because I do see that this meant a lot to him, but I also believe that my reason for forgetting is valid. And in truth I think his reaction is out of proportion. Am I in the wrong here? Should I apologize again? Or should I stand my ground? Because this will definitely come up again.\n\nI'm open to criticism, please help. ",

      "description": "First off sorry for any incorrect formatting, I’m on mobile and don’t wanna wait till I get home. About 3 weeks ago my relationship started becoming very rocky because my girlfriend, or ex girlfriend now, told me she wanted to move back to her home town because she missed her family. We’ve been together for 2 years now and she’s been around my 3 year old for the past 2 years. She decided she missed her family so much she wanted to end our relationship to be with her family. I’m not entirely upset about her wanting to be back with her family but it sucks because my son really took a liking to her. Unfortunately we ended up breaking off our relationship because of this. We still live together so we’ve been sleeping at friends houses or I’ve slept on the floor. We were being very civil with each other until last night. Instead of going home and being miserable I went out and had a bonfire at my friends house. It just happens that one of my friends, we will call her P for short, was there and I’ve known and been close to P since early high school. Me and P have been in a relationship and it never worked out like I wanted. But I had a really good time being with my friends and enjoying my night until I got home. Even though my and ex weren’t together she questioned where I was and kept yelling at me because I was home late. She then found out who I was hanging out with her she became extremely hostile. Telling me things like she was going to stay and now she isn’t and she doesn’t trust me anymore and all this other shit.  She ended up going through my phone and leaving the house and staying at a friends. My biggest issue with this is that I tried so hard to keep our relationship together while she just seemed to give up, ultimately causing our relationship to end. It really hurt my feelings because even though I didn’t think I did anything wrong I still feel guilty. I’m just upset that someone who broke up with me and abandoned me and my son is mad because I hung out with someone who makes her uncomfortable. ",

      "description": "A little background, I have two kids under 3 years old and my sister in law has 3 kids, oldest is 5. Family is very important to my wife, which it should be, however living in the same town as my SIL and 1 hr away from in laws we end up seeing them quite a lot.  \n  \nEvery sport my nephew starts/plays they invite us to go. My in laws always come in when they can and usually end up staying the night with us or them. It usually ends up making my wife and I bicker/fight because I never want to go and just want to spend the weekend with her and our kids. On a couple of occasions this has resulted in me staying at home alone or with my kids. Also, I should add that she doesn’t go every time and has stated she doesn’t necessarily want to go either but doesn’t because it’s family time. \n  \nAm I the asshole for not wanting to watch 10 five year olds chase a ball around and not accomplish anything for an hour of my weekend? If it was competitive I don’t think I’d have a problem with it. I know the simple answer is to just suck it up and go but it happens so much that I just don’t want to.",

      "description": "This happened a couple years ago, but I still think about it all the time.\n\nI(21m at the time) met this girl(29F at the time) at work. I was friends with everyone at work but she was an exception because I had a deep respect for her for some reason. We always worked together when we were shorthanded so we bonded in that way. She was also more experienced than I was so I looked up to her and followed her example.\n\nShe had a fiance who lived in Europe she would occasionally talk about. She wouldn't say much and I wouldn't pry, because I really hadn't been interested in her. I felt we had profound friendship, but I didn't let myself get bothered by her relationship and gave her the respect due to her. \n\nShe had to write a letter to immigration to help her fiance immigrate to the US, and I told her I would proof read and rewrite and type her letter for her because her English was not very good. I did that and she was overjoyed. The letter sent was reviewed and the immigration was okayed.\n\nOne day she opened up to me and told me about how she was depressed because for ten years she had been waiting on this guy in Europe to immigrate to the U.S. and now that he had the ok he didn't seem very interested. She told me that he was cold to her. \n\nI figured I would try a pickup technique I learned on Reddit just to try it on. I wasn't interested in her but I did it anyway as kind gesture to my friend who was depressed. And to my surprise it fucking worked.\n\nShe started calling me to talk on the phone every once in a while after we initially hung out AS FRIENDS, and I was happily in the friend zone. I never had friend like her so I really cherished this friendship. I had never been in a romantic relationship so I just saw this as being friends with someone.\n\nThen she invited me over her house for dinner. She was an amazing cook. After we ate she wanted us to watch TV in her bedroom and I was too naive to take her Netflix and chill hint(I was still a virgin, give me a break). So I just sat there, made NO moves and introduced her to the movie Juice. She fell asleep, so I ccovered up the food on the table and went home. On my ride home I realized I might kind of like her.\n\nShe invited me over again on thanksgiving(which is probably why ive been thinking about it), because she was coming home from a thanksgiving party and she wanted me to try an ethnic food from her home country. I lost my virginity that night.\n\nWe were a secret thing for about 8 months and she talked about her fiance barely ever. I didn't ask about that too much because I thought she loved me(she said it often) and I thought this guy was a thing of the past. But then one night she told me eventually her fiance would come and things between us would have to end. I grabbed my shit from her apartment and left. My heart was torn to absolute shreds. I knew the whole time but I just ignored the inevitable. \n\nWe both got new jobs by that point and we kept up talking on the phone for a couple months until I told her to stop calling me.\n\nA couple of years later and I'm back at my old job. I hear from a mutual friend that she is getting married soon to her fiance. The waves pain, embarrassment and guilt come crashing down on me.\n\nFEELSBADMAN but am I the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "Backstory: we were never a functional perfect family. as a kid my mom would abuse me emotionally and physically, and my step dad wouldn't really do much about it. stuff started to change for the better 2 years ago, she hasen't laid a hand on me at all, and 1.5 years ago she went abroad to study something and took my brother and sister with her (she and my step dad didn't break up). as time went on, my brother and sister came back to my country since she is suppose to come back aswell, but they came early. time went on and the relationship between me and my dad got worse then before, we started fighting all the time, mostly because of my little brother. my littler brother has no discpline and it effects me sometimes (acting like a brat when I take him and my sister to the movies, when I need to be in charge of them he never listens to what I say and does what ever he wants \\[example, i tell him not to scream when were in the park, and he ignores me\\] ). it ended up with 2 major fights, one was because my brother called me an idiot for telling him that if he wants to watch something on my phone he should come over to me (he didn't want to get up from the couch and wanted me to come over to him), i got angry because no one was telling him its not okay and said that hes being lazy, to which my dad got angry and started yelling at me (which ended up getting worse). the second major fight was when I got hom from work, my brother was on the playstation and I didn't say hi to him when i got back home. my dad got angry at me even though I kept trying to explain it wasn't on purpose, we ended up in a fight which continued to him screaming that he wants no contact with me, he doesn't want me to say that i love him, doesn't want me to hug him, and nothing else. to which i started breaking down crying, he said he doesn't want me terrorizing the house and i told him i'm not leaving, to which he screamd at me to get my stuff and get out of the house in the next hour, or he will physically take me out of the house. after he kicked me out, i ended up sleeping at my moms friend house, bought a plane ticket, and am currently staying with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom doesn't want to get inbetween us. she says its between me and him and she doesn't want to deal with that at the moment because she is busy with what shes studying. She says that there is his point of view, and he told her \"he just said that out of anger, and didn't actually mean it, and he left the door open and didn't know i wont come bacl\". i told her thats bullshit because he told me he will physically take me out if i don't get out, and didn't tell me to come back later. I could've slept on the street and he wouldn't know. she keeps insisiting he didn't actually kick me out because \"he didn't mean it\". Shes angry at me for wanting her to get inbetween and take care of this situation. Am i the asshole? is \"i didn't mean to, i was just angry\" an actuall valid excuse?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- step dad kicks me out of the house, tells my mom whos abroad \"that he didn't mean to, he was just angry\" even though he never told me to come back home. Mom believes him and doesn't want to deal with anything.",

Well, I confessed my feelings and he told me right then and there that not only did he not feel the same way, but that he also had a girlfriend of over a year. I started crying and sobbing and he was comforting me, but then I remembered the photographs and told him that I would have to show/tell his girlfriend about it and then he began begging me to keep it a secret, but I told him I couldn't, but then he started offering me money and all of these things because his girlfriend would be really upset.\n\nWell, I thought then that if he is using me then I should also use him back. I didn't accept the money because I wasn't sure if it was illegal + I didn't really want it anyways. I told him that instead I wanted him to take me out to dinner because I thought it might get him to see me in a different way. After the dinner though (which I thought went really well), I asked him if he still wanted to be with his girlfriend and he said \"Yes\", so I told him then that I would send her the photos + other evidence anyways.\n\nMy friends all say I'm a jerk, but I honestly don't feel that bad about doing it because he used me first.

      "description": "This could either go here, or r/TIFU -- I think here fits just *slightly* better...\n\n\nSo me and a friend decided we would really like a FWB situation. The only problem was I would be her first. She was 23, I was 24.\n\nSo to get right to the point, she was at my place, we were making out and I put my hand on her thigh and she immediately blurted out **\"No!\"** -- Killed it immediately for me. 100% the night was over in my mind. The F in FWB was genuine. She was awesome, and I liked her as a person, and we were part of a big social clique that all interacted constantly. The last thing I wanted was to ruin a friendship, and basically be a total dick to literally everyone I know.\n\nSo I pulled back and slowed down. I didn't recoil and freak out, I just 'took a step back', i would say. The problem is she was still into it but the conflicting experience made me straight up nope out. She started up again and was a bit more handsy. The problem is, when someone blurts out \"no\" as a gut reaction to a touch.. not *quite* a yell, but more than just saying it.. That conflict doesn't jive for me. So she was getting more in the mood, but I refused to go there. We kept kissing and cuddling but no clothes came off. **I never told her she had reacted that way. If I could do it over again, I would have, but I didn't want to make it a big thing.**\n\nShe left disappointed, and I think she didn't even realize what had happened. I tried to very respectfully back off, because it's kind of a big deal to me, and I didn't want her to regret her decision. This ended up ruining our friendship anyways. And by not bringing it up -- I think that is why it's TIFU material. That WAS a mistake. Maybe if we talked about it we could have stayed friends. Instead my reaction was to get cold feet, because I didn't want her to feel she had made a mistake later.\n\nSo to sum it up... \n\n**AITA for not having sex with a FWB that was giving me conflicting signals, and blurted out \"NO!\" when I touched her leg?**\n",

The debate fizzled out and I thought it was getting left at that. \n\nThe next day, he boyfriend started verbally attacking me in the group chat in which the debate occurred saying I'm horrible at all the things I enjoy: maths (yes I'm a nerd), science, teaching (I want to be a teacher when I'm older, I'm currently 17 so I just tutor some people in, you guessed it, maths) and so on. \n\nEventually I grew weary of defending myself and as I already had screenshots of everything from keeping my boyfriend informed as to what was happening, I left the group chat and was going to leave it at that. However, the boyfriend did not take that well and then brought it into another group chat which I promptly screen shotted the new message before leaving that chat. \n\nThen, I sent it all to his twin sister with whom I am aquatinted via school  - we're in the same maths class and used to be in the same form for 5 years asking her to stop him from harassing me. Her and her mum then proceeded to yell at him and he sent me an apology before stopping. Ever since this happened around a month ago, best friend and I have not spoken except for necessities and the same goes between him and I; he also used to be a very close friend. Best friend told me this is because I betrayed her and was a bitch. ",

      "description": "I have a few groups of friends that I juggle hanging out with. One of them I tend to see much more frequently than the others since they live close, the rest I only really see during breaks in college and work. I would definitely consider the ones that live close my best friends, that being said I've never spent new years with them. Every year when new years rolls around I choose to hang out with a friend I usually don't get to see often since new years lines up well with breaks from their school and my work. this has been the trend since I graduated some 4 years ago. \n\nThis year someone from my core friend group messaged me to check if I was coming this year and was mad when I told her I wouldn't be attending. After I explained what I said above to her, she seemed to get more mad that I never choose to spend the holidays with them. She was particularly upset that I tried to say she isn't considering my other friendships I'm trying to maintain.\n\nFor her side I haven't spent any of the major holidays with them in the last 4 years, citing this reason each time. While sometimes I will spend Halloween or minor off day holidays with them, The big ones, Christmas and new years are generally reserved for family and other friends. She says that I'm throwing away important parts of our friendship by skipping out on these dates with them (she and her SO have been talking a lot about their plans for new years over the past few weeks while I remained largely quiet on the subject).\n\nI understand she has a right to be upset that I'm not spending new years with them but I don't think she can be mad at me for making that decision. so AITA for not spending new years with them?",

      "description": "I have been on and off with a guy, let’s call him B, for ~3 years now. in the last few months, things have gotten quite good between us, but he recently moved across the country. We both decided it would be fun for me to visit for the weekend.\n\nI get there on Thursday morning and right off the bat there’s tension. I try initiating sex and get brutally turned down, we move past it though, get brunch and I head off to work.\n\nFast forward to that evening. I had met up with a few friends to kill time and asked him to meet us for dinner, wanting him to meet my friends and spend time. He was excited about it, but as soon as we started making our way back to his place we got into a huge fight about nothing, and how i was really annoying him. Finally got back to his place, thought things cooled off as we were laughing and cuddling, so again tried to have sex and got told that no means no and he just wasn’t in the mood. Alright. went to bed. \n\nFriday morning we’re laying in bed talking about getting groceries to make breakfast, he keeps making jokes about his dick and how i accidentally touched it and so i was like ok...this has gotta be it. rejected. again. told i was aggressive and pushy and that i need to get people in the mood. this devolves into me being told that i should have just dropped it and laughed it off and instead i should leave and possibly stay at my friends for the night. I left for the day to give him space / i had to work, and then he called a few hours later wanting to meet for dinner. great! we’re near by and went for a couples dinner and had a fun time. after leaving, we all agreed to get another drink and go home, but suddenly he gets a phone call and they talk about going out, so as soon as we get to the bar, he says he wants to go home. no invite for me, just that he is going home.\nI was hurt and texted him as such that i wanted to spend time, and he said that he thought me coming over was implied. \n\nFinally saturday, i reach out early in the morning to spend the day, he can’t spend any of the afternoon/ morning with me but we can do dinner. I’m super excited, yes, let’s do a 1:1 dinner tonight. Around 5 he confirms the time, and then an hour later says he needs to get sushi with his friends, and that I’m welcome to meet him for a drink after if i’m up to it. He then calls at 11:30pm saying he’s tired. meanwhile all of my clothes are still at his house- i’ve been wearing the same outfit for 2 days-\n\nthe last day rolls around- sunday. I call because i’m leaving that day, and need my things. I come to his apartment and ask to talk for 5 minutes to end things on a better note, and he acts like he’s doing me a favor by talking to me, saying i’m incredibly confrontational, and if i had just walked in here with a good attitude, we could have gone for coffee and had a fun afternoon. \n\nI’m probably forgetting things, but i just need to know, AITA?

      "description": "this is my second AITA post of the night, i guess a lot of things have been happening recently and im truly curious if im just an asshole.\n\ni will start at the beginning. \n\n4 years ago i was a sophomore in highschool, as was my bestfriend, lets call her C for cheater.  C and i were super close, as neither of us had many friends throughout hs. she began dating another mutual friend of our little lunch group, lets call him G for good guy. \n\nC and G have what seems to be the perfect relationship, they date for the next 3 years, everyone agrees they are meant to be... until one evening when C asks me if she should take a certain job opportunity that was really well paying, i encouraged her and so did G. \n\nat this point C and G have been married (went to the courthouse, i believe for financial reasons mostly) for about 4 months. C takes the job, weeks later, G asks her to officially marry as in have a big wedding because they were ready, whips out a nice ring, and C and i are already planning a bachelorette party. keep in mind, G decided he wanted to be an amazing husband, and got her the dream condo that she has always wanted, as well as a puppy. lots of love, my SO and i could tell every time we went over there he was doing his best to make the condo into a home. \n\nfast forward a week, G messages me on SC and says in so many words that C cheated with someone from work... the job that i pushed her to take. \n\nnot only cheated, but was very nonchalant and pretty much disgusting about the whole thing: nobody would have ever expected this from her...\n\nfast forward again to current time, i hadnt talked to C in about 2 months, we didnt end on a bad note, though she must have known i didnt want to be within 100 feet of her. \n\nG is torn up, i call him almost nightly to make sure he is OK and see how he is doing, because i can tell he needs someone. \n\none night, G messages me saying he met up with C again, and wanted to work things out... now this is important because  my SO and i made sure to tell him that if he got back with her we would not stick around, simply because we now know the destruction she is capable of. \n\nG says she told him that if they got back together she would most definitely cheat on him: G is torn up once again. he goes on to tell me he is having suicidal thoughts, and will never find anyone, and she f-ed his credit so bad that he is struggling daily. \n\nat this point i am fuming. i message C and tell her horrible things, how she ruined him, how she is lucky that it is 2am or else i would drive to her house and... ya know... i also tell her not to contact G any longer because she is putting him through too much turmoil and basically ruining his mentality once again. i call G and tell him all of this, he is not mad, because her and i used to be bffs so he understands that this is now my business too, especially because he kinda dragged me into it. \n\nguess who calls him two seconds later? yep.. Satan herself... he said \"c is calling\" so i said \"i swear if you hang up on m-\" he hangs up. and by this point C has blocked me on everything. \n\nG texted me later saying that he told her to get away and not talk to him anymore unless it was about the divorce.\n\nAITA for messaging her nasty things... do you guys think i should have let him be and let her continue?\n\nside note, she was never honest about the cheating, G had to find out when she went missing for a night...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR ex bestfriend cheats on other bestfriend and i broke down and sent her nasty messages in hopes to help repair bestfriends life, which semi-worked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So my girlfriend and i have been dating for over a year 1/2 and we haven't had any major problems in our relationship. Until recently, we have been getting into small tiffs over minuscule issues that i don't see have any real impact over anything. I'm not going to lie on here but i tend to be the jealous type, but i don't let it affect my actions or anything i say to my girlfriend. But even since high school she has been friends with this guy that lived near her neighborhood, this all occurred way before i even met her. They still keep in touch even after having a history together while in high school, but i have met the guy a couple times, he plays basketball at our rival college. He doesn't seem like a bad person but he acts strange around her when i was there. I never say anything about it because it isn't my place to confront her about her friend, so i just bottle it up and seal it away. This morning my girlfriend is at work, and i hear a ring at our doorbell so i get out of bed to see that he had delivered her an edible arrangement, saying \"I'm sorry he didn't send you one last year, hope this makes up for it, love ya xxx Happy Valentines Day\". This really upset me so when she got home i confronted her and she was adamant defending him saying how they're just friends and how he doesn't have those feeling for me. This just isn't setting right in my head, can you all please help out! Thank you for reading. ",

      "description": "So some context, I’m 21, off at school most of the year and have been home for the last month for break. I leave tomorrow, this happened last night. \n\nLast night was one of my best friend’s 21st birthday, so we did what any good group of friends would do and got him shitfaced drunk until around 2am. then got him home and asleep with his roommate keeping an eye on him. I ended up going home with a girl that lives down my street since we were the last two out. We go to her place until 4 when I head home. Now my dad has cameras all over the house so I’m not even slightly under the impression I can get in without him knowing in the morning, but I do “sneak” in through the back door that’s connected to my room so as to not wake up the entire house. \n\nMy dad comes storming in this morning asking why on earth I thought it was okay to come in at 4 and if I was staying over somewhere else to tell them, and that they called me and texted me several times around 3. Then came the “Think about other people besides yourself.” Along with accusing me of sneaking around their backs, and only being sorry for being caught. My mom then starts in on if I wanted to start a life with this girl because staying out to 4am “doesn’t respect their wishes”, and that’s the only reason she could think of for me to be out that late with a girl.\n\nI never got a call, text, or anything from them, the last call I’d gotten was from one of the guys at 10 asking which bar we’d gone to. Also I don’t know what else I could’ve done? Not respect the rules of the girls house and sleep over, or Uber back to my friends house and crash with him while he pukes up his birthday? Like it was either that or come home and I think the correct choice is obvious. At 21 I’ve way grown out of the phase of sneaking around to not get caught by my parents, if I come home late, it happens, and up until now I’ve been home at or before when they’ve told me to be. How can I apologize for something that I genuinely don’t see an issue for. If I was in high school, yea, they’d be 100% in the right, but I’m 21, isn’t it about time to realize this kind of thing might happen sometimes in the very little time I’m home, and that the best thing is to be just a little more understanding? I’d get it a lot more if they just said, “Hey coming home at 4 wasn’t cool, don’t do it again.” And leave it at that, not this whole blown up issue.\n",

I have flea bite scars all over, cuz allergic. He &amp; guests took over living room. I and other housemate dont use it. \n\n1 day, living room fan broke. Asked to tell owner. Owner greenlights maintenance guy (Bob?). Owner is paying for the fix. \n\nWe don't use living room, thats his responsibility.

And it will be even extra shittier if bob comes and you're sleeping, or too high to deal with it.\n\nHim : If you feel like I'm not reliable, you can always just tell him that you don't want it fixed\n\n[RAGE STARTS HERE] \n\nMe : You haven't proven yourself the most appreciative towards help given to you.  \n\nAs you can see right now, instead of appreciating the owner for his concern and wanting to pay and fix something on an area of the house YOU and your guests usually dwell, you pull off this attitude instead of *fixing* anything\n\nAppreciation is more than just saying thank you. Apologizing is more than just \"sorry.\"\n\nLearn from it, stop being a child already its not fun for anybody.\n\nHim : Where in the text did it say I didn't appreciate him\n\nMe : Your attitude. You are being unappreciative. We gave you our time of day.\n\nHim : I was talking about you. You don't think I'm reliable\n\nMe :  Well because look at what the fuck youre doing now\n\nHim :  Great no time like the present to tell you. I'm moving out. Find another house mate.\n\nMe : Are you playing victim? You want me to feel sorry for you? I don't.\n\nHim : Oh no not at all. I'm not playing the victim here\n\nMe :  Sigh, things say otherwise\n\nHim : I'm here reading messages from you saying that I'm unreliable and unappreciative.\n\nMe : Do you think unreliable and unnapreciative people say \"i dont appreciate this\"? No, they just dont take help when given. They dont show initiative when everyone else helping them does.\n\nHim :  Where are you pulling the unappreciative from anyway\n\nMe : We helped you. The owner helped you.  Instead of \"ill try to be reliable this time\" Youre like, \"Well if im unreliable then no need haha\" Jesus christ. Disappointing. You are disappointing, and infuriating\n\nHim : Yeah alright. Your opinion on me doesn't matter. I legit dont care what you think about me.\n\nThen it just went on for a while until i said \"this isn't going anywhere\"\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I met someone about a year ago whom ive come to respect and care about as probably the only person i could call a friend, and while our friendship has been great, she knows I have a hard time with stuff like trust and caring about people. \n\nI know she has feelings for me, shes made that pretty apparent, and is currently in the process of leaving an abusive relationship which im very happy for her doing. The issue is I worry that if she does leave that relationship she wilk want to grow ours more, and while i think i do have some feelings for her, i always doubt the outcomes of everything and dont know if i should risk the one friendship i have for a possible relationship. \n\nI dont really know how to get it through to her that im just a friend aside from a straight up talk which i know would hurt her feelings, and i dont know myself if i really just want to be friends. \n\nWould i be the asshole for leaving things as is until i know or should i try to express that?",

      "description": "I live in a house with 3 other girls and 1 of them I do not get along with (for more background info on this roommate, I have a post on r/legaladvice that details her offenses). So to summarize what’s been going on for the passed 2 months, it’s been borderline illegal disputes and common courtesy thrown out the window. Basically she uses her friend’s death to excuse her from any responsibilities; she never cleans, never pays rent and bills on time , treats us all like shit, and constantly threatens suicide and almost brags about the amount of sleeping pills she takes a night in hopes she takes 1 pill too many and kicks the bucket. At first I tried to be there for her (especially after her friend’s suicide 2-3 months ago) and get her help but after she broke into my room just for the sake of spiting me, I have no genuine love for her anymore. I care about her wellbeing but I’m at my wits end with her. After she broke into my room I called her a cunt, a circus monkey following the loudest idiot leading her stupid parade, and that she needed to stay the fuck out of my room and to not touch/take my stuff or I would take her to court. Afterwards she accused me of not understanding her, that I lacked human emotions and understanding because I’m autistic, so I told her (was ex) boyfriend of 5 years shot himself not even a year ago and my best friend killed himself last year and I haven’t and still don’t pull the woe is me card. She called me an asshole and I sarcastically told her I am what I eat and that would make her NyQuil. She ran upstairs crying and screaming that I was an asshole. AITA?\nSorry for grammar, english is my second language.",

      "description": "Hi all, I'm on mobile so I hope this is an easy read. \n\nMy grandmother died 3 years ago from ALS. Since her death i became a huge hypochondriac. And my mom knows this. I love my mom to death but I think she has mental health issues, but i can't tell for sure. She can seem manipulative sometimes but I love her so much i just can't force myself to see her that way even though my husband has told me she is. \n\nA couple months ago she texts me asking me to ask my dad (they are divorced) for rent money. My dad doesn't have a lot of money but he does buy them food. She threatened him over the text that if he doesn't give her money she will send some of my uncles to talk some sense into him. Then at the end of the text she told me she is seeing the first signs of ALS because shes in so much pain. \n\nMy heart DROPPED. This is my biggest fear. But I also wrote back that it wasnt fair she did that to me and that ALS does not present itself with pain initially and I thought she was fucking with me. \n\nSince then I have been OBSESSED with the idea of having ALS my self. I have read all of the medical journals on it. EVERYTHING. Ive been twitching and i have a phantom like feeling on my leg that i keep doing strength tests on my self every day and talking to everyone about this. I became hooked on finding out if i have it or not. It ruined my life. I just got done with finals and my bachelors graduation is tomorrow. It will be with family and friends. But I have been so miserable with anxiety i haven't been able to be happy about anything. Even though i have a good life. The anxiety is unforgiving. \nShes coming to my graduation tomorrow and im secretly wishing i didn't invite her. I feel So guilty about having this feeling. But she broke my heart. \n\nI called her today and kept asking her if she really did have als. She said she has fibromyalgia. But i know that if she did have als she wouldn't tell me for sure because she wouldn't want to worry me. (But I'm pretty sure she used that to make me feel bad for my dad to give her rent money) \n\nAITA for having these feelings against my mom? :( ",

      "description": "It sounds strange but hear me out. My wife and I recently got a cat and everything was great for a while, until I realized that sometimes she talks to me the same way she talks to the cat. \n\nFor example, before we had the cat if I came home from work after a hard day and told her about it she would say \"Aw, you poor baby\" or something similar. Now, we have the cat and if the cat gets scared by the doorbell (or anything really) then she says that exact same thing to the cat IN THE EXACT SAME TONE as she would if she were talking to me.\n\nThis is just one example, but this has led to us getting in a lot of small fights because I've asked her to stop saying phrases like this to me (or at least change how she says them) if she's also going to say them to the cat. She claims she says them to both of us the same way because it's how she is and how she talks to things that she loves (which is really cute but doesn't stop my irritation).\n\nI get that they're common things to say but being talked to like our cat really doesn't sit right with me.

      "description": "I'm 23, my little brother is 17 and a senior in high school so he's been going through the applications process to go to college. I've tried to be supportive throughout because our parents are immigrants and really have no idea how this works. I handled all my applications and financial aid forms myself, asking guidance counselors when I didn't know how to do something. I expected my brother to be similar, and to come to me when he reached a point of \"I know I have to submit these things but I don't know where to find them or I don't know how to fill them out.\"\n\nThroughout the applications process my mom has been hounding him to apply until he finally submits his applications the night they're due. I've been offering to help with financial aid stuff when he gets to it. I know you have to fill out FAFSA and the College Board CSS profile as an incoming freshman, I'm unaware of what the specific colleges he's applying to want. So I ask him \"when do you want to fill out the FAFSA?\" for a couple months until we finally sit down and do it together. I ask him about the CSS profile and he says he doesn't need to do it, so I assume things have changed and don't bring it up again.\n\nThis came to a head recently, as he's been denied from his top choice school, wait listed from other schools we thought he'd get into, and only has a couple acceptances. Then he says that he's missing some financial aid forms, including the CSS profile and some forms that one of the accepting schools wants that were apparently due back in January. We fill out the forms and submit them. My mom is now incredibly worried about how much aid he's gonna get because these forms were submitted so late, and we're a very poor family (I graduated with less than $10k debt because I was fortunate enough to receive a lot of financial aid).\n\ntl;dr little brother was irresponsible while applying to colleges, submitting applications late and being completely unaware of forms to submit for financial aid, am I the asshole for not being proactive in making sure he submitted everything on time?",

We still keep in touch and have an emotional connection, but sometimes she makes me feel like she really doesn't care that much about me.  \n\nFor instance:  I have meditated for about 30 years.  All at once she is spending a kagillion dollars to go study meditation with a nationally recognized Buddhist guy, so she can teach meditation.  She has never meditated before, and has never asked me to teach her, even though I teach meditation.  If I offer an opinion on anything, it's dismissed pretty quickly.  I honestly don't think it's about me, but it gets tedious.  \n\nA few times in the last couple of years I have just come right and said I'm not sure why we are still friends since she doesn't seem to be interested in my opinions about ANYTHING!  \n\nNow, my husband and I are going to be travelling to an area not far from where she lives.  She is assuming that we'll come and visit, but we don't care for the city she lives in and really have no reason to go.  When we visit her we just sit around her house.  Her husband comes to visit us, and she travels all over the place, but has only been to my house once.  In other words, she lets me do all the work.  At least that's the way I feel about it now.  \n\nSo my question is, do I really need to go see her?  How can I get out of it without looking like an a-hole?",

      "description": "I just moved to a new state and am staying with my boyfriend’s mom until I can move in with one of his friends. I moved specifically because she said I could live with her. Right now she shares an apartment with a roommate who I will call Madison. I hate Madison because I know from my boyfriend’s friend that she is a huge racist.\n\nThe plan was that Madison would move out and I would move in once she was out. However, after I already got here, Madison let me know that she won’t move out until I pay her back for the security deposit she put down when she first signed the lease. I don’t want to pay her because she’s a huge racist and I don’t see it as my responsibility to pay her. I also do have money saved up but not enough to be able to afford rent after I pay this deposit. I’ve told Madison all of this but she says she also can’t afford to leave unless I pay her because she has to put down a deposit for a new apartment, and so she is refusing to leave. Boyfriend’s friend wants to stay out of it as she thinks it’s between Madison and I.",

I just had this question for y'all:\n\nAITA?\n\nWe (my group of friends and me) go to the cinema to watch movies, so we were planning to watch Avengers: Endgame which is going to be on our local cinema the 26th of April. The thing is that it's a Friday and i have to go to the university that day at the hour of the movie but it will be the next day on the cinema too so i said that we could go the Saturday all thogether because of myself being on the university and one started to convince the other to put me aside if the movie and watch themselves the movie. They all accepted and left me outside of the \"event\" of going to watch the movie.\nSo i started to say if we could go the saturday (again) and they answered that they wanted to see the movie the first day it's here, on our city.\nSince then i started to ignore the one who started the whole thing, whenever he asked me something i said a simple \"No.\"\nNow they say i overreacted only for a movie but i have been waiting since Avenger Infinity War and they really knew that.\n\nSo... AITA?\nSorry for any typos or bad sentences that they aren't coherent between each other. English isn't my native language.",

It was kinda like, “oh well, I guess we might as well.  When we made it official, the only thing that really changed was the title. I was fine with the way things were before and I’m fine with how things are currently, but I’m now faced with a dilemma. Recently an old flame (more like an old crush) came back into the picture. We started hanging out and talking more, and I realized that I still had romantic feelings for him. Around this time my bf also said that I was the “love of his life”. I love him, and I really like him romantically, but I already know that we do not feel the same way about each other. All of these events have made me reflect on my decision to make this relationship exclusive in the first place. I know it would bother me to see my bf with someone else, but I don’t feel like that’s a good reason to keep being in a relationship with him, especially if my heart is wandering. WIBTA if I broke up with him/went back to just dating him casually because I wanted to start dating other people casually again? I feel like breaking up would be somewhat extreme, but it also feels wrong to tether him to my side because of my worries. ",

      "description": "My (f36) fiancés (m35) mother and father came to visit this week. This is always a stressful time for him because his mother is very her way or the highway. \nAt dinner the evening they arrived, his mother told us a ridiculously long and elaborate story that ended with her pulling a muscle in her ass playing tennis. She was clearly in a lot of pain through the evening.\nThe next morning while I was at work, fiancé texted me that he had taken his mother to the ER because she has shingles- that was the real cause of the pain.\nI didn’t know a lot about shingles, but his family does because his brother has had it a couple times. His parents stayed like it was no issue (other than her constant wincing in pain) for the rest of their visit (only 2 days). \n\nI am extremely upset because his mother knowingly brought a virus into our home when it was at it’s most contagious state. It was also on a part of her body that made transmission more likely (toilet seat). She also blatantly lied to our faces about what she thought it was (his father told us after that she has had a rash where she “pulled a muscle” for several days prior). She didn’t know if I was pregnant, my experience with chicken pox, that I am a clean freak and borderline hypochondriac. Shingles is also not like a cold - the effects from the virus can be very painful and long lasting. I strongly feel they should have canceled their trip and planned for another time. They are both retired so there is no reason they couldn’t have.\n\nI spoke with my fiancé after they left. He was bothered as well and completely understands why I am upset.  He has always had a difficult time getting her to respect his wishes. On top of all that, his mother bitched a lot about her other daughter in law to me, telling me all the things she does behind her back with her grandkids, because her daughter in law would “have a fit is she knew.”\n\nAITA because I want to confront her about lying to us? Or because now I don’t feel comfortable leaving her alone with children we may have in the future?\n",

      "description": "I was on discord just a few hours ago, on a server with me and a bunch of friends. I was the only on online until some random guy got on. This is a private server btw so invites only. I knew it had to be someone that one of my friends knew, so I treated them as I friend, like I would with anyone. They urgently asked if my friend was ok (using their discord name not their real life name) because my friend hadn't been active on that guy's server for a long time. I was muted at the time on the server so I had to dm the guy. I told him that he was fine and he replied saying that he thought he was dead. I said we are taking care of him and that he's fine. Then right after that, the guy got removed from the server and my friend dm'd me. He asked if I invited that guy and I said no. It was true, neither me nor him knew who invited him. He asked what I said and I told him what I just told you. (I never said my friends real name at all during this entire thing) He then got really serious and mad saying that it was super important. I asked why and he didn't respond. Then he started talking about how he does not trust me anymore because I gave out \"personal\" information to random people on the internet. He then banned me from his server. (a little side note in that I also told the random guy that my friend had just come out, which is a joke that runs in our friend group, but that doesn't seem like a big deal cuz it's a joke and it's a lie so if it was some random person then it wouldn't really matter. But I didn't tell my friend that because he said he was super serious and I dont think it's a big problem.) Am I the asshole for talking to this random guy about general stuff?",

Thanks, first of all, thank you for taking the time to read this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in a Long Distance Relationship with this cute girl from the opposite hemisphere for 4 years and a half, we talked every day for hours at an end, I helped her through some really awful times in her life as well through some very suicidal months, likewise, she helped me through some awful times of mine.\n\nShe suffers from some mental illnesses and she was taking medication for that as well as some other things, I encouraged her on anti-depressants due to her family situation, where she was not abused, but one of her parents is terminally ill and she cares for them.\n\nRecently before the break up, I had been busy due to being close to graduation from the military academy, but I still did my best to be with her despite everything and we were happy, until she started to grow distant more and more, being depressed for seemingly no reason, and spending less time with me. I was devastated, but tried to understand her and still was there with her, I had bought an airplane ticket to go visit her, and so it was set, I logged onto my computer to tell her I had requested leave for a while, and had bought a ticket to go visit her.\n\nThat day, before I could even tell her, she  dumped me with a massive text wall that was unlike her writing at all,  claiming she was just not attracted to me anymore, trust me - you know somebody's writing style after 4 years of chatting with somebody over voice and text, and acted extremely could, although we stayed \"best friends\" since we both cared for each other\n\nI burned the ticket in a fit of emotion, which sucked in hindsight, I could have at least gone sightseeing or something.\n\nA little less than two weeks later, she told me she has got a new group of partners (We were monogamous, although she flirted with the idea of being poly once) and spoke to me about them, they seemed extremely manipulative at times and not very attached to her, she introduced me to them a few times through multiple opportunities, and they were quite harsh and respectful of me.\n\nHer entire family, she told me, is around \"15 or more\" people, she isn't even sure, but she claimed to be happy, from what little we speak, she seems to be growing erratic and I'm concerned she might have been encouraged by them to go off her meds or something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, AITA for all of this? I can't help but feel bad for being unable to let go of her or something, and maybe that I'm just paranoid over her new partners or something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I hang out with a group of 8 or so people and we get together every week or so to hang out and just chill or go out together. We also all go to school together so we all see each other everyday. It’s a friendly school for the most part too, and it’s a everyone is cool with everyone sort of deal.\n\nOne guy who we hang out with though is so toxic and aggravating. Everyone knows it too and feels like it would be better off without him, but we mainly only say it privately. He’s extremely difficult and stubborn and turns everything into an argument. He also tends to victimize himself and say a bunch of annoying shut about how he’s stupid or ugly or lazy over and over again. Also, we all joke around and insult each other but he acts like we always are only make fun of him.\n\nWe repeatedly tell him that we find the way he acts really annoying but he just brushes it of or makes it about how he’s annoying everyone to get pity ( which he never ever gets) \n\nAnyway we talked about preventing him from hanging out with us but it never really came to anything. We are sort of mean to him when we talk just because he’s so aggravating. Admittedly I’m probably the worst to him and I just go off on him sometimes. At one point I started being really harsh just so he would stop hanging out with us. It worked for a day when he said he wasn’t going to anymore but then he came back.\n\nI know that that makes me sound like the worst but in my defense he never changes his behavior ever. We tell him to stop doing something like being self insulting because it’s annoying as fuck and he never stops. We ask him to stop saying stuff thats really annoying and he never stops and when we ask him he just does it more or is self insulting again. Basically am I an asshole for intentionally being a jerk to him to try to get him to stop hanging out with us when everyone feels the same?",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've known my friend (from now on known as Mark) for a few years now, and he is in general a positive, fun, and supportive guy. But at times, he can be very irritable and moody for seemingly small reasons, and takes it out from me, which seriously drains my mood and triggers my anxiety. For example, if he has to wake up too early for our planned trip he gets irritable and sassy, often replying back to me in a passive-aggressive tone. Or if I miss a turn or something Mark will make comments like how I don't know how to drive (in a non-comedic, sarcastic, tone). I've brought this up in the past about how little tone shifts/comments like this can make me feel and how they trigger my anxiety, but nothing really has changed. To his defense, when things like this happen I don't always speak up about it, and rather I (childishly) return  the passive aggressive behavior so in effect his bad mood transfers to me. So lately I've been distancing myself from him and stopped hanging out with him as much as my other friends, which he called me out on.\n\nOn one hand I feel like I'm just being dramatic/overly-sensitive, that everybody has a bad mood every now and then, and that Mark overall is still a supportive and nice friend. On the other hand, I feel like my feelings are valid, and I have no obligation to be friends with someone for any reason: if i have a choice to pick between a positive, supporting friend, and a positive supporting friend that sometimes gets in passive aggressive bits, I am free to choose the former.\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "My MiL, Rose, and I don’t have the best relationship so I want an unbiased perspective on the situation. Hopefully, I can present it as such.\n\nRose has another granddaughter that is 9 years old. Everyone calls her “chi-chi”, her real name is Amber. When I asked how the nickname came about, I was told that Rose had a dream that she had a granddaughter named chi-chi when her daughter was pregnant. This is before they had her real name picked out.\n\nRose has dubbed my daughter “Chulie”. At first, I didn’t know if this was a Spanish (my MiL is Cuban) term of endearment or not but later found out it isn’t. I’ve asked her multiple times to stop using the name, especially while she’s still learning her actually name. \n\nHer defense is that “she responds to it more than she does to her actual name”. This is because she watches her while my wife and I are at work, roughly 8 hours a day. I told her that she’s still learning her name and she would respond to anything she was called by 8 hours a day.\n\nI thought Rose had stopped calling her by the name around July, around my daughters first birthday. However, when family came to visit at Christmas time, I heard it again and threatened to kick them out of my house.\n\nSome points to consider:\n\n-My mom is Vietnamese and calls her youngest grandchild a term of endearment, but not as a replacement for their name.\n\n-my siblings and I all go by nicknames, but ones we gave ourselves in childhood. Not one that was assigned while in the womb.\n\n-this nickname was also chosen prior to my wife and I deciding on a name (not sure if it came to her in a dream this time, though)\n\nI understand that this is something grandmas do, but I’m personally not a fan of the name and don’t want it to stick with our extended family.\n\nSorry for any spelling/grammar errors. I’m currently on mobile.",

Two days pass and she and her friends invite my friends to a restaurant where the subject pops again. She tells me she isn't sure he likes her back so I ask her why she thinks that. She says her crush wanted to talk privately with her and was very serious with her, something that isn't very normal. I again ask her if she's completely sure in being with him, which she tells me no. I tell her she shouldn't move forward then since a) she isn't even sure b) I thought her crush didn't like her. She agrees and everything moves on. Just yesterday however, she tells me her crush hasn't talked with her and that her crush's friend told her how he was interested in her but she didn't do anything.

I told him, he should ask out Kenzie now before Ryan can. He just said he couldn't do that, since Ryan's already flirting with her and he's way more popular and hot than my brother. That's kinda overdramatic, imo. Ryan is popular and good looking, but Nate's not a lonely bridge troll either. I told Nate it's his choice, but I see it this way: if he asked out Kenzie, there's some percentage chance she says yes. If he doesn't, that's a default zero.\n\nHe just got mad at me and said I don't get it cause I'm popular. Again, I feel like he's being dramatic: I'm not that popular.

It wasn’t anything big, it only cost about 20$ so I said thanks and ordered it and went about my life as usual. Fast forward to today and I handed my mom the present (unwrapped) and said Happy Mother’s Day. She was examining the present and asked where her card was. I said I never got one, she and her bf sort of scoffed. I just left the room after that. \n\nI got a text a couple minutes later from her bf. The first three words were “You’re an asshole.” Then he went on to say it was never about the present and more can be said in a sentence on a card and that it was my job to show love affection and support. He finished by saying a little thought might work.\n\nI felt like telling him to fuck off but I understand where he is coming from. I would understand a lot more if it was her birthday or it was Christmas (I would always get a card for an occasion like that) but I just didn’t think buying a Mother’s Day card would have such negative repercussions. I didn’t reply to the text and I haven’t spoke to either of them since. This was like an hour ago. \n\nIn future I’ll always buy a card to accompany a present but my question is: did I deserve the text from him calling me an asshole? I didn’t mean to be one. I didn’t think that because I got her a present but not a card I’d look like one. The text came across as super confrontational and it made me feel like shit. To be honest I was a little surprised I never got a thank you before I received that text calling me out. Now I know why. \n\nAm I The Asshole? ",

      "description": "Necessary background:\n\nI (17M) dated this girl (17F) for 11 months. She was my first love, and it hurt beyond words when she dumped me. I always wanted to be with her, never even thinking about getting sick of her.\n\nWe were friends on and off a few times, we ended up having sex twice, once during the summer and once in early November.\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving (in the middle of a time where we were on good terms and talking to each other) she says she misses us. We talked for a while, and she ended up saying she regretted dumping me, how amazing I was to her, how I was her high-school sweetheart, etc. (I didn't feel deceived by this, she would occasionally mention how well I treated her when we were talking about our past before). We keep talking and end up deciding to go on a date to see if we want to date again.\n\nA week later we go on a date, and in the middle of it, she said she does want to date. We both said we'd think about it and decide, I was under the impression that we'd both have a decision after the date, but I knew I wanted to date her before the date so I was happy when she said she wanted to date.\n\n2 days later, she comes over to my house, we were both tired from our Friday nights, so we basically just nap the entire time.\n\nThe next day, she calls me and says dating again was a mistake, I should stay away from her cuz all she does is hurt me, unless I want to be friends with her (this shows me she only told me to stay away from her because it would make her sound good. If she genuinely thought that she wouldn't even suggest being friends). I tell her I don't want to be around her and that that was a good idea.\n\nMy stance on this whole thing: I believe she is really good at being indecisive, and she let her constant need for male attention cloud her decision making, along with her loneliness (she ended up messaging a mutual friend who she said she'd never talk to again  because he did shitty stuff to her recently. She texted him reminiscing about the times that they dated, despite telling me she hated him, never wanted to talk to him again, and calling him an idiot even before they were on bad terms). I just think she isn't very smart when it comes to social matters. \n\nA week later I text her to clarify that Im not talking to her because of her stupid, careless decisions, not because she \"keeps hurting me\". We previously planned to have a final goodbye before we left for college, and I told her I didn't want that to happen.\n\nThis is for 2 reasons: this huge mess she made, and the fact that she sees me as clingy and compares me to \"a lost puppy dog\". she frequently mentioned this when we were talking about dating again, and how she didn't want me to latch on to her, even though we ended up both agreeing I didn't do that. I don't want to have a final goodbye because of her stupid decision and because she sees me as clingy.\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "About 6 month ago I had gotten into a relationship with a girl and it lasted for about 2 months. It was both our first relationship. We mutually broke up because exams were coming for college and we were both going to different ones. I believe that both of us we really sad about it but we both promised that this relationship was more ‘experimental’ than an actual long-lasting relationship and it should not affect our future relationships. \n\nThe summer before college a friend (for 4 years) from the same high school wanted to ask me out right after I had broken up with my previous relationship. He was gay and I believed that I was bisexual (but I guess I am actually asexual). My response was that I wasn’t really looking for a relationship but I would think about it,\n\n2 weeks later both my ex and him text me around midnight calling me and asshole for not giving him a proper response. My ex says that my poor communication skills is the reason we broke up (but I had called her for 2 hours each day, but not relevant here). We were all angry and I especially was surprised at my ex showing up to this conversation. I ended up blocking the guy but not my ex because I wanted to talk to her about it but she kept saying that we should just stop talking. \n\nAre my communication skills bad?\n\nLater today or this week I am going to have a serious conversation with the guy who asked me out to work things out.",

We were done at 9pm, the university was already closed, no students, almost no lights and our cars were the only ones in the parking lot, my friend Jessica, and me were going to my car, when other member of the group asked us if he could ride with us to the restaurant, we said yes.\n\n\nHe told us he had to do something in the lobby and to meet him there, we get into the car and drived close to the lobby and the gates, everyone else was in their way to the restaurant and we waited 10 minutes for him. I was starting to get anxious because it was really dark, this is a dangerous city and my friend and me are both youg girls in an empty parking lot. \n\n\nAfter those ten minutes he calls and tells my friend he was already on his way to the restaurant! He had asked other membets if he could ride with them, when we had already told him it was ok to ride with us, and were waiting for him by the lobby (as he instructed us).\n\nI'm usually a really laid back and shy person, but that made ne furious, I felt my time and security wasn't respected. When we arrived at the restautant I asked him to meet me outside. I scold him pretty harshly, callying him a \"pendejo\" wich can translate to \"dumb as fck\", and told him what he did was pretty iresponsible and disrespectful.  He was really surprise for the scolding and looked really ashamed, he seemed sorry, so i started to calm down.\n\n\nWe went inside as if everything was ok, but he clearly looked like a puppy someone just kicked on the street. I started to feel bad about it, was I an asshole? Did I overreacted?",

      "description": "Neighbor I've been on/off seeing had his son's birthday party. At said birthday party, his older sister who is beautiful and incredibly fit for her age was ridiculing her own weight incessantly and started telling one of neighbors life long friends how she could lose weight, continuously ridiculing herself even though she's got to be about 110 pounds and his life long friend is thick but carries it well. L.L.F. made eye contact with me multiple times like \"good lord\", and I kind of giggled and we both proceed to tell her she looks great for her age.\n\nMany hours later, I'm half drunk as shit, and start babbling about how I found that insulting, that they both look great, and she needed to leave it alone, I felt like she was being crude to L.L.F, but all of the friends turn icy as hell at me. I apologized, I don't know the sister enough to know her intentions, but I guess I'm so used to how my family talks to each other, which is fully through funny but cruel criticism.\n\nI walk inside to tell my neighbor what I did, that I unintentionally spoke shit about his sister, and apologized, while still not thinking myself terribly wrong. Gave all details of conversation. Apologized sincerely for out of turn words on his family,how it wasn't kind or my place because I didn't know her well enough.\n\nWent outside again.\n\nEvery word I spoke afterwords was blatantly ignored or ridiculed and finally I drunkenly stumble away.\n\nHaven't spoken to neighbor since.\n\nI have been nothing but helpful to my neighbor, we've been decent friends for months, have been confidants, and I help out with his children a lot.\n\nI've been kind of suspecting him trying to back off of me, he's just gotten out of a ten year relationship and has said he wanted nothing serious, but our drunken talks had been creeping that way. I suspect this is a good out for that.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So this happened about a month ago. BF and I have been dating for a year and a half, and there's always been (in my mind) an issue of his ex. He likes to be friends with his exes. That's fine. Ideally, I wouldn't want them in our lives and for the most part that's true. However, his most recent ex (BF broke up with her 3 yrs ago, dated for 5) lives in our small city and they chat on messenger and meet up in groups and sometimes alone to hang.\n\nNothing inherently wrong with that. Again, if they were just solid wholesome friends I wouldn't feel weird about it. I'm not the jealous type and am not envious of her because personally I don't think she has a handle on her shit. He doesn't want anything romantic to happen between them and I believe him.\n\nAnyways, there were a lot of red flags that made me uncomfortable about their 'friendship'. A quick timeline of things...\n\n\\- One drunk night she suggested they date again a couple months before BF and I met (I'm a believer that being drunk doesn't make you a liar it makes you just say what's on your mind).\n\n\\- She sent a long, drunk, text last Jan about how it's not fair that he's still in town and potentially moving in with me (not true), he explained that they need a break from each other until things cool off (at my request).\n\n\\- During those next few months she was sending passive aggressive texts at him whenever he missed a group hangout (I never told him not to go but yeea he did the right thing) and she would offer to lend an ear if he needed to talk about his personal problems (death in the family, she didn't know them well). It felt like a gross overstep on her part.\n\nShe was always quite cold towards me and inferred at times that I was superficial. I felt like she didn't put in any effort to be at least kind with me, which is important if you want to be good friends with your ex/bf.\n\nBut here's where I think he done wrong. They started talking and hanging out again (sometimes alone sometime with friends) and he never really told me about when this started up again. It began late summer '18. I felt gaslit when I told him I felt weird about her, oh and one night after reading her angry text messages (he passed me his phone b/c I wanted to see her January drunk text), I saw that she wrote \"understood why I, r/noireau, would be jealous of her\" a night after they hung out. I think he had attempted to explain why they didn't hang out for a while. Anways, I got realll pissed off about that. We talked until about 2 am. I got real pissed asking him to first off a) clarify to his ex/friend that r/noireau isn't jealous and to b) not let that slide in the future if you count on having a healthy friendship with her. He never did.\n\nAfter that fight LITERALLY the next day she's over (mutual friends from Chicago were visiting) and he lends her some of his favourite comics in front of my face. DUDE, not cool. I explain this, he doesn't really get it until I explain it when we were breaking up lol. He also has her art on the walls (fine) but I had to fight him tooth and nail to get this damn plush Jake the dog toy she sewed for him outside our bedroom (nothing again Jake but get her out of our bedroom pls thx).\n\nWhen bf and I had a break in December they got together and she vented about pent up issues she had 3 YEARS post breakup. Yikes. We've had several convos about her during our relationship that always ended with r/noireau stop worrying about it, I care for you I'd never do anything wrong to you.\n\nTo his credit he's in incredibly kind person. Almost to a fault. He puts other people's need before his own. There were other things like his problem with alcohol moderation (gets way too hammered b4 everyone else) that soured things but namely, it was finally seeing him texting with his ex when we were hanging out before the holidays that was the final straw. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Context: \n\nAround New Years my girlfriend told me that she wasn’t happy, and that the past few months she felt like we weren’t together anymore. I had regrettably failed to emotionally support her during some very stressful months and due to this and a few other issues on my end she was considering breaking up with me. I begged her to stay with me and while she didn’t cut me off entirely we agreed to take a break. This included the possibility of seeing other people, something I still can’t consider doing, and haven’t done.\n\nSince then we’ve spent some time together, initially discussing our issues and then basically a date or two, although we were still on this “break.” While on one of these dates I noticed she was texting multiple other guys who’s names I didn’t recognize, initially I put it off and she didn’t acknowledge it. She stayed over that night and she was still doing it and eventually it got to me and I had to ask her about it. \n\nI told her I didn’t like the thought of her dating anyone else and especially not texting them while we were on a date. \n\nShe said that this is what we agreed to and that she needed to talk to them as a distraction to keep her from falling right back into our relationship without us fixing our issues. She also added that our old relationship is over and that I have to essentially win her back over the other guys she’s been talking to if I want to be with her.\n\nSo I’m not sure how to feel or handle this situation. I can’t tell if I’m being selfish or overly possessive or not.\n\nOn one hand I feel like we’re still in a relationship and this is essentially her way of “seeing what’s out there” while having me to return to if there’s nothing better. \n\nOn the other I understand that in the past I’ve failed her to some degree and that relationship is now gone and I have to start again. If this was someone new I had just met I’d have to make them want to date me over anyone else they considered being with.",

      "description": "Throw away account , also I'm on mobile. It all started when I was born. My parents weren't the worst but weren't the best either.\n\nMy dad was always working, either in my home country or abroad , so I rarely seen him. He didn't really show any interest in how I am or what I'm doing. I did want to spend more time with him as a child, I definitely needed his attention, but sadly I didn't got it. Also later in my life by dad had drinking problems, which was hard for our family get through them.\n\n\nBecause of this , I spent most of my life with my mom which is the reason I'm writing here. My mom was and still is a helicopter parent , maybe even worse than that. My mom was a control freak, she didn't trust me , always had to do everything for me and never let me go anywhere. \n\nShe didn't work anywhere for atleast 15 years, so every single day she was home. She always cooked for me, cleaned my room , cleaned my clothes etc. If I hang out with friends I would have to go home at 6 PM not matter how old I was. She didnt let me close my door , so I had no privacy. I had to go to sleep at 10 PM till I turned 19. \n\nShe did let me do some of the stuff , like eat unhealthy food every single day, she didn't really force me to have any hobbies. \n\nBut what I hate the most is that she was never happy with me. No matter what I did I wasn't good enough. She would always yell at me and call me names. If I did something wrong , maybe get a bad grade or hurt myself on accident she would yell at me and remind about this for weeks . But I did something good she would act like nothing happened . \n\n\nIn her eyes I always were ungrateful, bratty, stupid, fat child. \n\n\nSoon I'm gonna be 20 , I still don't know who I wanna be.  In thinking about studying photography but my mom is unhappy about it. She wanted me to become a doctor , ( which wont happen ) and thinks that it I will become a photographer I'm not gonna earn any money and live of theirs my whole my life like I do now. \n\n\nAt this point I don't know how to cook or clean  or even make a single appointment. I don't know what's right or wrong , it's hard for me to stay healthy and I'm emotional mess. I feel like a burden to my own family. My mom constantly says that I'm a failure because of all of this stuff .   \n\nAnd I think that it's their fault for all of this.  They never helped me nor showed me how to do any of that stuff. How can a child learn all of that on it's own. I know that I will have to learn that  on my own now  and it's okay . But I still feel like I should blame them for this.\n\nAITA for blaming my parents ? \n\n",

      "description": "Preface: this is a bit of a mouthful. \nAnyway, I am currently building a garden in my family's backyard. Starting from scratch, the whole nine yards. Also doing it myself, with the idea that it would be primarily for my use, but I wouldn't be opposed if someone else wanted to put a couple of plants in. Since I have other responsibilities besides this project, i asked my father if he could help out a bit. He refused to help, saying that it's my project. So I asked whether he was planning to use it at all, and he told me that he was. That it is on his property, so he takes precedence with using it. I told him he's being ridiculous, and if he wants to use it all he has to do is help out a bit. I'm not going to get into details, but he is unemployed, has no day time responsibilities, and has no physical or mental disabilities that prevent him from helping out or getting a job, much to my moms frustration. He used to work, but got laid off 7 years ago and apparently has got used to doing nothing. Unfortunately she is very averted to confronting him about this so she doesn't. He totally shuts down when confronted with anything he considers criticism, so we don't bother mostly. As such, I see it more as my mothers and my choice how it is used, as we both work and i put part of my pay towards our house utilities. He says I will not be allowed to use any of the family cars if I don't let him use the garden. And by using the garden, he means it will be primarily for how he seeks to use it, and i will be allowed to put in a few. Am i the asshole if I refuse to let him use it? ",

      "title": "AITA for backing out of a living assignment with my friend",
      "description": "\nI have a friend named ted, at the start of the year, he started hanging out with our resident assistant... a lot. Recently they are secretly dating (have done everything except sex. Not even really dating, just friends with benefits honestly). That doesn't bother me too much, shes just a jerk. She has this ego problem where she thinks shes more important then everyone else (my friend ted has this problem too). We all hangout a decent amount and we tolerate each other, but every one in awhile the ra will say something that just bugs me, but I don't confront her about it because I don't really care. Ted just has this attitude problem where he'll argue over the smallest things no matter what because he likes being right.\n\nWe all planned on rooming together next year. She had asked me if i wanted to live with her and I said yeah, ignoring my true feeling's about living with them. The new housing is like an apartment. It has four total bedrooms (two on each side), two bathrooms on each side, a full kitchen, etc.\n\nI asked if I could ask a friend of mine since we had a 4th spot open,  she proceeded to get mad and say \"It's my apartment, I decide on who is going to live there\". This made me a little upset, but I got over it because I feel like she would pick someone we all know and I was in Florida on spring break so I wasn't dealing with her attitude. Weeks later, I find out that she had picked some random girl she just met and doesn't even hang out with/talk to to live with us. Well, that's all fine and dandy as long as they weren't sharing a bathroom with me. I figured since this is some random person that the ra picked, ted would be a good friend and share a bathroom with the person he'd known for three years who he was very close with rather then the girl he just met that gives him blowjobs. Well that wasn't the case, my friend said the two of them would share a bathroom and then put me with this random chick none of us knew.  I don't like that. So I go to the ra's bosses boss and ask about switching my living assignment because the ra had already written down that I was going to live with her and I wanted to make sure I could still get out. I don't tell her anything about the Ra and ted, but I just say that I don't want to live there anymore I'd rather live with others. She says this is perfectly fine and guides me through the selection process. So I'm officially not living with Ted, the ra and this random chick I still haven't met.\n\nWell, they both find out which is fine, i was going to tell them anyways. But they refuse to have a mature conversation about it and claim its just because I want to live with my lesbian friends.\n A few days go by and Ted isn't that mad anymore but the ra still is. Am I missing something or does she have the right to be upset about this? She is still guaranteed a room regardless, it changes nothing for them. ",

      "description": "I work at a buffet style restaurant.  It’s at a popular vacation spot and quite large.  On the floor the hierarchy is basically general manager&lt;floor manager&lt;lead line server&lt;line server.  I have years of both front end and back end kitchen experience.  I was also an assistant manager at a previous place of employment.  I was promoted in less than a month of working there to lead line server.  \n\nThings were going very well.  I was frequently getting compliments from both managers about the efficiency and training I was doing.  There is a lot of turn over at this buffet as a good percentage of our employees are actually out of country students.  It’s actually one of the most interesting parts about working here, learning about cultures all over the world.   It has its challenges though as well, mainly language comprehension.   My general manager said that since I took over for the last lead things have greatly improved.  \n\nI’m not just trying to brag, I’m just giving examples of why I feel I was screwed over.   One of the line servers was an American girl.   She was my 2nd worst server.   About the only good thing I can say about her work is that she was friendly with customers.   Everything else she screwed up.  She was also constantly late and even had a no call no show which should have gotten her fired. \n\nFor whatever reason my general manager really likes her though and she never got so much as a write up.   A lot of times I would see them just standing by the kitchen doors having a conversation while the rest of us worked.  It was annoying, but hiring and firing wasn’t my job.  \n\nThe floor manager recently left for another job.  I really thought that it was mine and I was really excited about it.  Instead my 2nd worst worker got promoted above me and is now my direct boss.   I’m pretty resentful about it.  It makes zero sense that she would be promoted.  I asked the general manager if there was something wrong with my performance and he just said no, that I’ve been doing great work, but she’s better managerial fit.  \n\nPart of my wants to quit I’m so bothered by it, but this has been one of the most interesting jobs I’ve ever had and the location can’t be beat so I’m conflicted.  I’m not sure how well I’ll be able to take orders from her though.  ",

      "description": "So, there's this guy. He and I have been..... close, but touch and go. Which is to say we've had fallings-outs before. Usually over shit he did (an indication that either I'm an overreactive drama queen or that he's a dramamonger)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's the argumentative type. And, to be perfectly honest, so am I, but I guess I would say to a lesser extent than he is (but I imagine he'd disagree). Concerned with the way he and I always fought and got into arguments, I decided to myself I would make an active effort not to fight with him.\n\nThe thing is, he actively pursues arguments-- by his own admission--because he believes disagreements bridge the gap between misunderstandings. Which, I guess, is noble in its own way, if it weren't for the fact that he is absolutely and totally condescending in these disagreements. In October or November (I forget exactly when), he and I got into a **recurring** argument about whether or not it is acceptable to give money to panhandlers. I have always argued that, no, I am not under a moral obligation to give a panhandler my money. This particular night, though, a guy, after I told him no, told me \"Look, man, I'm not looking for a hand out. I'm just hungry.\" So I took the dude to a nearby food place and bought him a meal.\n\nThis dude that I argue with called me a hypocrite, and got very smug about how I could learn to be a better person if I just admitted he was right more often. \n\nI cut the guy out of my life-- because I'm tired of fighting and arguing with him. Fuck that guy, I don't care if I'm an asshole or not there because seriously he's a dick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing, though. Tonight, I realized he and I actually share a Hulu account from our roommate days. I don't pay for it. I'm not 100% sure he does, either-- I think he's mooching off of his mother, and that when I was paying my half as a roommate that he was just straight up pocketing that money. I don't really have any proof he's doing that other than the fact that he's done similar things in the past.\n\nOne way or the other, I feel **a little** guilty using this Hulu account which is saved after such a big blowout over charity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL; DR:\n\nAm I the asshole for cutting this guy out of my life over an argument about panhandlers, and then using a Hulu account that is in his name?",

I do  everything short of bathrooms which means trash, sweeping, and table bussing for our parks restaurants. \n\nToday the 2 people I was suppose to work with called out which left me working by myself in our biggest restaurant *on a holiday*. I’ve been working here for a little bit over a year now so I wasn’t too worried I just knew it was going to be a really busy day. \n\nSo right to the story: I’m halfway through my shift and my lead (who’s deaf) comes by for the first time all day. He apologizes to me for not coming sooner and then explains that he has 2 other restaurants to manage (we’re very understaffed not the norm) and jokes that he wasn’t too worried about how I was doing. Communicating with him is easy since he reads lips well and also mouths what he’s saying.  When I speak to him I find myself also just mouthing our conversations instead of actually speaking. We continue our small talk on random topics, he tells me about the hot chocolate in the break room, we complain about the weather and our staffing situation and then he leaves. I didn’t think much of it and I got back to work, I did a round of trash and collected some trays. After I was done I went to the cart we have set aside with rags and gloves and got another pair of gloves (note that this is where me and my lead had our conversation). As I’m putting on my gloves a man sitting about 2 tables away with his family approaches me and hands me some money and a napkin with writing on it and mouths “a tip for you”. I tense up realizing the situation and without thinking mouth “it’s okay, but thank you” while nodding my head and smiling , he insists I take it and at this point I don’t want to be rude since he wrote me a note so I accept (we aren’t suppose to take tips). I sign and mouth “thank you”, then go to read his note which says something along the lines of “Your work is appreciated, Here’s to the start of a great year :-)” I smile at them and thank them again then go to the back of the restaurant to count the money, it’s $44 dollars (their change I assume) and I’m more than grateful for it. I write them back a little note on a napkin thanking them again and wishing them a Happy New Years. \n\nLater in the day I run into a coworker I’m close with during her lunch (my break) and tell her about what just happened. She’s happy for me but then mentions that it’s kind of shitty that I pretended to be deaf. I say I panicked and didn’t know what to do but I didn’t do it intentionally. She argues that I wouldn’t have gotten the tip if they thought I wasn’t deaf. I’ve been thinking about this since the end of my shift, so AITA for pretending to be deaf for a tip?",

      "description": "Asshole is too strong a word for the situation, but you catch my point (probably). Here's the situation, my boss wants to treat my coworker and I to lunch. All 3 of us are straight men BTW. I (happily) don't have a car so I welcome every invitation to eat with my coworkers, but my boss always wants to pick up the check. Now he's a nice guy trying to do a nice thing so I offer to pay for myself only twice before I uncomfortably force myself to give up.\n\nIf I tried hard enough, I could probably explain why I feel that I have to pay for myself, but that rabbit hole probably ventures into the financial problems my family had growing up and how independent I had to be. So I don't exactly like sharing it.\n\nAnyway, AITA for even arguing against a free meal?",

      "description": "So, for some background: it was a couple of days before Christmas, and as I was doing the dishes, my dad whipped me with a towel. It was playfully, but I wasn’t in the mood, so I asked “Could you not”. A few minutes later, my mom was saying that I was giving her pushback on a lot of things, and I told her as respectfully as I could that I didn’t recall fighting her on anything recently./\nMy dad then said “[I]must be a miserable person”(though I heard it as “[I am] a miserable person”). I then responded with “of course I’m miserable and lazy to you (the man had called me lazy to my face in some of our more heated arguments)”. He of course responded with an angry “Shut your mouth”. My parents then went on a lecture about how I’m unpleasant to be around, and how it’s going to cost me friendships and jobs. /\nMy mother even cam back to lecture me further(she usually either supports my father or tries to frame what he said in the best possible light). And immediately to see if what they were saying was true I asked as many people as I could think of if I was a downer, and they said no. I guess my question are twofold:\n1. Was I in the wrong for reacting negatively to what my father said?\n2. Should I take what my parents said to heart when other people around me (who are very positive people I might add) disagree with it.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to stay at my boyfriends place anymore",
      "description": "Background information, I'm gay. My boyfriend and I have been dating for about three months, though we dated briefly about three years ago before work took us to different states. We got together once we were living in the same city. We're both in our 20's, he is two years older than I am and makes more money -- but not exponentially more. This is important later.\n\nWith the holidays, I've been staying over at his house a lot. He has a dog and a home, where I have an apartment and a roommate. They're both nice places, but it sort of makes sense to be at his place rather than mine. We order food via Door Dash / Uber Eats fairly frequently, I bring food home on my way from work, or we eat groceries that he purchased.\n\nThis is the important point. About two weeks ago he got upset while we were out to dinner with some friends, put a $20 on the table, and left. I sent him a text that night but he didn't respond. I figured he needed a little space so I stayed at my place. After a few days of not getting any texts, I went to his house to talk. He told me that while the friend thing upset him, what he was really upset about was the fact that I hadn't offered to pay for his meal. He felt like he was paying for a disproportionate amount of things with me staying at his house, eating his food, etc.\n\nI was taken aback. I've never been called stingy by anyone in my life. In fact, and I don't mean this to brag, I'm known as being really generous. We grew up fairly poor and I have been quite lucky in life -- I go out of my way to pay for meals for my employees, pay for family outings, etc. It's just a part of who I am. Additionally, it felt really weird to be arguing about a couple hundred dollars when he spends money on expensive clothing, decor, etc. on a daily basis. We're talking thousands of dollars on a whim because he doesn't like the color of something.\n\nLong story short, I apologized if things had gotten out of whack financially. I certainly didn't feel like they had given the back of the napkin math I was doing, and I told him as much, but I said I figured it was possible since I don't really keep an accounting ledger in my head. We came to an arrangement that he would continue paying for groceries, etc. and I would pay for meals / drinks anytime we go out. Fine, right?  \nNope. On Tuesday this week, he told me that he needed to do a lot of work at home and that I should sleep at my own place. Cool. I didn't really hear from him for 3 days. I sent a couple of texts, which he responded to with one-liners but nothing else. Then after work last night, I went over to his place sans-invite and he told me that work has been stressful, but more importantly he continues to feel like \"he is taking care of me\" by me being at his place. I told him the only reason I stayed over was that I wanted to spend time with him. The argument didn't really go anywhere. He told me that's the way he feels and I told him that I think he is wrong.\n\nHe then wanted to have a night in and have me to stay over, but I was upset by the argument and I left. I dunno, Reddit. I try to be a super reasonable person but how the hell am I supposed to feel comfortable around someone if I know they're keeping a running tab for every bottle of water, cup of coffee, or frozen pizza I consume? I have absolutely 0 desire to be at his house anymore with this now becoming a recurring issue for him, but he can't really come and stay at my place without making arrangements for the dog. Am I the asshole for not wanting to stay at my boyfriend's place anymore?",

      "description": "On mobile so apologies for formatting.\n\nBackground information: Years ago when I was working my first job as a teenager, I worked at a popular breakfast/lunch in my family’s well-to-do neighbourhood. We had a 25-30ish regular who would order a meal (not cheap) and ask for our recycling. I was told that he was brain-damaged ex-military and that his parents (who lived a short bus ride) housed him, clothed him and covered his food bills but he collected recycling for pocket money. \n\nAnyways, he would come in every other day, hit on all the female staff, explain to male staff that he wasn’t gay (almost every time) and then relentlessly go after our baker. He would ask her out, ask to kiss her, ask to have sex with her, ask to have dinner at her house, ask her and her husband to take him out for dinner. She was actually quite friendly to him but obviously didn’t take him seriously, and kindly excused her way out. I found out later that he had actually successfully invited himself to her wedding, had been over to her house for dinner multiple times (with husband present), and had attempted to three wheel her honeymoon.\n\nShe eventually told me (in parts overtime) that because of his condition, we had to be more sympathetic and kinder to him than the average customer:person, and that essentially it was the brain damage that made him act that way. Fortunately I never had to deal with him much while working since he always wanted her, the head baker, to take his order personally (not her job) and she did it because we have to “think of his condition”. When I told my parents about this, they agreed with the baker and I didn’t (and still don’t really) know the effects of brain damage so I left it like that.\n\nNext to the assholery: Even though I didn’t really deal with him much at work, we used the same bus stop (and occasionally same bus). He used to recognize me from work and beeline it for me, be overly friendly (he assumed we were really good friends since I smiled and asked him how he was when I was working), asked to sit next to me on the bus and sat down before I could respond (I let him because he was and customer at my work and I was a stupid teenager with severe social anxiety), or sit super close to me at the bus stop when the whole bench was empty. Mind you I was a minor at this time.\n\nAs the years passed (and I was no longer working at my first job), I would still run into him at the bus stop and he would hit one and ask me out. I would turn him down absolutely but kindly, keeping in mind his “condition”. It never even gave him pause, he kept on trying. I want to remind readers that I have really bad social anxiety that makes me dread any interaction with strangers etc and even most acquaintances. This was truly awful for me.\n\nEventually I go travelling, work in various places, take some classes across the country and then come home, live with my parents and start finishing up my degree at a local university. And sure enough, he’s still here, still taking the same bus and still trying to talk to me. I don’t think he recognized me but I still feel singled out: I’m an awkward polte-looking young girl who might seem like an easy target.\n\nThe first time he comes up to me and starts talking to me, I take off my headphones (which I always wear since I hate talking to people), tell him “I’m sorry, I don’t like talking to people,” and put my headphones back on. He just stares at me silently, still standing uncomfortable close to me, until I walk away. This repeats a couple times until I start pretending I don’t hear him and wander aimlessly away. I have tried hiding from him, it doesn’t work; the guy has a spidey sense for young girls (I have seen him act like this towards other girls). Tonight when he bothered me I just looked at him and walked to the other side of the bus stop, he tried to follow me so I walked behind it and waited there, keeping an eye on him until his bus came. The next time I see him I might just tell him to fuck off, despite my damn social anxiety.\n\nAm I asshole? Most of my friends and family think so. They’ve told me to be more patient and considerate of his “condition”. But they don’t have to deal with his relentlessness. He’s never been physical and comes off as cheery/friendly but he seems to have no sense of object permanence or concept that no means no, not ever and not just no for this specific thing for the next five minutes. I guess it’s possible that his injury affects his memory (even though he remembered me for years after I quit my first job. But I still don’t feel like I should have to deal with this on basically a weekly basis.\n\nI feel like no one has ever told him no seriously and then held him accountable when he tries again. People treat him with larger kid gloves than they treat their own children.\n\nSo yeah, am I the asshole? Also, advice for how I should deal with him in the future is welcomed.",

      "description": "Okay so first of all I'm in my first year of University and second year of college. I commute like 50 minutes to my school everyday, so for this reason alone I do not have much time to hang with my friends for hours during the school week.\n\nFlashback to my last 2 years of high school, one of those years which I spent at community college. During this time I had a friend group who like to get together and play this game called Exalted every week, which is another RPG game like DnD.  My friend group consisted of my current best friend Rose, an ex friend named Mark, Marks little sister, another guy named Tom, an old friend named Katy and her step brother Robert who is 40 years old. Everyone else was 17-19 when we first started playing. Robert was always the DM or GM of our games, and because we had no where else to play for over a year, I offered up my house for us to have game night on Fridays. After a while, I felt like my friends were overstaying their welcome. Each Friday game took a minimum of 6 hours to play, they would always order take out with often with a mess they would sometimes leave for me to clean up. I began to feel stressed out about playing this game. \n\nI didn't begin separating from my friends until we all tried to go to the Renaissance festival together. I was going with my family and the Exalted group. When my friends show up (which was like 6 or 7 people) in their minivan to go to Renaissance festival, the van engine craps out immediately on us in front of our yard. So we offer up our other family minivan for them to borrow. \n\nI remember this weekend in particular. This was the same week that I had broken the tip of my right index finger, and the same week my backpack was stolen at school. I remember trying to open up about it with my friends at the time, but they weren't respondsive to what I was saying. So to top it all off I decided to go to Ren Fest to feel better. However after like 2 hours or 2 1/2 hours I was feeling pretty done with the Renaissance festival. I had fun, but I had seen all the fake Renaissance/medieval attractions years prior, and I was tired and ready to eat. But my friends were hardcore Renaissance people, they were following the day's schedule and ready to commit the rest of the day there. But I split off with my parents and my sisters to get lunch and go home. My friends were tense and disappointed that I left early. I told them that my finger still hurt and I wanted to take more pain meds (which was kinda true lol).\n\nLater that night, after my friends returned the family van and left, I got a series of cryptic texts from Mark, which basically revealed to me that I had offended him at Ren Fest. I remember eventually calling him and asking him \"what the fuck? Why exactly?\" And trying to drill him to get him to say exactly what he was thinking. And then, Mark starts crying (which he did a lot when manipulating me and others in the past 🙃). And then I hear Rose's voice on the phone and I realize she was there the whole time listening and talking to Mark. Then she begins to tell me that I don't hang out them as friends enough anymore. This shocked me because we already spent once a week playing our RPG game and never missed our game night. At this point I had told them how busy I was at school (community college), and about the bad week I had before hanging out with them. I felt like their request to spend more time with me, after they had been so tense around me that I didn't want to hang with them, was inconsiderate of my feelings. I remembered crying that night because being attacked by 2 friends over the phone is so fucking fun. \n\nIt's been like a year since this event, and I'm actually still friends with Rose. I feel like Rose just got fed Mark's bullshit at the time and took his side, but she's been a much better friend since then. I have also stopped playing Exalted with these people because I've lost my interest in 6+ hour long RPG games. I guess I just grew out of that. As a result I don't see the group much anymore. Also because of many other factors involving Mark, I have been ghosting him for over the past couple months. (He was dependedent on me and our conversation had become passive-agressive whenever we talked to each other).\n\nSo was I the asshole? Also if you answer \"Not enough info\" I understand. This was just a whole shit show of a friend group and I didn't want to live every single detail of it again\n\n",

      "description": "Sorry this is a long one!  Basically I have lived with my flatmate for three years but with others. We were really great friends and then he went away for a year. When he came back we decided to live together just us two. He wasn't around so I sorted all of the viewings for flats etc. I was really proud of the flat (really cheap and nice looking, equal bedroom sizes which is difficult for a 2 bed). I lived there on my own for about a month and then he arrived. Ever since he arrived he has just basically treated the flat like dirt.\n\nHe leaves his leftovers and peelings everywhere, dirties all of (my) pans, chopping board and knives (we share) and then leaves them until he wants to use them next. Just lazy things like leaving food on the dish sponge and leaving the bin lid open with stuff poking out?? if I want to cook or eat I have to tidy the kitchen and wash everything up before I can make anything myself. This takes half an HR in itself! I have said about maybe just tidying communal areas and he said yes sorry he was just really stressed.. we are both at uni so I thought that wasn't an excuse but we left it and it was tidy for a bit but not long. I'm no neat freak but its things that make the flat smell and become unpleasant.\nI'm super aware that it's annoying to have someone niggling at u to tidy up all the time but I genuinely feel like a cleaner and it is actually exhausting thinking about how messy it will be when I get back from work/classes. I have began to hate being in the flat and I don't enjoy spending time with him anymore. I feel like I'm just tidying up after  him ALL the time. I think we have just drifted. But I feel so bad constantly getting annoyed by it and feel passive aggressive when I tidy up. \n\nAITA for being so negative about my friend and essentially wanting to distance myself or is there something I can do to better the situation??",

      "description": "so there’s this girl at my school let’s call her a . she wasn’t always a giant bitch , in fact we got along quite well that is until i realized she was boy obsessed. \n\nwe had met before school started once before, and when that happened she actually came out to me as bisexual. I’m completely supportive of anyone that’s a part of that community, but when she started high school she told me she was no\nlonger bi and that it was just a phase she went through.  honestly i didn’t care that much, as long as she’s happy so was i until she started to get a little meaner and less supportive of my decisions. \n\nshe would flirt with guys constantly and would always brag about the amount of boys that liked her. by the time hoco had rolled around she had asked 6 different boys to hoco then broken off their date then would move on to the next guy. it eventually became intolerable because she would complain about problems that she made. eventually i stopped talking to her completely, but she was still friends with many of my friends.\n\nshe ended up dating a guy for around a month but broke up with him because he was moving to slow. after that, she started talking to this mystery guy we all knew as Logan. she also became very close with a friend of mines bf. let’s call him R.\n\nR had a history of cheating on girlfriends then braking up with them to date the girls he had fooled around with, and a few of my close friends made a swear she wouldn’t mess around with him.  \n\nright before christmas break the guy A was talking to hooked up with another girl and A lost her shit. she started crying in school even though they were never really dating and spent the rest of the week complaining about it. then we started to notice that she was spending A LOT of time with R. \n\napparently she had started talking to him about how his gf didn’t really like him that much and how they just weren’t meant to be. R broke up with her and guess what ? almost immediately started to date A even though she was very close with Rs ex gf. \n\nat this point i was pretty furious being that i was also close to Rs ex gf and was a friend of R and knew that he was gonna end up getting hurt. But if we ever tried to talk to R about it he’d ignore us.\n\nat this point my friend group pretty much despised A bc she was obnoxious and full of herself and did this awful thing were she would go up behind you and grab your boobs no matter how many times you told her to stop. the final straw was when she told one of my best friends who has struggled with self love for a long time, ( and is very open about it) that she is extremely fake. she asked her if anything about her was real, like her nails or her hair or the fact that she wore makeup. \n\ni was so livid that i screamed at her, “WELL AT LEAST SHE HAS REAL FRIENDS” she ignored me for a week, and frankly i was fine with it.\n\nnow comes the last part of this story. my school goes on a ski trip every year cause we live very close to a ski resort. it’s a two day long over night trip, and the whole way on the bus A was cuddling with some guy that was not R. (he didn’t go on the trip) she even went as far to buy  them a milkshake put two straws in it so they could drink it together like in the movies.\n\nthen that night she started telling people that some guy had kissed her ( which ended up being a huge lie ! ) and was bragging about how hot he was.  no one had the balls to tell R tho so she got away with it . on the way home tho, SHE STARTED CUDDLING WITH THE GUY AGAIN AND SHE HAD THE NERVE TO DO IT IN HER BOYFRIENDS SWEATSHIRT! i was so angry that i texted her bf and told him everything that happened.\n\nhe texted me and said that he was grateful that i told him and that he was gonna have to talk to her about it, we go back to school tomorrow and i’m worried that there is gonna be beef for me when i get there. idk wether i’ve done something wrong and need to apologize for butting in, or if she finally got what she deserved. am i the asshole? \n\nTLTR - a girl kind of cheated on her bf and i told him about it and now i think i broke them up. \n\n\n",

He's hardworking, cordial, and well-liked. He gets his work done, and everyone likes him, but he doesn't have the brilliance or ruthlessness of Sarah. \n\nI chose Sarah, which the COO disapproved of. He pointed out Sarah's an asshole and doesn't deserve it, while Sam is hardworking and loyal. Maybe, but I'd much rather prefer an assistant that's brilliant, ruthless, and gets things done.

      "description": "For reference, I am 20 and currently on winter break from school. My mom and I have been arguing for most of today over finances, specifically over her spending what I thought was way too much money for a holiday dinner (she bought 4 filet minion steaks when I know we could have gotten a cheaper cut of meat and been just fine) when my parents have no retirement saved up for their age, but for the most part I thought it had ended as we stopped discussing it about 3 hours ago. Around 30 minutes ago my mom comes into my brother and I's room and says to my brother \"I need you for a second\". He asks why and she dismisses it/answers \"well, you know\" or something to that degree. I jokingly say \"mom I know its for wrapping my present you have to be more coy than that\" and she laughed. My brother groaned about getting up from his bed to wrap the present, but eventually did.\n\n I thought the interaction was over, but in my parents apartment there is not much distance between the downstairs and upstairs section so I overheard my mom chuckle and say \"We should enjoy this Christmas because I dont think the boys will want to have it with us next year\". My dad asked why, and she said that \"Well I have one kid yelling at me over finances and our retirement and the other complains about wrapping a present\", which both are gross exaggerations of the reality of our argument and my brothers light groaning. My dad then proceeds to talk about my brother by saying \"thats the problem with \\[brother's name\\] these days, he's so one track minded and aloof. He doesn't have a game plan\". To which, my mom said \"yea, and the other one is crazy\", implying me. This put me over the top and when my mom came down I said to her \"You know, you should watch your volume because what you say travels far down here. Otherwise you might sound crazy (yes, intended to indicate I heard what she said). She then is confused, and I tell her what I heard and she denies she said that and makes it out to be I have it out for her today and I am hearing things. My brother eventually comes up and asks calmly what she said, and she says a version that is different than what I heard. He responds with \"I dont think that is what I heard, I agree with \\[my name\\]\". My dad, hearing the commotion, comes down stairs and says \"guys, its Christmas eve tomorrow, stop the fighting\", to which I say (and this is the potential asshole moment) \"I don't care if its Christmas eve tomorrow, I don't like it when you both talk behind our backs. This is more important than that\". He says \"give your mom a break. You can win this battle and lose the war by ruining Christmas here by your actions\". Keep in mind, my mom is constantly denying she called me crazy, and my dad is avoiding saying what he heard as when my brother asks him he replies with \"thats not what this is about, this is beyond that now\", obviously siding with my mom. My brother then explains that he does not feel good hearing beyond talked bad about, and he does not mind them talking trash but to make sure we don't hear it (which is a lie, he does not like being talked bad of either), to which my dad says \"ok, I'm sorry. Is that good enough?\" To which I say thanks, and go back into my room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, was I the asshole for making a big deal of this on the eve of Christmas eve? Or was I justified. I did not eavesdrop as they were talking so loud I could hear it from my desk downstairs, so its not like I went above and beyond in trying to find dirt. I can see its bad timing with the arguments I had with my mom today and Christmas eve tomorrow, but I still feel like being talked shit on like that justifies confrontation. Let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post, lots of details. TLDR: parents talk shit about my brother and I behind our back upstairs, I overhear and regardless of previous conflict and it being Christmas eve tomorrow I confront them about it. AITA for not letting it go? ",

      "description": "So I was playing video games with my friend, and we were expecting another one of our friends to join us and play.\n\nMy girlfriend's then joined the call and said hi, and my friend went 'oh, hi' because he was expecting someone else. My girlfriend got upset and left the call but I managed to convince her to join again. The second time she joined I said hi, and so did she, but my friend didn't, and my girlfriend questioned it, to which I answered 'i don't know', my friend then said 'just ignore her idjot' in a really joking way. After that my girlfriend got upset again and left once more.\n\nI then went on to text her that he didn't mean any harm and was just joking, to which she answered 'but why would he do it again if he knows I got hurt the first time', I again answered I don't know.\n\nShe then said that I was taking his side and defending him instead of having her back, as she always has mine.\nShe's now really upset that I don't have her back as often as she has mine, which is true, but I don't know how we got here from him jokingly telling me to ignore her.\n\nMy friend said that if I could add her to the call he can explain and apologize to her, but she refused to join the call and instead said 'fuck off\" and 'stop adding me' which I find very childish, since she refused to resolve the situation. She said he could do something instead of sending me to talk to her, but all I did was try to add her to the call. \n\nI asked her what she wanted me to do and she said I could start by talking to her, and so I called her and she said she didn't wanna talk to me, she then said she thought it was funny how I could get along all day without her, and just now try to contact her again, when I had been texting her all day but she didn't answer.\n\nSo AITA for 'defending' my friend in this situation?",

      "description": "AITA for getting banned here for not posting AITA in the heading? And AITA for this stuff:\n\nSo, in the age of social media, I do not have social media. Long story (kinda) short, husband had an affair with a coworker and so switching jobs, cutting off social media, etc... it was an AWFUL thing that required therapy and all sorts. We had been together for 5 yrs and the affair happened a year after my only (big) brother died, and a year after our only child together was born. Emotions and hormones and all of it ran rampant. But eventually, it was GOOD. Took a few years but it is so good now. \n\n We disabled all social media immediately after the affair. His idea. \n\nI always had text convos with S and K (and others obviously). S loved my dogs and my dogs had puppies, she wanted one. She was younger than me, not as established, so i was iffy on her having such a high maintenance pup. She came and saw our child after he was born.. he has tumors and has had a few surgeries since. She kept up the most contact out of all my friends from college. Puppies and babies, she was there. One day, idk, we just all kind of stopped texting. \n\nSo I download instagram 2 yrs later. Made an account. Thought since it's been 2 years, i could reconnect. I find S and K. I message them both, and other friends. I tell K specifically \"hey I've been thinking about you and S!!\" She goes into a whole \"I miss you\" schpiel, as do I. Then she says the whole \"did you hear about S?\" \n\nWhat? No? \n\nS had died nearly 2 yrs prior (roughly 2 months after S and I had last hung out). We go into a convo over this. K says that she and others tried to contact me to let me know, but I was nowhere to be found. \n\nI missed all of it. I ask for a phonecall and she says shes busy moving furniture but will give me burial info later. I get that K is moving on at this point, but I am in my livingroom so upset over this. Crying my eyes out. It's new for me. And I quickly find myself wanting to text my husband \"if you wouldnt have had us delete social media, then I would've known sooner\". \n\nI was mad at K at first for dismissing my need to visit the cemetery, she seems as if giving me the cemetary info isnt important.\nThen I got mad at my husband. \"If you wouldnt have had an affair, I wouldnt have had to deactivate all this from YOUR suggestion and I wouldnt have missed this!\"\nThen I got mad at myself. Dont blame anyone, it's a circumstance. No ones fault.\n\nI'm a product of circumstance from my brothers death. I am biased and always looking to blame. I guess I may be a little bewildered. But I am hurting now. AITA for blaming friend/husband? Or is anyone to blame? In regards to my own selfish pain .... Ks death was health related. ",

      "description": "Recently I've gotten into an argument with my friends about how they were being inconsiderate of my feelings. My boyfriend and I are a part of the same friend group. My bf wanted to join a frat and i told him i was uncomfortable with it, he felt as if i was pressuring him to not join at first - but we talled about it more and we came to a compromise where he could join. Later he changed his mind and decided he didnt want to join anymore. Our group of friends kept pressuring him to join and told him to not let me control his life (which i dont think i was since we had come to a compromise). They were blaming me for him not joining the frat and i felt like i was being guilted for feeling uncomfortable with the fraternity issue. \nI planned a \"group meeting\" to talk about the issues and how their actions made me feel. We talked about it and it seemed like no one was trying to understand my feelings or my point of view. They told me their points of views and how I had made them feel uncomfortable. I acknowledged my faults, but i still wanted to get it across that i didnt appreciate how they were acting either. They started dismissing my points and said i was making bullshit excuses. Eventually the conversation ended, and they thought the issue was resolved.\nI had felt as though they were being very narrow minded and not really willing to listen to what i had to say. \nI saw them today and wasnt really in the mood to interact with them. i was quiet and reserved because i felt uncomfortable and wronged. They texted me asking what was wrong and i told them how the talk last night didnt seem productive and that they were being disrespectful during the dicussion. During the discussion, one of the friends was making faces and giing on her phone, and the other one was telling me that my feelings didnt matter and telling me that nothing i was saying made sense)\nAITA for telling them that they were being disrespectful??",

I post to instagram, mostly pictures of our adorable baby daughter, and RARELY to facebook. I have been slowly, over time, filtering through the friend lists on each site, making sure I have only my real friends and family- so long old middle school classmate, so long old coworker I never kept in touch with, and so long neighbor from three apartments ago in a different state.  \n\nAnyway, my husband told me he was showing pictures of our sweet baby to his coworker. I've met her once, nice person...but I don't remember her name, wouldn't be able to pick her out of a crowd, etc. He then mentions that she is going to request to follow me on instagram so she can see the baby. \n\nMy question is, am I being an asshole for wanting to decline her request? She's not my friend- she's husband's coworker who I don't really know. Why can't she just follow his social media instead? ",

      "description": "I'm 21m, he's 22.  We have never gotten along.  I don't have much respect for him.  Our father passed away when I was 10 and he left a lot of the adult stuff to me growing up, like taking care of our mother, handling the house, etc.  Inside I really hold a lot of that against him, some of the stuff I had to deal with with our mother still messes me up to this day.  I can't remember a time when I've been happy to see him.  He lives with my mother at home and I am constantly getting messages about how angry he always is and how he yells at her.  He has only gotten physical with her once that I can remember (he pushed her when he was 14).  Although it's only yelling it's over the dumbest stuff, like how she doesn't remember to turn off the lights or something.  Things that don't deserve yelling.  As children we were always fighting and as a teenager I learned not to talk to him, we'd go days without talking.  It was just simpler.\n\nWhen I first graduated and left home I felt like the space helped.  I felt sad that we didn't have a brotherly relationship, I can't remember a time when I ever looked up to him as a big brother.  As soon as I would return home I would remember why I didn't like him though, and now I feel like I can't see him without it bringing back all the memories of how he hurt me, embarrassed me, and used me when I still lived at home.\n\nI was much bigger and performed much better in school which is what my family assumes led to his treatment of me.\n\nNothing that he has done to me has been illegal or particularly terrible, nothing that by itself would be horrible.  It's just the years of negative experiences have added up and I can't stand his presence.  As I write this I'm trying to remember the last genuinely nice thing he did for me and I can't.\n\nRecently he's been trying to contact me more, whereas before he would never talk to me, I feel as if his girlfriend is trying to repair our relationship.  They've only been dating a year and I have only talked to her twice.  My sister (13 years older, different mother, not very connected to our family) tried to talk to me about it at a recent family reunion.  He himself hasn't changed in person however, it's still the same shit at home.\n\nThis isn't really a large social issue like most in this subreddit.  I want to be clear right now that I am not interested in being close to him, this is what he wants.  I feel like it's such a wast me to have know someone your entire life but not be close to them.  Am I being an asshole (to myself or to him) by not trying to repair this?",

      "description": "This actually happened about a year ago but I just remembered it and wondered what other people might think. \n\nI'm no longer in college, but last year I was taking classes at a local community college. The class in particular was Game Design I - I'm interesting in being a game developer so was pursuing their 2 year degree in game design. The majority of the assignments outside of readings were group projects where we made board games to get a basic grip on basic game design before moving into video games specifically.\n\nSo, I get by the class fine - I skip some readings and stuff because I'm lazy but I do my best to contribute as much as I can to our projects. My group sucked, really bad. We were a 4 person group as opposed to a 5 as the majority of the class was, and half the time 2 of the people weren't even in class (they were friends or something). The other 2 people were me and this guy who was ... okay, I guess. He made a lot of distasteful jokes and hit on me the first 4 weeks of class but he wasn't like, a total dick, just really awkward and definitely nobody I would be friends with.\n\nAnyways, fast forward to our last project. We basically have 3 weeks to make like.. the ultimate board game. Use all of the things we have learned in the class to make some thing really cool and nice. For our \"final\", we would all play each other's games and give feedback.\n\nSo - this part does make me the asshole - our entire group didn't communicate, myself included. We had a group text and each other's emails and... nobody basically.. did anything. Again, I recognize I dropped the ball here too. But SO DID EVERYONE ELSE. Somehow not a SINGLE person cared. I'm assuming everyone thought \"oh, somebody else will start getting stuff done and I'll help later\" (because I did as well), and then.. nobody did anything.\n\nI also wanna mention I have ADHD, so I just.. totally forget about stuff. I get there's ways around this, I'm just saying it is something I struggle with, and I definitely wasn't trying to be like haha I won't help. I'm just not good at starting things. So... suddenly, it's the night the thing is due - at midnight. It was like, 5 or 6 pm. I realize, fuck, nobody has literally done ANYTHING, let alone send a text. I'm annoyed with myself, and pissed at the group that nobody else seemed to give a shit either. So I decide that in the 8 or so hours I have, I'm gonna bust my ass and make a game on the spot.\n\nI spent the next 4 or 5 hours making a resource management based card game basically entirely in Photoshop. It was fairly simple, but I did my best to actually apply some form of game design. When it was finished, I submitted it (before the deadline) and specifically told my professor that the reason it was so bare bones was that I made it by myself, and nobody on the group helped. I acknowledged I also dropped the ball, but that I figured I could at lease salvage my own grade if these other clowns would not do it.\n\n(I also did not go to the last day of class because I'm a pussy with bad social anxiety who did NOT want to explain to my group members why I submitted a game just for myself).\n\nI ended the class with a low B overall, with an 87% on the project, and I never heard back from the professor on it, nor any of the group members.\n\nWas I the asshole specifically for doing the project myself and making it clear I was the only person who did anything? It was so long ago, I doubt it matters, but I guess I'm just curious, because I always felt kind of like.. proud of myself for just powering through it and making it clear none of those clowns lifted a finger to make the finished product.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Normally I don't go to the internet seeking advice, but I don't have anyone to go to, I can't afford a therapist and I hate talking about my relationship problems.\n\nSo my boyfriend and I have been together for over a year. I love him very dearly. It was established since day one that we were extremely monogamous. He would say in what I thought was earnest that he only was attracted to me.\n\nFast forward a few months, I discover his reddit and like a bit of a snoop, I looked through it. Eventually I discover a large list of comments (saying how perfect and attractive) on photos of girls naked. These weren't just pornstars either, these were amateur photos of girls, most I'm assuming posting for attention or whatever, and would probably see his comments.\n\nNow, I understand some people need porn to get off. I'm ok with watching porn, but photos really just make me uncomfortable. I'm not ok with my lover looking at photos of other women. Not to mention commenting on it. \n\nIt's been close to a year since I discovered it, and every time I confront him he gets so filled with self hate I just can't get the anger, frustration and hurt I need to get out. \n\nIt's built up a lot of resentment, and sometimes I just get angry out of nowhere, and we're so close to a breakup I don't even know if I can salvage it.\n\nI just want to know why, but all he ever says is he doesn't know. \n\nI understand some people are ok with things like this, but I'm not. Neither is he. \n\nSo... Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I (21M) have a friend (21M) who is flamboyantly gay (think the stereotypical image of a gay person and you're just about spot on). He's had a crush on me ever since we started being friends (almost 6 months ago), and while I love him to death (he's my best friend, and anyone I consider my best friend I love dearly), he has been more and more aggressive about how he essentially gets his relationship fantasy played through me.\n\nTo start, anytime we are out in public, he will grab my arm or hold my hand or give me a peck on the cheek when he says bye (all stuff I dont like, as I'm not gay and even if I was I don't like him like that and I've just allowed it because I dont know how to handle sexual things. Wouldnt even allow a girl to do that to me as it geeks me out), he always calls me his \"future husband\", and theres been a few times he has either made comments on my body or been creepy with me (he once grabbed my ass when we were at a bar with friends, which I brushed off because he was drunk, and recently he commented that \"you should be shirtless more often\" because I had to take my shirt off since the dog we were dog sitting together for a mutual friend peed on me. Plus he wound up getting up in the middle of the night to sleep on top of me, and I woke up in the middle of the night to that, which to me was disrespectful and not okay in the slightest.)\n\nI've had enough of it. It's starting to bother me to the point that everything about him is bugging me, from how excessively extra he is about things to his mannerisms. I want to talk to him about this and tell him that it is pissing me off that hes treating me this way, but I dont feel he will listen. So what I want to do is this: sit down with him and make the conversation about him. Since he likes me and I'm leaving the Army in 13 days (sidenote: YAY!), I want to make the conversation about how I, as his best friend, encourage him to move on from me and use the creepy examples and the over possessiveness examples to demonstrate to him how much this is messing him up, being fixated on me when I will never return his affection.\n\nThe reason why I bring this here is because in effect, I'm not telling the whole truth, as there is a bit more that bugs me about him (the extraness and him grabbing on my female friend [however playful it is] while she has a boyfriend, creeping her out and pissing him off too. Plus him continually belittling her bf is incredibly annoying), but I'm leaving that out, along with the entire reason for why I want him to stop, which may mean he continues his behavior with other people, hurting his relationships and possibly his wellbeing in the future.\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA for telling half of the truth to my friend who is being creepy towards me in an effort to get him to stop?",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom!  \n  \n  \nI have had a rough upbringing with several traumatic experiences including emotional, physical and sexual abuse. I am always upfront about it with friends since some can’t ”take it” when I talk about my feelings. I respect that fully and never try to push my bad feelings onto someone else. But as pretty much any other person, I need to talk about my emotions.  \n  \nI recently went through a bad breakup. Got thrown out of my apartment and had to endure a lot of emotional abuse from my ex. I wasn’t in a stable emotional situation at that time, and had recently started on anti-depressants due to my suicide thoughts/plans.  \n  \nI had one friend I pretty much all the time turned to just to empty my chest. It was what I felt I needed. At the same time I tried seeking professional help. In my country the healthcare is free, but the wait is long. I have been waiting since 2017 for a psychiatrist and it was only yesterday I had my first appointment. So I have had to rely on close friends for comfort.  \n  \nI noticed how a friend group started drifting away. They didn’t answer my messages anymore and when I ran into them after a concert they pretended like I wasn’t there.  It was super embarrassing since I was there with another friend who they hadn’t met yet, and the tension was awkard..\n  \nYesterday (it has now been months since we last spoke) I asked my ”best friend” of the group if I had done something wrong and if I hurt any of them in any way, so that I could apologize which I though was fair to do to them.\nShe told me that she was tired of me always being sad, telling her about my self harm thoughts, and complaining about my ex. She felt used and manipulated.  \n\nReading that made my stomach drop. I never knew that I had made her feel that way and now I feel *awful*. She told me she didn’t want me as a friend and I understand that. So I apologized. She then told me that more people deserve to have my apology but she didn’t tell me who or why so now I am anxious and can’t sleep. Was I that big of an asshole? What could I have done differently? I have severe abandonment issues, and always have the feeling that people secretly hate me, because of my background and now all my ”bad thoughts” are coming true. How can I apologize the best way?\n\nTL;DR: I was sad and talked to my friend about it. She got sick of it and stopped inviting me to gatherings and stopped talking to me. She told me she’s fed up with dealing with my depression and anxiety. AITA for sharing everything with her?",

      "description": "Some backstory: I'm a student who moved to another city to go to university and in the last few months there I've made new friends and I really have a lot of fun with them. On some weekends I go back to my home town to see my family and old friends. \n\nNow to my problem. I have a really good friend, let's call her Anna. I've known Anna for a while and I know she is a good person, but sometimes she doesn't make a good impression when she meets new people. She's very extroverted, asks A LOT of personal questions even if she just met the person 5 minutes ago, she's also very loud and really just says what's on her mind. \n\nIn a few weeks she will come visit me in the city I go to Uni to and has asked if she can meet my new friends. Personally I don't think this is a great  idea as these friends are the opposite of her. They're introverted and they definitely don't want to talk about their personal lives or problems to strangers. I just feel like if they meet it will be crazy awkward and we won't have any fun. They're just very different and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't like my friend. \n\nSo when Anna asked if she can meet them, I said that I'm not sure if they have time and that I'll ask them, when I actually don't plan on asking them at all. I'd just rather have a fun night out with her than cringe the whole time and get second hand embarrassment. So now I kinda feel like an asshole for doing this but on the other hand a lot of people keep friend groups separate.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting Anna to meet them? \n\nAlso this is my first post on reddit so sorry if I'm doing something wrong like formatting or other stuff! I'm on mobile and I made this account just to ask this.",

We haven't spoken since then and now live in different parts of the US. \n\nAs it happened, I was the one with the camera most of the time, so a lot of the pictures I took of us on vacations, around town, etc. are with me. Most of my or her favorite pictures were uploaded to Facebook.\n\nRecently (a few weeks ago), I deleted my Facebook account. Privacy concerns, I haven't used it in almost a year, the usual. This deleted all of the photos along with it. I have backups of all of them, but as I said my ex-wife does not. A few days ago, a mutual friend told me that she was pretty upset because some of her favorite photos were on my Facebook, and now she doesn't have them anymore. Because of the whole \"acrimonious divorce\" situation, I doubt she'll ask me for them directly, but I'm feeling guilty about this.\n\nIt had been quite a few years since the divorce, and there were a ton of pictures, posts, whatever on my Facebook that the older ones didn't stand out in my mind. Probably also because I have copies of all of them anyway. That's probably why this never occurred to me until after the fact.\n\nAITA?",

However some of the material around her crotch was backlit by the sun, making her labia/vuvla fully visible like she wasn't wearing anything. My phone brightness is always on almost full blast because my eyes are really bad, and the contrast on photos sometimes is a little extreme as a result. I didn't know if she was aware this could be visible. Tampering with my light showed unless someone has this extreme setting I do, it was invisible, which made me think perhaps she posted without knowing. \n\n\n\nI sent her a DM privately saying she was a grown adult so she can post what she wants/maybe it was intentional to share that, but let her know it was visible in case she didn't know. I've accidentally overshared and embarassed deleted photos before cause of something in the background etc I missed that shouldnt be visible, nip slips, etc - and would have wanted someone to warn me. I sent a polite message telling her I supported her wether or not she shared that kind of stuff. No shame, no shade, not trying to be creepy.\n\n\n\n\nShe responds getting really upset, telling me not to look at her vagina, being all around really sad and sounding scared, telling me only family should have come to her about that and sounding really creeped out. I apologized and said over and over I didnt mean to overstep and that I was not ill intentioned. She just seems so done with me now.

      "title": "AITA for distancing myself from a close friend without telling her why?",
      "description": "I was friends with this girl at school, we hit it oof pretty well from day one and soon became close friends even though it hadn't been that long. I was enjoying her company and meeting up with her in my free time, chatting at school, sitting together in class, etc. \n\nBut after about a year of being friends, some behaviours of her that I've noticed before where recurring all the time and it annoyed me a lot. Thise behaviours first and foremost consisted of a lot of complaining about the smallest things. And I mean a lot. Nearly all of our conversations where just her complaining now and me trying to give advice but not really knowing what to say because in my eyes the things she was complaining about where mostly just so risiculous. She would tell me how her brother had eaten part of her dinner the day before or how her parents didn't listen to her when she was speaking or something like that and sure, I would be mad about that too and maybe vent to my friends about it but she just went way over the top. \n\nShe always told me how she was depressed and stuff like that and I'll tell you why that matters. Because when she was complaining about those little things she never failed to mention how she had cried for hours over this, or cut herself because of that or was suicidal. And don't get me wrong, I totally understand that when you're in a really bad state of mind, even the smallest thing can trigger you and let you spiral into a mental breakdown, but having had experiences with similar mental health issues myself, it seemed a lot to me like she was blowing things way out of proportion. She showed me her 'cuts' once and they weren't even scratches. I know that harming your body in whatever way is a warning sign, but her skin wasn't even broken, it was just the white lines you get from scratching your fingernails on your skin. Also, she was always happy and smiling and chatting and yeah, you can hide depression but I know that I had one hell of a lot bad days that I couldn't muster up a smile or talk to anyone at all. There where even more things like that that made me suspicious but the bottom line is that I felt she was making things bigger than they were for attention. Because not only did she talk to me about her issues, as you do with a friend, no, she told everyone. She would literally go to random people in our class and find a way to bring it up in conversation because (at least in my eyes) she wanted validation and attention. \n\nIt got to a point where I was so annoyed with that behaviour and the constant talkong about it that overtook our friendship and I started consciously distancing myself from her. We didn't have a fight, we didn't have a talk, we just started slowly drifting away from one another because I kept turning down her offers to hang out and chose to talk to other people when I would've talked to her. She never confronted or asked me about so I never saw the need to tell her why I was doing this. It was one of those things where you both see what's happening (me distancing myself) but you don't talk about it because it would be uncomfortable. Nowadays, we never talk to each other anymore and try to avoid being in group projects together since it would be awkward. \n\nTl;dr: I was close friends with a girl who then started talking about being depressed a lot in a way that seemed to me a lot like she was owing it out of proportion and doing it for attention. I distanced myself from her, we're not friends anymore. Aith?",

      "description": "Background: my wife and I have a dead bedroom. For several years, she’s had issues having pain-free sex, so that’s been a huge contributing factor, but even before those issues, her sex drive had begun declining dramatically (to the point where we’d had many frank conversations about how it was affecting the relationship). \n\nWe’ve recently had very honest talks where she has granted me permission to have sexual experiences with other people (conditional, of course).\n\nWe live in a city where we don’t know many other people, so the opportunity for such an encounter is rare... almost non-existent. I’m on Tinder, Ashley Madison, and have even considered escorts. Not much luck with any (can’t justify spending $300+ on an escort and haven’t found anyone I’m very attracted to on apps).\n\nSo my next option: I live in a University town and am thinking of going out for beers on the weekend in an attempt to meet someone and perhaps have such an encounter. \n\nThe issue is that when I tell my wife I want have a night out (not mentioning my motives because I’m not sure how she’d react to me straight-up telling her what’s up), I know she’ll want to get a sitter and come with me for a night out.

It was really sad for all of us, especially since we had spent a lot of time with them in the last couple years (before the split) in organizing their weddings.\n\nFlash forward to now and I still don't know what happened to make them never want to see their parents again. This issue bothers me a lot because of the unknown nature and I frequently have dreams about them and how much they supported me.\n\nI miss them and I don't know whether to be sympathetic to their parents or not because no one will tell me what happened. Before, they were keeping things tight-lipped and only the twins' parents and brother knew why they had blocked them out. But now a couple years later people (my parents, my other aunts and uncles, my older cousins) are starting to find out. \n\nMy older brother(M30) knows but he won't tell me. He says I should mind my own business and stop asking questions because it's the family's private situation. But to me it's not private, we were raised as one big family and told to hold on to each other so why does that end now? They were like sisters to me but I still have to be left out in the cold? \n\nSo AITA for trying to find out why? Can someone explain to me why I don't get to know?

      "description": "So there is a girl that I've been into for a while, and it seemed like she liked me back, I was considering asking her on a date this week.\n\nAlso this week, I bought a condom from a friend of mine that I'll call Flynn. I didn't really do it for any reason besides the fact that he was selling it, and that I figured it would be useful at some point in the future. I wasn't planning on banging the girl any time soon.\n\nDespite telling me that he wouldn't, Flynn told another friend of mine (who I'll call James) that I had done this, and then James went and told the girl I'm into that I had done this.\n\nNow previously, I'd thought of this girl as being really nice and genuine, but I'm seeing a whole new side of her. She went with a friend of hers to confront Flynn and ask if it was true and if I’d bought it with the intention of using it on her, and he denied it but they saw through it. This is where things get strange – instead of being grossed out or infuriated, they apparently started giggling and making jokes about her innocence being taken. And the girl that I'm into said, in reference to me: \"I didn't realize we were this serious.\"\n\nSo then, during lunch break, before I knew this had happened, I noticed everybody pretty much avoiding me. Then all of the sudden, one of the girl's other friends just said \"[Girl’s name] doesn't like you, just so you know.\"\n\nSo after school, I confronted the girl that I like and we agreed to text about what is going on. When I talked to her in person, she was smiling shyly and looking down, which was just as confusing. I couldn't tell if she was amused, or flirty, or what.\n\nShe told me over texts that she had been told about the condom, but she never outright asked me if it was true or not (so I didn't lie to her). She also acknowledged that she had sent her friend to tell me that she doesn't like me. But now I'm starting to wonder if she just did that to test me.\n\nAnyway, I'm really confused, and everyone in the school is either feeling bad for me or disgusted by me. I don't know what do to from here.\n\nTLDR: I bought a condom, and the girl that I like thinks that I did it because I plan on having sex with her, and she seems to be playing me with mixed signals. I don't how to proceed from here. Does it seem like she might like me? And did I do wrong? I'm really confused.",

      "title": "AITA for having my girlfriend of 5 years break up with me?",
      "description": "It all started 5 years ago when I would stream for fun. We chatted online and talked for a long time and hit it off. We became super good friends and would text everyday and that eventually turned into a relationship. At the time she was working and not in college and I was in the middle of careers. After being together for 1 year we were able to move in together where I live (Different state), she was living in LA beforehand. I we were here for about 1 year, she took a community college course and worked some while I was still finding a job. When I found one in LA I was able to move down into a house where some other of the same employee's lived (kind of like a dorm). She moved back with her parents and continued schooling. It became an online relationship somewhat as our schedules did not meet that well and neither of us had cars to easily get to eachother. We texted a lot during the day about what we are doing and always looked forward to the future. This continued for around 3 years, we were able to meet during breaks and sometimes have 1 whole month of living together. I actually have messaged \"Goodmorning love\" or something along those lines alongside \"Goodnight love\" for over 4 years. 3 Months ago my career took a big turn, we still talked and got to meet occasionally and definitely were still in love, but I was not sure if I was going to be able to stay within LA. 1.5 months ago I had to move away, she was there the final week with me during this time. I told her I am going to do everything I can to make myself successful, she only had 1-2 years left in school and we would finally get rid of this online relationship. I messaged a lot about what I was doing and would sometimes ask about her. On december 14th she messaged saying how she loved me and misses me so much, she woke up at 4am and could not sleep, she wished to cuddle me and feel safe because she really enjoyed being with me. By december 18th she was messaging less and less, and told me that she was depressed and starting to ask me questions like \"Don't you ever wonder if we were not together?, if we would be more successful?\" I am a pretty analytical person and said no i dont have those thoughts because it's impossible to know, but i definitely am happy I am with her. I would say goodmorning love, goodnight love, every day (for years as i mentioned), she did too. She stopped at december 18th completely. She would say \"morning\". I would tell her I want to help her feel better, I wish I could hug and kiss her to make her feel better. She enjoys messages about what I am currently doing. I would send pictures too because she liked that too. She would never respond really, I would ask how she was and said \"the same, i am tired.\", she said \"I am tired of everything. I don't want to do anything in life.\" I told her we are both in bad places right now but let's stick through it and get through this. Love her miss her etc. Send some pics of myself, tell her hey you were going to the gym not long ago and you stopped, I bet it would make you feel better! This was basically the story up until yesterday. Last week she said she wanted to break up over a message. I said hey let's talk about this, we have had low low's before but always came out of it. We have been together very long and message every day for years and I believe we can make it better. She in the past has always talked about wanting to talk via phone / comms. I would agree but never get around to it. Not that I would put it off, in fact if she ever asked I would of said yes! But she never, ever did. I would need to be the one to ask, if I did not ask then no call happened. She would get upset at me for not calling. I say hey let's not make rash decisions, less than one month ago you said you loved me so much and you said you have depression right now. I want to help. She said she didn't want to hold me back from anything in life and said goodbye. I messaged the next day asking for a phone call because 5 years of relationship ended over a message did not sit well. And what she said was not true, I worked hard to make it so we would have a bright future together. She said that from my constant messages about wanting to call and I am confused that I was pissing her off and she wanted time to think. I said okay and left one final message because I just wanted to let her know that her thoughts of me being held back were wrong, that we have been through rough times, and that I know I could of been a better boyfriend by giving her those calls and was willing to do it now more than ever. It was the biggest time where I was like holy shit I love her lots and this is happening. I believed it would be okay. She replied back 2 days later after those thoughts saying she is done. In my messaged I actually said not 5 years and she pointed that out which seems that she was offended. (I said 4+ years). She said I \"had 5 years\" and that \"she is tired\", that I \"had my chance but it's over\", and \"in the future maybe we will meet again, but right now I am not willing to try again with you\", alongside an sorry and don't message me for a while. I was shocked.. how did this happen so fast? I pleaded for a phone call because I was confused, she made it seem that the past 5 years were hell. I had many great times with her but from that final message it made it seem that I messed up. After some pleading about asking for the call, and some back and forth about how she said I talked about myself when messaging her and not asking about her. (I thought she just enjoyed listening about what I am doing because she asked me to tell her...) She eventually said to completely stop before she blocks me and that me messaging more would ruin any tiny chance of the future. I am still young and immature but this was really hard on me. I will continue trying to be successful in my life but this was my first really long relationship and I didn't expect less than a month ago that I would be here today. I could of done better but I felt I wasn't the worst and we both could of made it work. I honestly don't know what advice I am asking for here, I feel very lost and confused. I won't be the type of guy who comes crawling back in a week, I know how she is and what is done is done. I just have very recent memories of her and it was wonderful and so recent, I don't know how things turned so quick.\n\n\n\njust scrolling through some of past messages in december there were messages about how she appreciated me sending messages and pictures during her hard time, and that she wont respond sometimes not because she doesnt want to but doesnt have the energy to. She also said that she was planning to get rid of the people in her life that won't help her grow as a person and wasn't afraid to cut ties with anyone (including me) to do so. And that she appreciated me trying to help her through her rough time and she hopes I continue to do so. And at the end that she hopes that I can continue being in her life and helping her grow.... I just don't understand how it got to this point still.",

      "description": "So recently my entire friend group has been extremely stressed with our lives, and it has definitely taken a toll on us. The stress will be alleviated once this academic year is over, but we're all trying to keep it together and still be good people. \n\nExcept for Friend 1.\n\nI won't lie our relationship has been a little strained ever since we had dated like 2 years ago, but before the stress began everything was dandy. Well sadly ever since it did begin it has devolved into us just kinda making fun of eachother, all in good fun though. But that made me sad since we used to be able to talk to eachother about really serious and personal stuff, and now we could not. So I began to try to fix our relationship by generally just being nicer and more caring, on top of all my stress that I am barely handling.\n\nCut to last night, we're all hanging out together, having a fun time. I particularly had a pretty intense day with an all nighter the night before for a research project that had been my life for almost an entire year. So I was in an odd mood at the time. Well regardless, she pulls me to the side away from the group and starts berating me about how if she \"wanted our relationship to be better, she would fix it.\" And how I \"must think she is childish and can't handle herself\" since I've been trying to also alleviate the stress of her research by doing small errands for her. So I cut her off, said I didn't really want to hear anymore for the sake of our relationship, and said she was being a bitch.\n\nI was honestly shocked the words left my mouth because I've never been one to call anyone a bad name in a serious tone, but I was just so frustrated. I felt dumb for adding to my stress and going out of my way to help her if it was gonna end in this way. I feel bad because she looked pretty hurt, but I don't really want to apologize because I feel like I haven't done much wrong. However the girls in the group think it was a bit much to use that language since Friend 1 is pretty sensitive to stuff like that.\n\nSo am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Due to family issues with my (19M) parents, I'm living with my grandpa (62?M) who's let me stay with him until I start an employment assistance program and find a home.\n\nI've stayed with him for three months, and while I can't pay rent, I help him out with chores, cooking, etc.. However, in the past month he's been super paranoid and pessimistic about everything and it's REALLY affecting what I can do with my life because it's at a point where it's affecting his sleep, and I can't do ANYTHING since he sleeps in the day and works the night shift. Typing or watching videos, sitting down, grabbing food, even going to the washroom wakes him up.\n\nIt's worse that he refuses to accept the fact that apartment staff know I'm there, and his lease has no issues with me being with him. He wants me to constantly stay in \"in case someone finds out\", he's jumpy about letting me get a key cut because of this, meaning I have to fight through lengthily bus routes unexpectedly if he gets called to work while I'm out, and has even started whispering to me that he thinks someone's putting their ear against the door.\n\nOn Thursday, he went to work again, and was so tired that he fainted on shift. When he got back home after a checkup with paramedics, we went to bed and went to the clinic yesterday to make an appointment. However, this morning he woke me up to say he's not going because he's too scared the doctor will tell him he can't work again, and cause him to lose his apartment. I've already tried getting him to go about a full week beforehand, and he was denying help then.\n\nSo when he asked me what *I* was going to tell his boss that he didn't go to the doctor, I just couldn't take it any more. I told him that's *his* responsibility, and he shouldn't expect me to do things for him when he won't get the help he needs. I said that I needed to go out to calm down, but he said that he wanted me to stay since he's scared that something might happen to him while I'm out, to which I said maybe he wouldn't worry about that if he had seen the doctor, and by asking me to stay he expects me to do something and nothing at the same time. He then said to *call an ambulance* if I was going out, and I said he didn't need one, and he just needed to see a doctor to help him with his sleep issues, that he more than likely would be able to keep working his drive-thru till and that he can reschedule his appointment.\n\nI ***hate*** getting frustrated him like this because I want to help him and I care for him, but at the same time I  ***hate*** him talking about nothing but how he's going to be evicted, is going to lose the unit, find himself alone, and how I'm also going to be homeless when things are more likely than not going to work themselves out. I also ***hate*** being expected to stay with him if I can't do anything requiring movement. Am I the asshole for getting frustrated with him today?",

      "title": "AITA for talking to my friend's \"ex\" despite her warnings and consequently ruining our friendship over it?",
      "description": "I met this friend online 2 years ago, hit it off immediately like we were long lost sisters, I love her but we're the same person almost down to a T, both dealing with mental health issues as well as physical. We naturally bonded and talked almost everyday, got into a huge fight where I was admittedly the asshole for blowing up on her and a mutual friend, eventually we made up and last year we started talking again. My friend (who I'll call A for convenience) sometimes mentioned a guy, but we didn't talk about that too much since she's really reserved about her personal life, which I understand, but sometimes get a bit offended with since I'm super open about my personal problems (like I'm being now I guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day her ex hit me up on twitter. I'd tweeted something about MBTI and he loves that thing so we talked the entire night about that. I mentioned her bc she also liked MBTI and he said he should send her his regards since they hadn't talked in a while and that he missed her, and I didn't think much of it (this will be relevant later). It appeared to me he was a bit flirty and I have to admit he ticked some of my boxes - he's incredibly well-spoken (which at my age is rare) and has a weird sense of humor, a bit of dad jokes mixed in with dark humor, not to mention liking some of my favorite movies and anime. It was a pleasant night of talking, nothing happened because I had an idea there'd been something going on between him and A and didn't want to stick my foot in that. Also I wasn't so incredibly attracted to him that I'd risk a friendship over that (well, guess what!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was a bit conflicted and told our mutual friend that T (her ex) had hit me up and that I'd enjoyed talking to him. I asked if  I should tell A, since I didn't want to go behind her back, especially since we were on good terms now. My friend said I should say something just to get it off my mind, so I did. A has the weirdest reaction ever, like she was clapping at a really elaborate comedy shtick which just left me kind of dumbfounded. She laughed super hard about it and I decided to play along, told her that we didn't talk about much of anything. A asked if I'd mentioned her. I said yes, because of MBTI, and said he'd told me he missed her and was going to hit her up. She said that wasn't possible, since she'd blocked him a year ago... I just thought that was weird and didn't think much of it, but she kept talking about how manipulative he was and how he was such a disgusting person who ruined her life and manipulated her for years to his benefit. I was starting to lean toward him being an asshole. But then I kept talking to him and he was always super nice to me; a superficial kind of nice, but nice nonetheless. From a rational point of view, he hadn't done anything to me, so why should I hate him? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe kept talking but not for long. I guess the combination of A talking shit about him with me and him being aware that we knew each other and we talked made for a weird atmosphere. I don't regret it much, but I like being on good terms with people. We didn't stop talking because of what A said about him, just there wasn't much interest on my part (he kept replying to my instagram stories and complimenting me, so I guess he was a bit attracted but I can't say for sure). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, A was never open about what happened between them, despite my insistence. I insist because I don't want to hate someone just from what my friends say; while I understand sometimes they are right to be mad, I also think there are always two sides to the story, and so I'm usually skeptical, even when they tell me the whole story. I hate being unfair to people just because someone pretty much ordered me to, which is kind of what happened. She started to become increasingly paranoid about me and him, asking if we were talking much and what we were talking about. A bit of backstory: T and A had known each other for some 4 years I think and they dated for two weeks. They never met in real life, he was an asshole to her, pretty much manipulating a naive girl into sending him nudes and being there for him while he went around flirting with other girls. I KNOW he was shitty, which is why I didn't want to get very involved with him, but I also didn't want to be outright a bitch (or a white knight I guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo one day T says \"hey we need to talk\", and I get a bit scared. He says I probably know that it's about A. He tells me he tried to talk to her, which I know because she showed me: he was super casual saying he missed her and she basically told him to fuck off and that she never wants him in her life again, saying how after they broke up he'd hit on her best friend and now he was doing the same thing to me just to get to her. Well, I don't want to be the one to say it but IT DID GET TO HER. I sent a print of the \"hey we need to talk\" bit to the group chat I had with A and our mutual friend. I had stuff to do so didn't deliver (also bc I was nervous about A's reaction since he'd pretty much trash talked her to me after the initial message). A asked \"where's the rest? can you send the prints?\" and I kept postponing it until she lost it and pretty much bullied me into showing her the convo. I said I didn't want to because it was going to hurt her, and she said she had the right to be hurt. I almost had a panic attack bc she wouldn't stop blowing up my phone. Before you say it, yes I know I messed up here and it was natural that she wanted to see the prints, but I told her what he'd said in them (albeit in a much nicer way since T was really a bitch to her). She wouldn't stop pressuring me to give her the damn convo, so I said fuck it, if you want to let your ex who you dated for 2 weeks affect you this much then be my fucking guest. Btw I tried to defend her in the prints, saying I understood why she blocked him and didn't want to talk to him. I wasn't SUPER WHITE KNIGHTE-Y about it, because I wanted to hear his side. Yes, the side of an abuser, I know I know. So after she saw the prints she said she didn't want to talk to me again about T or anything for a while and left the group chat. I didn't go after her, but I went into a panic that night, talking to my best friends trying to understand what exactly had happened. She usually insisted I show her my convos with him, meanwhile I never showed him any convos with her... Because he just didn't care. Now if you ask me, A has a great boyfriend now so I really don't understand how this affects her so much. I've also never had a boyfriend, but I have talked to my share of almost-boyfriends online, so I know how to spot a manipulative asshole and cut them right off. A didn't and she suffered for it. I suffered the first time, then I learned to get over it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo sum up, A tried to talk to me again for a while, but I accidentally mentioned his name twice and she said she couldn't do it anymore so she left mid-conversation. I think she overreacted a lot, especially for someone who seemed to be so close to me. Btw I haven't talked to T since November when all of this stuff happened. Now I know how much of an asshole he is, but only because another friend who knew him told me since she wouldn't open up about it. A wished me a merry xmas to which I replied \"merry xmas to you too, but when are you going to reply to me?\". Took her some 10 days to reiterate that she was offended and couldn't understand how I could do that to her, and that maybe we really weren't compatible after all. She might be right...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, reddit, am I the asshole for not taking her at her word and talking to him regardless? (Or also, am I the asshole for taking printscreens and posting them to the group chat? Actually I am, and I know that one, so don't mention it, I've learned my lesson.)",

      "description": "My alcoholic dad and I have been trying to have a relationship again after years of estrangement. This is hard because we live in different states (I'm in Indiana and he's in Pennsylvania). Things have been better for the past 6 months though. He called me first and said he was sober and wanted to work on things and get to know my daughter. He had missed out on my basic courthouse wedding, and felt bad about that. I was receptive and we started having calls on the weekends too.\n\nMy mom also lives in PA in my childhood home with my brother (29) and grandparents. My parents are divorced, but my family has been really great about letting my dad visit me and the baby when I stay with them. I had also checked with my brother and made sure he was comfortable with my dad being around, and he has been. Things were really good between me and my dad. I could tell my dad honestly about how stuff made me feel and he did the same. He was calm and didn't freak out when stuff was bothering him.\n\nAnyway, 2 days ago we had a blow up fight. He had gotten into a fight with my mom Saturday about some tools he left at their house after the divorce. Legally they were hers now (he had 1.5 YEARS to move them and did nothing).\n\nHe was mad at ME because a few days prior he mentioned that he was drinking \"two beers\" at night and I said I didn't know how that made me feel. I think he's lying but I didnt say anything specific. He had been saying that he wasn't really an alcoholic, but that he was a \"drunk\" and had chosen to be drunk, which was a mistake.\n\nAnyway, he told me he wasn't beholden to anyone and was an adult. He said he had the beer because he doesn't like soda and he coffee was keeping him up it was awful living alone with no money and I couldn't judge him for doing what he needed to feel better. He also said we all have our own \"dependencies\" and that clearly mine was I had \"eaten too many huge hamburgers and it was starting to show a lot.\" (I've gained weight since the baby, have PPD and haven't lost the baby weight yet.)\n\nAnd then he said he had no idea why the drinking bothered me so much because it wasn't that bad when I was living with him and I was out of the house all the time. I was also apparently really mouthy and its not like he hit me or anything. It could've been so much worse!\n\nI calmly asked him if he thought it was unreasonable for me to feel nervous about him drinking and he said no at first, but then said again it wasn't any of my business and he was doing what he needed to.\n\nI angrily started to list things that he did and made me feel shitty (he tried to rebut them), and then he brought up that he wasn't at my wedding because I didn't invite him. I told him we needed to stop talking then and we hung up. \n\nI feel like he was just trying to hurt me as much as he could, and possibly because he is hurting too -- but I'm just so tired of trying with him and then getting shit on.",

Someone else was seated at a table nearby and had eaten and left by the time we got our dessert. I wanted to leave after 20 mins of waiting, but my friend insisted on waiting.\n\nWhen we split the bill, my friend put down some tip for the waitress, to which I responded \"why would you tip? That service was awful\", and she looked at me like I was insane. She then explained that she always tips no matter what.\n\nI've worked in the service industry before, and my living was 90% tip. Yeah, it was shitty customers didnt tip, but no ones forcing them to. Where I'm from, service is included in the bill because people are actually paid for their labor by the establishment.

      "description": "So firstly, some back story on our relationship and financial situation: \n\nMy boyfriend and I have a mortgage together along with the normal bills that come along with owning a home. Plus 2 car payments, student loans, etc. You know, the typical bills everyone is overwhelmed with. My boyfriend makes close to 60k a year where I make closer to 35k. Our mortgage is roughly 1800 a month. We have a daughter together and I have 2 other daughters from a previous relationship. Currently, he refuses to get a joint account. I’ve tried to push combining our finances but he refuses at this point. I believe it’s because he distrusts me with money. So he currently pays for the mortgage, car insurance and his phone bill. I pay for everything else. The electric, water, both car payments, internet, Netflix subscription, daycare costs, our mutually shared credit card (that we used to pay for renovations in our home) and any other expense you can think of incurring. I foolishly wracked up over $6000 on a credit card by buying items for our home such as a new mattress and other household items. I can’t remember the last time I purchased something for myself, alone. Everything I purchase benefits all members of the family or is used by the family. I also have an agreement with my ex that I will claim the kids and give him a percentage that matches the amount time that he has the kids, so about 40% of what I received for the two oldest. \n\nNow, I did get a decent amount of money back this year. I was really excited at being able to pay my credit card off and having money left over for savings as it just makes me feel secure having it in there. Well, my boyfriend asked for his half of the return for the children since he provides for them also. So after paying off my credit card and giving him his portion. I now have only $300 in my bank account. Am I wrong for being pissed for having give this to him? Every pay period, I am struggling to keep my head above water with all the bills I pay. I’ve tried talking to him about how I understand he thinks it’s “fair” for us to pay 50/50 of the bills. But I think he struggles to comprehend that I also make nearly half of what he does. I’m constantly scraping by every month and never seem to be able save any money. \n\nAm I the asshole for being disgruntled and pissed off for having to give him half, leaving me with virtually no left over money for my own security?

      "description": "So me and my girlfriend have been dating for just over a year. Let me get out of the way that we love each other to no end, and communication between us is clear and there are no relationship problems that stem from this or any problems causing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe both have a busy day. I balance work as well as college and it takes up a big chunk of my daily life, as well as hers. However I always manage to make at least a little time for my girlfriend in the evening and spend a few hours with her since it is easier for me to visit her than vice versa. We are not independent just yet, so that means when I go visit her I also see her siblings (both of which are pleasant, don't get me wrong).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem lies with how her 3 year old brother gets. Every time I visit, he's either crawled all up on her or between the two of us, and I hardly get time to cuddle or have physical interaction with my SO. It's been this way for a while, and it's starting to annoy me because I don't have a whole lot of time with her, and the time I manage to carve out I spend 2/3 of it with her little brother being the center of attention. I've brought it up to her before and she defends him by saying that he's only 3 and doesn't understand any better. My thinking though is if he doesn't understand any better, why not try to help him understand? Obviously in a way that can be digested easily by a 3 year old. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get it, I genuinely do. I've had a really young sibling before and it's still fresh in my memory how much of a ball of energy they can be. I've had to explain to her (my sibling) what things are acceptable, and what things aren't (in a really simple/rudimentary and most importantly kind way that got across to her, more or less). But it still irks me a little that no action is taken and it's justified by saying he's 3. I just find it a kinda disheartening that I visit my girlfriend to spend time with her but it gets divided between me and someone that already sees her far more often than I do, but at the same time I feel invalidated because he's just a 3 year old and naturally wants to spend time with his sister. AITA, guys?",

      "description": "Okay, note that I was 6/7 when this happened (around 8/9 years ago). First time posting, formatting might be off, sorry. \n\nWhen I was 6, I joined this art studio for traditional Chinese painting, and I loved it. I remember that something happened, and my schedule was messed up, so I had to transfer over to another time slot. It was basically the same. Same teacher, same stuff that you do. Except for one thing: everyone you know is in another class now, so you gotta make new friends.\n\nI was a social kid, so I hit it off with another girl around a year or two older than me. She was nice and took care of me when I just joined the class. Enter the kid. He was around 16/17 years old at that time. I think he had mild autism and tended to have some anger issues.\n\nHe was really good at what we did in class. Like AMAZING. It was like he painted masterpieces every class, stuff like that. The teacher would let him demonstrate. But there was one problem... he liked to pick a kid in the class (he was the oldest excluding the teacher) to bully until the kid either changed time slots or dropped out of the class. The art studio couldn't do anything since the parents would kick up a fuss for discrimination.\n\nI remember that the last target had left that semester (3 months per semester, idk how that worked but it did) and my friend had the bad luck to sit next to him that week, right when he was looking for a new target. Unsurprisingly, he picked her as the new target. Since that week, he would yell insults across the room at her. She was calm enough to not react, but one week I yelled back at him. Like, \"Stop being mean, you stupid\" or something like that. A childish insult, I'll admit, but I didn't know how to insult people back then.\n\nSomehow, that 'insult' set him off, and he literally flipped his chair to walk over and put ink on my art. (With Chinese traditional art, you can't cover any mistake up like you might be able to with watercolour. So this was a big deal for me then). I grabbed my art and hid under the table so he wouldn't get me. Got a warning, nothing else happened.\n\nAfter that, the entire lesson became somewhat of a war zone between me and him. He'd start treating the entire situation like a game, while I was the one getting angry at him. Continued on for a month until I set him off again. (Forgot the details, sorry.) His parents complained, I got kicked out of the class and transferred over to another class which did different things. No more traditional Chinese art for me, I guess.\n\nHonestly, I haven't seen the guy around (or my friend) again since. I still draw at the same place, and still make small talk with my (then) teacher from time to time. He's a nice guy, understood that I was trying to protect my friend then (he was the reason why I was able to continue learning in the studio).\n\nWhen I think about it now, I don't regret protecting my friend from that guy, but I do wish that I'd handled it better.

      "description": "I'm a PhD student. Aside from working on my thesis, I also teach, tutor, grade papers, hold workshops, participate in seminars, attend conferences, meet my supervisor ... All stereotypical grad school stuff. It's deadline-after-deadline.\n\nMy department has a brand new post-doc named Samuel, who came from Scotland. He does research with my supervisor, as well as teach courses on campus --- it's also really busy for post-docs. I showed him around when he first started here, and we became friends quickly, often having lunch together and playing video games on the weekend. Even our research areas are similar.\n\nAround a month ago, Sam told me his graduation is at the beginning of November and he's traveling to Scotland. So he asked me if I can cover three of his lectures while he's traveling. I agreed, assuming that the department would pay me for my time: prep for three lectures can be 6-7 hours of lecture time, which would be probably at least $200.\n\nBut about two weeks ago, some of my impending deadlines started seeming worse: I have two workshops this week and next, and I have to create and submit a final exam by this Thursday. The workshops are for high school students and are about two hours each, and I have to create problem sets with full solutions, in addition to designing \\~3 hours of lectures --- I've been working nonstop on this for two weeks and I'm still not done. And the final exam is for a class I'm teaching, I have to come up with fair problems and then time the exam to make sure it's fair to the students, which takes hours of trial-and-error. TBH I have not had time to even start writing the exam, and it's due for mass printing in four days (the sitting is in two weeks). In fact I'm feeling guilty writing this post because I have to get back to work.\n\nKnowing all this, about two weeks ago I told Sam that I might not be able to cover his lecture. In retrospect, I should have said \"cannot\", but I figured my lack of sleep is less important than his graduation. So I told him to PLEASE look for someone else to cover him, ask EVERYONE he knows (other grad students, other profs teaching the same course, etc), and if he still can't find someone THEN I will do it. Looking back, I think everything I said was just an winded asshole-y way to say \"I can't do it\". He also told me last week that I would not be getting paid, so now it's just a pure favor that I can't afford to do.\n\nBut I told him all this two weeks ago, so I thought it'd be fair notice.\n\nBut he has not been looking for a replacement. He is just banking on me despite what I told him about my schedule. I just got a mass email from him on FRIDAY asking if anyone will cover him --- that's less than a week from the lecture. Why didn't he send this email sooner? And he only sent it to grad students (which is why I got it). There are several profs teaching the same class as him, so it would take less prep time for them because they have already prepared the lessons, but he hasn't asked any of them yet. I think he's been super lazy about trying to find someone despite how I told him I really don't have the time to cover him.\n\nSo now his graduation trip has become *my* problem. I think he should have actually tried to find someone --- especially given what I told him about my schedule --- but on the other hand, I should have just given him a straight \"no\" at the outset. I realize it's too late for me to back out, but I don't know how to tell him to *try harder* *to find a replacement* without being a dick.\n\nAITA?\n\n**tl;dr** *I told my friend I would teach three of his lectures while he travels back home. But I have a lot of deadlines that exact week, so I told him I will only do it if he can't find anyone else. He has not found anyone else, but I don't think he's tried very hard. I'm thinking of backing out because I'm way too busy.*",

I told them then that I was not alright with this and that it would really strain my relationship with both of them. They continued but tried to keep it behind closed doors. Last month my friend told me he wanted to date my sister, I still was uneasy about this but it's their lives and who am I to stop them. My sister and I still both live at home because it's cheaper and last night my friend came over for the first time not to visit me but to just visit her. AITA for being irrationally angry that my friend is coming to my home and visiting my sister and not me? ",

I was going to get my plate sit somewhere else but notice the cafeteria was empty and this table of 6 was near the dish drop off so to save time I decided to stay. \n\nFew minutes later I hear this man saying \"it's not fair having all that space for one.\" He comes over places his bag on the chair next to me and on top of my work bag and sits on the next chair. Two other people join him no one acknowledging me at all. I'm sitting at this table with 3 other people I don't know completely being ignored while they talk about personal issues ( someone they know has a mental disability).

In reality if they would have asked me if they could join me I would have said yes and then been upset with myself and not them but they didn't. \n\nI finished my meal and while I picked up my plate I said:. \" You know usually people ask if someone is sitting there? Or do you you mind if we join you? ...or maybe I wanted to be alone\" \n\nSame man as before: \"then you should have moved!\" Points to the empty tables\n\nMe: \"I was already here, I was already here\" repeating myself since he kept saying the same thing. \n\nMan: \"Go get some manners\" \n\nMe:\" I'll meet you there\" though I don't think he heard me since I was walking away. \n\nI said all this in a calm manner.

      "description": "My classmate's/friend's birthday is today and I have been making her gift for almost a month now. I needed to find some specific things, so it took some time.\n\nFew days ago I was talking to this other girl (I'll call her OG) , also my friend. She told me, that she is planning a huge surprise for the classmate (I'll call her Bday girl). OG told me, that she thought of buying Bday girl balloons, 17 balloons, to be exact. Since it's her 17th birthday. OG said, that the balloons will cost 35 euros and that she and 9 other people already collected the money. She said, that if I also contributed, then the price for each person will be smaller.\n\nI didn't want to do that. I've known Bday girl for several years now, but we are not that close to eachother. We do talk and hang out, but only during school, unlike OG, who spends a lot more time with her.\n\nAnd buying balloons as a gift, especially for a 17 birthday is weird for me. 18- okay, but for 17th birthday I would have thought of something else. Coupon, maybe some several smaller things. \n\nWhen I make gifts, I go for the cheap but simbolic route. I bought a gift, that is like an inside joke. \n\nI also remembered my birthday this year:\nOG forgot and bought me 2 packets of Tic Tacs, and Bday girl completely forgot and didn't get me anything, she didn't even say anything. The next day she brought me a tube of chocolates, even though months before I told her, that I cannot eat chocolate.\n\nWhen it was my bday, they didn't care so much, but now they want me to contribute. I told OG:\n\nOh no, I can't. I still need to buy some candy to put in Bday's girl present.\n\nShe went silent, we continued learning and etc. Last night she sent me several photos of the balloons. She decided that 17 balloons was too much, so she bought a huge number 17 balloons and several smaller ones.\n\nAfter the 1st lesson this older girl was waiting with the balloons, filming the girl. After a minute or so of singing happy birthday, the older girl was naming all of the people, that contributed to the gift - the balloons. The Bday girl laughed, and then had to take the balloons to some other classroom, so she wouldn't have to bring those balloons around school.\n\nI think I already did enough, when I made the simbolic gift. AITA for not contributing to the balloons? ",

      "title": "AITA for being unhappy and upset that an old friend group wants nothing to do with me and labeled me as a bad person?",
      "description": "I used to be friends with three people, and we were pretty close and would all talk or play games almost every day. The friendship wasn’t too long, as it only lasted for about 4 months. \n\nWhile I was friends with them, I was struggling through mental problems like depression and anxiety, and so I was beginning to rely on to them as my main source of happiness once the school year ended (understandably a bad thing), since I didn’t really have any other friends at the time and was having trouble with social anxiety.\n\n Once August  came by, there was an instance where two of them were just talking privately, and due to past experiences, I felt that it was to avoid me since they weren’t responding to me asking if they wanted to play a game or just talk, and responded to everything else being said. I mentioned that to them and they told me it was just something personal, but they were playing something afterward since it wasn’t a long conversation and just decided to stay in their private call instead of moving where me and this other friend could join in. Moving on after that occurrence and September, I started having more thoughts that they secretly hated being around me and didn’t actually appreciate my company, and were doing it just out of pity or something. This gave me a lot of anxiety, especially since I kept repeating a problem like back in August where I thought they just wanted to avoid and get rid of me.  Eventually it got to the point where they did in fact want space away from me, and yet I still joined their lobby in game and asked what was happening, and if they just wanted to get rid of me or something. Eventually it caused one of these friends to feel like I was just directing it all on her, since I began specifically making my messages toward her out of anxiety because they went silent. This made her really upset since she usually goes quiet to calm herself down and not say anything she might regret, \n\nA day later, I talked to her and the other friends about it and she was very angry at me for what I kept doing and repeating. I tried saying that I was sorry and not trying to do it on purpose, and they were all aware of me being really depressed and having some other troubles. Eventually the conversation spiraled into her saying something about wanting to be friends, and wanting to be someone I can rely on if I need them, but I need to stop causing her and the rest of them feel like they are being controlled by me and that I need to stop doing that. Afterward i don’t remember what I said, but I remember something the lines of I don’t know what to do and that I’m just sorry about everything I kept doing, I just don’t know how to stop feeling like that and repeating it. She started crying during the call after what I said and left it for the rest of the night. \n\nA day later, I notice she made her own discord server and the other two friends were in it. I found it on social media since I thought it was just something interesting so I joined it. I was kicked out a bit later and messaged her and the other friends what exactly was going on. I was under a lot of stress and worry that this was all going to be a repeat of the past and what I kept being scared of happening, which was them getting rid of me. She never replied to the message or call I tried sending, and the other two friends just basically told me they don’t know. As more and more time went on, more problems arose between me and the other two friends since I kept talking to them for support throughout my confusion, and getting upset and asking too much from them. \n\nOne day, the conversation I had between one of the friends led to him telling me he was taking screenshots of all of our conversations throughout each week, showing them to her and the other friend. A bit later, things spiraled down and he got upset and cried because he felt attacked due to me using bolding, caps lock, etc. to kind of show my surprise and confusion as to why he would be doing that. A little later I got a long message from her saying that I’m being unempathetic to all of them and that she wants me to no longer talk to her at all. I asked if I can respond and was told it would be just a waste of time, but I tried saying I’m sorry anyway. The next several days felt awful for me, and I kept talking to the other two friends as well as other people for help. I eventually came up with sending an apology letter and gift despite being told in her long message that an apology was “way overdue.” I asked if she got it the same night and all I got was a thumbs up emoji. \n\nAnother week or so passed, and during the amount of time I spent seeking support and advice on what was going on, I was given the suggestion and idea to try calling her just for closure on it all and apologize or something. I tried doing that, and I kept saying “hello?” Because no one was responding. Eventually they hung up and I got an angry message from one of the friends asking why and if I was trying to call her. Later that day I noticed she left my discord server, as well as another one of the friends in our circle. I messaged her what happened and why this was going on, why apologizing didn’t matter and that I just don’t understand. I got blocked from every social media and removed from them. She got forced out of my class we shared at school for the semester, and I was forced to do it for the second semester so she could have the teacher for the second half of the year. \n\nOver the course of all of that I had looked for help and support for my anxiety and problems, and I’ve made newer friends and became an overall less anxious and clingy person, but still get uncomfortable knowing that if I see them, I cannot contact them at all or think of them as a close friend anymore. They’ve also been rude when I did try contacting them those times, and one of the other friends blocked me as well since they kept insulting me when i tried messaging them about it all and I decided to insult them back, and so I got blocked as well. The third friend understands what I’m going through and knows I’m sorry, but said he’s just staying away for his own past experiences and in case of this happening again, since it was a huge negative impact on him.\n\n So... AITA in this whole situation?",

She left the bed in the middle of the night to go sleep on the other room because apparently I fart in my sleep. I would understand if not for the fact that the previous night she peed in the bed and I stayed. It wasn't a little bit of pee either, her underwear was soaked. I'm sorry if this is a litgle bit too much information but I'm genuinely mad. She also has quite the princess complex and I've actually had quite enough of it. Thanks for listening to my thoughts. ",

      "description": "So, me [19F] and my boyfriend [22M] have been together for a year. He broke up with his ex-gf [21F] a little over a year ago. At first, the ex and I didn’t get along. Like, at all. I recently made things right with her (about a month ago). And I found out she was going to a con that I was also going to. So I said, “Hey, let’s hang out.” At this point, I didn’t think my bf would be coming. But he decided to come, and I didn’t tell her because I was afraid of what she’d say. Their relationship was super toxic, and emotionally manipulative on her part. So she found out this morning, and messaged me in a panic about him coming. I told her I would keep them apart (why I have to babysit and mediate between two grown adults is beyond me), and it seemed to calm her down a little. But she hasn’t responded to my last text. On top of that, my bf has been mad at me and in a funk all day about this. I don’t feel like it’s my fault? Like he was fine with going, KNOWING she was gonna be there until she found out. Then he 180’d. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna ruin my relationship, but I don’t wanna ruin this con for the ex. It’s her last one here before she moves and I just... want her to have fun. But I also want my bf to come, and to hang out with both of them. Am I the asshole for thinking it would be okay? Am I forcing him to be in a space with an emotionally abusive ex? ",

      "description": "I know how the title sounds, so here's the deal. My friend says that I need to get off of my high horse. I like to go to the public library in my city to check out books and also do some work in their computer area. As is the case with many libraries in urban areas, there are a ton of homeless people there who come to spend time and take shelter.\n\nNow, I understand why they come there. It's one of the only places (maybe the only place) besides a shelter where they are allowed to come in, get warm, be treated civilly. And the library allows it, so as long as they're not being disruptive there's a mutual understanding. \n\nHowever I find that I just do not like being around so many of them. I know this makes me sound like a sheltered, elitist asshole. But I'll be sitting there and actually will have to cover my nose because someone sitting next to me smells so bad. Someone a little ways in front of me is watching porn in full view. Someone a few seats down is constantly making noise. It's just not a conducive atmosphere for working/relaxing/studying. \n\nI am fully aware that I have the choice to go elsewhere, like coffee shops or home, to do my work. And I understand that it would be very unfair of me to expect the library to not allow homeless people to come. That is their prerogative and I get that the library can be a sanctuary of sorts for the homeless. But, it turns into the opposite of a sanctuary for others.\n\nI made the mistake of casually commenting to my friend about the number of homeless at given times of the day at this library and she got very offended and said I was being elitist and needed to show empathy. I explained that I do have empathy for the plight of the homeless, and that I don't expect them to be banished from the library, but I simply **do not** want to be in that atmosphere. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Last one was deemed shit-post, lemme start over.\n\nI walked in on my boyfriend of 6 weeks in bed with another woman Friday morning. He kept apologizing, trying to offer an explanation, wanting to hear the whole story,claiming she was just his ride to work the next day since his jeep is broken (which is true) etc. Followed by gaslighting for making me question his intentions. I blocked him, everywhere. Obviously there wasn't much more to it I needed to hear.\n\nI believe his actions, regardless of intent or what actually happened, was influenced by heavy drinking the night before. I drove him to the bar MYSELF before going to work (I work graveyard shift in a hospital lab). He was meeting a friend to watch hockey, he claims this girl was his friend's daughter (so they know each other) who drove him home because he was too drunk. The next morning I saw them lying next to each other. In hindsight, this may be the second time, the first on Christmas Eve, a woman walked out the back door when I got home from work, although banter between he and his roommate the next morning suggested it was his roommate's hook-up. In this instance, I asked him who she was when I found him in bed naked, he said he didn't know and \"I always sleep naked\"...did they both fuck this girl?? That's gross. Anyway, I didn't see whose room she walked from. I think something happened christmas eve as well, he just didn't remember. He once told me the morning after sleeping with me \"i don't remember anything, I just know I had sex\". Gross.. layers of gross...\n\nI don't know how he thought I would take it or if he even knew what he would be waking up to the next morning, either way I was pretty upset. One of them could have easily taken the couch, so he either cheated, intended to cheat, or was too fucked up to make any rational decisions and know what he was doing.\n\nThe time we were together, he would get into beer and liquor from getting home from work until passing out. He went to bed with vodka and lemonade at the bedside. He drinks and drives constantly (even with me in the car, which I voiced as an issue) and goes through pints of whiskey in no time. Now it has ended the relationship and I am tempted to tell his father, whom I have only met once and who I was told to say nothing to about his drinking and gambling. \n\nI want to forgive him and move on. Besides, even after \"I love yous\", and me practically living with him the time we were together (which makes it even weirder he let me witness that) I want to move on. However I am worried it will be viewed as prying, petty, or my intention would seem misguided.\n\nTl;dr should I tell cheating ex's father about his alcohol abuse, or would it seem petty?",

I asked if he washed his hands and he said “no need”. In front of the hostess I very loudly said “you have been at work all day delivering mail, petting dogs, and pissing and you don’t see a NEED to wash your hands?!”\nHe was very embarrassed and pretty pissed at me the remainder of the night/week.\nSo AITA for thinking people should wash their hands?",

      "description": "I live in the dorms at ASU and my roommate is someone from my high school, we were never really friends but over summer I started inviting him to parties and shiz like that to get to know him before moving in together. Once we finally moved in together there turned out to be a girl on out floor who also went to our school, I had never met her before but my roommate was pretty tight with her. By pretty tight with her I mean that he had asked her on multiple dates before and even though things didn't end up working out they stayed close friends. After he introduced us we started hanging out a lot more often with each other and fast forward 3 months I ask her out. I never told my roommate anything about this cause I didn't want him to be upset especially if it wasn't a sure thing yet. He eventually found out I was gonna be going out with her because a mutual friend told him. He then stopped hanging out with everyone who was related to the group. If it were someone I was close friends with I never would have asked the girl but I don't even like the kid and I personally don't know what the rule is for roommates. Do they follow friend rules? Acquaintance rules? If I'm not friends with him is it anarchy? Who knows? What I do know is I am officially Mr. Steal your girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome Fast Facts to help my judgement;\n\n1. His \"date\" was about 9 months before I asked out the girl.\n2. The two of them never even kissed\n3. I never bring her over to the dorm when he is here because I don't want to shove it in his face\n4. Maybe we're quick to judge but we think he may just be using her for a beard, (He's kissed 14 dudes, which good for him but also that's a lot of dudes for only kissing 6 chicks or at least that's what he told us when we were playing hot seat)",

      "description": "Very long story short, neither of us have jobs right now. We are staying with friends in a new area who are letting us get on our feet and comfortable with the area. \nWe are making moves to get our shit together and be productive. I just got my ID yesterday and we are earnestly looking for jobs. \n\nWe regularly talk about our plans to save up, move out, and finally get married and that makes me happy. It's something I'm very excited about. We talk about the freedoms we would have and the comfort. \n\nEarlier today, she asked if I wanted to go through the marriage legal process very soon. I told her that I didn't. Obviously, she asked me why and I told her that money was an issue and that I wanted to wait until we were situated on our own. \n\n\"It's not expensive,\" she told me, \"It's only like 60 bucks.\"\n\nI told her that's pretty expensive for people who don't have jobs or money. \n\nWhen she showed me she had almost $100 in her cash app, I got upset. I didn't ask where she got it from, and I didn't have to. I didn't care about that nearly as much as I cared about the fact that she was seriously asking if I wanted to get married on someone else's dime. I felt like calling her out on that right then and there, but I just shook my head. \n\nSo now I'm wondering, WIBTA if I told her I didn't want to get married with that money, and not just because we weren't situated?",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago and I’m still internally torn whether I was the A-hole. \n\nI was a student in a 3-term post-graduate program with a 20 student class size that shared the same schedule. In my 3rd term, our class got a “new” student. He seemed nice at first and I made friends with him within a few hours. Throughout the day, my friends and I began noticing that he was a little peculiar. For example, he made some very inappropriate jokes that were racist, sexist, and personal in nature. We didn’t confront him about it since we had to be around each other for the next 4 months.\n\nAfter a few days when we were sure that there was something off about him, my friends and I tried to distance ourselves from him. He didn’t really get the hint, so we tried harder while remaining civil. The rest of the class also noticed and was doing the same thing. No one liked working with him on projects because of his personality and frankly, he was not a very good/smart student and couldn’t pull his weight.\n\nFast-forward after a few months of alienation, he gradually became noticeably depressed. No one was ever directly mean to him but the atmosphere could be read from a mile away. He didn’t talk to anyone outside of group projects, ate lunch by himself, and his overall demeanour was just... sad. My friends and I felt guilty that we were avoiding him but also felt it was not our responsibility to use our energy, and frankly, sanity, to help him feel included.\n\nA month before graduation, he stopped coming to school. He didn’t notify the teachers or the program coordinator and we were worried that something had happened to him. A few of us (myself included) tried reaching out to him on social media but he didn’t respond. I found out through a new random mutual friend several months later that he was alive (thank god). It doesn’t seem like he ever finished the program and I have no idea how he is doing now.\n\nI can’t help but feel responsible for his experience, but at the same time he was a terrible person to be around. He never seemed like an inherently bad person. Rather, I believe he just didn’t have a filter and was socially awkward. \n\nSo Reddit... AITA?",

      "description": "(First Reddit post, sorry idk how things work super well)\n\nAITA for stealing the friend of someone who was really nice to me?\n\nOk, I'm new to my school, and my family has just moved to a new town and a new much smaller, P-12 school, with American year level divisions. I've moved schools a couple of times before, so it wasn't very strenuous on me.\n\nThe first day I arrived, this lovely, funny girl (A) immediately tried her best to help integrate me into the class and into the school, including setting up many chances to work in groups of three with her and her best friend (B), including adding me to pre-existing projects. She was really nice, and she really went out of her way to have me hang out with her at lunch and recess, including with her other friends (She doesn't hang out with B at lunch, usually hanging out with her friends in other classes).\n\nI only came to the school about 1 month before the summer/Christmas holidays, and apparently, it's a tradition to have a party during the holidays, and A and B were organizing it together. I said I'd come, and was really enthusiastic about it as soon as I got the invite, but pretty much as soon as I started to hang out with A and her friends, I got really uncomfortable with her friends. They weren't awful; we just really didn't click, and they made 'jokes' that were just edgy for the sake of being edgy, and more jokes that I just didn't find funny. At the same time, I started getting closer to B, and she and I really clicked, and had similar senses of humor and worked pretty well together, both kinda in contrast to me and A.  I began approaching B to hang out with during lunch and recess, and during class to work with. I didn't specifically try to exclude A, but I didn't really specifically try to include her. She started getting mad at B, and I was pretty sure it was because of me, but never confronted it. After B talked to A about it, A started hanging out with us more again, but the way B talks with me vs. how she talks to A is noticeably different, so it felt like we were alienating A a little bit every time we talked together, and she slowly drifted away again.\n\nAbout then, school ended, and I texted with B over the holidays, but still had no texting history with A. The party rolled around, and A didn't end up coming, but I did. When school came back, B and I hang out alone together immediately, and I'm pretty sure at this point, she's only talked to A in a group conversation by our lockers.\n\nIt's really petty and childish, and I don't even know how upset she is about it, and she's got another new kid that she's hanging out with. Every time she said something to B about me or the party, I can't help but feel 4 years younger, like I'm in a petty 6th grade argument, but at the same time, I've had new people come along and become closer friends with my friends than me, so I can't help but feel like shit about it.\n\nTL;DR; I came as a new kid and stole the best friend of a girl who really did the best she could to help me and be friends with me, who never done anything against me.",

      "description": "Okay, so it's my birthday today. I turned 26, I've been over the birthday rush for years now, and I'm pretty simple. If my wife wants to make it special, I just want to be able to do whatever I want within reason, maybe go to a restaurant I want to try or just hang around the house and have a few drinks at night. Time with her and the kid is really all I care about, it doesn't really matter if I receive gifts or anything like that. This last Christmas though, she got me these tickets to a beer tasting at a former job, pretty high end event I guess. It was a pretty cool gift, but it's not something I was like dying to go to. Fancy things like that just aren't really up my alley, but the idea of going and tasting a bunch of different beers didn't necessarily hit me the wrong way, I just couldn't shake the feeling that she was way more excited for it than I was. It kinda felt like something that she wanted to do, but it was my Christmas present.\n\nOh well, I still was cool with going and trying to have fun, and we totally did. I didn't really like any of the beers except for 1 and I ended up sampling it a bunch of times rather than tasting some of the other crazy shit they had there. (everything was aged in liquor barrels so tasted like whiskey, tequila, etc... a strong yuck for me.)\n\nSo my wife let me sleep in today, good start, I got up and had some coffee, lounged around for a bit, then she told me to shave and get ready because she had a surprise for me. Already she's displaying signs of her thinking of herself, as I don't really care to be shaven for a night out or anything, that is solely for her own liking. It was a small thing though and she does it all the time so whatever, moving on.\n\nWe head out to drop my daughter off at my parents' and she starts driving to our destination after we stop for some coffee. We pull into a plaza and she's looking around for the place, then she starts nodding her head when she sees it. I look up and it's a pottery place, a \"paint your own\" pottery place. I am an artsy person....for music. I don't draw, I don't paint, I've never been good at it, I've never really liked it. She starts saying things like \"this is my surprise so you'd better like it\" and \"we can both pick something out and we can paint each other's item\". At this point I'm just trying to fight the \"please don't make me do this\" thoughts and suck it up. I start walking around the store, looking at the different pieces of pottery they have...coffee cups, mugs, salt and pepper shakers, figurines. I just couldn't. I really didn't want to tell my wife, I'm clenching my coffee cup in both hands because I know I don't want to do this for the next couple hours, and I don't have the slightest idea how to tell her.\n\nSo finally she gets the hint that I'm not over-excited like she is and asks me what's wrong. I say, \"Babe, I love you so much. I feel like this is something we would be doing for your birthday...\" which in all fairness is 100% true. This just felt like something she wanted to do. Maybe she really did think that I would enjoy something like that, but I'm literally looking around the store and it's nothing but women and kids and the one guy that was in there with us was there with his own wife and kid and they were clearly there for their child.\n\nShe gets kinda somber and we walk out of the store towards the car. Cue the tears. She starts bawling, extremely upset that I didn't want to do it. I just don't even know what I'm supposed to say to her. Slowly over the years it feels like my birthday is just her second birthday and that it's all about her. She just kept saying \"that really hurt my feelings\" and \"I was so excited for this but I guess you just don't want to do it\" all really teary and angrily.\n\nI honestly feel so fucking horrible that I made her upset, I hate to see her cry, it breaks my heart so much. At the same time, I feel super disrespected and like my special day was never supposed to be special for me.\n\nWe had made plans to go out to a fancy pizza joint I've wanted to try for a while, but I really just didn't even want to go anywhere if she's just gonna be upset all night, so we went home so our daughter could nap. She said she's gonna run out to get some alcohol and to get me something, so now I'm just sitting in our bedroom alone in the dark typing this.  I feel like my day is completely ruined and I'm officially turned off to celebrating my birthday as an adult in the future. I requested this day off from work, but I don't think I'm gonna request my birthday off anymore. I really just want it to be tomorrow already.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So, this happened my senior year of high school.\n\nMy best friend (we'll call her Lura) started dating this sentient dab of sour cream wearing cowboy boots, we'll call him SC. I was very happy for Lura since this is the first time she's ever dated! SC was friends with my boyfriend (now ex) and seemed pretty harmless at first until he started to show his true colors. He would insult Lura's art and call her intrest in anime stupid. Kinda shitty but whatever.\n\nThen, SC started to become very possessive of Lura. So possessive that he would immediately take her to his car after school (which was weird on its own), not letting her hang out with her friends until her mom picks her up.  He would complain if he saw Lura with me or any of her other friends, saying he was being neglected. He wanted to know *everything* about her. Someone had told her a confidential secret, and SC kept pressing about wanting to know. He then guessed that it was about me, which it wasn't, and thought I was transgender because I was one of the few girls at my school to  wear pants year round. \n\nFast forward towards the final few months of our senior year, I had acquired SC's number for some reason and my trust in him had dwindled drastically. I had KIK at the time and his profile popped up on there. My profile was called Altan, the name of one of my characters that is Mongolian. I decided to shoot the piss and contact SC. I acted like I had never met him before to see if I could find out some random things about him. I made up a bs story about living in Mongolia but my dad got a job in the US so we moved there. *He actually bought it.*\n\nWe would continue to chat for a few weeks and I had won his trust I guess. I had asked him if he had a girlfriend because I needed \"dating advice.\" SC told me he had a busty chick with a big ass (Lura) but was also fucking this other girl.\n\n*HE THEN SENT ME NUDES OF HIS SIDE CHICK*\n\nThis was all the evidence I needed. After reverse image searching the picture to make sure it wasnt some random thot, I took screenshots and planned to show Lura at school after discussing it with another friend of mine.\n\nRedemption Day comes. I reveiled the receipts to Lura and, of course, she was devistated. She broke up with him a couple of days later despite him trying to object about it all. Toxic relationships over and I told SC I was Altan. SC was pissed but I felt like I had done the right thing.\n\nSitting back and looking at it now, it's been 4 years, I don't know if it was an asshole move of me or not to initiate the breakup. I didn't trust SC with my best friend at all and I could tell his possessive nature was affecting Lura.\n\nI mean, today she is happily engaged and living her best life. SC had a shotgun wedding with some chick that has more testosterone then he will ever have, but I've never seen him since.\n\nTL;DR: Catfished a possessive and cheating piece of shit that was dating my best friend, they broke up.",

      "description": "I (51F) asked my son (22M) to help me install a laminate floor in my house. He asked a friend of his to help also. I have met this friend (21M), they’ve hung out at my house (my son does not live here but visits often), and generally I like him.  Later my son commented that this friend - who has led something of a sheltered, conservative,  religious existence- thinks that homosexuality is a mental illness. My son’s GF is bisexual and my son clearly disagrees with his friend on this so they just have agreed not to talk about it. Since my son told me this I have sort of concluded that I don’t want this friend in my house any more, to help with the floor or anything else. I am bisexual (my son does not know this) and I also have bipolar disorder (which both my son and his friend both know.) I find his homophobia beyond offensive and equating it to a mental illness makes me really angry. WIBTA for telling my son his friend isn’t welcome in my home? Generally I’m a live and let\nlive kind of person, but this confluence of issues just doesn’t sit well with me at all and at my age I’m just not into pretending to be nice to people whose views I find abhorrent. On the other hand, I doubt this young man has ever been exposed to anything outside of his family’s conservative views. What say you, fair people of Reddit?",

      "description": "Hi Reddit. I'm a regular middle class young professional in the software industry. My wife's brother, who I personally like, has always been a string of mistaken decision after mistaken decision. For example, in the last 5 years that I've known my wife's family, this guy has been a druggie, alcoholic, fake married a stripper, had an illegitimate child with her, moved twice with no job, borrowed money from us instead of selling his expensive TV or Xbox, among other things. Now, I'm no perfect guy, but I've always counted myself as a virtuous person, doing the right thing and playing by the rules. I always viewed my brother in law's life as a very simple result of the poor decisions he has made. Imagine my surprise when he suddenly announces to my wife and his family that he has found a corporate job that makes almost 30k more a year than I do. Now, to be very clear, I am happy for him, honestly. He has a kid now, and even though the marriage is fake, I think he truly wants to do right by his family. My wife has accused me, however, of being jealous of his new success. Well, yes, I am. I'm jealous that someone who does very little right in his life can still come out ahead of me financially, and this entire situation challenges my view that life is about the decisions you make and the product of all of them. I also can't help but feel that my hard work has been deligitimized. So, my wife has called me an asshole over this jealousy.\n\n So Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for quitting a work placement?",
      "description": "So the backstory, I have been unemployed for a while, and have a long record of not being in jobs for very long. The only kind of jobs I can get tend to leave me vulnerable to bullying and feeling outcast and depressed because I can't even do menial tasks very well and get constant criticism from my my supervisors/ managers. Anyway there is a work program thing that helps you find work, and they put me onto an unpaid work placement in a College. I was extremely excited to start, it was initially meant to be a four week placement. The job itself was testing their new application system. I did this to the best of my ability, I drew up an extensive report on the website and all its functions, and gave it to my boss and copied in the developers. I worked hard to get it done quickly and as professionally as I could, and I got positive feedback from the boss. But nothing seemed to come of it. None of my suggestions were taken into account. The Developers are socially awkward in their own right, and I felt were dismissive of me as a tester, and ignored any feedback I gave them. It just felt like busy work and I felt more and more demotivated. Sorry I should say this is long after 4 weeks, those 4 weeks became a month, then two months etc. Eventually he said he would try to create a part time job as a tester. They couldn't just give it to me because of employment laws, but he strongly urged me to apply when it came up. It would take around 6 months from then to create the position.  In the meantime I was still attending the work program place, they have these sort of classes/ lectures that you go to. Some of it is helpful but a lot of it is just nonsense frankly. Anyway I also got kicked off one benefit and put onto another, which means a huge amount of stress and paperwork and the new benefit is notoriously difficult to be on and they make life as hard as possible for you to force you into work. Fair enough but I believe that the kind of jobs they put me in don't last very long anyway, the work program has a better attitude of finding the right thing for me so that I will be able to stick with it. But ironically because of all the bull that goes with being on this new benefit I was struggling to make time for the work placement, and moreover I was getting extremely stressed about my situation. For this reason I contacted my previous job coach about the future of this work placement. She said she'd speak to them then get back to me the next week. She didn't, so I took the excuse to have some time out and wait to hear back. Which I never did.  \nSince then I spoke to my new job coach and asked if it's unusual to do an unpaid job for 6 months, and she told me it isn't, some even go for a year. So I now feel like an asshole, I have basically given up a chance I was given, maybe my only chance to find a job I enjoy at least somewhat.\n\nTL;DR am I the asshole for giving up an unpaid internship/ work experience job that may have led to part time employment?",

      "description": "   My BF of 3 years owns a 15 year old truck and naturally, it has been having mechanical issues. He had already put in a couple thousand dollars into fixing various issues and about a year ago the engine completely broke down. I was told that it requires a completely new engine which would cost about $5k. He hasn’t drove the truck in over a year because he was another newer car that he uses for normal everyday driving. I don’t understand the point of having 2 vehicles either. \n    We are in the process of saving for a down payment on a home and I have mentioned that we scrap the truck and when we’re done saving for the house, we start saving to buy him another truck. However, he won’t let the truck go and every time he brings it up, it really annoys me. Now he’s planning on using his tax refund with the savings he has to get the truck fixed. \n    Another big issue for me is that he recently told me that he and his ex-fiancée had sex in his truck on a number of occasions. Ever since, I just don’t feel comfortable with the truck or being around it. I know that if he gets it fixed that I would not ever sit in it again. I have expressed this to him and he thinks I am overreacting. I have my own car as well, so I don’t need him for rides, but he said he wants me to ride with him in the truck when we go out. \n    All that being said, I feel I may be overstepping for suggesting he get rid of the truck since it seems to hold a lot of sentimental value. Also he would be paying for it with money that he worked for, so I may be out of line for telling him how he should spend it. So AITA for not wanting my BF to sink more money into fixing his truck?

      "description": "So my younger sister by 5 years is getting engaged and it's a small gathering happening in our apartment, now i have been out of the loop for the whole thing, and had to find out from hints, clues and shifting in behavior that she was actually dating someone for a whole year, even after asking my mother full blank that is she seeing someone, and she lied straight to my face that she isnt. My parents met the guy and knew him full well during that year, and i only found out recently well more like they finally admitted it after i saw her riding a motorcycle with him. \n\nTo clarify, i am not mad, i am not furious, it's 100% non of my business and honestly i don't really care about that whole ordeal, but i also don't care to attend, since they clearly don't feel the need to keep me in loop, so why should i attend such a gathering right?\n\nI'm having second thoughts but tell me reddit, will i be the asshole if i ditch this whole thing?

      "description": "I am having a rough time trying to figure out a way to explain my situation without it exposing much of where I work, so I’ll go with the simplest way possible:\n\nI work at a large (LARGE) company. I build expensive things. I work on an “assembly line”, where things are put together in Shop 1, then the thing is moved to Shop 2 for more things, then Shop 3, etc etc.\n\nWell, we can do our jobs in Shop 3 until Shop 2 is done with theirs. Most of the time, the Shop 2 guys will finish their work on time, but they don’t sign it off in the computer system in a timely manner.\n\nThat doesn’t affect us in my group, because we can physically look at the Shop 2 jobs and see if they’re finished, regardless of what the computer says, so we are then able to do our job without delay.\n\nHowever, another group of guys that also do my job (on a different line) apparently wait for the job to be bought off in the computer system first, which is fine, but this leads to them having massive amounts of unfinished work that they have to catch up on on a daily basis.\n\nThose guys got tired of having to look up the prior shops work. So to make it easier on themselves, they want to establish a mandatory work order for Shop 2 to be done before Shop 3 can begin, because this will make all the orders visible on one screen when you look it up in the system.\n\nSo it might make it easier to look up the jobs, yeah. But now it’s mandatory for Shop 2 to buy off their work before we can begin ours. Even if their work is physically finished, we can’t start ours now until the computer system is bought off.\n\nMy team is pissed. Because we are caught up with no issue. But now we have to wait for Shop 2 to sign their work in the system, which means our work will become clogged up and backed up a A TON.\n\nI told the guy who proposed this idea (younger, inexperienced with big company’s, first time as a Lead, etc etc) that he needs to pick his battles. Yes, it seems like the “right thing to do”. There’s always a “right thing to do”. But in a company like this, and in the world in general, there isn’t always gonna be positive outcomes for the “right thing to do”. That’s just not how life works.\n\nBecause now, we gotta wait. And the jobs are stacking up. The Shop 2 guys are a hot mess and can’t sign off their work immediately because of how large and disorganized their shop is. It’ll take forever for any kind of change to take effect in that regard.\n\nSo, the new guy basically fucked over my line for something that’s not our fault and tried to fix something that wasn’t broken. (Well ok, it was broken, but now it’s got a bandaid on it while it’s still got a severed artery).",

It was some joke about the basketball hitting her chest and rupturing her milk duct or something, lol. \n\nThen, after school, Y and I are walking home together (we live across from eachother), and we were talking about our day because we didn’t have any classes together. He’s telling me some funny shit and I’m laughing, then I remembered how much X and I were laughing earlier.\n\nI laughed and told him what she said, cause I thought it was funny.\nBut then Y told X that I told him her joke for some reason, and the next day she got mad at me. \n\nApparently because it was a joke about boobs and because Y was a guy, it was inappropriate for me to tell him, which I didn’t realize. So X was pretty upset with me because I embarrassed her. Anyway, I tried to explain how I just thought it was a funny joke, etc. We got over it eventually. \n\nThen a couple months later, X is telling me she’s upset because some people from our school (younger grade) thought she was dating someone who she wasn’t. \nThen, later that day I saw the people who thought that, and because they’re friendly and nice people, I just told them that X was bothered by the fact that they thought that.\n\nThen one of the people texted X that night and wrote like a paragraph long apology for spreading rumours, apparently I scared her when I was telling her it wasn’t true, which I never meant to do at all. \n\nX was upset because I had told them to stop and that embarrassed her. So she was mad at me again. \n\nWe’ve kinda drifted apart now, but I was wondering if I messed up here. ",

      "description": "Hello!\n\nTo explain as much as I can, my girlfriend’s best friend is going off to the military soon, and was having a get together in their city (about a 5-6 hour drive). So my girlfriend invited me, but I said maybe because I was unsure of whether or not I’d be able to get off of work that day. (This is about a week and a half before the event).\n\nAbout a week before the event, I found someone to take my shift, and told her that I would be able to go. At this point, she had booked a hotel with her mother, father, sister and dogs. From my perspective, I was expecting just the two of us making the trip, as we’d be the only ones attending her friend’s party. \n\nWe’ve been dating for about a year and a half, and I’ve visited her family plenty of times before, but I’m not sure if I am comfortable going on this trip. There is a language barrier between me and her parents, and the sleeping arrangement would require that I sleep alone in the same room as her father. It’s not that I dislike her father, but I don’t know how comfortable I am sharing a room with a man I can’t really communicate with. Especially we’re going to have to care for the dogs while we’re there. \n\nHopefully this gives enough information about the situation, but I am open to answer any questions about the situation. But I ask: Am I the asshole?",

      "description": " Ok so to start off , I have no idea how to make an AITA post. It's 1:00 Am , and I'm sick at home. (This takes place in 2015.) Context: We were both very shy and only communicated with notes for the beginning of our relationship.\n\nAnyway , my ex girlfriend ,whose name I won't reveal,  and I were together for about a year. Everything was great , until the end of the year. She didn't talk to me as much as normal.  She didn't even communicate with me through notes , she sat directly next to me but ignored any of my attempts to talk to her. Confused ,  I tried to ask her friends about it but quickly stopped , remembering that our relationship was supposed to be a secret.  Then  the year ends , I come back not knowing what to expect. We don't sit by each other anymore , and she doesn't sit close enough for me to pass notes to her either. I was too embaressed to ask her , if we were still together she might have thought that I forgot, but I was also scared , that if I asked she might say that we weren't.  I NEEDED to know. So I asked one of her friends if she was dating anyone , and her friend replied no. Even though our relationship was \"Secret\" I assumed the worst. The weirdest part by far was that throughout the following years , (including this one) , she was very polite , friendly , and overall more talkative towards me. She got involved in my friend group , hung out around me more.  She flirts with me often as well , and I had / have no idea how to deal with this. So what did I start doing? I started ignoring her. I intentionally avoid and ignore her and her friend group. (Despite some of her friends / relatives being my close friends.) Am I the asshole for avoiding her?",

      "description": "Full disclosure I’m using a throwaway since I know a few people involved in the fracas are on reddit. \n\n\nSo picture it, Sicily 1943. Actually more like a funeral home in 2018. My sister in law’s father had just passed away and the funeral was two days ago, which is where this story takes place. I didn’t really know the man myself, by me and my SIL are pretty close. \n\n\nThe end of the service is coming up and we all approach the casket in a line before they close it and put it in the hearse to say some final things to the dead and the dead’s immediate family. This is where I do something horrible, but of course I didn’t mean to. And it’s something straight out of a sitcom but of course at the same time you can’t make this shit up. As I’m passing the casket, I feel the urge to sneeze. I can’t really suppress this one as much as I’d like to. So I lift my arm up to cover the sneeze, but it’s not enough. Some of the snot gets on the guy in the casket. \n\n\nAs I’m reaching for the handkerchief I’ve got in my pocket, I feel a hand come up on my shoulder and try to spin me around, hard. The hand went to a guy I’ll call Ramon. Some more background: Ramon is my brother in law, but he’s been very distant from his family. My understanding is he got involved with some bad guys early in his life and he’s just an all around douchebag. Little to no manners, can’t figure out when to shut his mouth, things like that. \n\n\nRamon spins me around (or tries to) and goes “What the hell are you doing, man? Why are you spitting on my dad?” REALLY loudly. Obviously trying to make a scene since it’s painfully obvious by the “ah-choo” sound I made that I sneezed and not spit. I told him this but Ramon was having none of it. He just kept making a big stink about how I was trying to disrespect his dad. \n\n\nI keep trying to let it go, but eventually I just look at the guy and tell him “you know what? Even if I did spit on him, it’d be better than how you ever treat him.” Ramon understandably got a little pissed off at this remark and started throwing fists at me. Out of reflex, I started doing the same and actually got in a couple good hits. After what felt like a long time, the pallbearers and a couple people behind us in line pull us apart and I leave after that. \n\n\nEver since then, the people on my in-law’s side of the family just pretty much cut contact with me, even the sister in law. Am I the asshole for trying to fight this guy back over starting a bunch of bullshit?",

      "description": "around six years ago, i went to a new school and had to make a whole new group of friends. eventually i found one that i got along with extremely well, and we became very close over time. our friendship stayed pretty strong for the next few years, but not without some minor anger every now and then. one of my friends (i'll call her B) didn't treat us too well. when it came to academics, B would slack off while the rest of us put the work in. she wouldn't pull her weight in group projects and she'd copy our homework last minute. socially, she was very arrogant and probably had a superiority complex? B acted like she was above the rest of us and didn't 'need' us, and wouldn't treat us very well (i.e school work problems) and this slowly got worse as time went by\n\ntwo years after we met, B got way worse. the usual stuff continued, like not putting effort into school and leeching off our work and marks, but her attitude got a lot worse. she started trying to replace us because we no longer shared the same interests and would scream and yell at us for being curious about her new interests. i also introduced her to one of my other friends who she instantly latched onto and became closer with him than i had been, and would constantly ignore me to talk to him instead. we once had a big project to do for a fair and we got together to work on it. \n\nshe took part in the 'fun' stuff that didn't take any real effort. when it came to the real work she did ONE part of it, probably the easiest, which ended up being garbage which i had to edit and fix. for the rest of the project she sat next to me texting my friend that i mentioned earlier while i did every single thing for our project. i repeatedly tried to get her to work and she would ignore me or brush me off and tell me she didn't know what to write and to figure it out myself. We ended up not doing very well because B prioritized texting over our marks. this also wasn't the first time she'd done something like that, as she'd worked with our other friends for similar projects before and done the exact same thing. as little work as possible so she could still get the marks for our work.\n\nwhen she got close with the friend from earlier (ill call him P) they got really toxic. the three of us had group chats together, but as they were closer with each other than they had been with me, i was a third wheel almost all the time. they took pleasure in berating me and making me feel bad about myself and would gang up on me and call me names, which in retrospect wasn't terrible, but considering i had issues with controlling my anger at the time and would be set off by very minor things, which they were very aware of, it wasn't nice to deal with. there's also nothing i hate more than being ganged up on because i can't defend myself when they're all making fun of me. they'd also leave me out of things (which i hate as well)\n\nB also had no concern for peoples feelings. when we had to make groups for things and she had to choose some friends over others, she wouldn't even ask if they were okay with her plans. she'd just do it anyways and tell them too bad. she also used to throw things at us when we were hanging out, and generally just treat us badly. literally everyone who knew her during this time period agreed she was not a good person at all. to sum it up, she was increasingly horrible to me and the rest of our friends over these two/three years, and by the end of them, when she got really bad, i decided i didn't want to put up with her anymore and couldn't wait until i went to a different school than her so i didn't have to be around her toxicity anymore. \n\nour friendship continued after this even though i was just faking it and powering through until i never had to see her again, until one day when she just started straight up ignoring me. it was out of nowhere. one day B was talking to me like old times and the next day she wouldn't answer me anywhere even though she was online. i was so confused and kept trying to talk to her but just got completely ghosted and eventually gave up and stopped chasing after her. a while later, a mutual friend who she still spoke to asked why she just cut me off like that, and B said that it was because ***I*** was the horribly rude one and she didn't want to deal with it anymore. this genuinely shocked me because the rudest i'd ever been to her was in self-defense when she was ganging up on me or looking down on us or ditching us for other people, and it was nothing more than joke comebacks like \"you suck/you're a loser\" which we had said to eachother many times before??\n\nB ended our friendship like that four years ago and i still hold a very strong grudge and haven't come close to getting over it. we haven't even spoken since then but every time i remember she exists or what she did to me or how she cut me off i actually get furious because i feel so wronged. there's so much wrong with it. she was the one who treated me so badly (and the rest of our friends as well) and then before i could make the move and end things she flipped it around on me and played the victim and said i was the big bully????\n\n i constantly seek validation from my other friends who knew her as it helps me to stop dwelling on it and everyone agrees she was horrible to me and i didn't do anything nearly as bad as she did. it also makes me angry because she wasn't brave enough to confront me herself and say what she had to say, which points even more at it being a big lie because she knew she was a bad person. i got no closure because i just heard her accusation second-hand, passed down from a friend. i'm a very confrontational person and it makes me so angry that she just got away with that without even having to speak to me and hear what i had to say. \n\nshe's genuinely afraid of me now and i know it's because she lied. she knows how she treated us but hides behind that lie to pretend she's a good person and she can't face me because she knows how badly she handled the situation. the last time we interacted in person i just acted like i didnt know her and she was shaking because she was so nervous.\n\nso yeah again to summarize, my friend B treated me very badly throughout our friendship and when i was finally done with it and planned to end things with her, she turned around and did it to me when she was much worse of a person than i ever felt i was. we weren't even going to the same school at that point so even if she confronted me herself we wouldve never seen eachother again anyways so it's stupid that she wouldn't talk to me directly. its been 4 years and im still so angry about what she did and i just want some kind of closure, and sometimes i just want to knock her out because she's too afraid to fess up and have a real confrontation with me about everything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for still being so angry over it?? was i really the rude one and just didn't know it?? am i terrible for hating her so strongly for just cutting me off and being a wuss about it? most of the people i seek validation or help from are biased because they knew her so i would really like opinions on the whole situation from strangers.\n\n who was really in the wrong?

      "description": "Yes, the title sounds very bad, but I should tell the whole story first. So i’m a senior in high school, and i broke up with my girlfriend a month ago after about 7 months of dating. We had been very good friends before dating, and I was very happy with her. However, I have had anxiety for a couple years, and have been on meds to combat it. However, I had a very bad episode a month ago and simply wasn’t in a good place. We ended having a messy breakup with mistakes from both of us. I wasn’t engaged wit her as much as I should have been and was probably neglecting her emotionally, and she told me to basically get over my anxiety. We haven’t really talked since the breakup, but at our school’s football game last week, we ended up getting in a arguement. We said some things and then with most of the student section listening, she told me to go home and pop pills to deal with my fake anxiety. I was pretty upset and blurted “how my dick taste tho” Our classmates found it very funny, but she started crying. She’s very christian, and she probably was upset that her activities were out to everyone. It’s been a couple days and I kinda feel like i overreacted. Am i the Asshole? ",

      "description": "My boyfriend was recently diagnosed with chronic GERD, esophagitis type D and congenital hiatal hernia. What this means is that he has had a bunch of associated complications such as insomnia from the heart burn and constant throwing up at night. He was given strong medications for his insomnia which also means he is barely coherent when he throws up on himself, the bed and sometimes on me. This used to occur once a month around 3 am and i would clean him up and put him back to sleep. It is now happening every other night and my sleep quality has gone to shit. I am very sensitive to sound and used to sleep with ear plugs. However, I do not want him to choke so now I shoot up with a bucket at every cough or loud gurgling snore. I dont want to resent him but i am tired and exhausted. I have tried making him sleep with a wedge pillow but he does not find it comfortable. He is on medications which have stopped his day time symptoms but not his night time symptoms. I know he can’t help it and I am trying to stay calm because of course I care and dont want something to happen to him. I want to be mad but I also have no right to be mad which sucks because then I have to hold in my frustration. The  worst part is he doesn’t realize how attentive I am when he’s sleeping and has started to say I am overly sensitive or acting different when in reality I am just tired and don’t want to be puked on again. WIBTA if I slept in a different room and just let him throw up on himself? I just want to sleep. ",

      "description": "I know the title sounds horrible but hear me out.\nMy girlfriend of 2 years (maybe ex) was crying to me about a long-standing debt issue she’s had with a credit card company. Since I’ve known her, I’ve been trying to convince her that she needs to either transfer her balance or just let me cut a check and pay that shit off.. because as of now she’s just been making payments to her convenience that does nothing to her balance because interest just keeps stacking on top of the principal balance.\nFinally, she started taking action and decides she will transfer the balance to another creditor for a fee, but now free of interest for 18 months (after months of me nagging that we need to get rid of this issue permanently). \nShe gets denied a few times but finally gets accepted for a certain amount and she is extremely stressed out at this point because she is afraid her credit went down because she applied for the other transfers that she was denied for. So, as she was crying about over FaceTime and telling me all the details about what one of the creditor representatives was telling her, me being slap happy, fucking tired and one who nervously laughs in situations that I’m asked to be very serious in, started busting out in uncontrollable laughter..... \nWas I laughing at her? No. I was just tired and stupid, it was late.. Do I take her seriously? Very. Do I think her situation was funny? No, I’ve taken all the initiative since day one to correct it.\nAnyways, she hung up the call and since refuses to speak to me and it’s been a week. The last thing she said to me was that I hurt her and she doesn’t think I can fix that (over texts, when I tried talking to her a few days after she said she needed her space.)\nI know I was a terrible person for doing that but it was NOT intentional, I couldn’t even have taken it back if I wanted to.. I don’t even know WHY I laughed.. it’s kind of hilarious I’m sure hearing this story...\n\nAITA though?! A week? I’ve texted her multiple times apologizing and called her but she won’t even answer. And she’s acting like this is it for her... I feel like what I did was bad, but not as bad as she’s making it seem..",

We watched the first few episodes together, and I really really liked the show. I am on spring break right now, so the next day, I watched a bunch of episodes without him. I still haven’t told him, but I am about a season ahead and i just can’t turn the show off because it’s just too damn good. I still watch episodes with him whenever he can despite his busy work schedule, but we watch episodes that I have already watched and I pretend to not know what will happen and whatever.

Now four months later...I really have moved on from the situation. However since this occurred at the end of the summer and is now winter break some of our old high school friends have asked me to talk to him. He just reached out to me for the first time in four months to talk today. I know some would say I should meet up with him but at this point I have moved on, and I know that this is not him wanting to talk ,it’s our old friends telling him he should meet with me.

      "description": "Sorry for the click bait-y title, but that pretty much sums it up in a nutshell. Using a throwaway, and sorry in advance for the long ass post.\n\nSo a bit of background - I love my Mom (I really do), and she can be a really good Mom sometimes, but she has a whole load of problems. She's been an on/off alcoholic for most of my life and was addicted to prescription painkillers up until about 2 years ago (she got through that though which I'm really proud of her for). She has mental health problems (not her fault) which are exasperated by the fact we lost my sister 12 years ago this year. It’s been really hard, I’m surprised the family got through it at all to be honest.\n\nSo, I work in tech, and have been in love with Japan since I first went there about 8 years ago. I studied Japanese at school for 5 years and kept it up afterwards, so I'm not awful. I just got back recently from another trip there, and have decided for sure it's where I want to live and work. My fiance is 100% behind me and is pretty excited for this new chapter in our lives.\n\nThe decision to move to Tokyo would be considerably easier if it was just my Mom I was worried about. My Dad is a **fantastic** guy, I know she'll probably be alright. \n\nIt's my younger siblings I'm worried about. I'm the oldest in the \"squad\", but 2 of my sisters are older now too so they'll be alright - it's the younger 3 I'm concerned about. I'm very close to the younger 3 (2 sisters and a brother), and I don't want to sound arrogant but I know they look up to me. One of the sisters suffers from depression, and I’ve been trying to be there for her as much as possible (I suffer from it too so I can relate). But I just can't shake the feeling that if I moved abroad, I'll be deserting them. I would do literally anything for those kids, I love them more than anything. But I want to start this new life in Japan too. No lie, if my Mom and Dad would even entertain the idea, I'd take them with me.\n\nSo reddit, WIBTA if I went to Tokyo?",

      "title": "AITA for being upset that my parents are moving?",
      "description": "For the full context: I graduated from college around two years ago, and have been living with my parents since then. In that time, they've made vague statements about wanting to sell the house and move to a ranch they own in a neighboring state (it's something they've mused about since even before I went to college). I've been considering moving out for the past couple months, so the idea of them moving doesn't bother me that much, but I never put together any official plans since my parents never gave any concrete info about their decision to sell.\n\nThen, near the beginning of this month, my parents let me know that they had the realtor coming by later that day and they wanted me to help clean up the house a bit. I was taken a bit aback, and once I pressed for more info, they let me know that they were going to have the house listed on the market no later than the first of February.\n\nCue me spending the days since scrambling to find friends who are willing to room with me and an apartment that we could afford. And before you ask, I can't move with them, because not only do I have a job, but the ranch they're moving to is in the middle of nowhere, much too far from anywhere I could feasably work.\n\nObviously it's stressing me out, and a few minutes ago I got in an argument with my mom over the whole thing. I feel that their vague hints weren't enough and they should have given me a concrete date to move out by *months* ago (IE; \"We're going to sell the house in February, we want you to move out by the end of January\"), while she feels that they've been hinting at it long enough that I only have myself to blame, and they don't even know when the house will actually sell so I have more than enough time anyways.\n\nSo... yeah, that about sums it up. To be clear, I'm not really upset that they're moving; I'm upset that, in my opinion, they didn't give me enough of a proper heads-up.\n\nStill... AITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway because friend frequents Reddit, hope he doesn't get it's me. Meh, even if he does, I hope he understands. \n\nAlright, the story is really simple - I got interested in this girl who started hanging out with my group from time to time, started texting her. Admittedly, because of my idiotic behaviour, she rejected me. Now, by idiotic, I don't mean I was an asshole, but I was just acting like a little child that has a little crush and doesn't know how to act around girls.\nUnderstandably, got rejected.\n\nNow, after a little while, this girl, following a hangout with the group, started texting my best friend. Being the good guy he is, he told me. Full heartedly, I said I would support him, and that he shouldn't think of me when he makes a decision. And to this day, ask me anytime, I will stand by my words.\n\nBut it hurts so much, man. We didn't even get the chance to get to know each other so well, it should've been easy to get over it. Then why does it hurt when I think of them chatting, meeting each other. I feel it is really childish. It can be attributed to my other problems, like depression, anxiety, inferiority complex, overall being a sensitive guy.\nI wouldn't do anything to jeopardize anything that might be going on between them, it's not my call. \n\nOn a side note, I'm not really sure if there is anything romantic between them. He tells me he doesn't want a relationship for now, and insists that they just became good friends that just chat a lot. He isn't the lying type, I'm sure of it, so it could all be just imagination on my part that went the wrong way.\n\nThe point of my questions is to ask if I am an asshole because I feel jealous of my friend for having contact contact with this girl that I couldn't achieve. Would very much appreciate your criticism and advise. If I am an asshole for feeling this way, what could I do to fix it?",

Normally were pretty relaxed with giving the discounts out, it only saves a few quid on your visit. \n\nThis guy comes in, and I ask if he's a student, to which he replies, \"I've got the card\". Now he shows me the non student side, and I ask \"but are you a student?\". He gives me a uuhhhh and I ask to see the other side of the card, which is very expired. I've never asked for the other side before and no-one else ever has but since it was expired I didn't give him the discount and he got pretty pissed off and gave me a \"seriously dude just give me the discount\" before cutting his losses and paying and going in.

      "description": "This will be a long post, also spell errors\n\nSo me and my girlfriend has a long distance relationship and we see each  other like every other weekend. This last friday I was supposed to hang  out with a couple of friends at home and drink some beers and just talk. Later that evening they say that they are going out to a club near by and I follow them. At this point my girlfriend is hanging out with her  friend which is also my best friends girlfriend, and they are at the  same club that we are suppose to go to. We find out that we are going to  the same club just as I started walking with my friends to the club that they are at\n\nWhen  we get there I am excited to see my girlfriend and im going in for a hug her and kiss her for a bit before I turn around and greet her friend  with a hug, and everything seems fine. We dance for a bit, we go out  and smoke, and talk in the smoking area. And her friend seems genuinely  glad that im there and also that there is no problem with me hanging out  with them. I tell them when I see them that im leaving in 30 minutes  and show them the app showing the time table for the bus\n\nAround  30 minutes later when im supposed to take my jacket and say goodbye, her friend also goes to the wardrobe to pick up her jacket and seems really annoyed. My girlfriend says that im about to leave and that they  will hang out just like before, and dance together. Her friend doenst  listen and picks up her jacket and say that she is going home. We ask  why and she doenst say anything. We tried talking to her and calming her  down and ask whats wrong she doesnt say anything other than that she wonders why we planned this in advance without telling her, but the  thing is that we didnt know the other person was going there before I  was almost there. When we got out of the club it all escalated when she  went from quite annoyed to crazy when she stopped and started screaming  \"why dont you talk to eachother?\" and she sounded so dissapointed\n\nLater, when I asked her boyfriend (who was also angry after) why she was so upset, they started to write that we left her out and didnt talk to her at all, that we ignored her and turned our backs around to ignore her, and also that i made a inappropriate joke. The joke was that she and my girlfriend was supposed to sleep at my girlfriends home, and then I said \"oh, you are stealing my spot in her bed\", AS A JOKE. And she seriously said after, that the joke was inappropriate and that she was really sad  about it. The thing is that both me and my girlfriend thought that nothing was wrong, and her facial expression looked genuinely glad and  normal (no issues) and also that she didnt say anything at the club, she  could have said to my girlfriend that I was being wrong and that she  was upset but she didnt say anything. Now after the event her boyfriend  says that we're suppose to see that she was sad and upset.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I am going to refer to my friend as Sara. We are both 25yo females.\n \nSara and I connected in college and have been best friends for several years. She moved back to her hometown in May 2016 and now lives 10 hours away from me by car but we have kept in steady contact. \n\nSince she moved away, I’ve made the 10 hour drive and visited her twice – in Aug 2017 &amp; Feb 2018 – and I am looking to make a third trip in March 2019, but this time I am planning to fly. Sara has not come to visit me since she moved, but has said that she intends to make the trip sometime so that we are taking turns traveling. However, she has difficulty finding the time/money to travel because her job doesn’t pay much and she has larger familial responsibilities. My life is more stable &amp; my job pays more so I’ve come to understand &amp; accept that if I want to see her I’ll need to be the one who travels – at least for the time being until her life evens out a bit more. I have not yet booked my flight for March because I am hoping the prices drop some but i am planning to book it by the end of this week. \n\nFast forward to yesterday – I hadn’t heard from Sara in a couple of days so I reach out to her and ask how she’s doing. Sara replies that she was busy over the weekend because she went to her coworker’s sister’s wedding. She tells me that they traveled for the wedding – with a layover in Chicago and a destination of Orlando – and that she only really had to pay for food &amp; hotel as her father’s airline points covered the price of the flight. I was surprised because it was the first I’d heard about her going on this trip – which is unusual because we talk almost every day and keep each other updated on our lives – but I told her that I was glad that she had a nice trip and left it at that.\n\nHowever, the more I think about her trip to Florida, the more hurt I feel. She has been telling me for years that she doesn’t have the time/money to take a trip to visit me, but then she makes a trip to the wedding of someone she hasn’t met...I could understand a little more if the coworker was a significant other or something, but they are just friends – both 25yo straight females. And I'm also hurt that she hid this trip from me – most likely because she realizes how this looks from my perspective. I am trying to let it go and not let it bother me – but it is upsetting me more than I expected.\nI have not yet told Sara that I am feeling hurt over this situation. She is very passive and does not deal with conflict well, so my plan was to talk to her about my feelings in person when I visit in March. If I choose to cancel the trip though, I would tell her now about how I feel and explain that this is the reason I am cancelling. \n\nSo – WIBTA if I chose to cancel my trip for March because of this? I feel like I am making our friendship a priority and that she is not. \n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my girlfriend on Omegle?",
      "description": "For a bit of context, this happened about 3-4 years ago and the relationship is long over. I still miss her, but not some of the shit she pulled. She was an odd girl, but I loved her to death when we were together. She had self-diagnosed herself with multiple personalities, and while that didn't get in the way of the relationship too often, it was also like walking on eggshells when a 'personality' that didn't like me reared its head. For example; saying I wanted to go inside during a hot day pretty much 'discouraged' her from ever accepting date ideas from me. On top of that she had started talking with another guy behind my back as 'she wanted to try something new', and that led to her breaking it off with me. I now see that was for the better.\n\nThe day started off normally. School, home, and then I went over her house for a visit as per usual.  \nShe was preparing to do a modelling gig with her friend, and I was helping her get ready. I mostly helped with her hair and such, helping her fit into her outfit, etc. Then I come to find out that she doesn't want me along. Why? Because she wanted some alone time with her friend. I say 'alright, that's fair', as I didn't want to intrude. (I know the guy (ftm) was in a relationship at the time, so this wasn't a concern of whether or not she was being unfaithful, I just wanted to be their with my girlfriend) I try to convince her to let me go, but still she's adamant about going alone and I end up heading home.  \nShe gets back after a few hours and she shows me a few photos over DM. She then says that she wants to spend some time one Omegle with her OTHER female friend showing off her outfit and her make-up. Of course, I ask why. \"I just like doing it, I get compliments and they make me feel good about myself\" Ok. Cool. But you're also in a relationship and that seems like you value the opinion of random strangers online over my own. And of course, I tell her this. And soon it devolves into an argument about how she just wants to feel special and I'm making her feel like shit and etc... It wasn't really an argument so much as her yelling at me. But since I'm at home, there's nothing I can really do to physically stop her, and of course she goes on Omegle with her friend to show off and I'm left feeling jealous, sad, and frustrated. I got hounded for a while after that, and this was the first time that she threatened a breakup... the next day in school... in the middle of class... over text. I was distraught, but her friend was on-board with her. Messaging me that I was acting petty and that she just wanted to feel positive about her body (she was borderline anorexic, and I had been helping her improve her diet and eating habits) and I was making her feel like all her hard work was for nothing.\n\nIt's a few years later, and in this particular situation, I'm still unsure whether my feelings against the whole Omegle thing was justified... So, people of Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So I was in a fast food drive through line and I had just ordered. There were also several other people waiting to order behind me and it seemed like the person in front of me wasn’t paying any attention. The line moved and I waited longer than I feel I should have to hit my horn just to get the person to move forward so the person behind me could order. He started yelling incoherent words at me (both our windows were down) and, while I tried my best to stifle it, I chuckled a bit. He did not like that. He jumped out of his car and started angrily storming toward me. I didn’t think he would do anything, but I put my window up for good measure. The man came right up next to my window to yell more incoherent words then stomped back to his car. He then turned around and yelled a few more things, then got into his car and moved forward. It all happened pretty quickly, within what felt like about 15 seconds, but by the time he was done the line had moved forward for a second time.\n\nSo, should I not have honked at this guy? Was I wrong to? I thought that’s kind of what horns were for. Anyway, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA For not telling my boyfriend I had lunch with a friend near his work?",
      "description": "Sorry, this is very rambly, TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo, this seems silly to me, but my boyfriend seemed upset. (I have not said so to him)\nAbout a week ago a friend of mine asked me to meet up. I was busy at the time, so we agreed on a lunch 3 days ago. I told my boyfriend (who I was with at the time) and he didn't really comment (he knows this friend, but they're not close, and I haven't seen her in about three months, but we used to spend almost every day together at some point). So 3 days ago the two of us met up and went out to lunch. Because of some new dietary restrictions on her part we went to a place nearish my bf's work (about 15min drive from my home, 5min from his work) because it's the only place nearby that's sure to have food for her. I found out about these new restrictions about a month ago, when I shared the information with my boyfriend, who was with me when she texted me. I did not mention the lunch to my boyfriend aside from the initial agrement that I'll be going. \nSo a day after the lunch my boyfriend texted me just remarking on how he's seen I've been to that side of town (i think she posted sth about going to that place to eat with me). I said that yes, I went with that friend and we went there because of her dietary restrictions and didn't really tell him, because:\n1. It was during his work hours and he wouldn't have been able to join us anyway\n2. I had to be back home by the time he'd finish work due to some obligations (which I told him about before)\n3. He would hate the food there\nFrom then on he pretty much just made some minor snide comments, so I'm guessing he's upset (I haven't asked directly and he hasn't said anything) \n\nI also didn't really mention the lunch afterwards because I felt I had nothing to say. I told I was going to lunch, he had good reason to assume we'd be eating at the place we were since I told him about her dietary resteictions and I fidn't want to talk about what we talked about, because when I did in the past he just said that he didn't care at all. So I just didn't mention having gone to lunch, when we were having a phonecall for about 2h in the evening while he played a videogame with some friends, pretty much just asked about his day and how the game was going, and then pretty much stayed quiet, so as not to bother or talk over his friends (I couln't hear them, they were in the in-game call together  but I could hear that he was talking to them about the game tactics and stuff) So I just didn't think the lunch was that important. \n\nBut now he seems to be upset since he's borderline ignoring me. And I don't know if I did sth wrong or not? \n\nTL;DR: Told my boyfriend I was gonna have lunch with a friend in a week, had lunch with her, didn't tell boyfriend about it after having lunch with her, just the week before, he saw on her social media, now he's upset with me for not telling himm.

      "title": "AITA for not believing encouragement?",
      "description": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nSo a little background: I got my degree in secondary education, with an emphasis in physics. I have always been passionate about physics, more so than education, but I wasn't sure of my own abilities. I opted to focus on teaching high school instead of pursuing physics myself, for several reasons. one of which was that I felt like I just wasn't up to the challenge. But that brings us to the scenario:\n\nI got a job at high school out of college and taught there for two years. At the start of the second year, I decided that I wasn't satisfied in my current position. Its not that I thought being a teacher was too easy/not important, but more like I felt that I had given up on myself before I really tested my limits with physics. So I decided that at the end of the year, I would quit teaching high school and go for a masters in physics, but I still had doubts about my skill.\n\nOur high school had a very close knit staff, so when I made the announcement, I was given nothing but support by my coworkers. They would often discuss my plans, as we still had most of the semester to finish up before I left. And invariably, my nervousness about the difficulty of the degree came out. And, invariably, everyone I talked to said things like \"you'll be fine, I know you're smart enough.\" And, Invariably, I would respond with \"Thanks, but we'll just have to see how it goes.\"\n\nNow this response seemed to piss some of them off, especially the teachers I was closest with. They seemed to think that my continued negative attitude in the face of their encouragement was somehow a reflection of me not respecting their opinions. They would ask me things like \"how can you say you're not up to it when we are all telling you that you are?!?!\" And again, I am extremely grateful for the support they offered. But they didn't really know what they were talking about.\n\nThis was a pretty small high school, so I was the only physics teacher on staff. Furthermore, I was the only teacher who was even certified to teach physics, and the only one that had taken more than the introductory courses in college. This meant that none of them had ever tried out Lagrangian Mechanics, or solved a Schrodinger Equation, or any of the more rigorous stuff. The three math teachers on staff probably had the closest idea of the rigor involved, which is why their responses weren't of the \"I know you can do this\" type and more of the \"If I can help you somehow, let me know\" type.\n\nSo for these teachers to tell me \"You can do this\" was really more of them saying \"I have no clue of what it is you have to do, but I'm sure you can do it\" Which wasn't really helpful to me, outside of the general positivity of being surrounded by support. It wasn't meaningful support. It was the platitudes of people who were simply trying to fulfill a role of good friend/coworker.\n\nAnd normally, I would accept this encouragement as I stated above, \"thanks,  but we'll just have to see how it goes.\" And nothing more. Its not like somebody would try to encourage me and I'd yell back, \"Well what use is that, coming from some dip Sh\\*t like you?\"\n\nHowever, when they asked me why I still seemed skeptical, even with their support, I answered them truthfully. I explained in a similar manner as above, in what I though were respectful terms. Essentially saying that I had struggled somewhat with the material I learned in my undergrad, and I knew that grad school would be much more rigorous, and I wasn't sure that I could hack it, but I had to try. And that even though I appreciate their support, their words didn't carry the weight of experience in this area, so they had less of an impact.\n\nSeveral of my coworkers ended up getting mad at me for this response. They accused me of being ungrateful for their support, calling them dumb because they didn't know much physics (which, again, I didn't think that they were dumb or anything, but essentially said that they were commenting on an area that they themselves admitted to having very little knowledge in), wallowing in my own self pity to earn sympathy points from others, and trying to present the difficulty of physics as such an impossible thing that it should be an impressive feat that I am attempting to get my master's degree while the rest of those mere mortals were stuck in a public high school.\n\nAnd I would state that if the story had been slightly different, I would be the asshole for sure. I.E. If they had offered support, but my immediate response was to tell them that they didn't know how hard it was going to be, so their words didn't really make me feel any better. That would make me an asshole, IMO.\n\nBut when they offered support, and I thanked them for that support, then they continued on by asking me why their support wasn't convincing me, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My coworkers got mad at me because I didn't believe them when they said that I could achieve a difficult task, even though they didn't have a concept of what that task entails.

      "description": "So I will tell the story from the start to my current day. \n\nI was hanging around in discord doing useless but fun stuff when I noticed this one girl. She was bad at the game in which the server is based on, so I ridicule her gameplay in front of some people. However it turns out that she's there at the server. Knowing this, I apologized to her about the ridicule and deleted all the mean shit I said to her.\n\n(yep, I possibly have separate asshole moments. I am not a good person) \n\nSo after that is done, I noticed that she keeps sending nudes/ inappropriate pics to the server. I scold her about it, and in response she showed her arm which is full of cuts. I know she had self harmed herself, so me and a friend of mine started talking to her to hopefully help her get back in track.\n\nMy friend didn't have much success, but I had too much success. We ended up talking for hours like a new couple :p. I was very amazed by the level of openness she had with me and gradually I made her the center of my attention and to be honest,  my life. \n\nOur chats started running dry after 2 weeks. We simply ran out of things to say.  At this point I was desperately searching for stuff for us to talk, but ALAS the talks starts to dry up.  We then settle into this kinda \"quality talk\" where we just converse brief but fun stuff sometimes \n\n1 month into our friendship, I started liking her (I know it's completely irrational) and you know it just motivated me to invite her to talk to me at all times. One day she goes missing for 1 day and we didn't do any talks. I was very worried for her and my thoughts went to really bad stuff. Finally she responded.  I was very happy that she responded.  We talked a bit and she said she had a one night stand with a guy named Alex.  She hoped she and him become partners.  This devastated me but also made me a little bit relieved, since I hope this Alex guy will help her with her problems as well.\n\nAnd then come the holidays....\n\nOn the holidays our talk started to dry up even more, we barely find anything to talk about.  I am aware that she's getting bored of our talk. I was unable to contact Alex at all. He couldn't speak English at all so I couldn't discuss with him how we can help her. During this period I became very worried of her and I became a very negative and emotionally unstable person.  I decided to contact one of my acquaintance to go help her as well. My acquaintance (we call her Eve) is very happy to help her (we call her Kris). \n\nJust when Ever talked to Kris, she spilled the beans. Alex was fake and Kris created him just to make me relieved. This moment made me not crush her anymore,  but I understand and tried to look past that. \n\nI won't bore you with the details. Me and Kris just have bigger distance over the month. At this point me and Eve also discovered that Kris also lied about their talk,  and asked me to investigate it. It's true. She claimed to have real sword fights and post a picture from Google as evidence.  My distrust of Kris grew. \n\nThen one day I discovered that Kris is not open to me anymore.  She started telling her secrets to Eve instead of me unless I asked her about that specific topic. At this point I gave up and I want to leave her be, I don't want to care for her again.  It hurt me in a lot of ways. I also don't want to pretend to be her friend. It is disgusting to me,  and I choose to just be clear about it than having fake smiles plastered over my face when I don't care what our talk is in the slightest. \n\nFor fairness, Kris has a lot of fucking problems in her life (although I cannot be sure they are lies or not). \n\nHer problems are:\n-her parents left her since March 2018 (like, they dissapear. She only got monthly allowance from them) \n-she didn't have any friends in her college\n-her brother moved out 2 weeks ago ( she said it's good but IDK. Seems pretty bad for me) \n-she was forced into taking a major she didn't want\n-she self harms\n-she often has depressive thoughts and dark humors\n-some of the server members are against her since she still occasionally posts nudes and shit. There was a fucking big drama over this that Eve also got whipped up on\n-she had an abortion in a rape (I myself believe she had a one night stand and have accidental pregnancy but I cannot know for sure) \n-she often drinks heavily \n-she works in a bar with strippers around and servicing drinks to men and occasional women there\n-she had some sort of disease that got her bedrest some months ago, and now she is forced to take blood tests every 3 months for a year\n\nAm I The Asshole? Also, what should I do? \n\nTL;DR\n\nI am exhausted mentally and emotionally from a friend. I wanted us to not be friends anymore,or at least for me to not care about every single thing she did,but I don't want her to be left alone, especially since she had a lot of life/mental problems",

      "description": "Context: In college. This happened twice, actually, with slightly different scenarios; I'm the common denominator in both these somewhat unfavorable situations, so I'm concerned about this.\n\nCase 1:\nI had a friend, Jeff, who appears to be depressed *as far as I can tell*, although Jeff has never really been to a mental health clinic to have it diagnosed.\n\nJeff and I mostly talk and support each other at times and I, being good at academics, often help Jeff with his classes. Jeff is not exactly struggling with to pass his classes, but his grades are rather low and he doesn't have much hope for his future.\n\nAt some point I decided to cut off the friendship because\n\n1. Jeff does not currently offer much of value to me. We do not really share many similar hobbies or interests, so I don't find talking to Jeff entertaining. I trust Jeff and he is one of the very few people I can be honest with some personal things about, but I do not value that very much.\n2. Jeff is a depressing influence. Most of our conversations are about Jeff being worried about his future or reminiscing about his past crushes, which in turn makes me feel depressed. I believe that I may have been a source of confort for Jeff since I'm optimistic in a weird way.\n3. As far as I know, I am not capable of changing Jeff's excessively pessimitic behaviour, so I did not expect this situation to improve. (This dynamic lasted for most of a year.)\n4. Jeff does not seek other people for help and believes other people to not understand him.\n\nCase 2: Emily is essentially the same, except\n\n1. Instead of worrying about her future, she just has a general (perhaps warranted?) sense of inferiority relative to those around her. They both worry about their romantic pursuits.\n2. Emily insists that she's very okay with her life and not unhappy no matter how depressed or pessimistic the things she says sounds.\n\n-----\n\nIn both cases, I broke off the friendship by being honest and telling them that they not useful to me and even a negative influence to me in their current state and I am unable to fix their problems, so I cannot expect anything I do for them to be worthwhile in the long term either; being what I believe to be a reasonably self-centered person, I choose to terminate the friendship and avoid talking to them.\n\nIn Jeff's case, I blocked him on social media after, but I realized that that probably wasn't necessary when it happened with Emily later on.\n\n(names edited)\n\n",

      "description": "**Background**\n\nI am a college student and my roommate is a writer and a moderate drug user. My roommate, who we are going to call Jim in this post, smokes a lot of weed and drinks. He has weird habits for brainstorming for ideas such as standing on his desk, laying flat on his desk, jumping on his desk etc. This is fine with me because hes usually not too loud and this type of behavior only happens every now and then when he is facing a writers block.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Incident**\n\nJim had a pretty old desk and it faced quite a bit of abuse from Jim. One day Jim got quite frustrated and managed to break a part of the desk. It wasn't a big part of the desk, but the desk soon became an eyesore and we agreed to get rid of it. My roommate doesn't have his own car and relies on me and another dude to give him rides around town. Let's call that other dude Tim. Me, Tim and Jim decide to go out to IKEA to pick up a new desk. I needed to look at some pillows and Tim decided to come with us. This is when it goes south. Jim had something misfire in his brain and thought it was a good time to pop some edibles on the day we had planned to go shopping. We go to a few furniture stores and find nothing. We finally head over to IKEA as a last resort store. It was about noon at this point and Jim wasn't completely out of it, but I could tell when the weed was talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe agree to go on a lunch break to a local Mexican place. We have lunch and Jim decides that he needed a drink. I have a bottle of vodka in my car from a party I went to, and Jim just remembered about it. Jim and Tim get in the car together in the back seat and do shots out of a souvenir shot glass that I have in my car. We are close friends and we take each others'alcohol as we please. They finish doing shots and I was well aware of how drunk they were. They were drunk enough to be stumbling a bit, but not in Jupiter quite yet. Jim was still high and now drunk. Jim walked into IKEA and literally started jumping on the damn desk. Tim encouraged him and thought it was quite funny. I was just like wtf and moved to a different section of the store. After some time I realized that Jim and Tim had no intention of shopping and were just wasting my time while being drunk/high. I picked out some pillows and headed over to the checkout. At this point, security had caught up with these fools and I was kinda pissed because I was the one who facilitated this whole trip. I just got up and left and let them figure out how to get home since my time was wasted. The IKEA is like a solid 30 min from the the place me and Jim stay at. They had to call some taxi service, and they called me a ass for abandoning them there. I told them they were wasting my time and maybe they shouldn't have been drinking vodka and eating edibles when I helped them with their trip. AITA for abandoning my friends after they wasted my time?\n\nNote: Jim and Tim are not their real names",

      "description": "I am in my university’s ballroom dance club. Today was Week 2 for Polka. My strong suit is West Coast Swing, but like to expand my horizons. I’ve learned and developed compensation techniques for when it comes to newer leads, one of which is backleading. So today in the class I danced with this guy who had a good frame and knew how to dance but had zero sense of rhythm. So I backled. I almost started counting out the rhythm “ONE AND TWO, THREE AND FOUR” but he said “If I lead you this way you should go this way.” I said “It wouldn’t be a problem if you kept up with the rhythm.” After the turn I told him “You led very well but if I can make just one comment, it’s that your rhythm is off. You should go ask [the instructor] to help you with your rhythm.” I feel like I could’ve worded the first time better and then let it go or just ignored him and continued to backlead. Nonetheless I feel like an anus...so...what do you say? Am I the anus?",

      "description": "A little background story: my roommate and friend has been dating a man (roo.ate is 29 guy is 35) for like 3_ 4 months , they met through a dating app and started dating right away. They are not in exclusive according to her since she is seeing other people but I think he thinks she's his gf and not dating anyone else. Anyways we share an apartment with 2 bedrooms and common areas. This guy happens to be Russian, and is seeking political asylum in our country , he has been having some major legal problems (were he has been accused of doing stuff I'm not getting into detail) and the thing is an international organization got to him here, so he has been having some serious issues but still free to walk. He doesn't seem dangerous but you never know plus he barely speaks our language (Spanish). \n\nSo the guy has been staying in our apartment while he is renting his to make some extra money through air b n b , without my consent. My friend never asked me if it was ok for him to crush from time to time in our house, like full time. Like t\n3 weeks ago my friend was away on a trip and he came to my house on Friday and lived there until Monday or Tuesday. My friend didn't know he was doing that and they got into a major fight after that. He called her many names and Insulted me and our home and behaved very poorly. He continues to stay at our place and she never asked me how I felt about that, specially with his background story... Is not like he is staying one night and they leaving in the morning. \n\nBottom line, now they got back together after he had some very shitty attitudes, and now I don't feel comfortable around the guy. Should I talk to her about it again? I wouldn't say I'm afraid of the guy but I'm cautious. AITA FOR not wanting him to stay for days at my house? I don't even know if I want to see him when I wake up because he is at my place making breakfast etc....",

      "description": "I've been friends with this guy for a few years now. Really close for the past year and we dated in the months leading up to his having to move away due to getting a new job in a different state. We decided to break up because he wasn't ready for long distance, but wanted to remain friends.\nWe texted almost incessantly that year up until a week after he left. We hung out together any spare moment we had. I was there for him through some really tough times involving people close to him and I can pretty confidently say that I was a great friend and girlfriend, even through times that he was especially shitty to me (I never took it to heart because of what he was going through). We'd said we'd keep in touch in various ways/be there for each other when he left. \nHowever the moment he started his new job he seems to have decided that he didn't have time for me. I had needed to call him a few times for what were necessary work continuity things (we had worked together and of course we chatted every time), but he started to sound annoyed with me for calling at all. He'd take entire days to respond to texts (I know he basically always has his phone glued to his hand). \nMy last call to him was to keep him posted on some milestones I'd hit which he had previously asked to be kept posted on, and he started complaining he doesn't talk to even his really good friends that aren't immediately in his vicinity more than every 3-5 months unless he explicitly needs something. I took the hint and apologized, and it's been some time since we last spoke. \nObviously, I hadn't expected to talk/text nearly as often, but to be told that he just wouldn't talk to me unless absolutely necessary was unexpected, abrupt, and hurtful.\nI want to tell myself that transitioning to living in a new place is difficult/busy and maybe he just needs time, but it's painful to be shut out by someone you care about. \nWe live in the digital age, and while I didn't expect a ton of communication, I didn't expect to be essentially ghosted by someone I considered my closest friend. It's not hard to text a person and I have many other people that I keep in touch intermittently with this way. \nAm I the asshole/in the wrong for having expected more from a friend?",

      "description": "I will try to explain this as clearly as possible, as I  have a tendency to get muddled up when explaining my social issues. I'll refer to everyone by letters, and call them friends, though I'm not sure if they are my friends anymore. We live in the UK. \n\nSo. I have this friend I'll call L. He moved to Australia back in October. And I have a very good friend I'll call T, who ended up replacing me with L. It got to a point where all he would do is talk to L and I suppose I felt rather neglected. A few months before L left, he wasn't sure he was actually going to leave. Me and T had an arguement and stopped speaking for ages. He blocked me on all platforms. Days after L confirmed he was leaving and when, he began talking to me again. At the time I already had suspicions of him simply using me because L was leaving. He doesn't have many close friends. \n\nNow, they were in this social circle. And I was too. But these people would ignore me completely when I sat with them. I'm not exaggerating either; I could sit for the forty minutes we get for lunch break and be completely ignored. No matter how hard I'd try to get their attention, there'd be no response. So these other people, H and D, began inviting me to sit with them. They talk to me, include me, and make me feel wanted. It's nice. After L left, T began following me around everywhere and began sitting with us. Fine. It got annoying, but fine, because I thought he genuinely just wanted to be my friend. \n\nSo L has come back for Christmas break. Two weeks before he came back, I asked people if they wanted to meet up in our local city. They all seemed up for it. T kept talking about it. I made a Whatsapp group for it, and invited people I'll call F, X, Z, alongside T and L. I messaged them a week later, everyone was up for it.\n\nI met up with T on Christmas Eve. He'd been off of college sick all week, with the flu. All week. On Saturday, it seemed like he made a sudden, miraculous recovery as he went and hung out with L. I wasn't invited. That's fine; they are close, whatever. We met up on Christmas Eve so I could give him his Christmas present. He spoke pretty much solely about L. \n\nNow. I messaged this group again over twenty four hours ago, asking if they wanted to meet up on Monday. They said they'd be free all week, see. Well, I didn't get a response from anyone for a while, despite all of them being active on the main group chat. I check to find four out of the five people had read it and not responded. Okay. I wait until twenty four hours had passed (just to give it a day, as F hadn't read it). And then everyone had read it. And just left me on read. \n\nI got really upset, honestly. Like. It's one thing for one person not to respond, but these people who I do talk to despite not sitting with them during break and lunch (I sit with them in the mornings, some free periods and on this group), people who claim to want me in their life, just left me on read. So I sent a message after asking my mother what to do. I was fairly sarcastic, so perhaps I shouldn't have been, though I was really upset at the time. I basically thanked them for the acknowledgement, and said it was clear where I stood with them, and wished them all a happy new year. Z said he'd just forgotten to respond, but I don't buy that. At all. Everyone else has left me on read again. \n\nIt also just solidifies the fact T was only using me because L had left and he'd have no one. He was really rude the other day. I was very upset as I'd broke my glasses, and feared that I'd need to spend a lot of money to get them replaced. I had this money; but this money was money was savings to finally buy something I've wanted for nearly three years now. He made sarcastic, completely unrelated comments. He's been really... dick-ish recently, if I'm honest. \n\nI geninuinely feel like crying. If it helps at all, I have Aspergers syndrome. I'm not great at this people thing. I don't know if this is normal. I don't have too many friends. None of my friends are really good friends as I share no interests with them. H and D are great as they're really accepting. It's hard to explain, but they're honestly great. I have an amazing online friend too, but recently she hasn't spoken to me too much. I know I've done nothing wrong, but it doesn't feel like it. I generally feel really shitty right now as well, so I don't know if that is just making me think things wrong. My mother said that we could go together to the city instead of them, as she got me a book token for Christmas and I know exactly which book I would like to get. It just makes me feel sick because I don't actually know if I've done something wrong. AITA?",

      "description": "I have two roommates. They're friends. They go to the same college. We are NOT friends. I don't like them because I feel left out by them (I tried to be their friend and ask lots of questions, but they never return the favor), I feel that they're pretty judgmental, I don't like that they're strong Christians and pushed it heavily on me in the past.\n\nAnd I resent the fact that one of them, I call him Billy, well Billy's grandpa owns the apartment building so Billy does not pay rent. He only pays part of the electric/internet bill.\n\nBilly sends lots of text messages complaining. I feel targeted by Billy. He does this thing where he sends a whole long text with lots of guilt trip and passive aggression about one simple thing such as me leaving a glass on the table. \n\nBecause Billy doesn't even pay rent and because he was rude to me, I feel like he doesn't get to tell me shit. I am very tired of Billy and the other guy bossing me around, but acting like best friends. \n\nThey also told me they aren't comfortable with my girlfriend staying over because Billy's grandpa wouldn't like it. Fuck that.\n\nI should be able to have my girlfriend stay, I'm tired of only inviting her when my roommates aren't there. I live there too.\n\nI'll admit, I did screw up once. I smoked weed in the apartment which they don't like and I rolled joints on top of Billy's textbook and forgot about it. He was pretty mad when he found it on the couch. I apologized and we worked it out. \n\nSo. I decided that I'll just avoid contact with them. I know we live together, but at least we don't see each other much. I decided I'll just let my girlfriend stay when we want to and it does not matter what they think. I won't go out of my way to be shitty but I refuse to do what they say anymore, and they can deal with it.\n\nAITA for standing up for myself or are my roommates assholes? I'm genuinely asking. My girlfriend says I'm doing the right thing, my mom says I'm being too harsh and kind of a douche.",

I’m in charge of hosting a small charity event that has students from around our school district audition and perform Asian cultural stuff. It has now come time to picking the acts for this year, and oh boy are there a lot of kpop dances.\n\nThis one particular dance act that auditioned has the other host from another school in it, and besides the usual stuff, the dance was not bad. My only gripe is that the song they chose to dance to features a lot of English, and even an American artist. I’m not talking about just the verse, more like half the song in English. \n\nI’m hesitant to call them out on it, as everyone seems to like their act, but I can’t help but feel like it’s a bit wrong to have their act be there, when other more unique and cool acts (Indian songs, Chinese dance etc) are also hoping to perform. Plus, I’ve quarreled with the other host before, so I think people might see me confronting her as a way of petty revenge.\n\nWould I be the Asshole if I called her out on it?",

      "description": "Decided to play a winner-take-all fantasy football league this season with some folks my dad knows where he currently lives. I enjoyed a successful season and pretty much dominate the whole year. Anyone in the league would be able to look at my team and pretty much assume I'm going to win it (although I did win in epic fashion by just two points, thank you, Greg Kittle!). \n\nA week before the championship, however, the league manager passed away. His father was also participating in the league (and I would presume handling the finances of it since the league manager was a young guy in college and likely handling the \"technology\" party of it). \n\nIt was a ten-team league at a $50 buy-in, so it was a $500 pot. Socioeconomically, I am a software developer whereas his father is a manager at a small-town fast food restaurant. \n\nI sent the deceased LM (league manager)'s father a message telling him that I was sorry for his loss and if he couldn't pay I understood. He offered to pay anyway, and I of course gleefully accepted it having won the league. After I accepted the winnings, another member of the league I had befriended during the season told me that his son kept the buy-ins in a safe that only he knew the combination to. However, the nature of the LM's death lead me to believe that he had spent the money on elicit activities.\n\nThe deceased LM's father had sent me the winnings out of his own money, apparently, but I had won the league, after all, and it isn't my fault that they didn't use an electronic bank account for the buy-ins, or handled the money in a more secure way. I empathize with the situation of course but I invested a lot of time and effort into the fantasy league, and the son's death doesn't have much to do with honoring a league where family members are involved. Even if the son didn't pay if he were alive, I'd expect the father to compensate me in that case as well.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Sorry for the novel. I posted this last week in another subreddit but now theres been an update and I am lost with what to do. \n\nMy friend, Michael has always has bad habbits and a need to fit in/\"be cool\". He's extremely image conscious, has zero self awareness, and a fragile ego. We have a similar hobby and he constantly puts other people down to give himself affirmation and constantly talks about howngreat he is. Confidence is great, but humility is needed. He is insecure and egotistical and I think his feelings are hurt that I always pursue the hobby seperatly. \n\nA couple of years ago we started to work together and things have been getting infuriating for me. Mike is the coworker who always talks about how vital he is to the business, but doesn't do nearly as much as he says. He got involved with a married co-worker. It's been going on a while now. They are on again, off again (depending on her), and he has zero self respect or self awareness. He doesn't know what a healthy relationship is. He allows it to happen and thrives on it. I blame him for not transferring or at least having any willpower considering how long its been and how far this has went. He has gotten extremely depressed over this and I have told him ad nausea he has to stop and why. I'm sick of it, and I also worry about it becoming an HR nightmare (god forbid they get me involved). \n\nHes an alcoholic. I always suspected it was an issue, but that also exploded this past year. He was admitted to the hospital for pancreatitis. He was in there for a while and missed a lot of work. It was apparently due to a genetic issue, but I'm sure the alcohol doesn't help. He lives at home. At the hospital I spoke to his family. They told me they were close to kicking him out before he had health issues because of the drinking. We live in an expensive part of Cali. I cannot and will not shelter him. No idea what he would do in that case. His parents care about him, but apparently didnt know what to do and it sounds like some sort of ultimatum was given.\n\nHis health problems didnt change anything. He wanted to drink once after and I flat out told him not to in front of me. He tries to hide it, but I see. This past week he stayed over and brought a huge duffle bag. He was coughing and swearing at night and was a total mess in the morning. I shouldnt have done it but I went through his duffel bag that day and I found another vodka bottle. He drives me nuts, and Ive been limiting my one on one time with him. He doesn't really have any other close friends, and I feel guilt over that. \n\nI just heard he spent this weekend in the hospital again because his pancreas flared up again. He didnt tell me until after the fact which I find weird. While it does seem this can just happen because of his condition, it also seems like alcohol increases the chance by a great deal. \n\nShould I talk to him in person or just go to his parents? ",

Not too long after they were getting praise for what they said meanwhile I was getting brigaded by downvotes for (what it seems like to me at least) just defending myself.\n\nWith how I see it, it is just so frustrating that someone who makes blind accusations about people being depicted as the good guy meanwhile I'm the bad guy for stating that none of what they said was true. To me they are CLEARLY in the wrong so I don't know why they're getting praise for making hostile assumptions.

      "description": "My brother and his friends play a lot of magic which I joined in once for a draft and now my phone is constantly receiving texts that are of no relevance to me. I asked if he or someone else could set up a group text that doesn't include me since the conversation doesn't include me. They could even use still text me along with everyone else next time a draft came about. Apparently this is an unreasonable burden to put on the group and that I should simply block it, which it turns out I cant. My brother then spent twice as long as it would have taken to set up a new group text trying to block the current one on my phone to no avail. And of course I'm the bad guy for pointing this out. Is this request even unreasonable. Only one person would have to take on the \"burden\" of setting up a new one, not the whole group and it would also make it easier to include me on draft setups in the future since they wouldn't have to text me separately from everyone else, but he wouldn't have any of it saying I was requesting that everyone else to inconvenience themselves for me. It's not even inconvenient, I have a group text for just my parents and one for the whole family and it has never once been inconvenient.",

It was my idea and I decided that we would split the money 60/40, mainly because I was a selfish jerk back then. He grumbled a bit but really didn't put up a fight, If he really wanted an even cut I probably would have given him one fair and square, honestly I was fully prepared to change the deal if he really pushed for it, but he didn't. He just sort of rolled over and agreed to the terms.\nOne day of hard work later, during which I managed and made sure that I would get the more difficult portions because I felt sort of guilty that I was getting more money, we tallied up our earnings. \nIt was at this point I realised that something was off, I was ten bucks short. I confronted him about it and he said flatly that he took it because he deserved an equal share. \nOf course I got pissed, we made a deal. If he didn't like it he should have said something before agreeing to it. The whole thing was my idea, we used my equipment, and I chose to do the harder parts of the work as well so it wasn't exactly a completely unfair deal either, just a bit stingy on my part. Again, I wouldn't mind paying him an equal share if he had just asked from the start, but we agreed on the terms I set, a deal is a deal.\nBy the next day we made up, it wasn't really a big deal even back then, but years later I'm still kinda annoyed by the fact that I got shorted ten bucks.

      "title": "WIBTA if I ask my girlfriend to help clean my apartment because of her cat?",
      "description": "(I'm also a girl btw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months ago, a cat showed up at my gf's parents house. She instantly bonded with this cat. Her parents tried to take this cat in, but their other cat started attacking it. My gf instantly comes to me and says, \"I need you to keep this cat at your apartment for me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy apartment is small, but allows pets, while hers doesn't. I knew this cat meant a lot to her, especially since she'd just lost her childhood cat to seizures the previous spring. She was also going through a lot of difficult things at the time. So I agreed to keep the cat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple things to keep in mind:\n\n1. I have pet allergies and asthma. When the cat came into my life, I had to start medicating. \n2. I am disabled. Doing any house work for myself takes a lot of spoons. \n\nI've come to love the cat, but because of my allergies and asthma, I have to clean *a lot*. Keeping the house from being overrun with fur and dander is critical to my health. Before I started buying expensive antihistamines and getting back on asthma meds, I had several severe asthma attacks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping the apartment clean has become a full time job, and I can't just slack off on it because if I do, I get sick. I'm disabled, though, and if I can only do so much in one day. For the sake of my health, I end up cleaning instead of doing other important things like grocery shopping or showering. And when the cat decides to piss on my bed, I then have to waste spoons doing all my sheets at the laundromat, which costs $10 a pop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't have to be cleaning this much if it weren't for the cat. To clarify, I don't mind asking my girlfriend to clean the litterbox or feed the cat -- she usually does actual cat-related chores just fine without being asked. But what about asking her to help me with the dusting, vaccuuming, sweeping, etc? **She's disabled too**, but she isn't affected by an unclean house like I am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome other context: A couple years ago, she let me stay at her apartment rent-free for like... 7 months. I wasn't expected to clean, though I definitely cleaned up after myself and helped out now and then (especially with dishes, which she hates). This is why I'm actually conflicted. She let me live with her and eat her food for almost a year and didn't expect anything out of me, so why should I expect her to clean MY apartment? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut also, I'm literally spending all my time and money cleaning up so her cat doesn't kill me! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, WIBTA if I asked my girlfriend to do a share of my household chores because her cat affects my health? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I'm asthmatic, disabled, and severely allergic to the cat my girlfriend asked me to keep at my apartment. If my apartment isn't cleaned almost every day, I will get sick. Wondering if I should ask my girlfriend to start helping me clean my apartment because I'm keeping her cat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I don’t mean to sound like a true asshole but I’d do anything for her or any of my friends. But sometimes she ignores me when she’s made plans with me.\n\nLike this weekend. I went to see Captain Marvel ( which was amazing ) and we were going to hang out after. I called her three times when the movie ended and even went to her house. She wasn’t there and her mother didn’t even know where she was. \n\nI went home then and stayed awake til 3 thinking maybe she’d still come over but that was Friday night and it’s now Sunday morning. I haven’t heard from her. Even my boyfriend texted her asking if she was ok. She sent me a snapchat yesterday of just a glass, I assumed she was in the pub. Then I wake up today and she has a story up on Snapchat of her out drinking with other people.\n\nI’m very upset because this happens most of the time and my boyfriend is always there for me but constantly tells me that I got to keep contact with friends if I want to keep them.\n\nI don’t like being on my phone too much so I rarely text or call people, I’d rather see them in person, but to hang out with someone you got to organise it via text or call sometimes.\n\nI just don’t want to talk to her or anything, it hurts that I’ve been tossed away and she hasn’t replied to me. So I’m just going to ignore her.",

      "description": "I’m not here looking for relationship advice.\n\nLast week my boyfriend got very drunk at my office Christmas party and called me some nasty names and accused me of cheating on him in front of my coworkers. He claims he was blackout drunk, remembers nothing and has since profousely apologized. I stayed at a friend’s house the next night and he sent me a screenshot of a ring he supposedly “bought” as a promise that he’d never act that way again.\n\nI came home the next night and he greeted me with a jewelry box, inside of which was a completely different ring. He says he “bought” the first ring but when he went to pick it up at Macy’s they had sold out (?). So he got this completely different one instead. \n\nAt no point did I say I want a ring. Our relationship has been rocky at best lately. I definitely didn’t want a ring that he bought on a whim.\n\nToday we were supposed to go Christmas/anniversary shopping for each other (our anniversary is Christmas Eve). I bought him a VR set, a high visibility jacket (he does construction work), an Amazon echo and a 4 set Tile device because he always loses his keys/wallet.\n\nWhen i got home, there were two identical jewelry boxes under the tree for me. One was the ring he already “gave” me and another was a chain so I could wear the around my neck. Those are my gifts. I told him specifically not to get me jewelry as a gift in casual conversation a while back. Two months ago I splurged on myself after a particularly hard time at work. I bought myself a necklace and two pairs of earrings that were not cheap and I try to wear almost every day so justify the price.\n\nAm I the asshole for being unhappy? I have no idea how much money he spent and I don’t care. I just feel like he really didn’t put any thought into what he got me...ESPECIALLY in light with the hurtful thing he did to me just last week. I was...expecting something different. Last year he got me bath bombs and a mug and I bought him a guitar and watch. He had been out of work for a few months leading up to the holidays so I wasn’t expecting much then...but this year he has been. I just thought he’d do something more to make me feel special. I don’t have a good relationship with my family so this has always been a hard time of year for me. I can think of so many functional things I need right now and a lot more that I’d want. And I’m not talking expensive. I need a new phone case. Id like an insulated water bottle. Etc...The only thing he asked me was my shoe size (and then didn’t get me shoes....). It just feels very impersonal. He thinks I’m being incredibly selfish. I just wanted to feel important and I don’t know if I’m awful and he’s right :( ",

      "description": "Throwaway because people could easily find out who I am through my regular account. \nI've been dating this girl for about 4 months now, and things have been going great. We have had occasional arguments, but we've been able to always work things out. Some important background, we always tease each other when we're together (nothing to personal, but just lighthearted fun, just enough to make each other laugh). She works, but comes from a financially unstable background and lives in a rough part of town. Also, I'm 25 and she's 19.\n\nAnyway, I've been living in the country where my girl is from, and I had to go back to my home country for about 1-1.5 months to take care of work related issues and family matters. She was aware of this and was completely ok with it. While here she texts me if I can buy an iPhone X for her since it's cheaper here. This is where the problem starts. I've had a history of \"friends\" always trying to take advantage of me since my family and I are somewhat wealthy (not fuck you money, but live comfortably money). She was the one who told me to not let people do that to me. So naturally, I asked her how is she going to pay for it. She jokingly asked if she had to take a picture of the cash and send it to me. So I texted back \"I mean, I'm not Santa Clause where I can just give away free stuff lol\". She blows up. Says she can't believe I said that. She's not like my \"friends\" that take advantage of me. It's obvious she was gonna pay for the phone once I get back. She can't believe thats the idea that I had of her, a girl who was just using me for money. Then she goes on to say that throughout the time we've been together I've only tried humiliating and embarrassing her (this is where the lighthearted teasing comes into play). I would always make snarky comments about her work and where she lived. That she was neglecting herself and giving me, someone who didn't truly care for her, priority. This convo lasted a few hours and by the end she said she deleted my number, all of our pictures and memories, she regrets being with me, and doesn't want anything to do with me.\nThis all caught me by surprise. I obviously apologized and told her it was just a dumb joke, the type that we aways made, but apparently the damage was done. \nDuring our time together, I've never felt these were issues, nor did she ever bring them up. The money thing came up once. She felt we came from two totally different worlds and it was eventually gonna be an issue. But we talked about it and worked through it. I know I've made snarky remarks about where she lives in the beginning, but I caught myself and stopped saying them. I told her to let things cool down and we'll touch bases a few days later ( this happened 2 days ago), but I'm so lost. \nSorry for the rant.\n\nBut....am I the asshole here, or are you guys just as lost as I am?",

      "description": "This happened awhile ago, been brewing over it since then. Over a year ago, one if my best friends, let's say A, worked with my boyfriend at the same place together. My boyfriend and I decided we we're going to move in together after a admitted small time. About 9 months into dating. The reasoning being he was going to be stuck in a bad housing situation (slum Lord time). My friend proceeded to tell my boyfriend that he had talked to own mother, and that A's mother disagreed with us moving in together. Then told my boyfriend I was Manipulating him into moving out with me. So I ghosted A when my boyfriend told me, I don't need someone talking behind my back. It really upset A, and he messaged me asking why I was ignoring him, and he didn't want to be ghosted like yesterday's trash. I told him I knew he was talking bad about me to my boyfriend.  Then A never replied. And told everyone at work that it's my boyfriends fault we weren't friends anymore. This made me even more angry. As my boyfriend is very sweet and it hurt him. Was I over reacting back then? I miss how it used to be with A. I'm still with the boyfriend. We still live together quite happily. But maybe if I had reacted like an adult we'd still be friends. maybe A just didn't understand my boyfriends living situation well enough and I should have explained? Maybe I don't need to explain to a third party what I choose to do in my relationship.\n",

      "description": "Every morning, for my whole life, my mom bothers me with some mundane conversation that eventually turns negative. She can never say good morning and just be pleasant to me. It always ends with some passive aggressive comment or ranting about some problem she has that I didn't ask about.\n\n\nThis morning, I wake up and sit down in the living room with my cup of coffee. All I want is to wake up in peace. But first, she asks me if I want to see this painting on her phone. I said no mom. Then she scoffs and starts telling me what she hates about making software updates on her iphone, and how she doesn't want to read 16 pages of facebook's terms and conditions. I am not making this up.\n\n\nI said \"Why are you telling me?\" Then i went to go get my headphones and play music. While I'm playing my music, she snaps at me saying I'm rude and snippy and wants me to move out. I said \"I'm on my way out, don't worry\".\n\n\n3 hours later, she emailed me at work to tell me how annoyed she was at my response and how I should have apologized instead. Didn't respond.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

But then She also has an interview, so she wants me to go to school to watch my two sisters outside in -25°C before windchill until she can come to pick up, which I will do no problems.

Until four. She told me that she doesn’t want to have to drive me home first, but I’m more than happy to bus, which is how I’m going to hand out resumes and get to the school  and is still mad that I don’t want to go.

I know exactly how it was wromg, why i did it, and was ready to admit and apologize to my friends. Well, that blew up in my face...They instead used what I showed/told them against me and spread the word around the school, along with exiling me. Tried to convice me everybody hates me, that  my other friends are dumbasses etc etc.\n\nNow time to time I tried to talk to them again and everytime i had regretted it, they wanted me to do things like leave friends ive known since kindergarten, raid friends servers, show my DM's. Overall situations that I just wanted to leave ASAP. Now...for the main problem\n\nI have started to just simply ignore them, its all childish, right? Every night pretty much they will spam the discord with my @, call my phone, call my discord, skype, teamspeak, etc.\n\nYesterday was the worst, 5 missed calls on SMS. 6 on discord, and 9 spread our across platform's. They claim they want to talk but it always turns out the same way and creates drama the next day.\n\nAm I being a bitch boy?\n\nHow should I confront them?\n\nIs this...just retarded..?\n\n-------------\n\nThanks for any responses ^^",

      "title": "AITA for being angry at my ex's insecure new boyfriend?",
      "description": "My ex and I broke up about a year and a half ago and the decision was mutual. We were dating nearly 7 years and I became quite close with my ex's family. There were also numerous important things that happened in my life during that time. After the breakup, I started dating someone who was a better fit for me and going on one year together. As my ex was dating new people, I supported him through the breakups. My ex started dating a new boyfriend and we all became friends, sometimes even going on double dates. (We're all gay guys, so I'm trying to not let the he/his pronouns get confusing).\n\nA month ago, both of them came over for dinner and drinks. During a conversation about my ex's family, I found out that my ex's new boyfriend doesn't like it when I sometimes talk about past shared experiences with my ex or how I know and care about my ex's family. The new boyfriend has said that he has \"baggage\" (abusive parents, an ex that cheated on him) and that it's difficult for them to begin their new relationship when I bring up the past. I felt very hurt by this because despite not wanting to date my ex, we still had some very important things happen to us together that I think we can reflect on in the context of friendship. I can't think of anything I've brought up that was sexual or romantic in nature; most have entailed experiences with friends, trips we took, and what I know about the ex's family. To me, it seems disrespectful of my life history to have to walk on eggshells and pretend like none of that happened for somebody else's insecurity. \n\nI told the new boyfriend that I don't want to date my ex and that I'd like us to be able to be our okay with accepting our pasts and the new futures we have. Furthermore, I told the new boyfriend that I wanted them to be together and I really care about them. He stood his ground, and eventually said that he was making me responsible for his insecurities and that I'm not responsible for his emotions and don't wish to distort reality to please him. When I said that, the new boyfriend became angry, said he was \"triggered\" by what I said and they both abruptly left my apartment. \n\nI wish I could remember exact words better--especially those of the ex's new boyfriend, but it was rather emotionally charged and I was on about 4 hours of sleep from working late the previous night. I stayed relatively calm during the whole conversation, but on the inside I felt really hurt and appalled. I texted them an apology after they left and said I was prioritizing my needs over theirs and that I would work on not bringing up the past. I got a reply from both of them the next morning. The new boyfriend was somewhat cordial and empathetic, saying he went through similar problems being friends with an ex, and suggested that bringing up the past with my ex might be a problem with my new partner (it isn't-we've talked about my ex actually quite extensively) and that I should work on it with a therapist because he thinks I'm hung up on the past with my ex. My ex, who had been near silent about this until now, also sent me a text message saying that it was inappropriate to talk about these past events but appreciated that I would work on myself.\n\nTwo other secondary details seem relevant to me:\n\n-A few months back, he also got in a large argument with another person my ex used to date, the person accused the new boyfriend of being insecure and controlling, and now they don't talk anymore.\n\n-When they started dating, my ex and his new boyfriend seemed to jump into things very quickly, and I noticed that sometimes my ex would call the new boyfriend by my name on accident. The new boyfriend bought the ex a ring (not engagement) a few months into the relationship. They haven't dated even a year and are already planning moving to another state and having children. Sometimes I wonder if my ex hasn't really gotten over me entirely and displaced a lot of the emotions and expectations on the new boyfriend. Maybe there are things happening behind the scenes I didn't know about. There have been a few times where he became upset at my ex at get-togethers and they have asked us to leave so they can work things out.\n\nAs time went on, I felt my apology wasn't really necessary. I can't imagine being good friends with people who ask me to not talk about 7 years of my life. I haven't spoken to them in a month. Both of them also hosted a party recently, and I wasn't invited. It was rather painful to see pictures of them on social media with some of my close friends knowing I was excluded. I've considered reaching out, but I'm questioning whether I want to be friends anymore and I don't think like the ball is really in my court.\n\nSo, was ITA?\n\n----\n\nTL;DR:\n\nI'm platonic friends with my ex after our mutual breakup. My ex's new boyfriend is insecure about my past history and doesn't like me talking about it. I think this is ridiculous and insecure and am questioning whether I should friends with them anymore.",

My parents said yes as long as there are no games on it. I said yea sure. i said i would pay half of the 700 euro (peripherals included). So i got it today and spent the afternoon downloading all the stuff i need and after that i sat on the couch and watched some YouTube. My mom comes in. Mom: \"what are you doing\" me: \"relaxing watch YouTube\" Mom: \"That´s for school you are not allowed to do that on there\" Me \"i paid 350 euro for this and i just wanted to relax for a while\" Mom: \"i paid a lot of money too and i though it was ONLY of school\" Me \"well i just wanted to be with the family and relax\" Mom: \" NO it is only for school get off RIGHT NOW\"  Me \"well im not gonna spend all my money just for school, im just gonna send it back then\" Mom: \"Fine do it then\". i was quite pissed as all i wanted to do is to relax for a while. I spent 350 euro for this, why tf do i ONLY need to do school work on it. All i wanted to do is just relax for a while, I bought it for school but i really dont know why i need to sit alone in my room just to watch youtube.

      "description": "So, in one of my Dungeons and Dragons groups, I've been DMing a long-standing campaign. About 10 sessions ish, each being 4 hours. So, one of my players, call him M, really wants to DM and he's agreed to have his campaign after mine. So, where the issue comes into play is that sometimes, I just cannot make it to sessions. And in this scenario, I let M DM with his own character being an NPC while he DMs. This has happened twice before and each time, when I send him the plans, it goes a different way than I expected, with different things than I planned and misinterpreting of the instructions. An example of this was when we were in the Fey Wild, searching for a player's ancestors. One of our players was a Dragonborn, and I had stated that the people there had an aversion towards dragons due to a past incident. So, while the other members of the party(1 Elf, 2 Half Elves, and 1 Aarakocra(M's character)) went to search, the dragonborn member was in a cave. So, I had asked M to have the Dragonborn roll for stealth, because the Dragonborn wanted to explore the mines. If he rolled low, the elves would find him and chase him through the mines, which served as a dungeon, with some NPC's scattered around the mine. However, instead of this, he included no indication of the elves being angry at all, and instead, had the elves congratulate him when he was done with the dungeon. This just made no sense at all to me, and the next session is a major plot point, and I can't make it. In this case, I try to reschedule, but M hosts the sessions and doesn't want to reschedule unless too many people can't make it. And if that happens, I really don't want him to DM because I really want this plotpoint to go right. I tried telling him that, and he looked kinda bummed. Idk, Reddit. So, AITA?",

      "description": "I’m a grad student who’s home for the holidays. My mom is one of those narcissists who believe they are perfect, nothing is ever their fault, etc. She is also incredibly judgmental.\n\nYesterday I had a committed schedule planned. First, brunch with my boyfriend on his lunch break. Then, spend rest of day with boyfriend. Then, go to party. Then, go to dance social. My mom suggested I ask him to the party, which he declined. I knew he was gonna decline. He didn’t want to go to a late night party with over sixty people. She said he was being annoying and that she’d be mad at him. Then she said I shouldn’t go to his house and called me silly for it. I explain to her that I’m capable of making my own decisions and reminded her that I don’t live in her house anyone. We then got into a heated argument. Things escalated quickly. As they always do with her. She ends up calling me the most ungrateful person ever, as usual. So I just drove off to my boyfriend’s house.\n\nI call my dad and ask him to remove my name from everything and to not support me in any way anymore because my mom clearly stated that I am an ungrateful burden, and she constantly looks for some form of control over me. I want to be independent. I am financially able. My boyfriend makes big moneys so his support is all I will ever need. Later my mom texts me looking to reconcile, but this is a cycle with her. Nothing changes after. So I ignore her texts.\n\nAfter the social, I spent the night at my boyfriend’s house. She needs to realize one way or another that I’m a guest in her house and that if she expects me to visit her again then she needs to treat me in such a way that will make me want to come back to her. Actions have consequences. And her attempts to reconcile are meaningless because the same thing is just gonna happen over and over again. I want nothing to do with her. AITA for the way I handled this? Could I have handled it better?",

      "description": "I was riding my bike yesterday through the city around rush hour, it was raining.  I generally stay pretty safe, use crosswalks at big intersections- I'm not the bike person you see swerving in and out of traffic and running lights and stop signs.\n\nI was waiting at a crosswalk on my bike for the light to turn.  A car stopped at the crosswalk (she didn't need to, her light was green but people do that sometimes).  There was only one car in sight and it was directly behind her.  I started going through the crosswalk after she was stopped for a few seconds, but as I did, the car behind her swerved around her into the center lane and nearly hit me.\n\nSo naturally, I was pretty shook.  I yelled at the car, maybe (probably) called him an asshole (sidenote: will he show up in this sub too?)  and kicked his license plate.  I almost definitely looked like I was trying to start a fight.  He started getting out of his car, more traffic started coming and I was still in the crosswalk, so I rode off.\n\nOn one hand, fuck that guy for being so unsafe in the dark and in the rain.  The car in front of him obviously stopped at the crosswalk for a reason.  On the other hand, he probably wasn't trying to hit me or be aggressive and I feel like I acted like the stereotypical aggro-cyclist that I can't stand.",

Anyway I've got many close friends who I believe because they proved to me I can.\n\nProblem is my girlfriend finds it easier sometimes to lie to me than tell the truth, mostly stuff which would make me sad/angry and she don't want t deal with it because don't see it as issue by her self. Usually it's really little stuff about housework, taking care of our dog or preparing to school and I really don't like it but didn't care enough to make issue out of it.\n\nBreaking point was when I found out she failed one of her university courses and didn't tell me, she fixed grade later so I wouldn't know if her friend didn't tell me. It's quite issue because she's got problem with studying hard enough and not being lazy so her failing again would be disappointment for me and she knew it.\n\nI am really angry and disappointed right now, thinking about whole 6 years of our relationship and in what other issues in future she could lie to me if it was just easier.

      "description": "So this is part two of this amazing AITA adventure. \n\nSo to summarize the first experience: I get frustrated at my friend because she keeps shooting down the gift ideas I want to give her, she says some things to me and then shuts down my emotional state and doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. I included the first part in the link below if you want to catch up on it. \n\n[AITA: Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aqy6xf/aita_for_asking_my_friend_what_she_wants_for_her/?st=JS8BB5RY&amp;sh=5ca55dda)\n\nSo today is my friend’s birthday. After searching my brain for something to give her, I settle on two gift cards, one for the ITunes Store and a Steam gift card - around forty-five dollars for both of them. So I send her pictures of the front and back since I’m not going to mail them to her, and say happy birthday. She texts me back asking me what they’re for, and I tell her they’re for her birthday. I ask if she likes them, and she doesn’t reply to me. Instead she says “Thanks.” And nothing more. A little weird, mainly because I know her and she never replies with a one word text and most definitely not with a period unless she’s upset. I know it sounds weird but we all have these weird texting quirks. \n\nNow I can tell that something is obviously up because of her texting style, and I ask her why she’s being weird. She says “Thanks” again. \nAnother flag up. I ask her if she was expecting something else and tells me “I already said thank you.” By this time I’m getting a little angry because it doesn’t feel sincere, and I understand that not everything should have to “feel” sincere, but something was bugging her, and I didn’t like the feeling. In a sense, I already know she doesn’t like the gift cards, but just to be sure, I press and ask once again if she “actually” likes them. She says “Well I’m grateful for them... I guess. But I honestly could have gotten something else.” \n\nI haven’t responded to her in a while and I don’t think I should. I’m angry at her because not only did she not appreciate the gift, but she wanted something else entirely. Not only that, but on her “list” of things she wanted, gift cards was one of the things she actually wanted. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "Hoping for some feedback on this. Sorry if it gets a bit rambling or long.\n\nBasically, I have a very close friend who I’ve known for 12 years, let’s call her Pam. Pam and I, up until a couple of months ago, would talk over Discord/Facebook for hours on end, maybe about 4/5 days a week. We would share videos, play games together, and generally just hang out. We live about 3 hours away from each other so we don’t get to see each other in person all that often.\n\nA couple of months ago, Pam finally got herself a smartphone and subsequently downloaded Pokémon Go, and she’s in love with the game. Since she’s had the new phone, we’ve been having fewer and fewer sessions where we talk and play games together. It’s still great when we do get to talk, it’s just a lot less frequent. Often when we text, Pam will say “let’s talk tomorrow and play a game”, then tomorrow comes and it comes to the point where she’s finishing work, I message her because I know she’ll be free to talk, and I get left on read for 2 or 3 hours. Then when she finally replies, she tells me she’s been out playing Pokémon Go and that she’s too tired to talk. I’m trying really hard not to feel upset because I feel like she’d rather play the game than talk to me and it’s a real change from what things were like. I don’t want to tell her what to do nor do I want to force her to talk to me if she’d rather be doing something else. I just feel it’s a little rude to tell me that we’ll talk and then I get ignored because she’s found something better to do. I’m also disabled (autism and physical disabilities) and not able to work right now so talking to her and playing a game or two is a real highlight of my day because I really don’t have a lot to do and we always have so much fun.\n\nI know it isn’t her responsibility to keep me occupied and I don’t expect her to be at my beck and call 24/7, I just want things to go back to how they were or at least for her to give me a clearer idea of when we’ll get to hang out because I hate waiting around only to be disappointed. It’s so silly because of course it’s great that Pam’s getting out more and is feeling fitter, some of my feelings may be based in jealousy because I wish I could go and walk for hours on end, but I feel like I’m being left behind and it’s difficult with us being geographically so far apart. We see each other once a year, on average.\n\nApart from this, we’re super close and want to move in together in the not too distant future, I just don’t know what to do, or if I should do anything at all? AITA?",

      "description": "This one is pretty light, but I'm curious what everyone thinks none-the-less.\n\nOn my lunch break today, I'm waiting in line in the drive through of a local fast food joint. The line was extending out of their corridor and into the parking lot, curving one way. I lined up at the end of the curve, and shortly after some woman in an SUV enters the parking lot from the opposite side to queue up in the drive through. Because of this, she had to park and wait off to the side for her spot in line to reach her. This is common here and people take note and proceed in the order everyone arrived, so no issue. \n\nWhen the line moved forward, the car in line directly in front of me remained stopped to let the new lady in the SUV go in front of everyone else. Irritated that she made the decision for everyone behind her in line to let this other lady cut, I honked at her. She seemed sheepish and avoided eye contact after that.\n\nI get that she was just trying to be nice and had no ill intent, but I guess I felt the need to let her know \"Hey wtf, you've got other people back here too you know\".\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So I have a friend, we'll call her F. I had just got to know her this year. So it was on Halloween, and she was in the woods with another friend, we'll call him C. So they were in the woods searching for something, as she had lost it. So as she was searching, C kisses her out of the blue, and she freaks out, and runs away crying. She had already had a rough night, and that was the last straw for her. So she reported this to the school we were going to, and the parents and such, and C was taken out of our school. I was there to support her and help her through it, and felt really bad for her. \n\nSo its been 5 months later and we were all talking, and she started telling us a story and laughing about it, the story being about how some guy cummed in her bra, and chased her around naked, and she laughed it off like a joke. I got pissed at her, as she had acted sad, and devastated/scared when C had kissed her, and got him taken out of school, but was just laughing this off? I later blew up at her in a group chat calling her out in front of everyone in the chat. They backed me up, but i have some regrets about that, was I right to be mad? AITA for it? Curious to hear your thoughts.\n\nTL;DR Friend got someone kicked out of school for sexual assault, and then was laughing and joking about another one",

      "description": "Okay so I dated my ex for 5 years and we broke up amicably when I needed to move to another state about 2 and a half years ago. It was a really good breakup as far as break ups go and I’m still on good terms with and speak to his family, and him and I have remained good friends and chat on the phone and on messenger pretty regularly. \n\nAbout a year ago he started dating someone new and she sounds great and that they have an awesome relationship and I’d love to meet her one day when u go up to visit him/his family and see my old friends this year at some point. She knows that we’re friends and according to him is absolutely cool with it so I don’t think there’s a problem there. \n\nA few days ago she sent me a friend request on Facebook to which I messaged the ex about and said “hey do you know why she would be adding me?”. He said she took some cute photos of his and my dog (that lives with him) and wanted to send me the photos; and that he told her it would be okay to add me. I thought it was cute and was distracted at the time and accepted the request and quickly forgot about it. \nDays go by and I remember that she added me, but that she hasn’t sent me any photos or said anything at all. That’s not in itself a problem but once I started really thinking about it I realised I regret accepting her request as it’s unnecessary. I only have my close friends and family on there and I’ve never met this girl. I like my privacy. I don’t think she has bad intentions but I feel like a boundary has been crossed. \nI brought it up with my ex and messaged him stating how I feel and that I wasn’t sure what to do and he said “you’re friends with me, and I’m dating her so by proxy you’re friends with her”. I said that I’m allowed to be friends with someone and not by proxy be their partners friend automatically although I would love to meet her someday and if we became friends organically then that’s cool. \nSo now I feel like if I delete her it would be sending a message that I don’t really intend, but if I keep her then I’m allowing something I feel uncomfortable with.\nLmk if you need more information.

      "description": "hey so i have a story lads and lasses. so there was this guy let’s call him b. b was a senior and i was a freshman and he added me on snapchat. at first i thought he was just some senior trying to get a streak with me then he started talking to me. he asked about a friend of mine and about a family . a week later we talked all night and it ended with him calling me hot and saying i was really cool . we talked constantly for a few days and some how he had brought up him sneaking out to smoke weed . i wanting this senior to stay interested in me , said that i was jealous he was going out to smoke. then he told me he’d take me and i had to find a way to wiggle out of it . he ended up not smoking that night at all and we kept talking . he said he wanted to do it that friday and when i said i’d go if i could bring a friend , he told me no way. so i had to get out of it yet again . when i told him i wasn’t gonna go cause i couldn’t bring a friend , he told me i could, but that we were gonna go back to his car and that my friend wasn’t allowed to go. hella sus right ? so i backed out and he got mad .  he would get high and drunk all the time and text me telling me i was beautiful and that he loved me , then he would go and ask my best friend for nudes . he went as far as to post a ss of OUR PRIVATE DMS as the cover for one of his soundcloud albums. ok before your like, “what’s this dumb hoe doing why didn’t she just stop talking to him” i was NOT popular at my old school, and boys certainly did not like me so when a boy, a SENIOR boy, started showing me attention i just felt special . so here’s the thick of the story . b got high, and showed up at my house at 3am. when i texted him and asked him what was going on he said that he wanted me to come out and chill in his car . the second i stepped in though, HE STARTED DRIVING. when i asked him where we were going he said to a beach near my house. he didn’t try anything though and actually just ended up falling asleep holding my hand. i ended up waking him up and telling him to take me home, which he did. at this point me and him had been “talking” for 3 months and i was kind of in love with him and was convinced he loved me too. until he stopped talking to me completely after sneaking out. when i asked what i did wrong he said nothing it’s just he didn’t want to catch feelings. i was devastated but never talked ANY shit on him. until i realized what a shitty person he was. i go to a really small school where if you do anything, everyone knows so of course people found out about me and him, and i was scared of getting labeled the freshman slut. a bunch of random people that i never usually talked to would come up and ask about him but i always kept it on the DL never told anyone any of the wacky shit he pulled . until yesterday. this sophomore guy said that he heard that b had picked me up and taken me to some parking lot where me and him had a great 3 hours (wink wink nudge nudge) and i kinda lost my shit. another sophomore who was on our bus made a joke about how he thought brooks was gay and i made a joke about how he rides this other soundcloud rappers clout. they all laughed and honestly it felt kinda great to talk to someone about his bs that wasn’t a close friend. now i feel kinda terrible and don’t know if what i did was wrong or not.

      "description": "Hi folks.  A small confession, this isn't really worrying me or anything, but when I found out about this sub a couple of days ago I LOVED the idea.  (Am I the asshole for not posting a serious situation?  Lol.)    So anyway, I finally came up with a situation which I could share.  Happened about a year ago.\n\nI live in Spain now and my first year here I met a young Spanish guy about my age in a club that we both attended.  I was visiting from another town.  We became quick friends and used to have deep life discussions and stuff.  Before each of us had girlfriends, we would hang out every 3-4 months.  I would always hop on a bus or whatever and go meet him where he lives (Seville), he would put me up in his house and I would pay for our meals.  \n\nWell, once we got girlfriends, things started to peter out, but we maintained contact more or less.  One day, we had planned to meet up, and I made my usual travel arrangements.  At the last minute he bails on me because he \"isn't in a good space mentally\" (to my knowledge he has no diagnosed mental health issues, he was just feeling down or whatever).  I tried convincing him but hey, whatever, he doesn't feel well.  Fine.  I cancelled all my travel arrangements and didn't think too much about it.\n\nAbout 6 months later we tried again.  When we agreed upon my visit I asked him, are you SURE this is what you want?  Because last time you bailed.  He said yes.  I confirmed with him, AGAIN, 1 week before my visit - again making SURE he wanted me to visit.  He says yes.  And finally, a couple days later, he calls and I already know what it's about.  He says, can I please NOT come because it turns out this is the only weekend he can be at his flat alone with his girlfriend.  I made a big deal about it this time, like, dude, you've done this TWICE now and I confirmed with you two times before making my arrangements.  You're gonna make me do this again?  And, he did.  I had to cancel all my arrangements, losing time, energy, and a bit of money.\n\nAfter that moment I pretty much decided, hey, this guy has no respect for what's going on with me and is too wrapped up in his own crap to be a good friend for me.  So I was sad at \"losing him\" but I stopped talking to him.  Just didn't feel like he had anything to add to my life.  \n\nIt's not like we were super close, and this is totally platonic BTW, but we definitely had a strong friendship.  Not my BFF but probably (one of my) BFF(s) in this new country.\n\nFor whatever reason I finally called him today, told him that what he did wasn't OK with me, but that I didn't want to argue and just hoped he was well and all.  And that we should stay in touch.\n\nSo, AITA / WITA for pretty much cutting him out of my life for a whole year over this?\n\nNote: He also did not try to re-establish contact with me in this period.",

      "description": "My husband and I have a friend who lives around the corner. We do a lot to help her family out and now I'm starting to feel taken advantage of. I have 3 kids of my own who are very little (all under 6 and one is an infant)- relevant to things.\n\nI take her and her kid to school every morning since she doesn't drive and it's too cold to walk. They live around the corner so I don't mind. It only adds an extra minute. But once a week I take the kid to school without either parent because there is another kid that doesn't go to daycare that day and my vehicle isn't big enough for everyone- only seats 6. It's not a huge deal but it does make things a bit more intense with 4 kids especially in the cold. \n\nTwice a week I watch one of the kids after school for about 3 hours. I'm not being paid, which again not a huge deal. They don't have a lot of money and we are financially stable. But this kid has some behavioural problems. We work through them and tell the kid appropriate ways to express their feelings, using manners, etc. that my kids already (minus the baby) know how to do and do effectively usually- they're kids they aren't perfect. \n\nNow, some mornings after dropping the kids off she says \"oh I have an appointment at (wherever) in 15 minutes can you take me there?\" At which point I feel obligated because that's a pretty big time crunch so I do even if I have other things going on because I can usually make it on time. \n\nMy husband does drop off when he is not working and she has an expectation that he's going to help them on a whim to do what ever they need for that day. I'm kind of getting annoyed at all the expectations for whatever they need at any time. I don't mind doing the school run and watching the kid after but I feel like it's a lot to expect the other stuff. \n\nAITA? She seems pretty understanding when I say it's a lot but doesn't change anything. Also we have 2 vehicles so I can still do things I need to get done if my man has the car.",

      "description": "Here's some backstory... \nI was in this discord server that happened to be about werewolves and whatnot and the people in charge tended to call it a \"pack\". Well, see the owner of the server tended to be very... eh IDK a very kind word for it, basically he was the kind of RPer who would PM you outside of the server because he got mad about an exchange between two characters. On top of this, you need to message him to get anything approved for your character (ie. Storylines, abilities, or even another character) well, whenever I wanted something for my character, such as a storyline, or if I wanted a new character, all he'd say is \"I'll think about it\" and then never get back to me about it, despite other people getting new characters left and right, story lines, the works. He himself had like 5 characters. He would also not follow the same guidelines everyone else did because he owned the server and was designated \"the most powerful\" which I think would normally be fine because status and whatnot, but every single one of his characters were like this, not just the character in charge. Well, another friend of mine made a server, and I was made a mod on the new server. Well I invited a couple of people from the old server to the new server. I laid out some rules and guidelines and used a couple of the numerous examples I had at hand about what not to do in RP so that everyone could have a good experience. Granted, there was one time I used harsh wording and maybe that was overstepping, but somehow the convo gets screenshotted and sent to him. Then he texts me and says \"So you dont like me as alpha huh?\" \n\n*facepalm*\n\nWe get into a heated discussion and he's really offended because of what I said, but, I point out to him that I dont dislike the server as a whole, or him, it's just that things could be improved upon. Then he has the nerve to say \"what are you doing opening up a new server when you're apart of mine, and stealing my players\"...umm.. I've known 2 of those people for several years IRL outside of the server, and the other person left anyway, and I didn't broadcast it in the server anyway. The whole time he's also threatening to punish me and the other person\n\nHis girlfriend messages me\n\n*mega facepalm*\n\nShe isn't mad or anything but she just wants to understand. So I point out what I said and then explain why I said what I said, along with the other friend who owns the new server.\n\n*his mom enters the group*\n*atomic facepalm*\n\n\"Yall are bullying and talking bad about our server, we want you two to leave\"\n\nI never said I disliked the server, and I liked everyone on there, including the peeps in charge, but now that I've left, I'm wondering if I was actually in the wrong and was being too steadfast. I'm kinda lonely, and I'm conflicted as to whether or not I should apologize, I dont know if pride is getting in the way but I'm also still angry to an extent.\n\nTL;DR I got kicked out of a server for criticizing someone else in a new one\n",

      "title": "AITA for trying to sell a gift I didn't like?",
      "description": "There will be a TL;DR at the end if you want to skip.\n\nI feel like a little background is needed here. When I was younger I was definitely an a-hole about gifts. Like even if I tried to hide it, I feel like most people could tell if I didn't like a gift and I've even had a few regrettable moments when I've straight up told someone I didn't like the gift they gave me. I've gotten a lot better as I've gotten older and have shifted to a mentality of \"It's the thought that counts.\" Still, getting gifts is cool. Getting gifts that you like is even cooler. I'm a gift card person. I would love it if everyone just gave me gift cards for everything. But I know that some people prefer giving more personal gifts which I completely get. If I do plan on getting a more personal gift for someone and don't know what they want I will ask them, \"Hey, what do want for this occasion?\" which more people should do honestly.\n\nAnyway, my aunts and cousin, while I love them to death, are not very good gift givers and they don't like giving gift cards as a gift. As stated above, I am no longer the type of person who will make it known if I don't like a gift. It's just rude. But a couple of years ago when my aunts just gave me gift cards I made it a point to tell them how much I loved getting gift cards, hoping that they'd get the hint, but that was short lived. My cousin usually gives me a Christmas themed body wash/lotion set from Bath and Body Works but I have really sensitive skin and can't use them so I usually wind up giving them to my mom. Last year both of my aunts gave me purses. I don't mind getting purses as a gift but these ones were not my style. My one aunt left the tag on so I exchanged it for something else.\n\nMy other aunt bought the purse and wallet she gave me at a store that only sells purses, wallets, totes, etc., in a certain style and material that I am not a fan of so I was unable to return/exchange. So I posted them for sale on Poshmark. What I didn't realize is my aunt who gave me these items follows my Poshmark closet so she saw that I posted them. She sent me a text that basically said that I should have told her that I didn't like them and she would've given me the receipt so I could exchange them (which again wouldn't have helped since I don't like the items the maker of this purse manufactures,) along with a screenshot of my Poshmark listing just to make sure I knew that she knew. I've felt horrible ever since. I apologized profusely and tried to play it off by saying that I did like them but I just had so many purses that I wasn't using and was trying to downsize. I took down the listing and the purse and wallet and are still sitting in a gift bag in my bedroom.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Again, while I do ultimately think that it's the thought that counts, I also think that everyone enjoys getting gifts and if you give someone a gift they don't like it creates work. It's like giving someone a goldfish as a gift. Like yeah, goldfish are pretty neat but you're not just giving me a goldfish. You're giving me a responsibility. I don't know. Maybe I'm over thinking this. Maybe I am just an asshole. Also, WIBTA if I posted on FB that I just wanted gift cards? I wouldn't say \"Hey, give me gift cards for Christmas/birthday.\" It would be more, \"Hey, if you're planning on getting me a gift for my birthday/Christmas...\" Also, just full disclosure, my birthday is at the beginning of December so I will sometimes get one bigger gift as a combo birthday/Christmas present and that's what this was. So I know that while what my aunt spent more money on it than she would've if it were just a Christmas present alone, it wasn't astronomically expensive.\n\nTL;DR my aunt gave me a purse and wallet for Christmas that I didn't like. I tried to sell it online. She found out and was upset. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm pretty sure I'm being an asshole, but I don't see how the alternatives are any better. \n\n**Background:** \n\nI haven’t attended a family dinner since I moved out after high school. This year, I moved back in with my parents to save money on rent while I complete my final year at university. \n\n**The situation:** \n\nI don't want to go for a variety of reasons but the main one is my grandmother. She’s the 'matriarch' of the family and a holy-roller southern baptist. She's said a lot of bigoted things in the past, often about her gay niece. She had no idea her only grandchild was LGBT as well until earlier this year. \n\nI’m not interested in educating her. I’m not interested in arguing with her. I’m not interested in forgiving her. I’m not interested in ignoring the tension and pretending we’re one big happy family. Every single one of those ships has sailed. \n\nI would be perfectly content to never interact with her or my extended family again. My mother chastises me for being so cold-hearted. She doesn’t understand the strain of growing up, knowing that your family's acceptance is conditioned on their continued ignorance. Personally, I think they’re better off with my cold distance over my cold presence.\n\n**The real issue:** \n\nMy grandmother is getting older and her health is starting to decline. She recently asked (through my mother) to see me. It’s possible that she wants to make amends, but I take some vindictive pleasure in never giving her the chance.\n\nThe rest of my family is very old-fashioned. Even though they don't like some of the things she says, they don't challenge her because she's the eldest. My mother especially subscribes to this approach. Consequently, I don't trust any of them to stand up with me if I have to stand up for myself. I also resent them a little for their complacency and cowardice. \n\nAs I said at the beginning, I know I'm being an asshole for punishing them with my silence/absence and not giving them a chance to make amends. I'm okay with that. But I'm less okay with letting my resentment push me over the line to cruelty. I want to be judged on whether I've crossed that line. ",

This all happened before I even met my eventual wife, so I have never met David and I certainly don't know everything about the whole story.\n\nAs far as I know, many people in Susanne's family don't know that they were divorced. I can only guess why: we live in a society where divorce is seen as something bad (or at least, not entirely okay). Whatever her reasons are, I want to respect it, so I don't \"out\" her during family gatherings. However, when she brings the \"poor widow\" card in private, I like to point out that she's not a widow but rather a divorcee, so David's untimely death is not the reason she is alone: even if he lived to this day, she would still be single.\n\nDavid died in 2002, quite some time ago, and Susanne doesn't seem to still grief that; from my perspective it seems that she just tries to make people feel pity for her.\n\nAm I being inconsiderate?\n\n(As this might show in the comments, I don't think Susanna's claims that she is all alone aren't justified. We visit her on pretty much weekly basis (we live in the same city) and occasionally help her with things like small home repairs; though admittedly I don't think I'm good at that, so I often propose she hires a professional instead, which she in turn interprets as my unwillingness to help. She seems to be some kind of a \"half-feminist\", who objects treating women as housewives but still thinks every man should be an expert in all sorts of mechanical repairs and the like.)",

      "description": "This happened a few months back. My friend (she lives with me and we study together) was going through a phase where nothing was working out with any of the guys she had been meeting off of tinder (basically all of them turned out be assholes, leading her on at first, then bailing out abruptly with flimsy excuses). So when she told me her ex got in touch with her and invited her over to his place and offered to book flight tickets for her, I thought it wasn't a bad idea provided she was ready to fly alone overnight to his place and back. She was unsure at first and asked for my advice, I don't know what made me do what I did, but I said I would cover up in case her mom calls home asking to speak to her. Things ended badly when her mom suspected something amiss while speaking to her on the phone just before she boarded the flight. She demanded to see her on video call and my friend, panicking, called me up and I didn't know what to do so I told her it's best if she video calls her mom and makes it look like she's at home just about to go to bed. That plan was a success fortunately. But she ended up telling her mom everything later on because she was terribly upset that our friends stopped talking to her (she had lied to them saying she was attending a wedding with her sister). They told her that they don't trust her anymore. I feel like all this drama could have been avoided if I had just warned her this was a stupid idea in the first place. Our friends still don't speak to her properly and think that she's just a desperate mess who would do anything for a guy.",

      "description": "My husband and I are in more debt than I have ever been in my life. Our main goal in life is to save up money and sail around the Caribbean. We have been together 7 years and married for almost 2. We have no children.\n\nMy sister goes to Alaska each year to serve at a restaurant and she makes very good money (way more than I make at my current job). My husband and I have talked about it in the past but have always agreed it was too much time apart. After crawling from the wreckage of 2018, I began to seriously consider the job. I talked to my husband and I applied. After I applied, he did say that he doesn’t think it is a good idea that we will be a part for that long. But he seemed to come around and support me. He would ask to talk about it and I would say, let’s wait until I actually get the job. Every bit of information I got from my sister or email from the company, I let him know. \n\nSo I get the job. My husband had seemed to come around and he has been looking for work there as well. The main issue is our dogs, we needed to find housing for them (for us both to go). My sister has been reaching out to all of her friends to find a dog friendly rental. She may have a friend with one that opens in June. I will be working from April 15th- September. I began to book my flight and my husband asks me to wait to see if he gets a call from a application he sent in that day. Later that day he tells me to buy my tickets. So I do.\n\nI just told him I am writing this post and he wants me to add: Our house is far away from family. 3,000 miles away from family. So it would be just him and the dogs. \n\nAnyways, the day after I buy the tickets, he is no longer supportive. He says I am ditching him. He says he just told me to buy the tickets because he wanted me to change my mind. \n\nHe has been depressed and ornery the past two days since I bought my tickets. He tells me I am ruining the relationship. \n\nLast night he says he is going to sail up there with our small sailboat. I say that it is pretty dangerous and he brushes it off saying that people do it all the time. So he starts planning his sailing trip and we are both getting excited that he has a way to get up there. Then he snaps again and blames me because sailing is too dangerous and I shouldn’t have supported the choice. \n\nHe keeps asking what he can do to make me stay and I keep saying there is nothing. I need stability in my life and I want this experience. He says if I love him I wouldn’t ditch him. I say if he loves me he would support me. \n\nI have suggested that he go stay with family while I am away, but he doesn’t want to. He just doesn’t want me to go. \n\n\nAITA for wanting to do this and not canceling after I have committed?\n\n\n\nTLDR; AITA for going to Alaska to have an experience and make money for 6 months without my husband.

      "description": "I’m a sophomore in HS who doesn’t have too much experience w girls but I’m not antisocial or anything, I’m relatively popular. \nLet’s call the girl I dumped “girl#1” \nI asked out girl#1 to homecoming and “dated” her for about a month. We only hu around 3-4 times but slowly our relationship deteriorated and the last week we were dating we only had one conversation. I’m good at talking to people and I really just wanted a deep connection, I would try to initiate conversation and she just wouldn’t open up or communicate. I ft girl#1 and told her that something needed to change and we needed to actually talk outside of school and do normal dating things otherwise it’s not really worth it. She agreed and she tried her best to reach out more but it still wasn’t working out. I was incredibly unhappy and stressed out because I suffer from severe anxiety and I didn’t really think it was worth it at this point. I decided to end things and she took it really well or so I thought, she seemed to agree w me and was not upset at all.\n During the time we dated, I had become best friends with another girl (girl#2) who was objectively more attractive and more popular and someone I considered out of my league. I did not consider them romantically at all until I split up with girl#1. Girl#1 and girl#2 are close-ish friends but they’re part of separate friend groups. Girl#2 has shown signs that she was into me for a while and we ft every night and talked all day, after I was vulnerable from splitting up w girl#1, she was there for me. I decided to ask her out on Friday considering she had said she would say yes beforehand and she was already my closest friend. Ofc she says yes but we agree not to tell anyone because girl#1 would get pissed. On Saturday one of our mutual friends is having a sweet 16 and I decide to go just to see girl #2, before I had split up w girl #1 I had made plans to go w her but I assumed she wouldn’t be going now. Girl#1 hadn’t once followed through on plans we had made and the only times we had hung out were when other people made group plans.\n I get to the party and start dancing w girl #2 and then girl #1 walks in and I’m pretty sure she sees us. She pretends not to notice and walks away. I freak out and feel awful for her so I kinda keep my distance from then on. I would have kept doing that except girl #2 had gotten incredibly drunk at that point and was panicking. I know her better than anybody and she really wanted me to be there and so did her friends so I ended up cuddling her on a couch trying to calm her down.  I’ve done this w many people in the past because I have a very high tolerance to most substances. (abuse) Girl#2 lays on me for 30-40 minutes and girl#1 walks back in. She stares at us for most of that time. One of girl#2’s friends who is dating my best friend walks up to me and starts yelling at me. Apparently girl#1 had told her “fuck you for being happy” and then apologized and started crying. There was nothing I could do at that point, I really did not think she would care that much and on top of that I didn’t even be cuddling girl #2 if she wasn’t freaking out. \n\nAITA? I will answer all questions \n",

      "description": "I am a [19M] and was just recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (January). After having a large attack that caused the left half of my body to have limited mobility and the left half of my face to be numb. After a month of physical therapy and new medications I am doing much better now and my mobility is almost back to normal.  However my face is still numb, I am not sure if this will ever get better. \n\nI just starting working full time again at my job on Monday March 18th and I have a lot of issues with fatigue and it takes a lot of will power to make it through the day. \n\nJust because I am sick does not mean that I cannot pay my bills. \n\nI was told that my work was going to be very cooperative with me and my MS. Everything was going great for the first part of the week and I had no issues and did not really need to take any breaks, but today I was working a little bit more fast paced then normal and was doing different tasks then normal. \n\nAfter the first 7 hours of the day I needed to take a break. \n\nI work in a warehouse type environment so there are basically no chairs that I could’ve used to sit in. So I sat down on the top of a table that we use to wrap parts in foam and other tasks like that (this is something that everyone sits on when they are taking a break, because again there are no chairs). After about 5 minutes of me sitting down trying to regain some energy my supervisor called me out of the room ( I thought it was because he needed my help with something in a different area of the building).  As soon as I walked through the door he said “you can’t be sitting on the table while you are on the job like that” and I said that I was sorry and that I just needed to take a break and then he said “that’s fine but when you need to take a break you can come talk to me and I will let you use my desk”. \n\nThis immediately hurt my feelings. I felt like he was hinting at me leaving for the day so I clocked out and left. And I don’t think that is a very productive solution to me needing to take a break. \n\nI unfortunately need to take more breaks during the work week then I used to and I thought that my boss understood this and I thought this was okay. \n\nATIA for wanting to speak to him and draw a line in the sand about me taking breaks when I need them? \n\nAfter all of the work that I have done and this terrible fight that I have found myself in, for someone to tell me to stop sitting around on the job really hurt my feelings.  \n\nAny advise on the situation would be great. My concern is that I am thinking into this too much and that I will make a fool of myself.\n\nP.S. - I have never made a post on reddit before but I am really looking for some outsider input on this.

      "description": "Mobile formating blah blah grammar blah blah\n\n\nThis happened today, and I asked some people on discord but they didn't really give a full response so i'm moving here.\n\nIn class at the end, my table was just goofing off regularly while playing the board game we were assigned, and a topic (It was a debating game) came up and asked \"Should the punishment for (I cant say this word but its background info, but its a word which goes with no means no. Sorry if this isnt the best way to give the info without saying the word) be less severe?\" Now, I don't remember exactly how it came to it, but my friend, who we will call Vince, said something \"Well I have done some dark stuff in my past, just as X (a girl in the school)\"\n\nX also shared a name with my best friends GF, so I assumed he was talking about her. He also said BF doesnt treat her right her, so basically hes insinuating in a joke that he and others havent treated her right her, but then just said it was others after we were confused af. Other two people there are people we will call Sam and Dan. I remember some diaoluge word for word, but not all since it happened today.\n\nM- Me\nV- Vince\nS- Sam \nD- Dan\nL- My best friend\n\nM- Dude L is my best friend he would never do that\n\nD- Shut up dude thats a different person, you dont know what you are talking about. Besides you dont know what is going on. V you shouldnt bring up something so personal.\n\nV- You're right, i'm sorry. \n\nS and V are talking about it while D and I are silent, then they stop. I dont know whats going on, and I am having a really good day so i decide to change the subject. First thing that comes to mind is the trailer for the Joker movie that released today, so I ask if anyone has seen the trailer.\n\nwhen I do that, S and D automatically get pissed at me for that. I try explaining that I was trying to change the subject, and D argues that if I dont know whats going on to stop talking about it. I tell him I did and I changed the topic, but he still gets mad at me for it.\n\nShould I have just kept quiet? Did I do the wrong thing? I thought it was the best thing to do as i had no information on the subject, plus its a subject that really shouldnt be discussed, but maybe I should have not said anything. AITA?",

      "description": "First of all, I will admit we’ve used the pull out method 3 times which isn’t the safest form of birth control (if at all) but we have our reasons and I will be going on birth control soon. We’ve discussed what I would wish to do if I fell pregnant. We used condoms for a while until the last 3 times we saw each other. I had an aversion to birth control because I couldn’t use my parents health insurance to get it and I wasn’t sure the unprotected sex would be regular (we’ve both been tested)\n\nThe story is pretty straight forward. The person I’ve been seeing (mostly casually but still monogamous) for about 6/7 months and I have sex about once a month because we’re both busy and struggle to find time to meet. Of the times we’ve had sex. \n\nThe first two times I was scared I might be pregnant but decided I would wait until my period was x days late to tell him I was scared. I know it’s a stressful feeling, however, I’m aware that I didn’t have sex alone and I don’t feel I should be the only one stressing. I just don’t want to come across as attention seeking or whatever. I could wait until there is something to actually be scared about (i.e. my period is really late) and I don’t usually stress over nothing (I’ll start stressing the first day it’s late). ",

      "description": "I’m 21 years old, and my parents are in their late 40’s/early 50’s. Every Thursday and Friday they expect me to wake up at 6:30 am to drive my dad to work because he recently had a medical complication that affected his vision. It’s all taken care of now but my mom still prohibits him from driving on the off chance that something could happen while he’s on the road. I was okay with helping back when he used to pay me, it was about 60 bucks for both of those days(keep in mind that we’re usually out for 7 to 9 hours per day) Then the pay starting going down, then he just stopped paying me altogether and hasn’t said anything about it. It’s not like I’m an integral part of his job(I sit in a cafeteria or drive him around, that’s the whole job description), and when I’m at home I’m usually applying for more jobs or making YouTube videos(which I admittedly have fallen behind on). Still, I’ve gone along with it because he’s my dad and I love him, though I wish I would get SOMETHING for the time, especially since I’m usually on the receiving end of his anger issues during this time. There have been days where I’ve had to hold back tears, listening to him compare to so and so’s kid, who has all sorts of degrees and is doing very important work, all the while continuing to drive normally like nothing is wrong. I’m also the youngest, with my oldest sister being married and out of the house, and my slightly older sister working with my parents on the weekends at a flea market. They pay her for this. About 70 bucks a day or so. Now, I do not have an actual job because my mom was making my life a living hell for being at my old job(which was a bit far from my house and was only part time, it also caused me to miss thanksgiving with my family) and getting a job there even though she initially told me I wasn’t allowed to, forcing me to quit before I had something else lined up. I was there for a grand total of two months. This was my only “official” job. Recently, this has caused me to adopt an idgaf attitude towards them, and I think I’m slowly starting to become resentful. I blindsided them by not signing up for classes this semester because frankly, I’m sick of school and I know it won’t take me anywhere I wanna be. I used to put effort into how I dressed when I went to work with my dad, but just this morning he made a passive aggressive remark about how my hair is a mess and it’s “the last time he accepts it being like that.” Sometimes it feels like I’m just a reflection on them instead of being their son. Every time I go out, I have a curfew, but I usually come home late in the hopes that one day they’ll stop being upset at me for doing so. I’m not very tolerant of a lot of their rules, and I’d like to move out but that’s not possible without a job. I know that times are tough at my dads job but I’d still jump at any opportunity that would prevent me from being able to work with him anymore. I don’t think my parents are bad people, I just lack any understanding of why they are the way that they are at times. I just want honest opinions at this point, like maybe I’m an entitled little shit and I don’t know it. Any advice would be truly appreciated.",

As money was short, I asked my brother to sleep at his place to save travelling costs. He told me, that I would have to sleep on the couch and I agreed.\nMind you, Ive slept at his place several times and his roommate would stay up into the middle of the night,playing games. I didnt mind back then, because I never had to get up.\nBut he doesnt have this roommate anymore, so I hoped to sleep early and get up soon for the job interview.\nBut he started watching his favourite show. It was 8pm by that time and I did not mind, because it was his place. But then he watched episode after episode, I grew tired and sleepy and just wanted to rest. It was way past midnight and I was kept awake by the bright light and loud audio.\nAnd in my tired mind, I started loudly complaining about him to him. I was at the point, where I considered sleeping outside, because it would actually let me sleep.\nThe next morning, when I almost overslept, I gave him the guilt. But he was the same. He did not let me breakfast before basically throwing me out for being an ungrategul person.",

One thing led to another and she and her roommate had a pretty big fight over it that affected her a lot, which is valid considering how terrible of a person Joshua has been to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all happened in September, which is when she told me about it, and naturally I haven't remembered all the details since then. Today she brought it up and because we haven't talked about it in a while I asked her to remind me about some of the details. This makes her furious and she starts screaming at me for not remembering something that affected her so much. I tried explaining to her that I've been exhausted from finals and all my mental energy has been going into studying and writing, so that naturally wasn't going to remember small details about something, especially when the only other time I was told about it was months ago. I was even working on a paper during our conversation. Am I the asshole here?

      "description": "This happened maybe two years ago with some friends. We went to Sonic for ice cream and slushies before going to a movie. I had ordered the Sonic equivalent to a Reese's blizzard/mcflurry. We all got our stuff and started eating. I realized there was a pretty big crack in my cup that ice cream was dripping out of so I asked for an extra cup to cover it with. Then I realized that there was only one big reese's cup in the middle of the ice cream and it wasn't crunched up or mixed in. (I had only taken like two or three bites at this point.) I tried breaking it up with my spoon but it wasnt working so I went and asked an employee what they could do. They said they would give me a new ice cream and that was fine. I got the second ice cream and again there was just one reese's cup but this time it was cracked in half and put on top. I dug through and that was the only one. At this point I was a little upset because my friends were basically done and I hadn't gotten the Blizzard I ordered, just vanilla ice cream with a piece of candy on top. I asked the employee agai. What was going on and they did they were out of the crushed reeses they usually have and they figured that was okay. Fine, they were improvising. I asked if there was anything else I could get because I didnt really want plain vanilla ice cream and half a candy bar. The manager told me  o as I had already gotten a second ice cream free and I'd have to pay for something else. My friends were pissed at me because I \"should be happy they tried to help and I'm making a scene.\" I wasn't yelling, throwing stuff, or being mean. I just wanted what I paid for. Had I ordered plain vanilla ice cream in a cup, that would be fine. But I paid for a blizzard. I threw the now melted cup of ice cream away and left because it wasnt worth an argument/fight over 2.50. I was pissed though because I ended up getting three bites of mediocre ice cream that I had to pay for.\n\n(I do not think the employee that tried to help me is the asshole in this situation. They were doing their best to make my order correct under non ideal circumstances.)",

      "description": "We know each other for years, he had one relationship before (middle school) with girl that was really unstable emotionally, and he couldn't bear with her, it took several broke ups to wrap up things, because after each she was begging him to stay and start over.\n\nAfter that he was alone for over ten years, dating and romancing along the way, but he just couldn't find good match for him.\n\nSome time ago he met this girl, he seemed very enthusiastic about her and anxious to see if they could be together. It seemed as love at first sight case and it progressed good. I should mention that this is long-distance relationship and she is quite younger than him. \n\nIn few weeks he needed to get off his chest more than one problem :\n  -\t She is panicking if he don't respond to her in 5-15 minutes, sometimes even if forewarned. So he need to stay on phone and watch out during the day until she goes to bed. \n  -\t She have heavy hitting depression, leading her into vicious cycles of disparaging herself, \n  -\t She had suicide attempts and has certain attraction to this topic,\n  -\t He can't talk with her about feelings or any \"real stuff\", because she would disengage immedietaly every time. \n\nAt this point I was giving him general reassurances and we had few exhaustive long talks about those problems, he was really disturbed by her depression appearing out of nowhere and her vicious treatment of herself. At the same time he was interested in her and additionaly he was excited to the possibility of stopping being a virgin. He was also worried that he can't really talk with her. I stressed how important it is to have conversations about what he feels and how he needs to be able to talk with her about more serious stuff. I also warned him that stuff can get serious after having sex (which they eventually did after some struggles and delays). \n\nAfter that came real bad month, she didn't receive her scholarship, she wanted to get scholarship to be comfortably able to move out of parents house and without it she would be down to the renting single room with other people, which she couldn't accept because she had set certain plan for life and when she was failing following it in any way it would throw her really deep deep down.\n\nDuring that month he couldn't sleep, being fearfull about her dying on him every day, sometimes to the point of no sleep at all. He seemed tense and strained almost every day. He also wasn't able to talk with her at all and was feeling abandoned (while he was constantly chatting) because apparently she is generally disinterested in things that he likes. He was also worried about talking with her about his feelings because she might commit suicide. He would stick to the chatting and reassuring her all the time. \nIn the end after few more talks I told him that this is not a sustainable situation, because he need to be able to express his feelings and his interests without fears such as this. I warned him that she might start to depend on him emotionally and it could turn very ugly then. \nFunniest thing is that very next day she sent him message saying that if it wouldn't be for him she would probably have tried to kill herself again. (he was astonished that she would write this just after our talk on the topic, so he showed me this). \n\nSome better times ensued, and he was looking better for a few weeks. Unfortunately it wouldn't last. He started to once again being anxious and tense, about this time I started thinking that maybe I should just tell him that this is very bad direction. So when he approached me, he laying on a couch with distress and hollow gaze, and after he laid out that she is suicidal again and he is scared shitless, and after some talking about this I asked him:\n  -\t Realistically, how do you see you two working out and you being happy?\n\nTo which his reply was that he will be happy if she will be cured of depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nI pointed out that he rests his happiness on significant change of hers situation, thinking and emotions, which is pretty shaky grounds in any relationship. \n\nI also went on with saying that it's insane to be so afraid for her life all the time. And that he was very unhappy very early into relationship with her and was unable to communicate with her about that. \n\nI summarized other problems I mentioned earlier, and said that there are a lot of red flags present, and that I am worried that he would blame himself if she should do something to herself in future or that he would become accustomed with that kind of thing and reliving her vicious cycles through the years while being trapped by suicide threats. \n\nHe didn't really complain, but I felt like a jerk interfering with my friend choices. With time I also felt being cut off a little, and felt certain difference in our friendship which I cannot really explain other way than him feeling some regret about what I told him.\nI personally think that I would do it again anyway, it seems like most obvious red flag ridden thing for me. \n\nMaybe you guys will have different thoughts and perspectives? AITA? ",

They asked me not to tell that to her and I didnt because I wasn't really worrying that they even get that far. But one day she heard from a bet which was about her and the following days she begged me to tell her what it was about since she knew that i knew what it was. And after a long time thinking about it i decided that she should know that. My classmates weren't to happy to hear that so they didn't speak to me for a few weeks.  What do you think?",

      "description": "She's in her 20's, has several mental health issues such as depression and social anxiety and lives with our grandmother. I visited my grandmother this winter break and my mom, which I had not seen in years, also came. We all live in Brazil.\n\nMe and my sister had fought just a few days before this title incident and frankly I think getting physical and threatening me, and telling me to kill myself unbelievable. I had beat her back in a moment of rage when she clawed her nails in my arm and told her to stay the fuck away from me.  Everybody got mad at me for hitting her back so hard. (I'm M, 15). That was because me and my younger cousin made gentle fun of her english when she was boasting about it when she tried speaking to our little english speaking half-sister. So she started hitting me.\n\nWe haven't talked for days until today, when she found a charger in the living room, accused me of doing it, and when I said I hadn't do it she told me she'll choke me on my sleep. I called her a fucking crazy bitch, and said I didn't regret it when my mom got mad at me for it. I told my mom i'd call her a bitch again and again, and that she is crazy and I feel unsafe.\n\nI feel like i'm unsafe here in the household, and everybody's mad at me for my vocabulary. Everyone's mad at me and telling me that I wasn't like this, swearing and all, but I feel genuinely scared. AITA? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The message may have been a little harsh but it’s what she needed to hear so I sent it and Marie basically sent a massage back saying it’s because she “cares too much” and how she was just trying to “help”  and she wished us good luck in life and this is what she gets for asking questions and caring too much. \nBut she’s never once mention her intentions to help it’s all been malevolent\nI want to believe that she had good intentions but it’s hard and I can’t tell if she’s honest or being manipulative and trying to cover her ass.\n\n\nI’m sorry if this is confusing I’m trying to explain everything but with keeping privacy and keeping it short. All in all I would like to hear others opinions. Sorry if this post doesn’t belong here just not sure where to turn. \n\n",

Now tonight my mom wants to go to my aunt's house to have a game night with just a couple of cousins and my aunt.\n\nI'm am an introvert and I like going out a couple nights a week, but now, I'm just tired. I cannot deal with going out every night and seeing a multitude of people for hours. My cousin is pretty bummed because he won't have as much fun without me there and I feel like a bit of an asshole. My aunt even said they could come over to our house instead. I just don't want to be around people anymore and I made that clear to my mom. So now they are going to my aunt's house without me and they won't have as much fun. My family isn't saying I'm bad for not wanting to go, but I still feel like a letdown. AITA?",

      "description": "So I would like to first tell you about the whole situation. I am a fairly shy introverted person and my friend Vikky (fake name) was fairly similar. We shared interests in Memes, television series like The Office and Brooklyn Nine Nine. We had some Highschool courses together and after a semester became best friends. We were very talkative together and brought out eachothers sense of dark humour. We started talking on Facetime almost daily, hanging out at school, and on lunch breaks. I had a crush on her, but as I said I was **very** shy about things that can blow up and make me uncomfortable. Halfway through the year one of her friends attempted suicide in school. This was very scary for me and I have necrophobia (irrational fear of death). Later on I mention how I can not deal with the topic of death and ESPECIALLY suicide (Important to remember). I say that I had thought her friend wascute but the stress would kill me, I would also think it was my fault no matter what. We change topics and continue talking the rest of the night. Summer rolls around and she starts saying that she wants to tell me something, but is scared of me becoming awkward. She continues avoiding the point and I get pissed off and I Ghost her for the next day. She says later on that she liked me (I had the feeling) we talk about it and I say, \"I want a relationship with you, but I am very busy for the next few months (Vacations, summer camps, and dancing classes)\". She says it will be fine and I go with it, we started dating. We talk and talk online, but I did not have time to meet because of eight hours of work and four hours of online schooling. We met up once at a location near the school and grabbed lunch and talked, it was nice. I go on the big trip which I had been looking forward to for **two years.** I leave and we text because we were keeping the relationship to us and some friends. One night halfway through my trip she sent a snapchat of her leg with a large cut through it. I knew she had trouble with depression and anxiety so I asked her what happened. She said, **\"Please don't be mad.\"** I knew exactly what she was going to say. She had cut her leg (Purposely) and her Mom was not home so she had to walk 3.2km at twelve Pm. She knew that I would not like it because of when her friend tried to end it. I was SO done with it and stopped talking until I was back. Our communication levels deteriorated until School started up again.  We talked less and less over the weeks because I felt I lost the spark, I was going to break up with her until I was told by a mutual friend that she was going through \"Hard times\" so I called her that night (knowing that it could be REALLY BAD). She said she was fine after I asked her several times so we moved on and talked about different topics. I postponed it for about two weeks until she texted me to, \"just break up with me already\" I said that I wanted too talk to her about it and she reluctantly did after plenty of asking. She thought that I did not spend enough time with her and it was true, but I had told her that I was REALLY BUSY. I said I was very sorry but I think we should break up. I wanted to stay friends, but she said to, \"stop pitying me\". She blocked me and then ended all our communications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have thought of this ever since. I feel guilty but thier was a part of me that felt she was started all the problems. I would like to hear all of your opinions because maybe it will be less of my thoughts day to day and because I am returning to normal school soon (I did an outdoor program away from the school). \n\nThanks.",

      "description": "So, every night me and my dad play Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s not the best at the game, although he is improving. When we play, he always insists on picking my character, so he has a better chance at winning. I’m normally fine with this, as it gives me more of a challenge. \n\nFor our first match tonight, he picks Ganondorf for himself and Zero Suit Samus for me. Great. A character I haven’t played yet. I lose, only taking one of his Stock. Today was not my best day, with girl trouble and other things at school. I’m a little annoyed, and ask if I can pick my own character. He has a smug look on his face and accepts. This rubbed me the wrong way, for some reason. I mean, he won a single match in the past three days. Yay him. But now he’s acting like he’s invincible or something. \n\nI instantly go for King K. Rool, like the complete dick I am. He’s not my main, but I know about the cannon and vacuum bullshit, and feel like toying with him. I beat him back against the edge, and spam the vacuum. I knock out two of his Stocks, and can’t help but laugh. He gets pissed, because he doesn’t know how to avoid it. He just wastes his last Stock by running off the edge. I get a little annoyed that he would give up, but his excuse is that I chose a garbage character. \n\nHe gets up to leave, and I ask him to play one more match. He hesitantly accepts the offer, and I immediately burst out laughing. He asks if it’s about the last match, and I’m like, “oh just you wait.” The match starts, and I chose Ridley, and again, spam the same attack, in this case his side special, the command grab. I throw him off the edge and shoot some plasma balls, but he isn’t having any of it. After the quick history, he gets up and leaves, clearly upset. \n\nI felt a little bad initially, but it was some of the only fun I’ve had all day. Am I the asshole here?",

My boyfriend had spent the night at my old house with me the night before to help me move, but honestly I just wanted him to live with me because I didn't want to be alone. I ended up asking him to stay, which required him to quit his old job because he doesn't have a car and couldn't walk that far. I realized I would be the only support system when I asked him to move in. But, things are getting tough. I'm extremely stressed out due to the fact that I'm the only one paying bills and buying groceries while he gets to sleep in and play video games all day. He helps clean which I'm extremely grateful for and he says he's been looking for jobs but none has called back. I just want to know if I'm the asshole for hounding him to get a job.

I live in another city and my brother and my mom help him with moving to a smaller place after we sold his house.\n\nI wrote my younger brother about the [impending GPS rollover](https://www.gpsworld.com/homeland-security-provides-info-about-2019-gps-rollover-event/) and sent him [that article](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/12/current_gps_epoch_ends/).\n\nThe conversation went a bit like this:\n\n\n**Me**: Hey could you ask our dad about what kind of Volvo he drives? I'd like to check with them if the model has safeguards against the rollover event.\n\n**Brother**: *sends pictures of demolished Volvo* I flipped it over with a bulldozer and it's pretty roughed up now. Has dents in it's roof now.\n\n**Me**: I'm not talking about this kind of rollover. Have you read the article?\n\n**Brother**: *sends grumpy cat meme with \"no\" caption*\n\n**Me**: Okay, it's fine. I'll just ask him myself.\n\n**Brother**: don't do it. We have other stuff to do here.\n\n**Me**: I'm serious, his car is like 15 years old and does not have any active internet connection to patch it. He might freak out of his GPS stops working in the middle of a drive. I don't want this to happen.\n\n**Brother**: We are moving in the next couple of days and I don't want him to worry. It's challenging to write an email for him at this point.\n\nMe: It's just the model number. He does not have to know the reason why I'm asking.\n\n**Brother**: FUCK SAKE BLKPINGU\n\n**Brother**: STAND DOWN \n\n**Brother**: IF YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ASK OUR MOM\n\n**Brother**: The car is not a priority at this point\n\n**Me**: Okay, fine. Have a great valentines day. Thanks for the conversation.\n\nI was pissed at this point but I feel like I have done enough to shed light on the problem.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I feel like the asshole, but I also feel like my reaction is justified. \n\nI’ve been through a lot in my life. It hasn’t always been easy. I smoke to help cope a bit with what I can, but It’s not like that was the first solution. I’ve been to therapy and taken psychiatric meds, and nothing helps as much as a little bit of green once in a while. The girl i’ve been talking to doesn’t like drugs; I understand and respect that, but tonight things got a little out of hand and i snapped at her.\n\n I told her that she doesn’t have any clue what kind of trauma i’ve endured in my life and if she really didn’t like me smoking to cope with it then we didn’t have to keep talking. I told her that her judgemental attitude about what I was doing with my life (which i’ve never ever let impact her, i’ve never talked to her when I was high) was coming off as condescending to me and that she was trying to be morally superior over a moot issue since I’m going to continue doing something that helps me make my life a fraction of a bit more endurable, and I kind of vomited a bunch of shit that’s happened to me all at once on her to try and make her understand why I continue to smoke. \n\nI obviously made her upset and I feel bad about it, but I also feel entirely justified in my anger considering I’ve never let it impact her and its my life to do what I wish with. It’s not like i’m doing meth, for crying out loud. \n\nSo, AITA?",

I'm trying to help where I can with daily household chores, and aside from some minor venting to my fiancé and close friends, have been keeping the little things that bother me to myself. Things like not cleaning up after their pets, hoarding, etc are all ignored as best we can because it's not our house and we're just grateful to have a place to stay at the moment.\n\nOne thing has started to push me over the edge. Someone is leaving pee in the toilet bowl, unflushed, lid open. This happens every couple of days and it's a nasty surprise.  I feel like I should probably just internally fume and put it away with the rest of our silent daily gripes. It's their house and we're just their guests for a time.

      "description": "So this actually isn’t my story, but a friend’s. It took place years ago. So it’s more of ARTA (are THEY the asshole)? \n\nShe was with her boyfriend for about two years at the time that this happened. They had a habit of breaking and making up (which is already a bad sign). They had a particularly bad fight and he dumped her; she was really upset over it and thought he truly meant it. \n\nThere was this guy she had a pretty toxic relationship with (they dated for a couple of months) prior to settling down with her SO. Her SO didn’t like him and didn’t like her having any contact with him. Well, the night they broke up, she went to a house party with some friends to get her mind off of it. The guy was there, and they left to have sex. She told me she actually cried in the middle of it, and I don’t think(?) they finished. \n\nThe next morning, her SO (who she thought was now her ex) hits her up like nothing happened (I think; it also could have been him apologizing—some of the details are fuzzy now). She tells him what happened. He flips out. \n\nHe says that she “cheated” on him, even though she thought their relationship was over for good. He must have assumed they were on the same page since they’ve had similar breakups before? Anyway, he and all his friends trashed her for weeks, and she did everything she could to apologize and get him back. They did get back together for like two weeks until he broke it off again. \n\nA year afterwards, they still talked and hooked up occasionally, but the bitterness he felt for the whole situation was still intact, so they never got back together. \n\nWhen she first told me this, I thought ESH. Her for doing what she did with the worst guy she could’ve done it with, and him for refusing to see her side of the story and labeling her a cheater and bitch, and continuing to do so today. \n\nIt’s such a Ross and Rachel scenario, and I’m curious as to what everyone else’s take on this would be.

      "description": "Stick with me here. It's a little long.\n\nI work for a police department as a security officer. The building I work in has pretty high security, but less than an airport. So already you can probably get the armed services vibe of \"do what you're told and don't ask questions\". But I'm not in the military, and I don't get paid enough to not ask questions.\n\nI always need to know the reason behind things. It's just the way my brain works. I'm always asking \"why?\". If I am given an answer that makes sense for the results, I am great. The problem comes whenever things that I'm told to do or the way we're doing things don't make sense. My supervisor has already told me I should put more trust him and not ask so many questions. I didn't like that.\n\nHere's the most recent situation: We're currently short staffed. He's taking an officer from one area and moving them to another area that already has 2 other officers. That leaves me with more work to do, and it's barely possible to complete everything assigned. The other person that was pulled now has no assignments. My supervisor keeps saying it's because we're short staffed, which is barely relevant because having more staff would just mean maybe 1 more person on shift and less overtime. So no matter what, we would have about the same amount of people on shift. I talked to him about this, and asked him why he'd do this. We had a civil discussion and came to the agreement that the officer would only be pulled away on days when the other building is particularly busy (day by day basis). However today he has ignored our conversation and left me to do everything myself while the other officer has nothing to do. I asked my assistant supervisor why since he's running shift today, and he said, \"I don't know. You'll have to ask [our supervisor]\". I want to email my supervisor asking him why he is still doing it this way, but frankly I feel like I'm coming off as TA.\n\nI know for a fact they're pissed that I always question them, but I'm good at my job. I work hard and do a lot for the department. I try to put myself in his shoes and think about how I'd feel if I was constantly questioned. AITA for constantly questioning my supervisor?",

Also, when I was fired from my job she offered me a part time job right away. (I ended up turning it down because it didn’t pay enough.) \n\nOn the other hand, I already have a lot of my plate. She has her own business (ie schedule) and our kids are at school for nine hours; I don’t know why she needs to work 12 hrs on one day. I’m an introvert, I’m going back to school at the same time, and I’m just not looking forward to it.\n\nAm I an asshole for not helping another mom when she needs it?",

      "description": "My roommate and I live in a two bedroom apartment. At the moment, we have our friend, who is my best friend, and her dog staying with us for a little bit. Tonight both my roommate (A) and my friend (B) left our apartment for two hours so that I could have some privacy while a friend is over. The friend and I went back to my room to hang out. We decided to leave the dog out instead of putting him in his crate. The dog has a history of going number 2 on the carpet when left alone, but I figured it wouldn't 'use' the carpet because it could hear us in my room.... Anyway, 2 hours later A came back, while B went to go do something else. A little bit over 2 hours after A came back (4 hours from when I went to my room), my friend was going to leave and I walked into the living room to see that the dog had shit on the floor 3 times, both me and A were surprised by this. When I texted B to ask where her doggy bags were, she told me that A had already texted her and told her about the dog poop on the floor 2 hours ago. I am very angry by this, and confronted my roommate about it. She thinks that since it isn't her dog, it isn't her responsibility. Which I agree with, but when an animal makes a mess, regardless of who's fault it is, you clean it up so that the smell and the mess is gone. She doesn't get it and she is too defensive for me to bring it up anymore. I just need to know if I'm right with how I feel about this whole situation. Should she have cleaned it up? \n\n\n\n\nAm I the asshole for being so angry? ",

      "description": "Some backstory: I am the oldest of 5 children, and my mom has cerebral palsy. My parents are divorced, so my dad lives about 15 minutes away. My mom is only disabled to the point where she has a severe limp, nothing affects her mental ability or upper body. She is also overweight.\n\nShe is always late. Always. \nExamples:\n\nOne Sunday (switch day), my mom offered to drive me and my siblings to my dad's house a few hours early. We had gotten a few inches of snow the night before, and all my best friends were going sledding. She said she would give us a ride if we cleaned the house. Me and my 2 sisters cleaned the entire house, top to bottom, for about 3 hours, and we were ready at about 11:00. \n\nMy mom said she would drop us off right after she made lunch for us. We don't normally have a sit-down lunch, so I was not expecting to have one, especially when we had plans. Sundays are usually fend-for yourself days. I was expecting her to just heat up some pizza or something fast like that. \n\nI texted my friends, after confirming with my mom, that we would be there around 11:30. Keep in mind, she AGREED to 11:30. \n\nSuddenly, I hear sizzling from the kitchen. I look in, and I see my mom cooking salmon on the stove top. I ask her what, and she replies \"I'm making lunch for the boys (my 2 younger brothers, 9 and 6). \n\nThey are pretty used to being home alone, and it would have been only 30 minutes.\n\nShe continued making lunch, and at 11:45, she had made 6 plates of salmon, rice, and mixed vegetables. She called us all, and seemed very confused when we didn't want to sit and eat with her. At this point, we were already 15 minutes late, and eating lunch and cleaning up would have taken at least 30 minutes. I was thankful that she made such a nice lunch, but I really wanted to go and hang out with my friends. \n\nDespite our protests, my mom, my 2 brothers, and 1 sister sat down and ate. It took 45 minutes for them to finish. \n\nWhen they were done, my mom went on to go to the bathroom for 15 minutes and we finally left at 12:45, and didn't get there until 1.\n_______________\n\nSo, I last week, I had a 4 day field trip, and we had to be at the school at 6 AM to catch the bus. Knowing her, I told her we had to be there at 5:30 to get the bus, so we would (hopefully) get there on time. \n\nWell, she found out, and started asking me why. I responded truthfully, and she started screaming at me. She said she's \"trying her best\" and \"she can't be perfect\" and \"just accept me\". I tried to have a reasoned discussion, with her, but she wouldn't listen.\n\nI got my dad to drive me there **on time**, by the way.\n\nSo, AITA for being annoyed at her like this? I know it's hard to manage 5 kids, but I don't get it sometimes.",

      "description": "Lately i have had more sparetime than usual as the workload have been reduced, that has allowed me more time to enjoy my hobby and game with my buddies. We are playing games that require communication, and we are usually doing callouts and having fun. However, im talking with a normal voice level, im not screaming, or making noice above what is considered normal in a conversation. I always stop playing before 22.00, and never start playing before 12.00 at the afternoon. I have stated clearly several times to the dorm, if it is too loud, tell me so i can reduce my voice. The walls in our dorm is pretty thin, and it is easy to hear if someone is having a conversation at the other side, but not what people are saying, so its somewhat of a low buzzing noice.   \n\n\nI feel like what she demanded yesterday crossed a border, in what a dorm member can demand out of a roomate. She asked me to take a gaming break, as it had been alot lately, and she stated, she could not rest well when i was gaming in the evening. And i responded, that ill try to keep quiet and reduce my voice level so she can rest. She then stated, \"that would not work, we have tried that\" She also said im not asking you to quit gaming, but that it does not have to happen so much, and we can plan what days you can play and what days not to play. That is when i stood my ground, as i am paying just as much for living here, i game in my own room, i try as much as i can to be quiet, i respect our sleep times and dont make loud noices. And when i have spare time, i want to decide for myself when i want to game with my friends, I do not want to be limited in that area of my life by her. I clearly stated ill try to be as quiet as possible, and she can tell me anytime if it is too loud.   \n\n\nSo in my case, I really don't like this lady at all, living with her is hell ( I have lived in several dorms, never had a serious problem with anyone else). But im not an undecent person, and i dont want her to be unable to rest, or do anything productive work at home when i am gaming, but i feel this is an exaggereation, as she also said \"i find your voice fucking annyoing\".\n\nAm i the asshole if i refuse to find a compromise on this?   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ",

Cause right know a couple of employees called out and we don’t have anyone else to close”.\n\nSo im a pretty chill guy i have never been disrespectful to anyone but at that time i felt like he was being disrespectful to me so i raise my voice and i told him”Are you f***ing kidding me,my grandma passed away and you only care about me being on my shift F**k you and i hang up” \n\nBtw i have never called out before is my first time,Days prior that happening i was really sick and i still made it to work and i was the only employee who stayed cause everybody called out.\n\nAnd Also i see that after that i have less hours on my schedule when i always have 40 hours now is down to 34 for some reason and is seems a little fishy to me.  \n\nP.S I Love my job but management sometimes makes the job a shitty place.",

      "description": "My oldest uncle got diagnosed with stomach cancer last week and may only have a few weeks/months to live. He is considered to be moderate mentally retarded and lives in a state group home, about 2-3 hours from my Grandmother’s house. I couldn’t tell you the last time they’ve seen each other, as neither of them travel very well- my Grandmother refuses to leave her house except to go to the doctor (begrudgingly), and my uncle- leaving the group home, even for a few hours, makes him incredibly stressed. He didn’t even want to spend the night at my dad’s house after spending all day at the hospital having test and test run.\n\nMy father is the primary caretaker/power of attorney for both of them. My dad has a way of being an emotional burden on people, and uses situations like this to complain and emotionally overburden everyone around him- he loves to be the center of attention and be perceived as this caring man when he’s actually very selfish. I’m ok with him dumping all his emotional baggage on me because he’s done it my whole life and now it’s just par for the course. What I’m not okay with is him burdening my Grandmother. \n\nMy fear is that he will overwhelm my already very confused/distraught Grandmother with the stress of what’s going on with my uncle. She’s tough, but I’m afraid this kind of news would make her decline even faster, if not kill her. I mean there’s also the chance that we tell her, she has a huge meltdown, and forgets a few hours later. But then... do we put her through that every few days leading up to his passing? \n\nI’m preparing to lose both of them in 2019, but I have a feeling my Grandmother will outlive my uncle.",

She didn't notify me that she was going to move my stuff.\n\nI moved my stuff back, and when I notified her about it, she kinda freaked out. I'm shocked by the hostile nature of her messages, and absolute refusal to discuss it in person. She messaged me like I'm a stranger, not even considering for a moment the countless times I helped her out with things during the last two years. I temporarily moved my stuff to my room since there was no possibility to even argue, and I noticed the last few weeks that my things get used by other people, which I don't like. I'm ready to cut ties with this person and ignore her for the rest of the semester. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "About 5 years ago I got a new job that paid a lot better and moved into a neighborhood where the houses are rather far apart, I’d say probly about 100 meters or so. Most people use that space for outbuildings like garages, storage, pool house, etc so it’s not uncommon to have buildings on your property that are close to somebody else’s house. I used this new found space to build a little auto shop to be able to work on cars, mostly just a series of passion projects but I have been trying to get into detailing and repair business. Because of this I usually have approx 4-6 cars on the property, some are total junkers and are used mostly for parts and some are functioning. I only really have time to work on my days off (the weekend) and tend to keep to the standard 9-5 hours when doing work on the cars because I acknowledge it can be pretty loud and noise travels pretty easily where I live. About 6 months ago a new family moved into the house next door, to give some perspective I can see their front door from my garage but it’s still rather far. Since then I’ve had a deputy sheriff at my house 3 times to talk to me about my, “unacceptable level of noise” as well as an official HOA letter about their complaints, I know it’s them because the deputy had come from their house prior to mine. They’ve never talked to me about it in person or voiced any opinions to me, I feel like all this is very passive aggressive. Would I be the asshole if I kept ignoring them and doing what I’ve been doing? ",

      "description": "My ex-boyfriend and I bought concert tickets a few months ago for a show coming up in a month. One of his friends got excited about it, and my boyfriend asked him to come (with my permission). I was cool with it, since he’s my friend too. He was going to bring along his girlfriend who is one of my closest friends, which made me even more excited. \n\nSince then, my boyfriend broke up with me over text after we’d been together for pushing 1.5 years and were planning on moving in together after college graduation in a couple months. Needless to say, I’m heartbroken and no longer going to the concert. \n\nI know my friend and her bf haven’t bought tickets yet, but are still planning on going. WIBTA if I explained how much it would hurt my feelings if my girl friend went? I feel like it’s reasonable, and her boyfriend can just take my ticket. ",

      "description": "I have developed depression due to some severe traumatic experiences I went through since our marriage over a year ago. We live long distance (oceans apart) due to having financial problems which contributes a lot to my said depression. My husband doesn’t give me proper timing and always prioritizes his friends. He usually isn’t the one being loving and caring either. Usually I have to initiate things for him to even say anything. But he tells me hes more of an action man than words and can’t do much since we are apart. Anyways, I told him yesterday about an argument I had with my sister which really triggered self-hatred and sensitive feeling in me to which he was talking to me for about half an hour and said that we will talk later. \n\nQue 12 hours later and I’m still waiting to talk to him since I do not discuss these things with anyone else. He knew I was waiting and got really upset at him when he finally called because I wanted some of his time and that he should have been there for me. He went to sleep as I was talking to him on the phone and I started to cry which woke him and he got angry and told me to go find someone else to bother and hung up the phone. I know sometimes it can be too much to have someone be wanting your attention. But he is the only person if I speak to him I feel better. Am I an asshole for demanding him to be there for me when I have an episode like this? ",

      "description": "For background, I live with my girlfriend and another couple. I am the only one who has graduated and started a full time job about two months ago, the rest of them are in their final semesters of college. My girlfriend and I started dating about halfway through our lease, so as a result the two of us are each paying 1/3rd of the rent and have separate rooms still. The other couple splits the remaining 1/3rd, despite having the far larger master bedroom with their own private bathroom attached. \n \nRecently there have been minor issues that I’ve had with the other couple that have mostly been pushed aside. These issues include them moving their cat’s litter box out into the living room of the apartment, right next to our kitchen counter. Another is them leaving their weed and paraphernalia on that same section of the kitchen counter, which creates an unappetizing environment to cook in. With some other typical roommate complaints, like them being loud late into the evenings and not doing their share of chores, the tension has been building, at least on my side. \n\nI really should have said something about these smaller issues as they came up, but I was pretty much fine with letting them slide for the remaining 3 months of our lease together. However, yesterday a conversation that I had with the woman of the couple about her sick brother has brought all of it to the table. \n\nHer brother is a freshman at the same college and lives in the dorms, and has come down with a cold this weekend. On Friday night, she brought her brother over to our apartment after my girlfriend and I had already gone to bed and had him sleep on the couch in our living room. Her brother will typically spend between 1-3 nights on our couch every week and does multiple loads of laundry in our in-unit washer, without any notice to my girlfriend or myself. We usually don’t mind because he’s not too imposing. However, this most recent time is different in my opinion because he is likely contagious and spending all day and all night living in our common areas where we hang out and eat.\n\nI feel like I was dismissed immediately without any discussion when I brought my complaints to my roommate, even though her bringing a sick person to live in our common areas impact everyone who lives in the apartment. I feel like it is a reasonable request that he should sleep somewhere else when he’s sick, such as his dorm room or their bedroom. I’m not requesting that he never comes over, or doesn’t sleep on the couch when he’s healthy. \n\nWould it be out of line to ask that they start paying more in rent for the remaining 3 months (individually my girlfriend and I would be paying 30% of the total each, and they would each be paying 20% for a total of 40%)? I feel like this is reasonable with the current situation.\n\nTL;DR: Roommate’s brother is sick and sleeping in our living room, I asked to change that.",

We would like to speak positively to the 12 year old daughter but temper that with realistic expectations. His family and his sex worker girlfriend will not allow us to speak to his case/social worker at the hospital so we can know whats going on and HIIPA doesnt let the the staff speak to us directly. Also the family is texting the 12 year old giving her updates directly (against our wishes) So here we are, picking up the pieces of a 12 year olds heart every night. The latest happened this morning. We were scheduled to meet with the social worker on his care team this morning until his girlfriend forbid it, We have now decided that until someone gives us an update or we can speak to a social worker, we will not be bringing the daughter for visits. This pains me because she should see her dad. (even though they wont let her if her mother is with her) But she should not have to deal with a bunch of strangers telling her her dad will be okay when he wont be. AITA for keeping her away from the hospital until we can know what his prognosis is? As you reply, please keep in mind the welfare of a 12 yo child.",

      "description": "I just started at a new school and I sit with the girls in my homeroom class at lunch, who are nice to me but don’t seem to like a lot of the other people in our grade. There groups “leader” I guess, A, doesn’t like another girl, B, and while the group was talking A called her a slut. \n\nB and I were talking later that day and she started talking about how mean the girls I sit with are, so I told her that someone called her a slut. I dont know why I brought it up, I guess I was trying to agree, but I didn’t tell B who said this about her. She started getting upset, a lot more than I thought she would be, and asked me if it was A who said that. I didn’t say anything, and she yelled “I knew it” and left.\n\nThe next morning when I got to school all the girls I sit with were standing in a circle talking quietly, then when I went up to them one of them said “there she is”. As soon as A saw me she ran up to me and started screaming about “how dare I” tell B she said that, calling me a bitch, and a lot of other things I don’t really remember. I was really embarrassed because everyone in the courtyard could hear her and it was only my fourth day of school.\n\nAm I an asshole for telling B? I think that you shouldn’t say things about people that you’re not willing to say to their face, and A seemed so confident I assumed she had told B this before. I’m still sitting with them (this was last week) because I have other friends in the group but A gives me the stink eye every time she sees me and it makes me really nervous to be around her. I’m starting to think I shouldn’t have said anything. Anyway, thanks for reading\n\n\n\n",

My husband and I were invited. \n\nWe told the planner (his older sister) that we likely wouldn’t be going. There are about 25 kids on the guest list, and they wanted us to take an entire 3 days off of work and stay in a hotel about an hour and a half away from home. Both of us work weekends 98% of the time, since that’s when we get overtime pay. \n\nWe both had the full capability to take those days off and go, but we didn’t want to. \n\nWe live a very child free life, and we don’t visit anyone due to some drama surrounding his younger sister and her drug and attitude issues. (Very long story, but it’s bad enough to keep us far away from them, as they are all absorbed into her drama.)\n\nSo we didn’t go.

      "description": "We (f/30) (m/31) had a fight about a controversial issue. He took it personal. We made up, but after 2 days, he said he felt judged and broke up with me bc he doesn't want me to resent him 1 day. We make up again and the very next day which is a week before our big trip across the world, he says we have to postpone the trip. He says he doesn't understand why I'm mad and that it's bc of money. I tell him I still want to go and he says the trip was for us to go together. I told him it's not fair he decided for me and if he can't, I still want to go. That night, we talk on phone but turns into yelling at him and being mean. I apologize the next day for the way I acted and he breaks up with me again after thinking over the night before. I tell him I respect his decision to break up and I still want to go on the trip together even as friends. We talk in person a few days later about everything with it ending on a note that he might end up going on the trip with me after all. The next day (Mon.), I wanted to know for sure bc our flight was on Fri. (today). He says we're not going and I ended up texting him later that night I'm done and need a more stable relationship. He tries to convince me all day not to break up. Says he's sorry for breaking up twice but I was being a jerk and he was mad. I tell him I need him to email the ticket and 2 weeks apart for both of us to think about everything. Those were my terms. He tries to convince me not to go on a break bc I'll cheat on him and he doesn't want me to go on the trip. I promised I wouldn't go and also not to talk to anyone else and told him that he has to trust me. After arguing all day, he sends another screenshot of tix. I told him I didn't trust him and the email. He sent me a screenshot of the airbnb. I stood my ground and said I needed the email by end of day. We discussed a lot and I felt like we could make this work despite all the recent turmoil. I realized he hadn't sent the email yet and told him he had til noon today (Thu.). It was after noon and the day went bad from our fight and got worse from a series of events at work (unrelated). I brought up the email that he needs to send again. I told him I really need him to send it now bc I didn't want him to always wonder if I would have gone on the trip if he had sent it anyway. He said it gives him anxiety to think about it bc of past experiences and he just can't. So I said if he didn't send it by 6:30, this would be it for us. He texts me at 6 that he'll be busy til 8:30. I said no email no us. At 10pm he said he's home and he's talking like we're still doing the 2 week break and he's going to work on everything we discussed. I told him we're done bc he didn't send the email.\n\ntldr; Boyfriend postpones big trip across world week before flight without discussing. I tell him to email the itinerary for proof but I won't go. He doesn't send it because he thinks I will go and I break up with him. AITA?",

      "description": "I work 3rd shift by myself 3 days of the week. It is usually pretty slow, which gives me an opportunity to watch some movies in my free time. I finished most of my work for the night and sat down in the lobby to watch a movie. \n\nI started the movie and my coworker sat down because she doesnt have a ride and is waiting for her husband to pick her up. She said she was gonna hang with me and watch some of the movie while she did some computer work. The movie started and she said she had to call her mom, i paused it because i thought it would be a quick call. After 5 minutes or so i played the movie and turned it down a bit. She kept talking and talking and it was getting irritating. She wasnt talking loud but i feel like i was there first and she was invading my space. I dont have a lot of free time tonight and was hoping to enjoy what free time i have. I ended up turning off the tv and leaving bcuz it was hard to take in the movie. \n\nWould i be the asshole for asking her to move to another room?\n\nI feel like i would, thats why i didnt",

      "description": "The title makes it seem pretty one sided, but hear me out. TL;DR at the bottom\n\nMe and a few friends (3 college-age guys) just moved into a new house this past summer, and it’s been great. The neighborhood is really nice, and it’s mostly families and older couples living here. We like to play live music with drums and amplified instruments, and we try to keep it reasonable; no music after 10, try to keep our voices down outside, etc.\n\nWe’ve gotten a couple (2) complaints from the neighbors about noise (the cops were called on one occasion) and so I’ve been very conscious lately of the level of noise we make.\n\nWell last night we went out to get some food at around 11 PM. As we’re leaving, one of my roommates starts yelling and making noise, so my friends and I tell him to stop. He does, we get in the car and go get our food. When we get back, closer to midnight now, he starts yelling again and I tell him to stop.\n\nSeemingly out of the blue, he gets super defensive about it, and claims that there shouldn’t be any issue, despite past complaints. “What are they going to do about it?” Was one of his arguments. I tried to explain that we should at least be courteous to the people who we have to live next to, but he blew me off and said that we always make a ton of noise in the backyard and nobody has ever said anything about it.\n\nThis sets me off because I have, on countless occasions, told everybody to quiet down because we were too loud. It hardly ever works, but the effort has to be made. I start yelling at him about it (we’re no longer outside) and he says that he doesn’t remember any time where I have said something about it. This is where I snapped and said “right, because you don’t listen to me. No one ever fucking listens to me.” He makes some remark about that being way out of left field.\n\nAt this point I realize that I’ve just completely invalidated my entire argument by letting out my own pent up emotions on the subject. I go outside and sit on my own while the rest of them watch Spongebob inside.\n\nI’ve come to the conclusion that what I did was wrong and that I should probably apologize, but I also don’t want the original problem to get swept under the rug if I try to be the bigger man.\n\nTL;DR: Roommate was making too much noise late at night, I snapped and yelled at him because I felt like I’d been ignored.\n\nSo, AITA?",

My friend then tried to persue me into going to her and getting a \"free\" drink (for him too), I didnt want to do that but since I was already a little bit drunk it didnt take much to accept it. She gave us the drinks and out of nowhere another two girls appeared and started to talk. When she saw me being more interested in them she left. \nSome time later I was going to take a photo with with my friends, when she appeared again and asked me for a dance, I told her I am taking a photo with friends and that I am bussy, which she responded that she is leaving soon and she is going to be waiting somewhere for me. I didnt want to decline, but also didnt want to dance with her. \nI told my friend to help me out and that when I approach her to just take me away and say that I need to go somewhere.\nWell... She happened to still be around and yeah.. she heard it all.

I spend a large majority of my time with the first couple and we hang out, play games, and watch movies together every night. The others in the house are always welcome, but are usually doing their own thing. \n\nLast week, the three of us decided that we were going to go to this Folk/Punk night at a rundown bar in town on Wednesday, and we brought it up consistently throughout the week. We invited the others, but didn't really have much hope since it seemed like it was going to be a weird and probably lame show, and they didn't show much interest. No one brought it up to us, or asked when we were going, so we assumed it was just going to be the three of us.\n\nWe ended up making a night of it, going to this art market at a brewery before heading to the show, and it turned out to be a lot of fun. Super weird, kinda uncomfortable at times, but it was good to get out of the house and try something new, and the music was better than we had expected. \n\nSince it was a Wednesday, and we had early class in the morning we were back to the house by 11. Two of our roommates were sitting on the couches talking, and looked unhappy when we walked in. We tried to tell them about the night, but they straight up ignored us and went to bed, only saying goodnight to each other, and acting really cold. This was odd, because like I said, we're all good friends who usually catch up at the end of the day. \n\nToday I found out that the reason they were acting so weird is that the one of them was apparently planning on coming with us, and was mad that we had left without her. \n\nSo AITA for leaving, even if we didn't know she was planning on coming?",

Its very small, basically one open room w/ kitchen, living room, beds. The only things we really decided on spliting are beds (obv) and desks. There is a couch facing the tv that i never sit in, that my roommate basically lives on.\n \nNow im not some super clean person, but i do like to keep things mostly clean, my roommate on the other hand... He litters the couch and his desk with crap, wrappers, dirty dishes, crumbs of food and other, not to mention theres crumbs and wrappers on the ground. Despite never using the couch, im adamant about keeping it clean, and often tell him to clean it up, he usually says hell do it next time he gets up from the couch. (As i said, basically lives on it)\n\nTo top it all of as soon as he gets up, he turns on the tv despite neither of us watching it. Now im usually on my computer with headphones on, but it still pisses me off. The tv is in the corner, to the right of my desk, so i can still see it in my peripheral vision, i can also still kinda hear it through my headphones. Ive told him multiple times about how it pisses me off, but he just shrugs it off and says he likes to have something playing in the background.\n\nHis excuse is that i never use the couch, so what is on and around it shouldnt matter to me. And since im watching videos with headphones in, the tv shouldnt matter either. Is he right? Am i just a nagging asshole or what?\n\nFirst post, so i hope i did everything  right, im also writing while in an extremely rocky bus, so if theres any mistakes, blame that.\n",

      "description": "I’ve been living with my roommates for about 2 years now. It’s three of us in one apartment, and rent is 1500 dollars a month. I’m going to give a little background and then get to the problem. \n\nBackground: \nEverything was going well, until one of my roommates got a dog without running it by any of us. It was a rescue, and it was not trained at all... for example it peed and pooped in the house EVERY. DAY. It would get into EVERYTHING, destroy it and rip it to shreds. Also, this roomate worked second shift and would leave the house at 2am... the dog howled and barked continuously until one of the other roommates (usually me) woke up to get it. I’m a student and don’t have class until 11am, and I usually stay up pretty late gaming or watching TV so I’ve been getting almost no sleep. I’d continue to try and work this out with said roomate but never got a sympathetic response, just “try giving her treats” or “buy earplugs”.\n\nAlso, the house is disgusting. My roommates do not clean. Dishes are stacked, the bathroom is disgusting, I stopped using the shower completely and started using the one at my SO’s place. I started buying disposable dish wear so I stopped feeling like doing every song dish after two years. Whenever I brought this up to them, they just shrugged and said it’s not that bad/they’d get to it soon/another lame excuse. \n \nThe problem: \nI moved out. I decided I had enough and my SO and I got a place together. I ran it past them, they said it was cool, and found another person to take my place, and I successfully moved everything out. \n\nNow, the person that said they would move in backed out and rent is due in a few days. They keep messaging me expecting to pay, but I literally don’t have an item there anymore and we had agreed I could move out. WIBTA if I refused to pay rent even though I’m on the lease? Or am I well within my means to refuse and make them split the 500 until they find someone to replace me? ",

      "description": "TL;DR: I made a new friend. She needed help kissing. I helped her. She confessed her feelings to me. I rejected her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome background: I'm a junior in high school. Before the school year I chose to take an extra Spanish class. My friend since middle school was in the same class sitting in the desk in front of me. Now, I'm a social guy, I like to introduce myself and get to know my neighbors. The girl sitting next to me, I could tell, was not as outgoing and kind of just gave me a side-eye look. I can understand obvious signs of \"Leave me alone.\" I thought nothing of it and went to class like usual. Fast forward a few weeks, I'm cracking jokes with my buddy and we're chatting like normal. I make one particular joke about his appearance and notice she chuckles. I took that opportunity to ask her name and get to know her, and eventually she came around and became our friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, we've been friends friends for a couple of months at that point. She has similar humor as me as we make fun of my friend and he gets us back. She has a similar blunt outlook on situations. She's basically a female version of me, and I loved that because I could say whatever I was thinking about to her and she understood and wouldn't get offended as if we've been friends for years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks after that, she mentioned she was crushing on some guy. I asked for his name or class and she said it was none of my business. I told her to get to know him and to give him a shot, I pretty much volunteered to be her wing man. She said she was shy because she never kissed anyone before. I, having two girlfriends in the past told her it's easy and that it was okay to be shy. She wasn't sure and I volunteered to help her with that. She agreed, and I helped her with kissing. For the record, this was simply to help her and I told her after a few minutes, \"Yeah, that's pretty much it, good luck.\" She was literally not acting any different the following days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I was taking Spanish test that was taking me too long and I was almost late for my next class. A few more tardies and I'd have to attend Saturday detention. I finished and she was waiting for me outside of class. Weird, but whatever. I had a minute or so to get to my next class across campus and told her to jog with me if she wanted to talk. I get upstairs one of the buildings and she holds on to me and stops me. I'm panicking at this point and telling her \"What?\" She confesses her feelings to me, that she likes me and wants to go out. I tell her very quickly but firmly, \"I don't like you that way and I never will. I want us to stay friends.\" and ran to my class, which I was late to btw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't talk to me anymore and my friends say I'm in the wrong. I don't see it that way. I don't have feelings for her, I was only trying to help and the way we socialized, she was pretty much another one of the boys to me. It's been a good bit since that happened. She works at my local grocery store and I actively avoid her. What do y'all/Reddit think?",

      "description": "Context: I lived in a country different to my homecountry for 5 years, the last 2 of which I made a group of friends from Homecountry (FriendA, FriendB and FriendC). We work at the same company, have similar ages, are all in LTRs.\n\nI moved to Newcountry almost 2 years ago but kept in touch with them, chatting daily, sending birthday presents to each other, I visited 3 times and even stayed at FriendA's and FriendC's while they were there or away on holidays themselves. \n\nWhen FriendA's very close friend passed away in Homecountry FriendA told me first, before telling anyone else. I immediately went into support (those who emigrated will understand how important friends's support is during hard times) and as soon as I saw them posting it on Facebook I reached out to FriendB and FriendC and we all kicked into support mode. \n\nI share some friends with FriendA, one of whose father passed away recently. When I found out a few months had already gone by, but I immediately thought of FriendA and texted her the news in case she wanted to reach out and support said friend. Turns out FriendA already knew and replied something like 'I'm sorry I didn't let you know, if there was someone who I should have told it was you'. \n\nI found out today that FriendB broke up with their SO, and surely enough when I reach out to FriendA I find out that they already knew. First they say that they didn't think of it, then that they apologise for letting me down with this and then that they weren't sure if FriendB wanted to share the news (yeah but FriendA didn't ask or try to find out). FriendC has been on holidays for the last few weeks so is out of the question.\n\n\nI just wish that FriendA would have kept me in the loop so I could also support FriendB, especially since this was something I had explicitly asked.\n\nIn fairness I feel like FriendA is somewhat self involved due to only reaching out when the way to talk and barely keeping conversation when it's not about themselves, etc \n\nAITA? \n\nAITA?

      "description": "So this only happened recently, but the whole problem of it started over a year ago. Basically, I used to hang around with this group of the four of us, myself, one lad who’s irrelevant to the story, and a couple, who for the sake of anonymity I’ll refer to as Rhys and Zoey. Now, Zoey started hanging out with us a lot later on due to her dating Rhys, but myself, him and the other lad have been friends for 19 years. Since we’re all only 22, that’s almost our entire lives. \n\nBefore Zoey joined us, we always used to share the same incredibly dark sense of humour, more often than not it’d be directed towards each other or each other’s family. When Zoey joined us, the other two lads dark sense of humour declined when she was around, but I kept mine up, she never noticeably had a problem with it, with the sole exception of two occasions where the jokes were aimed directly at her. \n\nSo one day, we were out together, considering that by this point she’d been apart of our group for several years and was well used to my sense of humour, I cracked a joke which, being honest, wasn’t remotely dark by my standards. I won’t repeat the joke, not due to the darkness of it, but just simply because it was purely contextual and wouldn’t sound remotely funny out of context. It was in no way aimed at her and was mostly just a joke about myself being gay. Yet, for some reason she seemed to take massive offence to it.\n\nNow, I’m not here to ask if I’m the asshole for offending her, truth be told I’m totally convinced I did nothing wrong, especially given what followed. After I discovered she had such an issue with it, I tried apologising. Repeatedly. This went on for about two months, until she seemed to be over it. It wasn’t until a further month after that she revealed she wasn’t over it at all, at which point I then continued apologising, repeatedly, for about six months. After that point I gave up, I wasn’t seeing her at all, if she wanted to continue holding that grudge against me that was fine, even Rhys (who at this point was her fiancé) seemed to think she was being petty. I continued to meet up with Rhys and stay friends with him at this point.\n\nThe wedding was looming at this point, and I’d only been invited to the ceremony and the evening reception, which if I’m honest already ticked me off. I’d been friends with this lad for 19 years and he wasn’t inviting me to the meal of his wedding. There were additional reasons however, which as weak as they were, I used to ignore.\n\nNow, fast forward to the night before the wedding,  about a month ago. I’m prepared to go, their wedding present is wrapped, my suit is hung up on the bannister, I’m about to go to sleep before his big day. That’s when I get a call from Rhys. He calls me the night before to tell me I’m uninvited to the entire thing. As you can imagine I’m pissed off big time. I remove him, but not blocking him, from all social media. Like I say, this was about a month ago and he’s made no effort whatsoever to contact me to talk about it. Am I the asshole here for being annoyed in the first place? Or even removing him from all social media? Or is it not on me?",

He then got madder, almost started crying and walked back into his house.\n\nHe said we could’ve just asked for more balloons but due to reason A and the fact we didn’t want to keep asking just because we weren’t using our balloons conservatively. I feel that everyone in this situation could be considered an asshole but I want to know what you guys think\n\nBtw me and Shawn are still friends ",

      "description": "I used to be friends with someone at my summer camp and I have always supported his small YouTube channel (100+ subs). He runs a discord server for his fans, which I have been a part of all the way from the beginning. The server starts becoming active again a couple years after it is made. However, I noticed that people were not enjoying their experience in the server. He was muting people in the server for the smallest things and many members were leaving the server. One of the rules in the server was literally to subscribe to his YouTube channel. Eventually, I had enough of it and I started telling him ways he can reform the server. My suggestions were taken as personal attacks to him. \n\nFast forward a couple weeks and I was starting to care less and less about the strict rules that he made. So with my friends, it is a joke to play Look at Me and spam “Ay” every time it’s said in the song. And we did exactly that. The owner of the server muted me for spam and revoked my roles as mod. After that incident, I just felt like he was looking for excuses to ban me from the server. For example, I could ping everyone once and get a 7 hour mute, while someone can do it 10 times as a “joke” and suffer no consequences. When I noticed this bias, I started calling his server garbage and telling him how unfair this is. Many other members noticed the bias and were on my side. But I think I was a bit harsh. I also told him that his YouTube channel was garbage directly to him. His most recent streams were just him messing with his fortnite settings and I told him that no one would ever want to watch that trash. I was just tired of pretending like his channel was good to make him feel better about himself. I also called him out for his ego and how he always brags about his PC and music setup. Again, this is someone a few years younger than me and they aren’t even a teenager yet so I feel like I was too harsh on them.\n(Yes I was banned from the server. We resolved our issues, but I want to see what everyone thinks of the situation)",

      "title": "AITA for rethinking my whole relationship with my best friend?",
      "description": "This one is going to be a doozy. Obligatory TL;DR at the bottom.  \n\n\nSo, to set the stage for this, I met my best friend (21F, who will be referred to as Sara from here on out) when I (22F) was in high school. She was a sophomore and I was a junior and we have been friends ever since. So, around six years. Ove the course of our friendship, I met different people and introduced them to her. There were about four of us in our friend group at the best point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, one person of the group did some things that I didn't agree with in high school and said something that set off a huge red flag for me, and despite me trying to overlook this and continue to be friends with them, I just couldn't. I haven't talked to the said person in years, but Sara is still friends with this person, even though I have informed her of all the terrible things the person has done. Which is fine, she's allowed to be friends with whoever, I just asked that Sara keeps my personal life private from this negative individual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing is Sara is Mormon. She just came back from her mission in Chile about five months ago after being gone a year and a half. She is very religious and has always found comfort in her beliefs. She has never tried to convert me and isn't a crazy person trying to shove religion down other people's throats. It's just important in her life and to her lifestyle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSara also has had a multitude of boyfriends in the past. All of which I've felt she moved too fast in, or they moved too fast in. I never said anything because it never lasted long because they would break up before it got too bad. I always hinted at it, but never outright told her. I've always tried to be supportive of her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, back in January, after being single for about a month, she met a guy (26M) in our local Walmart. They went and had coffee a few weeks later after he somehow scored her number and they hit it off. She didn't even tell me she met someone until they were already a thing one week after meeting. And, I know she isn't obligated to tell me anything, but it just felt very secretive. She didn't even tell me. Her mother did and then Sara just confirmed. I asked when she planned on telling me and she said later when she thought things were a bit more solid, even though they already had the boyfriend and girlfriend label.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, we are in February, and I found out about a week ago that she and the guy are engaged! She told me this a few days after he popped the question and I asked her what the hell she was thinking. She told me that they \"were in love and that she knew he was the one\" and I told her that this was too soon. It's been a month and she barely even knows the guy! I asked her if they even had a serious argument and she told me they hadn't because they \"just agree on *everything*\". I told her that they were in the honeymoon phase and that she needed to give it a bit more time before tying the knot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, after going to the bathroom and calming myself down, I realized that this was her life. I can't control her or what she does. So I went back and told her that I was happy for her, but I did need to meet the guy before the wedding. She agreed wholeheartedly. The issue was, her and I have full-time jobs. We're both teachers, so we both get off around the same time. He doesn't have a job. So it should've been easy to get together and meet up, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI planned THREE different times to meet them. Each at least a day before, and each one got canceled. And it wasn't for legitimate reasons, I feel. One was because he wasn't feeling too well, or because his family had a last minute BBQ and they just couldn't miss it. It was hurtful each time they canceled with these excuses because I felt Sara just didn't...care? It was important to me for my friends to meet my significant other because I wanted confirmation I made the right choice. It wasn't easy because he's in Norway (LDR) but I still made it happen when he was here. And I never canceled on her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis whole thing was frustrating because I have my own things to do and she just did not seem to care. It really hurt my feelings and I told her this and how much stress it's adding because I had to juggle other things around. She said she was sorry and that I shouldn't stress out about it and we could do it another day, but I didn't want to keep putting it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I finally met him today. He seems like a decent enough guy. I just don't really like the person she becomes when she's in a relationship. It basically just consumes her life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd while I was talking to her fiance, I found out that Sara, the negative individual, and he has a group chat together where they send each other memes. Out of spite, I'll admit, I asked if it took the individual three times to meet Sara's betrothed. Not at all! In fact, the person drove Sara to her first date with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just feel really confused. I really love Sara and I feel so gross for even thinking I shouldn't call her my best friend anymore. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - My best friend since high school got engaged to a guy she's known for a month, and a series of events have caused me to question my friendship with her.",

      "description": "The title sounds bad, but bear with me. I (19F) smoke regularly. I enjoy it, it helps me relax. My sister (17) does not. She tried edibles once before and totally freaked out and spent the night puking. She's tried smoking a couple times with me and hasn't had a bad reaction. \n\nSo, on to last night. I got home, after an exam, and wanted to relax and treat myself. So I set up my bong, and offer some to my sister. Now, I usually offer some to her if I'm going to smoke, but I never pressure her. I just offer and then move on when she generally tends to say no. But last night, much to my surprise, she said yes. Awesome, I set it up, let her take a few hits while I proceed to get stoned out of my mind. She was fine for about two minutes before starting to freak out, which lasted an hour. Crying, shaking, hyperventilating, the whole works. I did my best to comfort her, talked for a full half hour non stop about random shit to distract her, held her hand. I felt awful seeing her like this, I wanted to help.\n\nHere's the part that makes me worry I might be an asshole: the first time I tried my bong, I also got way too high (I had no idea how to use it and ended up taking way too much) resulting in a very intense prolonged high. It didn't bother me, it was uncomfortable but I didn't freak out because I usually don't. But, I knew this was a possibility. I, however, forgot this/didn't think of it last night, and gave my sister a bong even though it's a more intense form of smoking. It honestly didn't even really occur to me that she would freak out again, but I feel so bad about the whole situation that I feel responsible.\n\nSo, AITA for letting my sister smoke even though I knew it can be intense?

      "description": "First of all, I’m not a native speaker and there might be some cultural differences, which I’ll try to explain.\n\nI’m in college and share a house with another 9 people, it’s kinda like a fraternity but we’re super chill. 5 of them are men(gay) and the other 5 are woman(me, included).\n\nWe are super close and quite intimate. The guys walk around on their underwear and the girls walk around topless. We talk about sex, periods and everything a drunk person can. That works bc everyone is super confortable with each other.\n\nWe got two new girls this year(the last ones graduated), one fit really well but the other has felt kinda unconfortable. We had a meeting yesterday(we do it every week to speak about all the things that must be done on the house, about the dog, ect) and she said she didn’t feel confortable with us topless or some of our conversations and asked us to stop.\n\nI’m not gonna lie but that didn’t go too well with the rest of the house, literally everyone else either likes the way we act or doesn’t care.\n\nLong story short, today I sat down’t with her and told her it might be better if she looked for a house that fitted her personality better and that it wasn’t fair for her to ask 9 other people way of life, especially when we weren’t being assholes\n\nShe cried and told me it wasn’t fair, since she would be a paying renter and she had the right to be confortable. I explained to her that I understood that she was more private but that people had different limits and it seemed like hers didn’t mesh too well with ours, that she would be happier somewhere else\n\nWe didn’t talk much more bc she was crying. I feel terrible and really guilty but I don’t think it would do any of us any good if we lived together. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: we live a very free life(talking about sex and walking around topless) and a girl who just got here asked us to change, I told her she should probably move(but in a nicer way), I feel guilty and sad, but I need an objective view.

      "title": "AITA for asking to be reimbursed for alcohol my roommate's mom drank?",
      "description": "This is my first post ever. That's nerve wracking. If I mess any of this up, please let me know and I'll fix it. TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nLet me preface this story with a bit of backstory. This happened back in October of last year. My best friend (21F) (from here on out to be referred to as RM) and I (21F) had been living together for 4 months and had known each other for 7 years. Things were pretty strenuous because of financial things and other issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was the weekend of a different friend's (21M) (here on out referred to as John) birthday. They were turning 21 and for their birthday, since they had never really had any alcohol before, we agreed to get a bunch of different alcohol for them to try. So I went to the store the Saturday before and got a bottle of Crown Royal, some rum, whisky, vodka, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty comes around and its myself, John, and 2 other friends (RM was busy and didn't arrive until later, but didn't drink). John discovered that they *really* like Crown, it's the only alcohol they like really. By the end of the party, only about a quarter of the Crown Royal is gone though, because John is a light weight. John said to just keep the alcohol at my house since they only really drink when we're together for parties (which are normally held at my place) and of course, I said that's fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow RM knew that the alcohol from John's party was John's alcohol, even though I bought it, it was given to them as a gift. I put the alcohol up on the alcohol shelf, because we had no where else to put it, and then went on about my week. I had a few days off, so I decided I would go back home (I lived about an hour away) to spend time with other friends and family, plus it would give me a break from RM. RM's mom had been coming over a lot lately to help with some project RM was working on for theatre, so I was glad to be away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell I come back at the end of my break, and see that the Crown Royal is just.... Gone. The bottle is on the counter completely empty. I ask RM about it and they say that their mom drank it and RM had offered some to a friend when they were over, but they didn't drink any. None of the other alcohol was touched, just the Crown. So I messaged John and said that I was sorry, but RM's mom had drank all their Crown. As expected, John was furious, just as much as I was. After talking with them and the other friends at the party, they told me that I should totally ask to be reimbursed the cost of the alcohol, because it was made clear that the alcohol was theirs and not open for consumption.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I would also like to point out here that, although RM and I would share our alcohol, we didn't really drink the same things. RMF was more into wine, which I didn't like at all, and I enjoyed mixed drinks with Rum, which RM wasn't fond of. So we normally just bought our own alcohol or took turns buying alcohol as repayment when we drank the other person's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I message her and this is how the conversation goes...\n\n**Me:** Hey, so that Crown was John's alcohol that was bought for his birthday and he's really upset that it's all gone because it was the only alcohol he really liked. He's asking that you either reimburse him for the alcohol or buy him a new bottle of the same size.\n\n**RM:** Okay so no, I will not be buying John a new bottle or reimburse him for it and here's why: 1) I don't have the money to do so because you still owe me and my parents money for rent and bills *(Even though I had already worked out a payment arrangement with them for when they covered me when I was transitioning jobs, and they never brought up that I owed them money any other time that I asked to be reimbursed for things, like groceries and such.)* 2) My mom drank the alcohol, not me. If you or John would like to take that up with her, than feel free to do so.\n\n**Me:** Okay, then I'll message (RM's Mom) and take it up with her. Regardless, the alcohol wasn't yours to offer to anyone and even though we share alcohol a lot of the time, Crown is a bit more expensive than Malibu and the other types of alcohol we normally buy. I don't appreciate you offering it up without asking first. Please ask next time.\n\n**RM:** I didn't offer it to anybody. In case you haven't noticed, my mother does her own thing. If you don't want things being eaten or drank by anybody other than yourself, then don't leave them in the kitchen. Because if it's in the kitchen, then the understanding is that it's free reign to anybody in the house.\n\n**Me:** You told me when I got home you had offered it to (RM's Friend). Whether he drank it or not, you put out the invitation. And drinking some is fine, but the whole bottle? That's a bit excessive especially when it isn't yours. The polite thing to do is ask before taking, even if it is \"free reign to anybody.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRM never responded to that message. I sent a message to RM's mother and her response was \"next time you see John, give him the money it was worth and we'll deduct that from what is owed on bills.” So that’s what I did. I paid John $40 for alcohol that RM’s mom drank, and **still** paid RM and her family $400 when I moved out (which was over $100 more than what I owed them because I was just so tired of fighting with them over money).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Roommate’s mom drank alcohol that was purchased for a friends birthday. Ask to be reimbursed for it. Friend fought with &amp; lied to me about it, told me to talk to their mom about it. I did and I paid friend $40 for the alcohol and paid Roommate and her family $400 when I moved out (over $100 more than I owed)",

      "description": "So the backstory.\n3 years ago me and this girl were in a relationship. It was highschool senior year (I'm not from the US so we don't have a relaxed dating culture) the first time for both of us and lasted for 4 months before she dropped of the face of the earth for a couple of days, and ended it without giving a reason. We never fought or anything, and she constantly avoided telling me her reasons so I was left wondering why. I had a 3 year crush on her as well so her leaving me fucked me up for a good year or so before I got over it. Also vital information, both of us share a very close friend and practically the same social circle.\n\nFast forward 3 years. Me, my ex, and our friend all end up in the same college and same major. Since then I've dealt with my ex a number of times and we never really had a problem. All 3 of us are in the same course, which is basically one big group project. Naturally, since I'm close friends with our mutual friend, and having partnered with my ex on previous smaller projects before I assumed we'd all be on the same group. However, I was talking with my friend and she told me they are both already in a group, and that I'm not in because my ex doesn't want me there. I was pissed off for like 5 minutes and then dropped the subject.\n\nI go talk to my ex in the hopes of figuring out what her problem with me is and fixing it so that situation doesn't happen again. She gives me the same runaround, gets all defensive and doesn't say shit, at which point I stop trying to talk and just lay into her (nothing vulgar, just confrontational). The conversation ends there.\n\nThe next day my friend texts me saying that I'm wrong about talking to her in the first place, we're not that close as friends ( we've been close for 5 years now), and that she looks at me differently now cuz apparently I'm the asshole, even though I'm the one who got fucked over now and 3 years ago.\n\nSo am I the asshole? If so what do I do? If not, what do I do as well?\n\nI realize the whole thing may seem childish to some, it probably is. Just take into consideration that we're not actually adults.",

      "description": "My close friend of several years (we'll refer to her as Mary) dated this guy (we'll call him Roger), but it ended up being a one night stand-ish ordeal. She had felt very genuinely towards him, but Roger severed the relationship after only a few days, leaving her with a negative, whorish self-image. She proceeded to express intense loathe towards him and generally spoke negatively of him, with me trying to provide as much emotional support as I could, as it is something I know she would do for me.\n\nIn the following weeks, things healed, and she began to catch feelings for him again. The trash talking ended, and she began instead asking for advice on whether to ask him for another go at a relationship. Mary and I were at a football game. It was halftime, so we were heading towards the concession stand. Along the way, we were greeted by Roger, who had been talking to a friend of his who apparently bet him to kiss a guy. Roger asked me if I would be willing to kiss him for $5. My though process was that 1) Mary had been in a positive enough place with Roger that she wouldn't loathe me for accepting and 2) it was a meaningless, harmless bet, so I accepted (also it was not a serious kiss, it was a small smooch on the lips).\n\nAt the time that this occurred, I had not been aware of the sexual nature of their relationship. But later that night, Mary told me everything about the encounter that she had during her first stab at a relationship with Roger, and how betrayed I made her feel. However, while I overall empathized with her, I could not find myself hating Roger. \n\nAlso later that night, Roger DM'ed me, asking how I knew I liked guys (I am currently a closeted homosexual, only letting my closest friends know due to the homophobic nature of my community and family, and Mary had apparently told Roger because he asked), because, he enjoyed when I kissed him. I was shocked, but still helped him understand the feelings he was having. I empathized with him because I was in a similar situation, unsure of what I wanted in a relationship.\n\nI immediately told Mary about the encounter, and she was unhappy that I decided to help him, calling me \"harshly opinionated.\"\n\nAs stated in the title, I hold myself to strict moral standards, one of which is to never have negative relations with anyone. I try not to dislike anyone unless they've personally offended me, and even then, I've managed to forgive and forget over the years.\n\nAm I wrong to hold myself to this standard and potentially damage my relationship with my close friend?",

We are coming close to finishing and the price all up is getting pretty high so the clients insist on doing somethings for themselves here and there. \n\nOne of these things was building the fence on the left side. The owner is not a very handy person so he called upon his two brothers to help out one of which is a carpenter. \n\nNeighbours on the left side were notified and were aware that the fence was being built so they were prepared. Although they refused to pay for the fence at all. \n\nThe fence took about one week to be built and the very next day the neighbour on the left calls in a surveyor which cost him about a grand which would’ve been less than the amount to pay for the fence. \n\nThe surveyor determined that the fence breaches the the Boundry line by 70 mil and so now the neighbour wants to fence removed entirely and re-done\n\nIs he not an asshole for not being involved from the start where he could have got exactly what he wanted and paid less money?",

      "description": "Here is a little back story. I dated this person for a little under 3 years around 8-10 years ago. We were both in our early 20's and she has a then 1 year old son from a previous relationship. She told me the kids father was a dead beat dad and beating her and what not (found out later all of that was a lie). I played acting father figure to the kid when we were together so he met my folks and entire family. We never had any of our own and I am still not a father to any children. So anyways, her whereabouts and other things start to not ad up and I get a bit suspicious over the time we are together but just cant quite make sense of it all... and then her boss calls me concerned about her safety. This of course is a few days after she has explained to me that she has been fired and hasn't been going to work. Apparently I'm the emergency contact she wrote down on the application that's on file and the boss and I have a nice chat about her current employment. I promptly call her and tell her what has transpired and she comes up with yet another bullshit story. Needless to say I drove my happy ass over to her place after work and I told her it's over. I met with her son and sat him down face to face and I cried right then and there when I told him I wasn't going to be around anymore. That was honestly the hardest part of the entire break up by far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a year after we split and the kids dad is fighting for custody and she gave him up entirely. The state is after her for medical neglect.  The kid has Diamond-Blackfan anemia and the entire time we were together she neglected his condition and he was hospitalized at least twice while we were dating. I didn't know the severity because she downplayed the condition and she seemed to have it under control to my knowledge with the lies and all. Little did I know that when she was supposed to be going to doctors appointments she was pawning him off on her sister and doing other things. Turns out the dad is a stand up guy and was only trying to be there for his son this whole time!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents have continued to play the grandparent role to the child and have been in contact with the kids dad and his new stepmom this entire time. The biological father and his wife give him to my folks when they need babysitting duties. I have absolutely no problem with all of that. Like not even a little. That kid has had a rough life thus far! Especially with his mom being the dumpster fire that she is and I'm glad he finally has a support network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made a choice a long time ago that I needed to leave the painful memories of that toxic relationship behind me and move on with my life. I thought that the young age of the child would help him forget about me especially since he can now make new meaningful memories with his biological father. My parents have not let that happen. They constantly try to get him back in my life. I've told them how I feel about it and they ignore my wishes. I don't care if they have him over for the holidays and what not. I have just exclaimed that i'd like them to keep me out of it entirely.  It's a bit embarrassing explaining this to every person I've dated since her and also my now wife when they mention their \"grandson\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for refusing to have him in my life?

      "description": "So, some quick background, my husband 3 kids and I moved in with my MIL back in July to help raise our 2 nephews because she works 2nd shift ft and I'm a stay at home mom. There's more details in my post history if anyone cared to dig. \n\nMy MIL is mostly a very nice lady. She can be very passive aggressive though, instead of acting like an adult and saying she'd prefer something else, she pouts or rage cleans. My husband has always been lazy when it comes to helping with kids, he will be staring at his phone while I'm busy as he'll, and when I ask him to jump in a nd help, acts like he's totally put out. \n\nLast week, we got a call my BIL was found unresponsive. After several days in hospital,  he was declared brain dead. MIL decided to donate his organs, so it took several more days in hospital while they did testing and set up donations. This is also winter break for the kids (5 total). I was happy to jump in (99% of childcare already on me, I am now doing 100%). That's all over now, and his service is Sun. \n\nKids have been sick, so has MIL, and now I've got it. I was up all night before last with screaming 3 yo with ear infection,  got no sleep. Now I'm exhausted and sick too. I told husband and MIL if I was taking care of kids last night, bedtime was going to be early, as I'm sick too and exhausted. MIL had been going through pics at table for last few days. Her rule is only food at table. So dinner last night,  I started to throw down a blanket for a picnic dinner. She got bit snappy Says she was cleaning table off. Ok. Tgen bedtime snack, table still mostly clear except for album directly in front of her. I set 3 of kids at table, said be careful with your drinks. If she didn't want them at table, she could have said as much, I'd have moved them elsewhere. Instead she grabbed her things went into bedroom and slammed door then started sobbing loudly. Kids were freaked out by it, so I was then reassuring them that grandma was just sad about thier uncle, it was ok, just brush teeth lay down with thier tablets. Once they were in bed, I went and sat on futon in front room, only other place for me to sleep. I left lights on in case she decided to come back out with pics. She came out in PJs, got drink went back in bedroom. I assumed that meant she was going to bed o r at least her room for night. So I finally turned off light laid down. Few minutes later, I heard 3 yo crying. Husband had laid down with her at 630 fell asleep, left me with other 4 kids. I told husband his mom was upset, ran over what happened. He went off on me, saying I should have asked what she wanted, or should have known. I was a bitch for being mean to his grieving mom. \n\nI'm truly trying my best to be helpful, but I'm also sick and was already at my breaking point as caretaker. My break got cancelled twice with the goings on due to my BIL dying. I understand that, it sucks for me, but it is what it is. But I think expecting me to read Mil's mind is a bit much. She could have easily said hey, not at table, I'd have changed plans. Instead she threw a fit. \n\nSo, AITA for thinking even if grieving, an adult should be able to express their feelings to me without all the drama? Keep in mind, this is not new to her grieving period, she's done this several times since we have been here.",

She's got an adversarial relationship with her siblings. She was in the hospital hallway on the phone the entire time her mom was on her deathbed. She shunned her son and only looks after her daughters.   \n\n\nI cannot remember a single Christmas gift from her. I'm disabled and she'd grumble about having to push my wheelchair.  \n\n\nHaving said all that, I get along fine with my cousins. I decided long ago that if my aunt died, I'd skip the funeral, but my Mom says it'd be important to support her kids.  \n\n\nWould I be the asshole if I skipped out on her farewell?",

      "description": "I'm UK based and get a certain amount of maternity and child benefit paid into my account. My partner works and our baby is his second child - his first born lives in a town not far away but he has to travel every weekend to see him. He's paid roughly £700/800 a month compared to my roughly £600. He works 3 days a week 2pm-9pm while I take care of the baby (he takes the night feeds as he's usually up until 3/4am anyway).\n\nThe reason I'm frustrated is this - we both pay £200 a month in rent as we're living in my families property. Beforehand I worked 6 days a week anywhere between 10 to 14 hours, paid our £600 a month rent, paid for the shopping and would give him money for the bills that came out of his account. Now I've obviously taken a step back, but every month when my money comes in not only am I still spending £100+ on shopping for the month and giving him half of the debt we're in, he's asking for half of all my pay because the baby is half his responsibility and he has to pay £10 a week in travel to see his first born.\n\nI'm not angry with him and a big part of me thinks he's probably right, but it's getting me down that I can't afford to go out or do anything with my friends or the baby while he can afford to buy parts for a computer that he's 'building for me' that I didn't ask for and haven't used once.\n\nThe sentiment is so nice and our relationship is great otherwise, and he's a brilliant partner and dad to both his kids, I'm just... Frustrated.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hello all - pretty low stakes game here, but I'd like an outside opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am abroad in Europe, in my first year of grad school, while my good friend is working in the US; we are 6 hours apart time-zone wise. We have made a good effort to keep in touch while I've been abroad, via Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook etc. We haven't been that good about talking to each other on FaceTime though. She works a regular workday, 8:30-6, while I have classes, review sessions, and meetings scattered throughout the week in long chunks (some scheduled weekly, like class, some ad hoc like meetings with professors)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes, she will call me without any warning, and about 90% of the time it is when I am busy. She'll usually call on her way to work, when it's the middle of the day for me. When she gets home in the evening, it will be 11pm or midnight, and I usually am in bed by that point as I have early classes most mornings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to suggest that we fill out a schedule for when is a good time to call, and make it a set weekly time. Her calling randomly never works and I feel like a dick for never being able to pick up. Admittedly, I don't ever call her randomly like this - not only do I just not think to do so (which doesn't paint me as a good and interested friend, it's true) but also I feel like most times I'd be free to call, she's at work, so I don't call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be the asshole if I told her that random calling can't work for us while I'm still here (we only have 2 more months before I'm back in the US), and that we should fill out a schedule for a weekly or biweekly catch up. I am worried that this would come off as too clinical, or that I \\*only\\* want to talk to her during those times. I don't! I love Snapchatting and sending quick texts or messages on Insta and Facebook.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit - am I the asshole? (Bad friend? any advice otherwise?)",

I always start witha good full body massage to setup the mood and it always turns me on real rast when she moans like that. She's also into light BDSM (morr like being dominated,  being tied, and the like)\n\nI have this horrible habit to say stupid shit and when she did got mad when she felt me poking, i stated in a joking way \"its your fault with your moaning and all\" to wich she replied that was too far. It then dawned on me all i did in past with her; every time she wasn't feeling intimate and i convinced her, and the remarks i thought was kinky. I still feel disgusted by my behavior.\n\nLast night i told her my resolution which was i will be more careful,  i will respect her the way she should be respected,  i will wait her express consent before doing anything. She now feels bad about it, regret telling me the truth and said i make her feel horrible for saying that.

      "description": "Hi everyone, I am really not sure what to think of this situation. I am a legal assistant at a law firm. Across from me sits another legal assistant. There is a barrier between us and a decent amount of distance between us. I find the office cold and I have been using a small desk heater as of recent. I only point it at myself and turn it on and off periodically. It is very small. So the other assistant that sits beside me is very warm all the time. She said that since she had a child her body temperature has gone up a few degrees. Anyway, she has been asking me to turn off my tiny heater and told me I should bring a sweater to work instead. I told her that it doesn’t really do the trick which is why I use the small heater which again, is only pointing at me. I don’t see how it’s even affecting her because there are times she asks me to turn off the heater and it isn’t even on and I tell her this. So today, she was in a sour mood because she asked me to turn off my heater and I did not do it. I was cold and find it hard to work when I am uncomfortably chilly. I told her to turn on her fan and she said that it’s counter productive and I think but am not sure that she mentioned a sweater again. So anyway, I keep it on and she is noticeably silent and just clearly mad at me. Afterward she is talking to the receptionist about how hot it is (the receptionist found it hot too but three other people I talked to said the office was cold) and I suggest she turns down the thermostat for the whole office. She says it would be rude because other people are also cold. \n\nNow the next thing that happens really makes me doubt that I am the asshole but nonetheless...earlier on one of the articling students was asking me to help her with something. She then comes over to the other legal assistant and asks her how to phrase something. Since I had been helping and discussing the same file and task with the articling student earlier,\nI asked what they were talking about. I also thought the other assistant might have said she was busy so I was offering my help. I might have interrupted a bit by accident. Anyway, the other assistant said “she’s asking ME frozenofficegirl, stop trying to undermine me.” And I was like “I’m not undermining you...” and she said “Yes you are and you’ve been doing it all the time and I can’t take it anymore!” And then she took a break and also left early and didn’t come to our weekly Friday happy hour. Now my boss is very close with her so I figured I would suggest I switch desks with someone since my heater bothers the other legal assistant a lot. Am I the asshole? Also, what can I do here to fix the issue?",

But they grew to like him and the landlord gave us the OK.\n\nPrior to adopting, I had been sending m6 gf pics of white cats because I always wanted one. Imagine the occasional cat pic as a reaction instead of an emoji.\n\nAnyway, one day I come home and she makes me close my eyes as she grabs a box from her car. When she let's me open my eyes, inside the box is not one, but TWO white kittens!\n\nShe had apparently been looking for white kittens for a while and found a couple that were about to be euthanized at the shelter.  She brought them home for me.\n\nI recognize this was sweet of her and she has a good heart. But I was already on eggshells with 1 cat. 3 is a lot. What's worse is that our original cat was not friendly to the new kittens. They would often fight and the little ones constantly hide in fear. This has been going on for months with no improvement at all.\n\nTbh, it upset me that she brought them. They're cute, but she is 100% aware that I'm not supposed to have pets. I would have been OK if all the cats got along, but there's hostility in my animal kingdom. The kittens are saved from euthanasia, but they live in fear everyday.\n\nAITA for disliking her gift, telling her she shouldn't have done this, and giving one of the cats away next week? ...Even though she spent a time and effort to surprise me with something she knew I liked?",

      "description": "So a little bit of a back story: I am a 15 year old that goes in 10th ( last ) year of primary school. My mother always wanted me to gymnasium or higher education school in English. I got nice school marks etc. so I don't think it would be a problem, however I decided that I want to do a trade as a fitness advisor while also going to a 3 year long evening school to get a equally useful diploma as the one from highschool. Needless to say, my mother got furious when I told her yesterday and I am not sure if it's my fault.\n\nI think I should have talked to her about it, but she's not necessarily mad because I didn't tell her, but because I don't want to go to a normal school that requires a lot more effort than evening school but the same result.",

      "title": "AITA for ghosting a friend?",
      "description": "This happened a few months ago, but it's been looming over my head ever since. Throwaway account since some people know my main account username. I apologize that this is a long one. \n\nI have been friends with a boy (who I'll call Alex from here on out) for more than 10 years. At the beginning of the \"friendship\", though, I didn't like Alex too much. We didn't have anything in common, he was a bit awkward and we had different friends, but we were kind of forced to be around each other since we were next-door neighbors and our parents would talk occasionally. He moved after a year or two and I didn't see him at all after that.\n\nFast forward about 6-7 years, Alex and I reconnected through a mutual friend on Facebook. Even though I didn't really consider him a \"friend\" in the past, it was still nice to see him after all these years and catch up. We exchanged numbers and met up in person a few times. We still didn't have too much in common, but like I said, it was still nice to see him. \n\nA bit after we reconnected, Alex confided in me that he's been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts over the past few months. He told me that he doesn't have any real friends as people really only kept him around to ask him for help on homework, classwork, etc. Alex knew what they were doing, but he helped out since he just wanted to be a nice person. To be completely honest, I wasn't expecting to meet him very frequently after we reconnected since we just didn't have anything in common, and our conversations don't really go anywhere. Alex can also be unintentionally condescending sometimes, which was frequent enough for me to notice but didn't bother me TOO much at the time (this is important later). But when he told me all of the hardships that he's been through, I just wanted to be there for him, as corny as that sounds. Even if we didn't meet up in person, we'd text frequently and I'd just ask him if he was doing okay. \n\nFast forward about 5 more years, we're both going to different universities but still keeping in touch through text. Around my junior year, I went through a bout of depression. I tried to keep it to myself but it got to the point where I just needed to confide in someone. I thought of Alex since he's been through depression too, and maybe he could help me get through it. When I did reach out to him though, the first thing he said to me was, \"Everyone's depressed. Join the club.\" I was taken aback by this comment, so I just wrapped up the conversation. A few weeks later, I was honest with him in how his comment did hurt a bit, but he said he was just being honest and didn't see anything wrong with what he said. I told him it's a bit insensitive and condescending, and he disagreed. This wasn't the first time he's said something of this nature, but this time it really hit me and I felt that I really didn't want to keep someone like this around. My effort to talk to him honestly about how his comment made me feel was just tossed aside, and he was unable to have a shred of empathy about it. From that moment on, I ghosted him. \n\nHe's tried to reach out to me a couple of times after that day, and I've ignored every one of them. I've stopped checking up on him through text. He's confused as to why I'm choosing to ignore him. I know that ghosting someone isn't necessarily the best way to handle things sometimes, but I just felt that even if I did try to explain myself, he just wouldn't understand and say even more insensitive things. I've told some close friends about the situation and they agree that it's good to cut out people that are toxic like this, but I just wanted to get input from a few internet strangers if this was the best thing to do.

      "description": "Okay so for some context, I’ve (US) been in an LDR with my boyfriend (UK) for almost five months now. The only saving grace is that his sleep schedule is messed up enough so that we can actually talk. I have class on weekdays and I work on weekends, leaving the only time we have together during my evenings and his late nights. Overall, we don’t really have many issues. The biggest one is the time thing. He wakes up and waits around long past when I go to bed to make sure I’m okay (though I’ve told him he doesn’t have to wait around once I’ve gone to bed) but basically today I had off of classes and we were supposed to spend it together, but by 12:30 my time I hadn’t heard from him.\n\nThe day before this, my manager was mentioning how one of my coworkers would be working the front (despite her job being food prep) because they didn’t have anyone. I impulsively said I could work, but then remembered my plans and I felt like shit so I lied to my manager saying I had plans I had blanked over.\n\nFast forward to today and I woke up planning to talk to my bf. When I didn’t hear from him right away I assumed he was asleep and carried on with my errands. Around 12:00 my time I got a text from my mom asking if I wanted to meet her for lunch (at my workplace) I said yes, thinking that if they asked I could tell them I was stopping in before my plans (horribly impulsive, I know) once I stepped foot in I noticed how busy it was. They had kitchen staff delivering food and only four people staffed total. I looked down at my phone and still no word from my bf and it was 12:30. I had an event at 5:00 so at that point I knew we wouldn’t have much time anyways so I stepped in to help work. I let him know I’d be working and id talk to him later. It should be noted that it was in a very pissy tone because I was annoyed that the day was almost over and I had made a point to have it off.\n\nWe got into an argument as expected and he was more pissed off than he’d ever been and I do feel partially in the wrong. I also found out his phone died and he had originally set an alarm to be up before me so we really could spend the whole day together which made me feel even worse about going into work even though I felt partially obligated since I lied to my manager.\n\nTL;DR\nI had plans with my LDR bf but when he didn’t respond after a while (despite his phone dying while he slept) I took a shift at work instead \n\n\nTbh I’m kinda hoping I’m the asshole here but I honestly don’t know",

      "description": "About 6 months ago, I discovered a popular supplier selling damaged goods. Since I was scared of them, and no one would listen to me alone, I gave the information to another larger company, AC.\n\nAC excitedly went public with the information. He became popular, and had a huge influx of customers. Due to a mistake, it came out that I was the leak. No big deal, we rolled with it, I had a minor increase in my own customers, nothing major. We communicated regularly, until it became clear we had strong romantic feelings for one another. I cut it off, because he is married with children. \n\nA week or so later, I spoke to a supplier who used to work bad supplier. He knew about the damaged goods, but was afraid. He thanked me for going public, and offers me a discount on his newest product. I place an order.\n\nA few days later, AC insisted that we talk on the phone. I explained my feelings were too raw, so talking would only cause more pain since a relationship was impossible. I told him i couldn't go to his store because I still loved him. He said we would talk when I was ready, and to know he would always love me.\n\nDays later my order from the new supplier arrived. I put up the product for sale. The next day, AC released a statement, denouncing me for selling the product, accusing me of using him to get more customers, being part of a conspiracy to take him down, and of manipulating his feelings to get what I want. He also says I played a \"cat and mouse game\", and suddenly stopped talking to him and shopping at his store for no reason. \n\nI was shocked and devastated. I told him he betrayed me by attacking my character. He said he understood and blocked me.\n\nAfterwards, I was contacted by various friends and strangers asking if I was ok. They felt AC was out of line. I heard from everyone except FF.\n\nFF has developed a reputation. He uses people to get access to premium suppliers, help setting up his store, etc. As a friend, I had helped FF with many things, he used my connections to BC AND AC to get new customers and suppliers. I ignored it, because I considered FF a good friend.\n\n1 day after the drama? Nothing from FF. 2 days? Nothing. 3 days after, I finally asked FF if they saw it. Answer? Yes, and they had nothing to say, because they are friends with everyone. Everyone fucked up. FF is so upset with everyone for doing this!\n\nI told FF I was hurt, they didnt even seem to care about the effect on me, and that at least some support would be great. FF then tells me he plans to write an ENTIRE NEWSLETTER promoting AC.\n\nI told FF and his wife, if they write the newsletter, I am done working with them. We have a company together. It would look like they are condoning the actions of AC. As my business partners, I felt that looked bad. They were angry that I gave an ultimatum, so I told them, they are adults and can do what they want. Since I am also an adult, I can do what I want and end the friendship.",

      "description": "Hello everyone! I've been dealing with a situation for the last few weeks and I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong here...\n\nI'm in a masters program (second year) and in a team of six members. The course is challenging and we have group assignments every week including one large final project. One team member, a married man with a family, had a sick wife with cancer. She was diagnosed several months ago and was told it was likely terminal (it was kept quiet).\n\nFor the first week he was participating in all our group discussions and helping with the homework, but then shared with us what was going on at home. Everyone was supportive and many of the other group members told him \"Don't worry about this class! We'll take care of everything\". I didn't speak up about that and only offered my condolences. About a week later, she did pass away. \n\nWe all offered our support and since then, he has only showed up for class on evenings. I have largely taken on a lot of the work because unfortunately, my remaining team members aren't very accountable. I asked them to submit one of our assignments one day and they forgot. We've been continuing forward like this with me doing most of the work and everyone else telling my classmate that he can just relax and let us handle everything.\n\nAITHA for thinking he should have taken a semester off? Losing a loved one is horribly hard and I get that. But why would you stay in a school program when you don't have the mental capacity to be part of a team and do the work? Take the semester off and heal. I guess I'm mostly irritated because I've had to pick up theirs and his slack while they all proclaim don't worry about it when I'm the one who has been doing everything.  ",

      "description": "I’ve been a long time fan of Guns N’ Roses. Have been to their concert back in July and it was the most amazing night ever. So when I heard about Slash touring with Myles Kennedy in February I became instantly hyped. Asked my boyfriend to come with me and he replied quite excited. He bought the tickets in September and that was that. After that I would send the new album of Slash, and some random news I would find online. Fast forward to today, he began out of nowhere about going on a vacation with friends (which I’m fine with, honestly) around the end of February.  Jokingly I say “You better still be around to see Slash with me!!”. He looks as if he’s just seen a ghost and says he isn’t sure. I can tell he completely forgot about it. Not wanting to ruin the evening I let it be and move on. Till just a few minutes ago he called me up to tell me he will be flying the exact night of the concert. I don’t want to throw a fit so I reply with “Oh well alright. I’ll just go by myself then.”. He asks if I really wanna go that bad and I laugh “Yes, yes of course I want to go that bad.”. I’m sure he didn’t do this to upset me, but I’m pretty upset to be fair. The rest of the call I can’t get as excited about what he’s telling as usually. He suggests taking someone else with me, my sister maybe. Thing is, she, nor any or my friends, are into Slash. Before this there hasn’t been anything that he did that truly upset me. And I love him lots, honestly.\n I always get childishly excited for things like this, so when there takes a change of plans place I get pretty upset. Am I the asshole for getting upset with him?\n",

      "description": "For context; I've been living with a host family for 6 months now, while going to school abroad. Our relationship is pretty good, esp. between me and my host mom.\n\nSo, my host mom has started using the coffee machine early in the morning (around 5-5:30 am), multiple times over a period of around 20 minutes. I figured, if she just wanted coffee, she'd just run it once, so I thought she was cleaning it or smth.\n\nThe problem is, that the coffee machine is really loud and has been waking me up a good 2 hours before I'd normally get up for the last few weeks.\nToday in the car, I asked her politely, if she could use the coffe machine a little later and explained why. Didn't think it'd be biggie, cause we have a good relationship.\n\nShe then got pretty annoyed, explaining to me in a quite sassy way (calling me \"honey \", and not in a nice way) that she goes to the gym at 5:30 and needs the coffee. Because I didn't know that, I told her it's fine and she doesn't have to do anything about it. (I personally still think, there's ways to work around that, but I'll manage).\n\nLater on, she started acting quite reserved towards me, but I didn't notice it back then. In the evening, I told her she didn't have to prepare dinner for me, cause I was gonna eat the left-over pasta from yesterday. We'd obviously still eat together as we do everyday.\nShe then looked me straight in the eye, asking \"Why?\". I told her, I was just feeling like pasta and it was left-over anyway.\n\nWhat really made me think she was pissed of is the following:\nA few hours later, my host mom then took my host sister (also a foreign student, not her daughter) out for dinner, like eating out. She didn't tell me about it and didn't ask me, if I wanted to come. My host sister has been living here for as long as me. That's quite rude, or not?\n\nI might just be really ignorant and am gonna talk to her anyway. But Reddit, \n\nAITA?\n\n(For more context; this is located in North America, my host mom is of European heritage, so I don't think it's food-culture related)\n\n",

      "description": "So I know right off the bat this sounds bad, but hear me out here. \n\nMy older brother, let's call him Thomas, is planning to run for the House as a Republican. He's also gay. He's semi-open, basically he doesn't hide it from closer friends and family, but the average person he kinda knows doesn't know.\n\nI've heard through the grapevine that he's considering me in a key role for the campaign, maybe as manager. This is because I'm a doctoral student in psychology, and specifically I'm researching how people get their political views, how they decide who to vote for, how they justify changing parties without feeling like an idiot, etc. This is extremely convenient and useful for Thomas, since he's trying to get elected. \n\nAnyway, he's been hitting me up for advice and all that. Since he's running as a Republican, in a pretty conservative, very Baptist area, my first question was how open he was going to be with being gay. He replied he was going to be open with it and bring it up, saying he was hoping it could get some swing voters. I think this is a terrible idea, for a few reasons:\n\n1. You're not going to get swing voters just for being gay if, like Thomas, you're also Baptist, pro-guns, anti-regulation, and anti-drugs. So the whole idea of being gay getting swing voters is stupid. \n\n2. It isolates his core bloc, which is again, Conservative Baptists. Thomas believes that they won't care if he's gay if he shares their views. I know this is *false*. Conservatives can and will basically flip their views on him the moment they find he's gay, and no matter what he says, they'll tune him out with 'gay, gay, gay, sin, sin, sin'.\n\nSo, I asked if he wanted my honest advice. He said sure. I asked him, are you intent on running as a conservative Baptist rather than a Moderate? Because as a gay moderate, he *may* have a chance. He affirmed he did want to run as a conservative Baptist. I told him then, honestly, don't be open about being gay. Hide it, if you really want to win. \n\nHe got offended at this. I can see where he's coming from. But 1) he said he wanted my honest opinion and 2) in the long run, I think giving him a fighting chance will make up for offending him now.\n\nSo, aita?",

      "description": "Okay that was a vague title. Here's the obligatory I'm on mobile/throwaway account/first post here/fake names/TL;DR at the bottom yada yada. \n\nSome context: my brother is a few years above me. He has a girlfriend who is homeschooled, but her younger sister goes to the same high school as my brother. I as an 8th grader did marching band at the high school. Because of this I now have some friends who are in the grades above me. \n\nSo I was at a sports game today. \nThis one person in my brother Jack's friend group was at the game and since I know him from band, we were talking a bit. He mentioned how Jack always complains about having a girlfriend and and wishes he was single. He also said some other things, but I don't think they were very important for the story. After talking to him for a bit I went back to my other friend. \nAfter the game I mentioned it to my mom, who said that it would be a good idea to warn Jack that people were saying that in case it got around to Sarah (Jack's girlfriend's sister) because she would definitely tell Jack's girlfriend Sophie. \nConversation when getting home:\nMe: Hey Jack can I talk to you?\nJack: yeah sure, is something wrong?\nMe: So I'm not going to say who, but someone mentioned how you said you wish you didn't have a girlfriend and-\nJack: what? No-\nMe: hold on let me finish. I never said it was true. I'm just letting you know people said that because it would be pretty bad if it got back to Sarah because she would tell Sophie.\nJack: *starts talking about how the closest he said was just that he didn't deserve Sophie and how he would never said that (he's said it to me before when frustrated)*\nMe: Okay, but I thought you would want to know\n\nWe kept going back and forth for a bit. He said that it was weird having me involved in his life like that, I pointed out he was the one who asks me to rate his looks on a scale of 1-10. He ended with I was giving unsolicited advice, so that's when I decided to stop. I felt like I was just telling him what people thought so he'd be prepared if it got around to Sarah (if someone told me that the person I was hypothetically dating wished they were single I'd be hurt), but he was pissed that I was getting involved and giving unsolicited advice. So Reddit, AITA?\n\ntl;dr I told my brother someone was saying that he complains about his girlfriend in case word got spread around, he got pissed because I was giving unsolicited advice and getting in his business.

      "description": "This is my first post ever so please forgive me if I've made any errors in formatting.\nThere are 4 people involved in this story (fake names for privacy obviously)\n\nMe\nHarry (My best friend)\nAbigail (Harry's girlfriend) \nAustin (the person Abigail hooks up with)\n\nThis happened around 9-10 months ago, at this point  everything was going well their relationship was going on well (had a few bumps just like other relationships) but around a month before shit hits the ceiling Harry was always suspicious of Austin and even though Abigail knew about this she used to joke with Harry about if they had a fight she would go to Austin for comfort and all that. Oh and I had Abigail's Instagram account cuz she followed like 20-30 meme pages and I cba to follow those many so she happily gave me her account.\nNow one random day I was scrolling through those pages and getting my daily dose of memes like any other day but on this day I saw a text notification that caught my eye, normally I ignore those and concentrate on my memes but this one was quite confusing. It was a text from Austin saying \" I don't wanna talk to you rn, no I'm not leaving you I just don't wanna talk right now\". Now those confused the hell out of me considering she was dating my best friend and from what I knew they were still together. (This is a very gray area as in the aftermath of this whole situation Abigail was saying they were on a break while Harry was saying they weren't very Ross Rachel like)  I take a screenshot of those texts just in case and move on. I thought maybe I misunderstood the situation or something but then the following chat they had confirmed my suspicions\nAustin: It felt amazing so calm down\nAbigail:Thanksss, sometimes just to piss Harry off I used to rub his dick under the table in tuitions like how I rubbed you yesterday\nNow when I read that I was like what the actual fuck so I ended up waiting for more evidence and got it then took screenshots and sent it to Harry which resulted in so much shit which still goes today.\nEver since I've always wondered whether I did the right thing or not cuz this whole situation definitely fucked up Harry's head.\nIf there's any confusion I'll try my best to clear it up in the comments ",

      "description": "My father has not been around for a while and it was just me and my mother. Up comes her current lover, which I will call David now. \n\nAt first I thought he was nice. He brought me and my mother to events I would never have gone to anyways. He bought me and my mother a couple of stuff. Im pretty sure he got me my Xbox 360 and a few games, and always got my mom some jewelry or clothing. I thought nothing of this since I was in middle school.\n\nFast forward to high school. I notice that some things are a bit off. Simple tasks, like ordering stuff online and buying drinks and food, he tells my mom to do. While shes busy with other stuff. It escalates to her helping him with his so called job. And I say so called cause I still dont know what it is. Buying envelopes, making phone calls, and helping with the money. \n\nHe regularly uses drugs at this point, everyday. Stinks up the house. Every simple task he never does and orders my mom to do it for him. I think he uses her to be more and more lazy. Every time he brings his kids from his ex-wifes house, me and my mom HAVE to take care of them. He leaves the house in a mess. Full sink. Doesnt take trash out or the recycling. I dont know what bills he pays for even. Argues with her, and even yelling at her if she doesnt do what he asks for.\n\nI start to hate him more and more. Right now, he has been kicked out the house 3 times. 3 fucking times. Last time he came back, my mother said she brought him back to \"kill him with kindness.\"\nShe keeps bringing him back, defending his actions. Even after I offer her help. At this point Im fed up with my moms actions and still do. I see no point in being in the household and with her, him.\n\nI feel bad though, because my mothers issue is she doesnt want to be left alone. My girlfriend lives in Brazil, and shes scared of me moving there. Even for college, she wanted me to stay in the city because she wouldnt see me as often. But at this point I dont even want to be in the same city as her, and I dont know if he was actually kicked out would help that.\n\nAm I the asshole here for disliking her now? ",

      "description": "This all reads as rather petty, but the feelings behind it are quite real.\n\nI was friends with somebody who I hadn't spoken to for a while because we fell out. I had feelings for them and they lead me on repeatedly, we argued a lot about everything, and then eventually I cut things off. \n\nRecently, I've had a lot of work to do and I like to spend my time destressing by playing video games. My friends invited me to play CS: GO with them so that was a plus. It's the only occasion I really get to spend time with them anymore because I'm so busy now. It was great until they also invited this old friend of mine to play with us. I tried to just suck it up and deal with it for a short while but eventually found myself very uncomfortable being in their presence again. It's been causing me stress when all I've wanted is a break, so I decided I'd just not play when he is because it's a better alternative to isolating myself from them all completely over something like that.\n\nIt backfired a fair bit because he's a very frequent player and so I have very frequently chosen to sit out of games. This is causing a few issues for all of us. \n\nMe:\n\n1) I've spoken to them about how I'm uncomfortable with how things are at the moment and why I'm not getting involved. They'll just tell me to get over it.\n\n2) I'm starting to feel very lonely because the time I wanted to spend playing games with my friends has become more stressful than it ought to be so I'm choosing not to engage. I'm starting to think it's time to go out and make some new friends, but I'm a little overworked right now and the effort of that seems very daunting.\n\nMy friends:\n\n1) My friends want a constant five-man team, so they've been really pissy with me lately over my decision to not play when this person is around.\n\nMy old friend: \n\n1) I've tried to talk to them about it to sort out past tensions, but they have blatantly refused and won't allow me to.\n\nI've explained the whole thing to all of them and from each possible perspective and I'm not really sure if there's something I'm missing here.

They go to their country house most weekends, so i planned meeting with my friends on saturday at my house and on friday asked them both if they are going to country house and if i could throw a little party.(I feel really awkward about my friends meeting my parents, so trying to avoid that if possible) They said they were going but I assumed they would go the same time as always around 12-13 in a day, so didn't ask about time. So saturday comes and I wake up around 8 in the morning and see my mom, at this moment I decide to ask her when exactly are they gonna leave, cause my friends and I wanted to meet at 12. (I suspect that's where the biggest miscommunication happened) So she starts freaking saying I shouldn't make her leave her house (which I actually wasn't trying to do) and then she says \"Your father will still be at work at 12, I was going to stay home until 18.00\" and I start to feel like an asshole for not asking them at friday when exactly are they gonna leave, so i ask her if I should cancel my plans (because I know 18.00 would be a bit too late for my friends), to which she says no couple times, but i think it through and come to conclusion, that I have no right to make her leave her house, so I cancel my party anyway. She says I shouldn't have but I explain her that I'm not a monster and wouldn't do that to her. Here I thought is a happy end, I feel like I handled a situation pretty good and wasn't an asshole in any way.\n\nBut. When time comes, I find out she simply lied to me about 18.00, they left house around 13, while I was napping. I found out about that and thought this situation through again and was furios (still am) when I confronted her about that (I wanted a simple sorry) she started lying again, saying she didn't say about 18.00 which made me nuts and I just said I don't wanna talk about it anymore and went to my room, where out of pure frustration said \"what a bitch\" (it wasn't even loud or anything) and she ran into room trying to bend situation like it's my fault. I was having none of it. My father came home and stopped the fight but i still don't want to talk to her until she apologises. Am I asking too much, am I wrong in some way?",

      "description": "My buddy and I moved into a new apartment in November, and there is an extra room. We moved in a girl who is-for all rhyme and reason-a decent person despite her splitting hairs with me on certain issues (timing of rent payments, New year's celebrations, a homeless friend she had stay over for a few days..) we aren't great friends but she pays rent and helps out around the house so I can't take any ostensible issue with her. The thing is, these minor instances have kind of set things off with her and I at odds with each other. She smokes menthols like several times every day usually two at a time. It's not much of an issue but she comes back in and smells like it.. she is constantly smelling her hands and she is generally gross about it. I know it seems like it shouldn't be an issue, but it sets me off. I sneeze and cough even when I can hardly smell it.. so I have asked her to smoke away from the house so the entryway doesn't smell like it. I want her to wash her hands when she comes in too because the smell is really very obtrusive. I hate menthols and I quit smoking awhile back.\n\nWhen I approached her to lay down some boundaries about bringing smoke in with her, she got miffed and began snarking off about how she's a grown woman and she can do what she wants. This is a terribly trivial thing, but it's my opinion that if I want her to not bring the smoke around me, she oughta respect it. I want things to be culpable between us but she doesn't seem to respect her own health or my boundaries and that really gets my goat.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I really believe I love my current partner but I’m also wondering if it’s more of a platonic love. This is the second longest and realest relationship I would say I’ve ever had but the first of which has been with a woman. I once dated a girl in college for three months but we were horrible to each other. The one year relationship I had with a boy was also chaotic. This relationship has lasted five months and we’ve both learned wonderful things about ourselves and each other but I’m also not sure if this person is my life partner or not. I quit smoking weed almost a year ago and recently relapsed, one thing that really bothers me is this person often being stereotyped as a “stoner” and knowing they indulge on occasion when I in fact cannot indulge without becoming addicted - obviously my own insecurity that needs to be overcome. My partners goals encourage me but sometimes I also wonder if they work hard enough in other aspects of their life that I care about. I often get annoyed by little things like waking up early and making schedules. I also feel that I hate breaking up and tend to get really overattached and codependent during the breaking up phase and now that I’m thinking about ending it I also don’t want to end it more than ever. I would appreciate thoughts and experience because I wonder if I’ve always been TA or if I’m just going through what everybody goes through.",

      "description": "This happened 5 years ago so this is more so “was I the asshole?” I was a sophomore in high school and taking a remedial science class. There was a small group of ghetto girls (before you accuse me of being racist or assume these people I’m mentioning are of a certain race. I’m not saying whether these people are white, black, Hispanic, Asian or fucking martians. They just had a loud ghetto attitude).  \n\nAnyways I suck at science. I had a D in the class and was trying to pass to avoid summer school. I have learning disabilities and these loud girls talking in the middle of instruction was no help at all. They would constantly be talking (more like yelling) throughout class and we constantly fell behind because of it. I missed a lot of information.   \n\nOne day I got fed up so I turned around and asked one of them “would it kill you to shut the hell up for just 5 minutes?”\n\nShe looks at me like I just spat on her kid (no I don’t think she had a kid)  and yelled “BITCH YOU DO NOT TALK TO ME LIKE THAT” as if she was royalty.  We argued back and forth a little bit and after I “talked back” to her the third time, she got up and angrily left the classroom. As soon as she walked up random classmates started yelling “what the hell is your problem?” “You didn’t have to do that”, “was that really necessary dude?”  It felt like bullshit. \n\nThe 2 para educators had to take turns calming her down outside for 20 minutes. She came back inside later and just sat quietly in the back of the room giving me dirty looks.  The teacher pulled me aside the next day and told me while he didn’t blame me, I could have handled the situation better. I felt like I handled it better than he did all semester.  ",

      "description": "Recently my parents asked me to take care of the \"family business\" - we have 8 rooms to rent and basically all our money comes through it. Some of the people living there aren't paying rent and they want me to handle the situation as they say I'm more rational and cold when dealing with people. \n\nThe situation that is annoying me is this one: they talked to me about a certain guy living there who is not paying rent FOR HALF A YEAR. His historic is: nice guy who was living there for two years, paying rent correctly, never getting into trouble, then suddenly loses his job, stop paying rent, neighbors start complaining about him being drunk everyday. The guy is depressed and suffers from alcoholism, apparently. My father told him to move out multiple times but he's refusing to go because he's unemployed and will end up on the streets. My father considered calling the police but he says that he will feel guilty if the guy ends up homeless because he's sick and he was a good guy before unfortunately getting fired. \n\nWe have some money on the bank and that's why my father wasn't that bothered with not getting paid, but now we are spending a lot of that money and there's a risk that we will not be able to pay the degree I will be starting this year, also both him and my mom started having some health issues. Money is going fast and our rooms aren't shelters, we need the money that comes through them and that's why my father wants me to deal with the situation because he doesn't have the guts to tell people to move out or call the police. Well, I can easily go through the situation with two of the three people who aren't paying because I know they have family in town and that they can live with them, but the third guy is the one that I mentioned before and he has no family in here because he came to work, almost guaranteed that he will be homeless. This is breaking my heart and I'm felling so guilty for it, but I'm almost sure that I will give him 15 days to move out and if he stays there I will call the police. AITA here?",

      "description": "Hello, I read the rules and I think I'm ready to tell you my history and I hope you can give me your opinion about it.\n\nI have a friend, let's say she's called Jane, I met like ten years ago. We have supported each other through different complicated situations, like financial problems, a kind of abusive husband (hers), problems in the school with my children, etc. I helped her to get another job when she had financial problems too, recommending her to the company where I was working at the time.\n\nThen, I began to have problems with that company because I was freelancing for them and, even if we settled that I will do a number and kind of tasks and they will paid me a monthly salary in our spoken agreement (a big mistake, I should have insisted on a written agreement, but that's other story), they kept asking me to do more and more and more. I refused a few times, I say yes to others, the work relationship was kind of tense. I spoke to this friend, who agreed they were abusive, and they were also asking her to do more and more, and proposed her that we started our own company (a website to offer certain product) and asked her if she wanted to participate. She said yes.\n\nThe first time I asked her to give me her opinion to buy the domain for the website (I wanted to know what she thought about some names I believed were good for the site) she said she didn't have time and acted annoyed, as if I was asking her to do a lot of work or something. I wanted her opinion only, but well. She ghosted me from then on, not talking to me in any way, no phone, messages, WhatsApp or any other means we used before. I could swear I wasn't rude or anything, but anyway, if I was, she always said she would be honest with me. But that didn't happen.\n\nWell, the company I was working for decided to end the work relationship because I refused to do another big and complicated task for free. I wasn't surprised and anyway I was about to leave them because I wasn't happy. Well, that was expected, but what I didn't expect was to know, by accident (I saw a post in Facebook mentioning this ex friend) that she was going to take my job. She didn't tell me anything about it. The only thing that I believe was aimed at me was a post saying that some friends are better than others and that it's great you can disagree with some people, but so sad you can't with others and then, nothing. Obviously, she blocked me from seeing her timeline. I considered I was losing my time with someone who wasn't honest, who had ghosted me for six months without any explanation about it, who didn't talk to me after she ended with the job I did before, a job that she was able to have because I recommended her and that, even if it wasn't her fault the job relationship ended, it would have been a kindness to me to tell me what was going to happen, since I was her friend, so I unfriended her everywhere.

      "description": "I (54F) have been with my boyfriend (55M) since 2006. We have been domestic partners since 2011. He is a night owl. I am a morning person. This is not by choice, it’s just the way each of us is metabolically wired. \n\nI don’t choose to wake when the sun rises. Quite the opposite; I spent $3000 out of MY OWN POCKET for custom blackout curtains to try to block the rising sun and my biological urge to wake with it. I take sleeping pills and sometimes take (way too much) alcohol before bed in an effort to sleep sounder.  I often wake in the early hours of the morning and try desperately to get back to sleep, to no avail .   My mother and father are both morning people so I think that supports my argument that it is how I’m biologically wired. His father is a morning person,  his mother is not.  He drinks daily which exasperates his late awaking (IMHO).\n\nI try my best to stay awake with him for evening movies but I often fall asleep to his great frustration.  He quizzes me during the movies ; “Are you awake?”,  “Are you awake?”, “Are you awake?”... it’s very frustrating.\n\nBreakfast out is my special treat for me.  I don’t know why.  I can only suppose it’s because I’m a morning person. I love breakfast out. Since I’ve been with my partner, I can literally count on one hand the number of times we’ve been out for breakfast together outside of when we’re forced to do it because of an early morning flight or family engagement.  \n\nOn rare occasion I suggest we go out for breakfast; “Hey, let’s do breakfast tomorrow “.  This is normally greeted with “How early were you thinking “?  He might suggest “not before 11:00”.  “Nobody gets up early on a weekend just for breakfast “.  It inevitably ends up in a fight if the proposed time is before 11am.  Sometimes he tries to find a restaurant with an all day breakfast menu but for me, it’s more about the early start on the day and less about the menu.  The reality is we struggle to get out of the house before noon on any weekend days. \n\nWe literally had this exact fight tonight. He won’t remember any of it come morning, I’m sure of it. \n\nI desperately want a partner who is willing to recognize that a few times a year he should be the one to operate outside of his normal circadian cycle.  It seems like I’m always trying to be an evening partner for him but he’s very resistant (combative) when it comes to being a morning partner for me.  I’m happy to quiz him during breakfast; “Are you awake?”,  “Are you awake?”, “Are you awake? :)\n\nAITA for wanting my partner to break from his night owl schedule a couple of times a year for a breakfast date \nwith his partner of 13+ years?\n\nTL; DR:  He is a night owl, I’m a morning person. Once or twice a year I’d like to go out to early breakfast with him without it being a huge argument. ",

      "description": "So, heres the context\n\nI go to a very small college (1,200 students) This school offers a program where you get a bachelors degree in 3 years, and a Masters in 1 year. This school is private and rather expensive. My parents are helping me pay for college, and stipulated that I could go to this school, on the condition I enrolled in this program and completed my masters. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finished my undergrad with an honors degree, had awards for extracurricular and the whole 9 yards. My parents were very proud. They also agreed to let me take the summer off before I started my masters. (Keep in mind I had 3 very good internships in past summers, and I work during the school year for the Head of a department at the university) My parents helped me with rent and food, and I also stayed at home a bit and I assisted them with small jobs, and caring for my grandmother. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, heres the rub\n\nMy masters program schedule is a little asinine. Classes run for a full calendar year, from August 2018 to August 2019.  But, the graduation ceremony is in May 2019. Then 2 weeks later classes start again. My school wont host 2 ceremony's because they are cheap, and combine masters and undergrad into 1. The point is, I dont want to go to graduation and then go back to class. I think it cheapens my achievement. Not to mention I have come to hate this program a bit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, I am afraid of letting me parents down. They are VERY invested in me getting this degree and helped me get it. Additionally, My Grandmother did not come to my undergrad graduation because she only wanted to go to one, and decided to come to the last one. She has also contributed to my education a significant amount, and is invested in me getting this degree. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for cheating my family out of a 2nd graduation ceremony?

We we're all best friends. Like spent every day hanging out. They were kind of a weird family though.. I honestly can't put my finger on why, they were just strange. \n\nAnyway, we moved away when I was like 8ish. I never really saw them again. \n\nCue me being like 20. I ended up driving by my old house just to see it, and I noticed they still lived there!! So I knocked on the door, and figured I'd just say hey, and catch up a bit. \n\nThe dude who was my age answered and was nice enough and everything.. but the parents, and even him we're stressing pretty hard about how I should've called first and shouldn't just stop by unannounced.. \n\nI left with a really strange feeling like I had done something wrong, and was an asshole. \n\nSo.. I need judgement.lol. Was I the asshole?",

If I am indeed the asshole, I will accept my judgement with a grateful heart.\n\nAnyway, with yesterday being April Fool’s, I decided to go with a classic office prank.  I purchased a dozen fresh donuts and filled the box with goldfish crackers.  It was a big hit.  Afterward, I told my friends that my intention was to replace the donuts the following day.  I had them all in Ziploc baggies and was just going to place them, in said baggies, on the counter in the staff lounge. \n\nMy friends were horrified when they heard this.  By keeping them in the baggies, it would be obvious that I touched them to put them inside.  They suggested I place them individually back in the box (which would require I touch them not once, but twice) or purchase a new dozen (yeah … no).  I say, donuts in Ziploc baggies or bust.  They say it’s gross.\n\nHelp us, Reddit!  Each side thinks the other is truly insane! \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

But then I asked why was he in jail and it was for heroin usage. Fast forward hes sentenced to about 3 years in prison. He's been writing me letters and trying to call me , I was always hesitant to pick up his calls. About the third day he called me I was honest and I said how I don't want to talk to him because he lied to me. I told my mama and abuela about what I said and word spread throughout our family and about like a day or two lager my tio (uncle) calls me up and demands I apologize to my dad for not wanting to speak to him.

      "description": "Second account as I don't want this tied to my main. Also I am new to this subreddit as a whole so I apologize if I make any errors. \nI am genuinely confused whether my stance on this makes me the asshole... \n\nI am in high school, going to college in a few years.. my father got a promotion in work so we'll be relocating really far away from where we are now. \nI have a GF in high school who I've been together with since 6 months now. I really love her and obviously we didn't tell our parents about this as we're in high school. She has a sister who knew about us and she decided to tell her mom about this relationship. Ironically she was in a relationship too with a much older guy and my GF didn't tell her mom about this. Now the pressure is on her from both of her parents giving her the silent treatment.. so I asked GF to snitch on her sister too (her sister is 2 years younger and had a bf way older than me) so she's out of the line of fire. GF declines saying that \"I'm the elder sister, and I won't do this to her\" \nI replied saying that your sister should've thought about this too but she didn't.. its not about what's right anymore because your sister crossed the line.. its about saving yourself. Am I The Asshole? #1\n\nHer mom doesn't approve of us and wants us to be just friends and be in a relationship when we're ready for it. GF doesn't want to disobey her mom. \nMy reasoning here was that I'm going to relocate in 1 month anyway so why not be together for my last moments here? I said that as much as I would love to marry you in 10-15 years we both know its not going to happen and its possible that we're never meeting again. \nShe tells me to have a little faith in God and if we really loved each other we will meet... I said that life is harsh and the bitter truth is that we are never meeting again and we both will find someone else. \nAm I The Asshole #2 for trying to make it last for 1 more month? I am not trying to dominate here. Should I just take the hint and end it? ",

I actually fell for her, despite having a hard time trusting anybody, and things went south. Long story short, she broke my heart, but we still keep in touch and hang out on occasion. Anyway, her class is 90% girls, and I already know a lot of them, either through Ellie, or from other friends, or school or whatever. \n\nSo, I've slept with several of her friends. Some of them I knew were friends of hers, others I found out later, but it's getting to be a lot of people she knows that I've slept with, since sleeping with as many people as possible is kind of the way I cope with heartbreak and bad feelings. I've asked the girls I slept with to not tell Ellie, since I don't want any awkward feelings, but I get the feeling she knows, since she has been really distant and hasn't really talked to me that much lately. \n\nTo make things worse, a girl from her class, we can call her Jenny, has started sending me some pics, and invited me to hang out with her at her place this weekend. \n\nAm I the asshole for basically sleeping my way through the friend group of a girl that completely broke my heart?",

Of course there is going to be music (live or not, doesn't matter) and people will dance.\n\nDancing seems to be like a \"requirement\" in my country. At these huge family gatherings, people pressure into it, especially older people. \"Take her for a spin\", shit like that is not uncommon to hear. 5 months ago, my mom celebrated her 50th birthday and there was this thing the musicians did, they picked a single person at a table who had to make a toast with his table (4 tables), and the table that was the loudest would \"win\". He picked me as the dude that doesn't dance.\n\nI fucking hate dancing. I don't like to do it, I really suck at it, I need a couple of drinks to even get me on the floor, and even then I don't feel comfortable. Music is my biggest passion, but I will never feel this music so much that I could dance to it, since my kind of music is the complete opposite (metal/punk).\n\nMy girlfriend said that its like a tradition that the son in law has to take the mother in law for a dance. It's also expected from me to take my girlfriend to dance, but this is probably only from the family's side, since I talked to her about this and she said she doesn't give a crap about me not dancing and respects it because it's not who I am. Her mother will apparently be very offended if I refuse to do so.\n\nI talked to my family about this and they said I just need to suck it up and do it.

Me, Person A, &amp; Person B\n\nPerson A jokingly mentioned he wanted me to invite my girlfriend’s little sister to a group event all of us we were planning. In response, I said that I find it weird to have a friend date my girlfriend’s little sister as I find it one step detached from being eskimo brother. I realize this may be an unpopular opinion, but I only care enough to the extent that I wasn’t looking to actively set them up. If they were to meet organically, more power to them. \n\nIn response, A found this strange and told me that he thought there was nothing wrong with being eskimo brothers with ex-girlfriends, much less sisters of a current girlfriend. In fact, A went so far as to say that he would be okay with his friends being eskimo brothers with his ex-girlfriend. Surprised, I asked A again if he was hypothetically okay with our mutual friend (Person B) being eskimo brothers with his ex-girlfriend. He in turn found this comment to be of low taste and was quite upset by it and went so far as to say I had low EQ for bringing her up\n\nI’m curious what Reddit’s opinion on this is as I usually quite sensitive around bringing up ex-girlfriends. In my opinion, I wasn’t out of base bringing up A’s ex-girlfriend in this context as he essentially said first that it was okay",

      "description": "Sorry for my poor english knowledge and formatting. Writing on mobile.\n\nEvery Thursday and/or Saturday I rehearsel with my band in the basement of our favourite bar.\nI always come home at 8:45 pm after rehearsel.\nToday there was a DJ who played some decent stuff we're into. I would have come home early anyway If my girlfriend wish to but she wanted to come too, to stay and drink, party, and have good time.\nSo she came at 10 pm and immediately texted me across the room that she wouldn't have come if she knew that there were so many people (she suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder and has sociophobic symptoms).\nShe started conversating with strangers anyway and seemed to have good time. She was laughing, talking, and didn't bother at all that she didn't know those people.\nAt around 2 am she wanted to go home while I was in the middle of a darts game. She insisted on going right now even though the game wasn't finished yet.\nI told that we can go home when the game is finished.\nSo we stayed for another 40 minutes or so when she texted that she wants to go now. She was pissed. Really pissed.\nShe said in a reallys disparaging way that I can stay longer if I want to and that she goes home (she always does this if something doesn't go to her plan and cries about it later).\nI - knowing her - knew of course that she wanted me to come with her so I paid our bill, dropped out of the game and told her that I am ready to go. We went outside where she said that I am shall go away. I tried to talk to her but then she ran off in the middle of the night. I couldn't find her and she wouldn't answer my calls. I went home and waited for her to come which happend about 30 minutes after.\n\nSo AITA? Did I do anything wrong in this situation?",

      "description": "Yes, I am a senior in high school and yes the obvious decision is forget them when you graduate in a few months, but I see them everyday and I've known them for almost a decade so this a huge deal for me.\n\nSo now that that's out of the way...this year, I've been reconsidering my friend group I've known since 5th grade. I heard the quote, \"If 9 of your friends are broke, you will be the 10th\" or \"You are who are your friends are.\" That quote made me think about who my friends are and consider if I want to be known for who they are. I realized that I am the only one of my friends with a job, a license and car, and I have more than $1000 in my bank account unlike them.\n\nOne friend has OCD and is sad that everyone around her is in a relationship except her and her parents won't let her see a therapist. When I first met my boyfriend, she made it all about herself and was sad that she's not in the same position. And now another friend of ours went on her first date and is experiencing the same thing I did, but no one listened to me the first time I said anything. But not everyone likes to hear about relationships so I just don't talk about my boyfriend with her because I have other friends who like to hear about that stuff. On top of that, all she ever talks about is sex and the ironic part is that she's a virgin. She is obsessed with feeding over-weight, submissive men who eventually get nauseous and likes to reminisce about rubbing stomachs. And everyone finds it hilarious! I'm all for supporting the fact that people have the right to express their sexual feelings, but does she have to be so open about it? It's kinda creepy. (also she had a random mental breakdown in the middle of lunch with no explanation. she started bawling out of no where and none of our friends consoled her because they said \"i don't know what to do\" \"i'm not good at that kinda stuff\" \"it's not my thing\"\n\nAnd the girl I mentioned earlier who went on her first date, her dad died when we were in middle school. Her mom lets her smoke weed, but her mom doesn't know she socially drinks at parties. And I have a theory that she was sexually abused as a child because she told me she has PTSD and she showed me a song that she said really described her. One of the lyrics was, \"I was molested at 8\" so maybe, but not for certain. She has a dominant personality and is the one I fear the most will come after me if I suddenly just decide to leave.\n\nAnd the other guy is gay in a strict catholic home and his sister died when we were in middle school so that's just a huge mess. I don't have any personal problems with him because we're not really that close.\n\nSome might say that it's harsh for me to just leave my friends when they're in a time of need, but they do not know how to support each other when the other is going through a rough episode. Anytime something good happens to me, like the fact that it was my 1 year anniversary with my boyfriend on Valentine's Day, makes me feel like I'm bragging and being selfish because they are not living their best lives right now. When someone in a friend group is sharing something good that's happened to them, the rest should put aside their personal problems and give the other person a moment to shine. And a good friend group lets everyone experience this and they don't do that. I'm not asking for the spotlight to be on me because the same thing happened to the girl who went on her first date. They all want to be on the same playing field. If one is suffering, someone like me where life is going great, shouldn't really talk too much about how good their life is going because people like the girl with OCD could be hurt.",

      "description": "AITA for not wanting to talk to him again? \n\nI ordered food from a local pizza place and had it delivered but had the weirdest/worst interaction with the delivery driver which prompted me to message the business through Facebook. The conversation I had with the business ended up making me feel worse and that I shouldn't have bothered letting them know in the first place. Is there something I'm missing? \n\nHere's the conversation:\n\nMe: I just had a terrible interaction with your delivery driver. I live on (My Street Name). He came to the door, didn't say a word after I greeted him then just passed me the terminal to pay with my card. After it went through I returned it to him then he proceeded to shove my food into my stomach then turn around and left without saying anything. He topped it off by throwing the debit receipt on my front lawn. I can't even believe how unprofessional he was. \n\nBusiness:  I’m really sorry to hear that and thank you for letting us know. If you don’t mind what was your address, so we know which driver delivered you food. This is very unacceptable no matter any reason and the matter will be taken care of. \n\nMe: (My Address)\n\nBusiness:  Thank you again. And I’ll keep you informed what goes on. \n\nMe: Thank You\n\nBusiness: The driver name is (His Name) he is a really nice guy and doesn’t do these type of actions. I don’t know if he is feeling off today but to make the long story short dear I told him he had to apologize in person and I need to make sure your satisfied for him to keep his job. \n\n I hope you don’t mind \n\nMe:  I don't want to see him again this is very inappropriate \n\nBusiness:  I’m trying to call him back not getting an answer \n\nHe’s back here now sorry about that \n\nMe:  Yeah he come to our door and my husband answered. If you want to keep him as an employee that's fine, it's your decision. I mentioned it to you because there is no reason for someone to act that way and I didn't want him doing it to other people. \n\nBusiness:  I do appreciate that dear I will talk to the driver end of the night but I think he gets the picture and I would like to give you a 20 dollar credit for next time. \n\n Sorry again and I do apriate your concern.

I told her in my defense, my father calls me that all the time, and no one says anything. She ignores what I say and she said, \"Still.

      "title": "AITA For Cutting A Toxic My Toxic Sister Out Of My Life?",
      "description": "My sister and I have a complicated history.  We come from a divorced family and both of our parents have passed away in the last ten years (we are both in our 30s, so our parents did both pass away rather young.)\n\nMy sister and I have constantly bickered throughout our lives, and I know that she harbors resentment towards me due to the unique arrangement that was reached between our parents after the divorce.  My father moved back in with his parents after the divorce and I moved in with him shortly afterwards, while my sister stayed with our mother.  Soon after this, my grandfather passed away from cancer and my father remained by my grandmother's side to take care of her.  In essence, I was raised by my father and grandmother and only occasionally visited my mother.\n\nMy sister definitely got the short end of the stick.  Our mother was an alcoholic and a drug abuser (prescription medicines mostly, but more illicit substances here and there for sure) and had terrible choice in men.  My sister was placed in an emotionally abusive situation for her entire childhood and it messed her up quite a bit.\n\nOnce we grew up, my sister moved in with her boyfriend in her early 20s and eventually they had two children together.  I was a bit of a later bloomer and didn't really get my life together until my early 30s.\n\nWhen I was about to be married is when things really started to go south in my relationship with my sister.  My wife and I had decided to have a small ceremony but had of course invited her.  With less than a month to go before the wedding, she had not RSVP'd and when we spoke about it, she was offended that my wife had not asked her to throw her a bridal shower and also that her son and daughter would not be the flower girl and ring-bearer. a) My wife did not want to ask anyone to throw her a bridal shower.  Her aunts offered to throw her one and she accepted.  My wife would have been happy to have a bridal shower thrown by my sister, but did not want to solicit one herself. b) As previously mentioned, we were having a small ceremony and did not plan to have a ring bearer or a flower girl.  We only had one person each, a best man and a maid of honor.  I explained to her that it wasn't going to be that kind of wedding.\n\nEventually she did decide to go to the wedding, but it was like pulling teeth and she made up some story about \"not getting the invitation\" (this will be important later).  The wedding was lovely and the next couple years were fine.\n\nAt Christmastime of last year, my sister stopped talking with our grandmother over an argument they had on Christmas Eve.  My sister had not brought a gift for my grandmother (although her children had brought grandma a gift.  My grandmother, being a fiesty 90-year-old woman, made a comment about it, so my sister went from 0 to 60, grabbed her children and left.  She did not speak to my grandmother until this September and would not return phone calls and messages on the subject.\n\nShe also cancelled family get-togethers (namely her children's birthday parties) this year and has generally been difficult to reach.  My wife and I attempted to reach out several time, but were ignored or given the run-around.\n\nThings came to a head earlier this year when my wife and I became pregnant.  My sister was one of the first people we tried to call, and we left a few voice messages on the subject.  We didn't outright say the news, but we ended the messages with \"call us back, we have some really exciting news to share!\" each time.  As a couple of childbearing age that had been married nearly two years at the time, we felt like we were laying it on pretty thick with the messages.\n\nThe messages went unheeded, so we stopped trying to give my sister any special treatment.  We had stopped communicating over text for a while, and, as mentioned before she seemed to be intentionally making herself hard to reach.\n\nMy sister found out about the pregnancy a few months later when it was safe to post on social media.  She sent my an angry text message that day about not telling her.  I simply told her that she was one of the first people we tried to call and that we had called several times.  She claimed to have not received those messages (sensing a pattern yet?) and tried to make me feel guilty by bringing up that we never talked to her kids anymore.  We would have been more than happy to visit with her children if she did not make herself so difficult to get in touch with, if she didn't stop coming to family functions and cancel traditional times where we would typically see each other.  We eventually stopped trying after every conversation either became a runaround or an argument.  At this point we felt that the relationship had become toxic and started ignoring her.\n\nDespite this, I insisted that she be invited to our baby shower.  She was the only person who did not RSVP one way or another (she must not have gotten the invitation again) and did not show up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has occasionally posted on social media, lamenting the fact that she does not have a close relationship with her remaining family, and makes herself out to be the victim and the rest of us villains.  Hence this thread.  Are we the villains?  You are clearly only getting one side of the story, but should we have tried harder after getting ignored repeatedly?  Are we privileged assholes who don't care about our extended family?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I’m not sure why, but the only way I can drink it is if it’s cold and very watered down. He makes the tea with 8oz of water, 1-2 teabags and about a half a cup of honey. It ends up super thick and tasting like turned elderberry syrup. \n\nNow I understand and appreciate the gesture, but I’ve said a few times that the tea makes me really sick. Like indigestion and other kinds of sick.

An employee is nothing but mean to me and I believe I have done anything wrong. \n\nI am a merchandiser for a beverage company. And I haven't even been working there for 2 months, very new to all of this. Especially dealing with terrible people.\nI have to make the order and work the product when the truck arrives. I'm never there for over an hour. There are 2 woman who work at DG whenever I'm there. One of them is nice, and the other I can describe as nothing but a bitch. \nThe nice one of the 2 gave me 4 receipts and asked if I and someone else I know do the survey for them. And she asked me to give them very high marks. Lately they've received bad marks and as a result they have to be on conference calls twice a day. \nToday I went in to make my order and I simply asked how their morning was going and they both responded \"it isn't\" \nBottom line is, Corp. was coming in later that day and the mean one told me how I haven't order any sports drinks. And then she said to me \"I have asked you to order them and you haven't. I've sent in an eticket (complaint) on you because you aren't doing your job.\" I told her how she has in fact NOT asked me to order any sports drinks. And if I had known, I would have. Because it's my JOB. I apologized for the mishap and she said \"your 'sorries'(?) are getting old.\" I feel like she's blaming me for corporate coming in. \n\nI'm very tempted to give them a bad review. Today I order the drinks like she had asked and I'm going to continue to do my job. Anything helps, sorry if this doesn't fit all the requirements for this sub ",

So i have to hurry through a 100 years of grime, caked on everything she brings so i can be ready for other people. I hand her the last box and she walks out the doors. \n\nSoon as that glass shut, I flipped on both birds and start machine gunning middle fingers with authority. Shit you not... Fired the last round and its like it actually hit her. She disappears between her truck and the car next to it. I run out there to see if shes okay... \n\nShe had eaten every bit of that reinforced Costco Kirkland Signature box and busted her nose all to hell. Blood pouring out of her face like a broken keg tap. I look her over, handed her a rag for the bleeding and I call 911. She has a life alert on so she hits the button. Shes coughing, crying, and bleeding into the life alert and the dude on the other end starts berating her about how she shouldn't have called 911. I hear this and bite my damn lip cause I can't believe I just heard this dude say that shit. Ambulance shows up ten min later. They stop the bleeding, say shes okay and take off. I offer her the restroom, she cleans up, gets in her truck and leaves. \n\nSo she shows up a couple days ago and she looks like she got worked over. Have to bite my lip again but I ain't even angry about the dirty ass stuff she brought.\n\nAITA for giving her the force push middle finger?\nAITA for wanting to laugh when the life alert guy was talking shit?\nAITA for wanting to laugh at the raccoon eyes Iron Box Tyson left?\n\n",

      "description": "Happened yesterday, I work as a TV tech and am a relatively new hire (&lt; 3 months) who has been performing well, and so received a very newly hired tech as a shadow yesterday (with no prior heads up. That’s a theme here.)\n\nI needed to stock a new van instead of taking my normally assigned one (no heads up, again) and ended up needing to come back to the warehouse twice, once around 9 AM, once around 11:45 AM. Upon leaving at 9, I asked my shadow if he wanted to stop and get food, as I was all set eating my bagel I’d brought as breakfast. He declined, and so we went on our way. \n\nAs we were leaving around noon, he asked if we could stop and grab a bite. At this point, I was on a one-track mind of getting the job done and was stressed enough that I was looking bad by needing to come back to the warehouse twice in a morning. I explained that I didn’t want to look bad and that I’d like to get the job done first (about a 2 hour process with us both working on it) and he became angry, eventually telling me to not talk to him and completely ignoring me as if I wasn’t there. Upon arriving back at the job (we’d arrived once before returning to the office the second time), he gets out and walks away, and I’m told arrived later on at the office to discuss it with our manager. \n\nAITA? I had no intention of making him go the day without eating, I simply wanted to get done first a job that had been significantly delayed and not look bad at my job. ",

      "description": " Over the holidays my family went out to see the new Spiderman movie at the theater. We got there a little early, got all our snacks and got to watch some of those pre-movie commercials.\n\nSo far all good.\n\nRight before the movie starts a dad comes in with his kid (probably late elementary school, 10 or so?) near the middle of the row we are in. Immediately the kid starts to have a screaming tantrum about how he doesn't want to sit next to strangers. He's kicking his seat and smacking food onto the floor. The dad tries to make him hush quietly but the kid won't stop screaming. Other people in the theater are turning around to look at him but no one is saying anything.\n\nThe kid doesn't stop even when the actual movie starts and the dad still hasn't taken him out of the theater. By this point I'm irritated enough to start a conflict so I duck through the row and loud whisper to the dad something along the lines of 'get your fucking brat kid out of here or I'll find someone else to kick you out' (ok so maybe yelling wasn't the right word to use). The dad looks mortified and doesn't say anything, just pulls his kid up and walks out of the theater.\n\nIn retrospect maybe I should have just gotten an usher but in the moment I was too irritated to be 100% rational. I think the dad was probably stressed out and just didn't know what to do with his sucky kid, so for that I kind of feel bad, like I should have handled the situation differently.\n\nTL;DR Kid is loud and obnoxious at the movies, I confront the (probably exhausted dad) and tell him to get out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I believe even the biggest idiot should be allowed to voice ther opinion so there can actually be a discussion about that view. AITA?",

      "description": "My wife and I came home with our new baby 6 weeks ago.  Being a new mom, the curve for her has been a hard one. Being a second time dad I have tried to make sure she has all the support she needs. I keep the feeding schedule (if she’s up I’m up) so she doesn’t feel alone. I call her friends to invite them to stop by so she doesn’t have to feel needy. \n\nI do all the housework anyway because I’m already a stay home dad. I do the shopping, cleaning cooking and managing of our older boys routine when he’s spending his weeks with us. I fix the cars I repair the house. I go and do odd jobs for extra cash so my hobbies don’t take away from the house finances. This is my usual routine. I have not asked her for help in it. He only thing I don’t really help with is her personal laundry. Ruin one cashmere sweater and you never live it down. \n\nI don’t usually take naps it’s not a thing I really get to do.  I treat being a stay home dad like a real job and so I make my self busy from 6am to 630 when dinner is over. Monday through Friday  and from when ever breakfast is on the weekends till dinner. Just like every other stay home parent I don’t get a day off sick or not. Sometimes I dose in-front if the news or whatever show is on around 7 but I’m always woken up to a reminder that “I won’t be able to sleep if I take a nap now.” \n\nToday I was doing some tummy time with the baby and we were laying in a strip of sun. It was warm. We were on the squishy rug. We both passed out. I got woke up to empty the car of the consumables we went to get today.  I said “ok in a bit. I’m really comfortable napping with my boy.”  Mind you it was only about 10 minutes. I got some attitude in her voice as she exclaimed that “well I’m up folding laundry and making the house nice and relaxing. So I’d like it if you would get the stuff out of the car.” Then the baby starts to cry. So I jokingly “said see you made he baby cry. He just wanted a nap too.” Apparently now I’m the asshole because I wasn’t doing shit and then made her feel bad for wanting I have a nap when she was motivated to do some chores.\n\nAm I the asshole?

      "description": "Last weekend I went out to meet a few friends at a bar. Needless to say, by night's end I ended getting a little inebriated. I also ended up forgetting to close out my tab and forgot my card at the bar, which didn't reopen until five days later. Despite my condition, I remember what I drank and in what order I drank them. All the drinks I knowingly purchased don't even come close to the amount that was posted on my credit statement. Additionally, I paid gratuity in cash as I ordered each drink, even though I had a tab open.\n\nFor several days, the charge pending on my credit statement was an amount that I thought was a little high, but well within the realm of what I ordered that night. However, today on the day when the bar reopened, the final charge posted. The thing is, this charge was a little over 70% higher than what was pending and seems far in excess of what I ordered and put on my tab. Today, I went to the bar at open to recover my card. I asked for a receipt, but they were unable to provide one (something about another company processing the transactions) and told me to return tomorrow. I ended up signing no receipt to authorize any charge to my card, despite a final charge being posted. I also looked at the signage around the bar and there was no documentation posted suggesting there is an additional charge for cards left overnight or unclosed tabs.\n\nTomorrow I plan on returning to get a receipt, which I expect to be itemized. I know for a \\*fact\\* I did not spend as much as the amount posted to my credit statement. Would I be out of line to refuse to pay for drinks (or additional gratuity) added to my bill that I did not order? Since the final charge was posted and I'd presume a signature is no longer required by the merchant, would I be the asshole if I disputed the portion of the charge in question with my credit card company? or in the event they are unable to provide an itemized receipt, the entire charge?",

      "description": "Some quick back story, my actual father became addicted to alcohol in my early teenage years and I often got into physical fights with him about anything and everything.\n\nSo now I'm 21 and mystep father got drunk in the middle of the day for some reason and was being a bit of a dick. I don't like confrontations so I went to my bedroom to take a nap so my mother could get home and take control of the situation.\n\nAn hour or so later he came down banging on my door and shouting from the other side. I asked him what was wrong and he just mumbled something about me being a cunt. So I went upstairs and asked him what was wrong. He just went around in circles about nonsense, he had obviously been drinking more since I went to bed. He became irate and I approached him because I was sick of yelling out to him across the living room. \n\nAt this point he braced himself against the counter and dared me to \"try it\", I was confused because I had no intention of doing anything of the sort. I tried to explain this to him but he kept screaming in my face and after listening to it for too long I grabbed him by his shirt and told him that he's not my father, and to stop acting like he was. \n\nHe then tried to pull away from me &amp; when I didn't let go, he turned and shoved me. He was stumbling because he was quite drunk so I tried to get him on the ground to stop him from falling and hitting his head on the counter or table or even falling on one of our dogs.\n\nWhen he was on the ground he started clawing at my eyes &amp; ears, trying to gouge them. At this point I realized he's playing for keeps and I've gotta stop the fight to prevent any permanent damage being done to me. So I punched him once in the ribs and once more square in the face. Being drunk, he felt none of it and continued trying to get his fingers in my eyes. With that, I gave him a really nasty headbutt right on his nose. Blood went everywhere instantly, it was pretty disturbing. He decided when he saw all the blood that he had had enough and stopped fighting with me.\n\nHe and I are cool now but my mother is not impressed with either of us. Given that I tried to walk away, deal with it with words &amp; only resorted to actual physical violence when I was at risk of permanent damage, AITA? \n\nTL;DR Got into a fist fight with step dad &amp; beat him up pretty bad, feeling bad about having to do it.\n",

      "description": "I recently visited New York for the first time so as any tourist, I did all the touristy things! One of them was to watch a Broadway Show. I went to go watch Chicago and as those of you who have watched this, the theatre is very small and the top level is very compact so everyone can see the showing.\n\nFor reference, if anyone has been to a hockey or basketball game on the upper deck, you have to kind of LEAN forward to see the game. \n\nAs we all start to get situated, I notice the guy in front of me has a pretty tall top hat. He was kind of dressed up nicely, so I didn't say anything before the show. About 5 minutes before the show, I tapped his shoulder and asked if he could take his hat off. HE GOES OFF. He tells me to never touch him again. How I can't see that his fashion point is the hat. His date? also tells me \"mind your own fucking business and watch the damn show\". This gets me pretty livid.... so I waddled my way to a theatre person and told her the situation. She pretty much says it's his property and he can choose to take it off or not. \n\nSo I go back to my seat and I \"accidently\" knock his hat off with my knee. ( this theatre is TINY and I'm about 6'1\" so it's very easy to do so ). He stands up and throws his program at my face. At this point, the show starts and he's just yelling at me. I just stare straight at the theatre lady while this gyy is challenging me to go outside and face him. Guards take him away and not me because my neighboring seats defend my position. I feel a tad bad cause those tickets are expensive. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Throwaway + mobile, sorry for formatting. This happened like 30 minutes ago and It’s bothering me. \nSo, my family and I are going to a different city today to do a rosary for a family member who passed away a year ago. I was told we were going to leave at 4pm and be there for the entire evening. It’s a 1 hour and 45 minute drive.\nMy mom has a terrible habit of not telling me anything we’re doing. I remember always being upset whenever I was relaxing on a Saturday and i was yelled at for not being ready to go to a birthday party i had no idea we were going to, and one I had no idea even existed. It’s frustrating and I’ve told my mother multiple times to PLEASE tell me about things we’re doing or places we’re going to in advance so I can be prepared. I understand when it’s a last minute plan and it’s like that for everybody, but I get upset when I’m left in the dark and not told about things. My mom does this so often and it’s frustrated me so much that every single day during dinner I always ask what we’re doing this week and if we have any plans. \nSo, I found out almost a month ago that we were gonna go to a different town for this rosary. Alright, good. I got more details as today approached, how we were leaving at 4. Cool. \nThen today comes. I do some chores and I only ate a small bit of yogurt at 10am so i could not be starving but still eat lunch with my family. \nMy dad calls me, he left to go pick up my grandma so she could come with us and was on his way home. He was trying to call my mom but she wasn’t picking up bc her phone was in a different room. So I go to my mom with my phone on speaker. My dad says he’s going to pick up some Panda Express for my grandma, since she hadn’t eaten and asks if we want anything. My mom gets upset and says, “No, we’re about to leave to go eat where we’re going”\nI got really confused. It was 1:30pm. We weren’t leaving until 4. She said we’re leaving as soon as my dad gets home and we’re leaving at 2. \nI got upset. I said she told me we were going at 4. She said she changed her mind and wanted to go earlier to help set up some things. I told her she never told me and she said, ‘Well now I am.’ \nI said I hadn’t eaten a meal all Day and I didn’t want to wait 2 more hours to eat. So my dad hung up and i texted him to bring me some food.  When he came home, he brought me some food too. Cool. \nAs I’m eating, my mom comes in and says to only eat a little because there’s gonna be a lot of food. I tell her I haven’t eaten all day, and I’d have to wait 2 hours to eat a full meal. Not only that, but we were going to be there until very late, so I could eat at around 7 or 8 since there’s gonna be plenty of food. My dad asked if they killed a pig to make, (the family lives in the countryside  and on a farm.) and my mom said yes. This was kinda the final take. I have an allergy to pork that seems to get worse as I get older, and cross contamination with pork can cause a reaction. I said I wasn’t  sure if I was comfortable eating there anymore, since there is most likely to be cross contamination. My mom looked pissed and left to go finish getting ready. \nAITA?",

      "description": "So I’m aware this whole situation is ridiculous and juvenile but nonetheless I want to know if I’m being unreasonable. \n\nI have agoraphobia (basically an anxiety disorder wherein various situations cause me to have panic attacks). One of my biggest triggers is school - especially on mufti days (which is basically a day when we don’t have to wear our uniform + there’s usually a theme of some sort). This particular mufti day was 80s themed &amp; for the graduating class of 2019 only.\n\nUsually, I don’t go to school on mufti days but my attendance is currently at 76-ish% (due to my agoraphobia and depression) which is below what it needs to be in order for me to be able to graduate at the end of the year. So, I decided to push myself and organised an 80s-themed outfit, as did my friends (which I confirmed probably an annoying amount of times, since it was important to me that I wouldn’t be the only one dressed up). \n\nWhat I had intended to do was to come to school in my uniform to make sure that everyone else was dressed first before I got changed, but my friend begged me to come to school wearing my 80s outfit so she wouldn’t be the only one on the train dressed up. I, unfortunately, agreed to this. However, she never showed up to the station. I called her to see what was up (once I was already on the train). She told me that she’d decided to sleep in and was going to come to school late, leaving me alone. I didn’t see anyone else who was in 80s attire (which wasn’t particularly unusual I suppose since only one grade was supposed to be dressed up), had a panic attack and decided to just go home because the thought of going to school and being the only one dressed up absolutely petrified me.\n\nSo, the current situation is that I’m kind of annoyed with her. I feel let down, since she knows my situation and was giving me shit for my attendance just the day before - though, I am aware my attendance, or lack thereof, is my responsibility. I haven’t brought it up with her nor have I, at least to my knowledge, been treating her any differently. Regardless, I think she can tell that I’m annoyed with her. I probably have a look on my face or something. \n\nWhich is why I’m asking you guys if I’m being an asshole. Am I even justified in being annoyed? My agoraphobia/social anxiety isn’t her problem and she doesn’t really understand it either so it’s likely she just didn’t understand how big of a deal dressing up was for me and how distressing I would find the situation she put me in.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Backstory: I have a friend who I’ve been friends with since we were both 11 in 6th grade (14, 8th now) and he is mildly autistic (we still treat him normally, he’s just very shy) Classmates know that we’re really good friends, so it is a big deal. Now that we’re older and he tends to have a bit more... *aggressive* arguments over dumb things with me, I say that’s fine, I argument then let him win because he won’t give up on arguments.\n\nSo today, at our club meeting that is trying to find a strong material for space exploration, he brings up that a website we might be using is a charity, saying that they’re “keeping the money for themselves” and that they “never donate to their causes”. He’s said things like this before where he says something that is complete bullshit that can be contradicted so easily.  Even the 7th graders call him out on it saying that it’s completely untrue and embarrassing that they, the kids younger than him, have better logic than him (they said it, not me)\n\nAlso, he’s kind of a prick sometimes. He lashes out EXTREMELY easy and has attacked people for jokingly taking his pencil case. \n\nSo, AITA to end the friendship with him after all this time?",

      "description": "Long story. \n\nIt was his birthday, I won't specify how old he is, but just assume that were between the ages of 18-23. It was his birthday (Yay!) and me and a couple of the guys we're like \"Yeah, this kid is gonna get super fucking drunk and just fucking hammered.\" We go to a party where we know NOBODY. Anyway, the night goes on.\n\nAt around 1:30, i'm the DD. I'm always the DD. I'm cool with it, it happens to work with my personality, since I like to take care of people. At this point he is considerably drunk. I take him back to my house, let him sleep on the futon I have in my room and assume everything will be normal. \n\n3:45 AM rolls around, and i'm in this half awake/asleep stage where I cant tell reality from dream. I was having a dream of a waterfall, which apparently is never a good thing. I slowly come awake, and I can hear water hitting my carpet. I sit up, and this kid is just fucking sitting in my chair, PEEING. He is peeing his pants, piss running down his leg. I start yelling at him, mostly just in shock. I'll tell you the next part through dialogue.\n\n\"You JUST fucking peed your pants you god-damned stupid fucking moron.\" I was considerably angry.\n\n\"**NO, I didn't**.\" \n\n\"Yes, you did, why are your pants wet, and why is there what looks like a dark water stain on the ground.\"\n\n\"**I don't know dude, I think you have leaky pipes or something**.\" \n\nA reasonable explanation. Also, I didn't put it in here but I was basically just in shock because he peed his pants in my room and I was really upset. \n\n\"Ok, well fuck you. Go back to bed on the futon, and you better have that all cleaned up in the morning.\" I rolled into bed and on my side, facing away from him. \"You're a god damned moron.\"\n\nI recall sitting there and thinking about how shitty of a friend he's been to me lately. I have been really upset, but I figure I should just shut up and appease him and be nice, because I think he is going through a hard time or something right now. Either way, I felt a little bit of pity for him. \n\nIt was when I began to fall asleep that I started to hear.. rustling. I just didn't want to deal with him anymore. I just really wanted to go to sleep, I rolled over to look at what he was doing.. and he was just standing up, not moving. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What are you doing? Sit the fuck down\"\n\n\"**I'm standing.\"**\n\n**\"**Yes you are, and you should sit back down and go to sleep.\"\n\nNo response. \n\nAfter a very awkward couple of moments, he walks over to my bed and flops down on it, face down, with the pee on his pants. I had tried to get his pants off him, but he insisted that it wasn't pee, and that my pipes were leaking. \n\nThat was when I had enough. I know he's drunk, but there isn't a reason why he should be doing this. \n\n\"Nope, nope, nope nope nope nope nope nope nope.\"\n\nI get off the bed and stand over his not-moving body. I know he can hear me. \n\n\"Get off my bed.\"\n\nHe responds by laughing.\n\n\"Get off my bed.\"\n\n\"**Can I just sleep here?\"**\n\n**\"**No, for two reasons. One, that's my bed. Two, there is pee on your pants, get off my bed.\" \n\n\"Get off my bed. Final warning, or i'm gonna move you off.\"\n\nNo response.\n\n\"Ok, I am grabbing you and moving you off.\" \n\nI grabbed him, and moved him off the bed. \n\nHe responded by getting back on the bed. At this point I was just absolutely fucking livid, I was having thoughts of breaking some bones on this fucker. I started yelling, I ripped the sheets out from under him, told him to move his ass to the futon, and that \"I have every right to break to punch your stupid fucking teeth in and you're being a prick, and were gonna have a talk in the morning.\" After that, I guess he gained enough consciousness to respond to hostile threats, and stood up. For ten minutes, we just yelled at each other and told him he was awful and an idiot, etc etc. I went to sleep on the couch, downstairs. I live with my parents (Yeet!) So at around 6'oclock, (In the time between 4 and 6 I hadn't slept.) my father comes in asking why I am sleeping on the couch, and I explained the whole thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMorning time comes, I hadn't slept much, and I come upstairs. I told him he needed to take the sheets to his own washer, and he said he was gonna do them in my washer, and I said no. \n\nHe washed the sheets in his own washer.\n\n We sort of resolved but we haven't talked much, and he still sends me memes, but I dont send him any or go out of my way to communicate with him. We've been friends for about five years,  and I think maybe were just growing apart. He hasn't been nice, considerate, or shown any signs of value of me as a person as of late. Maybe we're both not assholes. This has been bugging me for sometime, and in retrospect there is a lot of things I could have done differently. Maybe we're both assholes. Please give feedback. ",

      "description": "So  I go shopping. I enter the store and there's this long ass shopping  cart supporting escalator from the entrance of the building (and car  park) to the entrance of the store. As I enter I see this family  blocking the entire thing. No problem, I think. Walk up, politely ask  them to make some space. The guy is starting to try and move the cart  but does it in like the most stupid fashion imaginable and by the time  he'd be done, we'd be at the top. So I push myself past them and am on  my merry way.\n\nAs I'm doing my shopping,  some guy walks up to me and just stands there staring at me (I got  earbuds in). I notice he's probably there because of me, take my earbuds  out and ask what's up. He tells me there was a kid in the shopping cart  and it almost fell over when I pushed past. (which I HIGHLY doubt.  There was barely enough space for me to push through so there is no way  this cart could have fallen over as there was not any more space on the  other side).\n\nI  am stunned, as I have absolutely not realized that there was another  kid. There was one standing on the escalator, but I couldn't see what's  in the cart as the people were standing in front of it when I approached  from behind. So any accusation that I... wanted to hurt the kid,  accepted that a kid might get hurt or something similar is just wrong.\n\nWhile  I'm collecting my thoughts the very tactful man makes a remark about  how I am not even going to apologize... so I cut my thinking short, I  apologize to him and tell him I had no intention to put his kid in harms  way. Afterwards I tell him that I wouldn't have had to push past him if  he didn't block the entire escalator. To this he replies basically:\n\n1. You can wait behind me (yea cool, everyone has to adapt to your pace I guess and if you want to stop everyone has to?)\n2. You have a very bad upbringing (excuse me?)\n\nI replug my inears and leave. I cannot take talking to that guy and since I've got nothing nice to say, I decide to shut up.\n\nI  don't think I did anything wrong - after all, if you're going to block a  pathway for everyone else, you gotta expect people to push past you,  no? I still said sorry because even though it was entirely unknowing, I  had no intention of putting a child in harms way and can understand that  parents go into \"I don't care if ITA, that's my child!\"-mode.\n\nI  mean am I wrong to think that what I want is people to be considerate  of each other and what he wants is people to adjust to him? Is my  perception here warped? (this is probably the most important question  here)\n\n3000  characters is the most stingy restriction ever. How do you even write a  short story of what happened with this without leaving every second  detail out?",

      "description": "Background: a young mother was murdered last year in my town (Ohio). The husband was arrested shortly after. Their 3 year old son was given to his closest relatives, the family of the husband.\nThe woman's sister lived in Turkey, and was originally from Isreal. She filed for a Visa to come to the funeral, but was denied. After 7 months, she was allowed a Visa to try and get custody of the nephew, as she feels he should not live with that side of the family. She said she would immigrate to the US, as she wouldn't want to force the child to relocate. The husband's family refuses to let her see the kid, and a legal battle is brewing.\n\nPotential A-holism: A guy on my Facebook, someone whom I've known casually for about 7 years, often posts anti-immigrant, \"the media is the enemy\" things. He posts how the sister from Turkey has changed her FB status to \"living in (our town)\" and that this \"is how illegal immigrants sneak in, and how terrorists get their start.\"\n\nThis post got to me, as someone who works at a newspaper covering the story, so I explained how she was here legally, and how she's seeking residency because she wants to take care of her nephew.\nHe called me a liar, accused me of falling for the media conspiracy (and told someone else to \"do what they can\"to remain vigilant against liars), and said I was being racist for thinking he called her a terrorist \"just because she's Arabic.\" At that point, he revealed he's the brother of the accused murderer, and the child is his nephew.\n\nI apologized for not knowing, but still maintained that he can cry \"illegal immigrant\" all he wants, but \"terrorist\" went too far.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I (f17) have a pretty good relationship with my mother, but it's a problem in the way that it makes it hard for me to be/stay mad at her. \n\nheres some context\n\nI have two older brothers, who are completely hopeless and never help around the house. They're both big gluttons and they almost never clean anything, not even their own rooms. They're typical gamers, and only sit in their rooms all day in front of their computers, and they almost completely shut themselves out of the family and social life in general.\n\nSo naturally, my mom is really fed up with them. \n\nProblem is, she takes her frustration about them out on me. If she's pissy about my brothers, or anything at all (she's a stressed person with a lot on her mind most of the time), she ends up getting mad, and taking it out on me. She doesn't hit or abuse me or anything, but she can get loud or speak to me in a very accusing or unfriendly tone. \n\nIt's especially bad if I'm the reason she's mad. If I'm doing bad in school, or don't help her with chores, or if I go to bed too late, she gets mad at me.\n\nLast night I was up a bit too late, and she got mad at me, and said the reason I dont sleep at night is because I always sit too much with electronics. I've struggeled a lot at school the last years, and have skipped a lot bc of depression, and last night mom said she wouldn't be surprised if I dropped out of school soon. Then she went off to bed.\n\nI got really mad, because in general she is a very caring, supportive and kind mother, and I expected her to have more faith in me than to think I'd drop out bc of insomnia, depression and being shit at school. I'm going to stick out, and get an education even if it kills me to do it, and I thought she of all people, would know that. \n\nAnd then there was this morning. She woke up grumpy, and when I asked her if we had any pizza leftovers in the fridge (a very simple question, with no bad intent behind it), she said \"Of course not, if anything like that lays visible in the fridge it doesnt last long\", obviously referring to my gluttonous brothers. And she said it with this tone in her voice, like it was somehow my fault. So I got mad at her again. \n\nNow, I'm a **really** oversensitive person, and will start crying easily. So today was about to cry, which is the reason I often let it go before even confronting mom if I'm mad at her. I don't want to start crying, and my mom is the last person I want to be mad at, because when I'm upset, she's the one comforting me. But I WAS mad at her, and this time I didn't want to let it go, if things are going to get better, I'll have to confront her if I'm upset about the things she says to me. \n\nSo I left for school without saying goodbye, which she noticed, and realized I was mad about something. So on the way to the bus, she sent me a message saying she hoped I would have a good day.\n\nEvery time I'm sad or upset, even if its because of her, mom always makes an effort to cheer me up, and she has been a really great help with all of my problems (like depression, diffculties in school, etc) I just feel like a dick to get mad at her. She really is a great mother, it's just when my brothers shuts themselves in their rooms, her complaining comes to me, especially since I have many of the same bad habits as them (just not in the same amount). \n\nSo am I an asshole for being mad at her?

They're playing a festival and I don't like any of the bands that also play either since they're pretty much that kind of new indie pop that's popular nowadays and I'm more of a metal/rock/emo kind of guy (Sorry to any indieheads that read this!). So I don't want to go. Really. I don't. I may go to the city the concert is at with her, but I doubt I'll go to the show. Still feel like an asshole for telling her no.\n\nShe said it's okay by text but I don't know if she means it in the \"Nah don't worry babe, it's all right\" way, or the \"I'll say it's okay even through I'm actually really angry at you\" way. \n\nI'm going to tell her I will go to the city with her, but I doubt I can make it to the concert. Which is the truth. I love the city, I just don't want to go to a concert of a band I absolutely hate.",

My brother seemed happy, although a bit too wasted for a child’s bday party, but hey the entire house was singing the smiths at the top of their lungs when i left so he it wasn’t like he didn’t have company.   \n     Today i get a phone call from my mother (that’s his roommate) saying he was talking about killing him self the previous night. I told my mom that he was a “big boy” and he could take care of himself. She told me i was being insensitive and i should “talk to him”\n     AITA for feeling like that’s not my responsibility?  I know she wants me to talk to him because i suffer from depression and anxiety, and that’s annoying cause that doesn’t make me the goddess of mental illness. I feel like she’s putting it on me to fix his “problem” when he should go to the hospital if he’s serious (or she should call 911, she is his roommate for fucks sake). I mean i obviously care but this is waaay out of my lane, am i wrong?\n\nMy brother is single \nMy brother has 1 friend \nHe’s 34 years old (I’m 27)\nHe is employed\nI fear my mother may be his best friend (yikes)\n\n",

      "description": "Using a throwaway of course. I'll try to retell the story as accurately as possible and let me know if you think that there's a part I'm leaving out and I'll let you know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it kind of started because we all played a game together. I was playing with someone, we'll call Joe, who I've been friends with for a long time. After playing this game for a while, I asked if he wanted to play another game something like League of Legends or so. He accepts so of course I start getting on but my discord starts getting buggy. That's pretty much the only platform I kind of use to communicate with my friends because snapchat or facebook. Anyway, I was trying to make discord work again while my League loaded up and when my League loaded up, I realized that he was a full queue with another group. That's fine and all but I was pretty much upset about this since I asked him first to play with me. I mean, it's common courteousy right? Or am I expecting too much? I asked another member of the group, since I know them, if it was full and they told me it was full. I didn't care much really because I mean, if he wanted to have fun then fine by me I guess. I didn't really mind being left out because I didn't want to ruin his fun. I was still sitting in the League cilent when they went into queue and played a game. My other friend, Bob let's call him, told me to play some other game with them so yeah, I got off League cause I wasn't planning to play anyway. Fast forward a few hours and then Bob told me to get on League so we could play. Why not, right? So I get on. When I get on, I get an instant invitation from the other group of friends. I was confused but I guess they were out of the game. However, I was curious why they weren't a penta queue anymore and I was confused who was in the party so I went to check their match history. Turns out that the previous games they played was a quadra queue. There was room for me but no one told me. They had me on discord and snapchat so I mean, I would have expected them to tell me something. Something to note is that during this time, they didn't send a single message to me so of course, I'm upset. They should have let me know that they had space. They should have let me know that especially since I asked Joe first to play but he decided to play with another group of friends without bothering to tell me. All this time, I thought it was full which is why I didn't ask so of course I'm upset. I message him telling him that I don't want to make him feel bad but that simply wasn't cool to do. I was expecting some sort of sorry or some sort of \"it's my mistake\" but what Joe told me was that he didn't think he was wrong because he assumed that since I went offline on Discord, he assumed I wasn't playing. What I'm stuck at is why didn't he let me know he was going to play with them or even just message me through the league cilent? It was a really harsh debate and it was tough but we made up later along the day. While it's over, there's still a longing for me to know like, was I wrong for getting mad because I was expecting him to wait for me? I didn't want to bottle up my feelings this time. The debate itself was pretty much both of us getting very upset at each other and we both said our fair share of terrible things so yeah I'll admit I was an ahole for that. I try to be nice most of the time but sometimes, it's just really hard to keep everything bottled in which is why I confronted him about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been told that no one is an ahole because he was just enjoying himself and in the heat of the moment, of course you're just gonna play some games together. Sometimes you forget what people asked because there's a lot of people in the call and everyone is getting \"hyped up.\" I know for a fact that what he did was not intentional and nothing personal. He's not a bad person and he's very understanding but I guess in the heat of the moment, I basically got extremely upset. I really like him as a person and I really enjoy his company. We been friends for like several several years so it's not like he's a stranger. But just because he forgot, according to the person, doesn't mean that they were wrong. They were just enjoying themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOthers have said that we were both the aholes since it kind of escalated to the point that it was during a call I had. Basically, other people were there and we were sitting there arguing at each other. And when I say that it was heated, I kind of mean yeah it was prettyyyy heated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been told it's his fault cause he should have at least let me know and not ditch me like how he did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd some say it's my fault cause I was trying to force him to do something. I know that I shouldn't force people to do things. I don't like forcing people to change the way they are for me or play games with me. It only hurt because they didn't let me know anything about what was going on. If I knew he wanted to play with them, that would be fine cause why not but since I didn't obtain anything, I get really angry. I think this is one of the few times I've been actually very angry which scares me. I'm not a type of person to do that and I'm ashamed of getting mad but I want to know if I was the ahole for getting extremely mad or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe majority of the time, I would say 99%, we're a very relaxing group to be around so there's not a lot of arguments. I think I broke the silence because I felt like I was lied to but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overreacting which I was told that I was. I didn't want to start a problem but since it's here, I want to hear your thoughts and maybe get a better understanding as a whole about the situation instead of my own bias thought about it.

My friend suffers low confidence but not the type where people seem to want to help her anymore, instead she’s become very biter over the last year and can’t seem to be happy for anybody. She always has something unpleasant to say recently it seems.\n\nI write songs as part of what I do and I thought as something nice to do I would offer her to work on a track with me sometime. She loves singing. Her voice really isn’t great but there is always auto tune. \n\nSo last year I wrote a track and played it to her asking if she’d like to sing on it. I wouldn’t say she looked down her nose at it, but she didn’t bother to bring the topic up again. Fast forward to this week and I’ve found a wonderful singer of the opposite sex to do vocals. He sounds absolutely amazing and has transformed what I’ve done. I’m going to be releasing it soon.\n\nThe problem is that my friend is now being off with me because it was supposed to be her song to sing. \n\nShe has piggybacked off me so much over the last year and tried putting me down in so many ways, this feels like the last straw. I’ll just add that this is a 40 year old grown woman behaving like this. There is no support for my work or even any nice words to say, it just seems to be about her again.\n\nI’m ready to walk away from her. I’m finding her behaviour very toxic. However, I’m posting here because maybe there’s something I’m missing and I’m being unreasonable? I’m too irritated to think objectively right now. ",

Now, i loved this game, but could never play it with anyone, so it sat mostly unused. Until today, when my grandmother and mom decided to play it with me. So, we sit down, set it up, and i explain the rules. We then play for about 10 minutes before my mom and grandmother decide to change the rules. Whoever can control all on one country first wins. Now, if you know risk then you know that that is utter bullshit, as with that rule you could win the game from litterally your first turn, or in this case(since were 10 minutes in) the next turn. So guess what happens? My mom wins and the game is over. So of course i am angry(though the most of this i show is maybe a dissapointed face). The one time i actually want to be social and its shut down in 10 minutes, and i suspect that they changed the rule just so they can quit playing and hopefully have me leave them alone. I know this is kinda petty but i still got angry over it and i want to know if my anger is justified or not. Its to the point where i wish they just would have said no or i didnt ask in the first place. So, random people of reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "Background: the two of us live pretty frugally. This is partly because of our current financial situation and partly because we're both naturally frugal people. At the beginning of our relationship we mutually decided not to exchange presents with each other at Christmas time. We also generally don't do birthday gifts. \n\nMy husband's birthday was two months ago. I asked him what he wanted, and he told me nothing. I asked a few more times in the weeks leading up to his birthday and he still said nothing. This didn't seem out of character to me at all; consequently I got him nothing. I mean, I made him a card that the kids and I signed, but that was it. \n\nToday is my birthday. I assured my husband several times over the past few weeks that I didn't want or need anything. This morning I noticed that he had left a card for me on my dresser before he left for work. When I opened it I realized there was also a gift card inside to a store I like but rarely visit.\n\nI know it was really sweet of him and I'm trying to focus on feeling grateful, but I'm also fairly annoyed that now I have no idea if our whole \"no gifts\" agreement even means anything any more. Is this a sign that he actually wanted a birthday present even though he said no? Do I need to lie and say I'm not getting him a Christmas present but then secretly get him one now? \n\nTl;dr -- I did not get husband a birthday present 2 months ago after he asked me not to. But husband just got me a birthday present today after I asked him not to. WIBTA if I share my annoyance with him when he gets home tonight? ",

      "description": "My husband is usually an EXCELLENT gift giver. Since we have insane work schedules and don’t get to see each other much, he had me open my Xmas gift tonight. I unwrap the package and I see it’s an UGG box. I ask ‘is this what it really is?’ and he says yes. I’m not anti-UGGS. I have a pair a friend gave to me years ago. They’re comfortable. They’re total Becky boots but comfy as hell. I continue to open the box and when I pop that lid and peel back the paper - I see seafoam green. Seafoam green boots. I am a nearly 40 year old woman that dresses like an aging goth kid, or more accurately, Daria as an adult. Seafoam green is a delightful color, but not my jam NOR my jelly when it comes to clothing or footwear. I pick them up and say ‘wow. these are... different. not a color I’d have chosen for myself’. He knows the jig is up. He says ‘you don’t like them’ and I tell him it’s not that I don’t like them, they just aren’t my style and I can’t picture what I’d wear them with. He then tells me that a friend of ours helped him pick them out. They both thought they were totally me and since he wanted to surprise me with something I’d never get for myself he thought they’d be perfect. He assured me they can be returned and I felt just awful but I had to agree, they just aren’t my style but I really appreciate the thought. I end up talking to the friend that ‘helped’ pick them out later in the evening and she tells me she was actually looking at them for herself and sent them to a family member so she hoped she didn’t get them because it might be triggering for my husband since I didn’t like them. \n\nSOOOOOO - am I the asshole for being honest that I didn’t like the boots? I feel like I was respectful in saying thanks but no thanks but I can’t help but feeling shitty. \n\nAlso - should I tell my friend not to send my husband things she’d buy for herself if he asks for help in buying me gifts in the future? \n\nTHANKS!",

      "description": "I recently broke up with my first and only girlfriend, we'd been together since we were 16. Never had tried dating or online dating for this reason but I figured I might give it a try. So I made a Tinder with some pics of me. One of them was a bit of a candid shot of me shirtless holding my Maine Coon kitten, that was last year May I think so about a year ago. \n\nBack then I was crazy lean, I had dieted down for summer for a long time and was probably around 8% bodyfat. I was super cut, abs, Adonis belt, everything. However at that point I was also quite light and relatively weak, I wasn't really satisfied with how strong I was. Also being that lean was really hard, I often felt tired and my diet was super strict.\n\nWhich is why I decided to bulk up until recently. I gained a lot of strength put I'm also nowhere near as cut anymore. I'm probably 16% bodyfat or so, which isn't fat by any means and actually less than the average man has but it's not lean in any case. However I want to get lean again soon so I'm getting that physique back and I'll even look a lot better with the added mass.\n\nI matched with a girl and we talked for a while. We seemed to get along well enough so I set up a date, just to have drinks. However when we met up she didn't seem as enthusiastic as previously. After some time she told me she thought I looked different in the pictures and actually pulled that one up after I asked her what she meant. I explained to her how I had been getting stronger and a bit thicker but that I would work on losing the fat again and I'd look better than in that picture.\n\nHowever she kept pestering me about it and how long it would take for me to get back to that which I found a bit frustrating. Personally I'd prefer a woman who loves me at my bulkiest as much as she loves me at my shreddiest. So there wasn't a second date since I broke off contact.\n\nAITA for using that pic? It's not super old and the only difference is that I have bit more fat mass now. ",

      "description": "October 2018: I move in with my friends E, D and V in a student appartement where they lived for a few years. I also had sublet a room there for 8 months two years prior. As the previous guy leaves, I take over the internet subscription and the guy from the company comes install a new modem box.\n\nJanuary 2019: D and V are a couple and give their end of tenancy notice to the landlord. Turns out there is some sort of loophole and the landlord finds a way to evict us all for April 1st.\n\nThursday March 28th: I let E know that I've cleared all my belongings and she can do whatever she wants with what's left in the appartement (i.e. lots of legacy stuff from people who lived there before).\n\nFriday March 29th: I store my stuff at the next place I'll stay and leave for good as I go away for a sport event over the weekend. I tell E she can use my vacuum cleaner. She just has to hold on to it after. I also leave the modem box behind so E can have wifi for the last few days. However, I don't mention any instructions about holding on to it.  \n\nSunday March 31st: With a lot of stuff to handle, E's mom come help clearing out the place. Eventually one of them throw away the modem box. (I was reachable by standard means of communication)\n\nApril 2nd: I'm back in town and ask about the modem box as there is a 200 $CAD unreturning fee.  I ask her to pay and blame her as I claim it's common sense to not throw away a functioning, practically new, most likely rented piece of expensive electronics. ",

      "description": "Ok so a bit of backstory, I'm a 14 year old girl with few irl friends and leading up to this point, I'd been manipulated by this \"friend\" that I'll call K. I never had the courage to stand up to this girl or tell her off because I was scared to.\n\nIn this roleplay server we used to have, she would constantly be causing drama to get attention. K broke many, many rules in the process. At this point, nobody really wanted to confront her since we all found it pointless. Plus, most of us were nice people, and no matter how rude K was, we thought we'd be just as rude by unfriending her \n\nThe final straw was when she used two of her characters to hospitalize and traumatize two of mine\n\n\"But they're fictional characters\"\n\nYeah I know that but it isn't the point here. She had pulled that shit way too many times and frankly I wasn't having any of it.\n\nSo I left the server and blocked her.\n\nI had been working on a drawing for a long time and I posted what I had in the art section of that server. I realized I had forgotten it and didn't have it on my current device so I was invited back to the server to briefly to get it... That's when shit really happens. (introducing new character M)\n\n(insert name) has joined the server\n\nM: No. Hell no. Leave. Right fucking now.\n\nMe: I'm not here for long I just need to grab something\nM: that doesn't fucking matter. You had your chance.\n\nK: exactly\n\nM: no. No, no, no, no, no. NO. FUCK NO. You had your fucking chance but you got all bitchy and childish over nothing and left. Nobody fucking wants you here. Your a little bitch who gets butthurt over every little thing and whenever shit doesn't go your way. \n\nMe: I just need to grab a picture real quick and I'll leave.\n\nK: nobody fucking cares. Have somebody else get the picture for you. Just don't come back.\n\nM: where's the bitch-begone spray I need like five bottles\n\n(K proceeds to laugh and support M)\n\nK: who invited you back in the first fucking place? Just get out of here.\n\nM: you need to grow up and learn how to deal with it.\n\nI left the server afterwards without ever retrieving my picture. A friend screenshotted the conversations and apparently they told the server owner, a good friend of mine, to not let me back and to block me.\n\nBtw M is in her early 20's so these two adults antagonizing a 14 year old\n\nAnd from what i could tell, nobody else there did anything. They didn't want to stick up for me or tell K &amp; M off because they didn't want to start any more drama. They did all DM me though afterwards to try and calm me down \n\nI'll admit that I didn't try to resolve things before leaving. My main reason was because my attempts to talk things out in the past just made stuff worse. I felt horrible about it though.\n\nMy real friends all told me that I did the right thing but did I? Maybe I should have stayed longer and tried once more to talk?\n\nI'm sure I'm not in the wrong but I want your opinions.",

      "description": "Last weekend me and my now ex were hanging out. He had been with a female friend of his who is Rich and pays him to do side work for her all week. As such, he told her that he was going to be busy all weekend because he was hanging out with me and he was going to be unavailable. Everything was fine until Sunday night when she decided to show up at his house without warning and stick around for 3 hours.\n\nUnfortunately her husband is abusive and she was just trying to get away from him but I still think that she overstepped her bounds by coming around without warning especially when he told her that he was going to be unavailable. I'm sure she had other friends that she could have gone to. The thing that bothered me the most was that she was asking him to stay at his house for a few days to get away from her husband and did so right in front of me.\n\nHe is still living at home while waiting for his disability payments to kick in but I still feel that it was inappropriate for her to ask him something like that knowing he's with me. After she left, she texted him saying can we please move in together because I can't live with my husband anymore? I was super pissed about it because again that's inappropriate.\n\nApparently she also asked him what he sees in me and he claims that she didn't say it in the way that I think but I still think it's super rude and inappropriate. It's none of her business. Apparently he told her it's because I'm the only woman who's ever cared about him and that I keep him grounded and keep him from doing stupid stuff that would land him in jail or worse. Again though it is highly inappropriate and rude for her to ask something like that.\n\nI highly suspect that they have something going on between them because why would she be asking those kinds of questions and be asking to stay with him otherwise? When I was angry about her showing up with no warning and asked him about it he got super defensive and literally told me to fuck off if I didn't like it and told me that I was not going to treat him that way. I don't feel like I treated him any kind of way because I feel like he should have set boundaries with her.\n\nAm I the asshole for being mad about her showing up unannounced when we were supposed to be hanging out? And am I in the wrong for being mad about her behavior towards him and accusing him of having something going on with her? I don't have concrete proof as they say trust your gut. I just want to know if I'm wrong in this situation? Like should I have not jumped to conclusions or am I right to be upset?",

      "description": "Im a Sophomore in college and I met a really nice girl the first week of school and started hooking up with her and took her virginity. Nothing formal just a FWB type situation. We had casual sex for about 5 months (i know its a ridiculously long time for not being in a relationship.) We both talked to other people during this time period but neither one of us hooked up with anyone else (she went on dates though). So a couple weeks ago she told me that she didnt want to keep hooking up because she was in love with me and knew I didnt feel the same way so we decided to stop hooking up but remain friends. This was surprising news to me because I didnt know she caught feelings. A week after this happened I went to a nearby frat party and she happened to be there. She sat with me we had a couple drinks and she initiated physical contact and started making out with me. One thing lead to another and she told me to come back to her place so we went and hooked up again. Now her roommate and her friends thinks Im an asshole for hooking up with her and accused me of leading her on. Am I really the asshole in this situation or are we responsible for what happened?",

      "description": "I (25F) am unemployed. I quit my last job and I'm working tirelessly to get a job. I live with my BF (32M) who works FT in retail. When not at work, he's on his computer. Because I'm home all day, I agreed to take on more chores. But we both agreed that cleaning shouldn't be my full responsibility.\n\nA few years ago, the roles were reversed and he was the unemployed one, at home playing video games. I was working two jobs to make ends meet for us. He didn't help too much with chores then either (because we had a third roommate who loved cleaning).\n\nHere's how it goes: I'll mention about wanting us to get some cleaning done tomorrow and he agrees. The next day comes and we wake up, chill out for a couple hours, and then I slowly start making my way to cleaning. He'll still be sitting at his comp. I'll mention something in passing like, \"do you mind doing the dishes\" or \"could you take care of your pile of clean clothes in the bedroom\" or \"do you mind changing the water in your fish tank\" (because I'm so small so I really struggle picking up the buckets of water that high and stuff AND ITS HIS TANK -- fish keep dying because he won't take care of it) and he just goes BANANAS! \n\n\"*Sigh* okay yeah fine but *I work all day* I really just wish you did this stuff while I'm at work\"\n\nWhat I do for chores:\n- our laundry \n- clean the bathroom\n- vacuum\n- clean 2 other fish tanks\n- take care of our bird\n- dust\n- de-clutter\n\nWhat he does for chores:\n- water changes on the large tank\n- he mopped the kitchen last week\n\nWe agree to swap dishes duty every-other time. But when it's his turn, he'll let the sink pile with dishes on both sides for days until it smells and we have no dishes. And even then, he's asked me in the past, \"what do I need to do to make you take my turn haha\" or sometimes he'll do only half of them at a time, let it pile up again, and the cycle continues for a couple weeks. And sometimes he leaves the ickiest ones on the bottom and say he \"can't deal with the smell\" and asks me to finish them. \n\nAfter he's done moaning and groaning through a chore or two, he sits back in front of his comp and vapes while I'm still running around trying to clean the place. If I ask him to do another thing it's a big *sigh* as he gets up to go do it and says again \"I work all week and my back/shoulder hurts.\" \n\nWhile cleaning last week, my boyfriend told me at least twice \"you don't need to make it that clean in here jeez\" My blood boils just thinking about it. What the fuck is wrong with a house that's clean? Our apartment itself is already a dumpy place. I also have MDD and the clutter makes me feel 10x worse. I just wish he would help more and not make me feel like a grade A piece of shit when I ask him to scrub the toilet.\n\nAITA for being upset with my BF because he won't pitch in without being mean about it? I don't want him to start falling into a groove of me picking up after him for the rest of our life together. I'd love to know everyones POV.",

      "description": "I'm a HS senior taking Japanese 4. My teacher likes group projects, and this time he assigned the groups himself because he wanted us to learn how to work with others we may not like. However, my group has not been cooperating with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis project is supposed to be a 5 minute film. It's composed of me and 2 sophomores: S &amp; K. I was the one who reached out to them first, got their numbers, started a groupchat, and asked them on Tuesday when a good time to work would be. We have Friday/the weekend off and I was planning to work then because I'm very busy with other classes next week. S asks the groupchat if we can start planning this Monday, which gives us only 2 days to film and edit the video if we did just the whole script that day. She also doesn't want to meet after school and asks if we can do it during the 30 minute study hall we have each day. She wants to film in a single classroom, but explaining the project is a long story, so I'll just say that filming in a classroom wouldn't work well because we're supposed to be giving a \"tour\" of several rooms. K seems ok with meeting outside of school, but he also doesn't seem to care what happens either way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth of them stopped responding after we exchanged like 5 text messages on Tuesday, and today I texted them again asking if they were free on Friday/the weekend. S asks again if we can wait until Monday, and I told her that it wouldn't be enough time but we could start the script this weekend and film then. K agrees and says we can plan the script this weekend. S proceeds to ask if we can do it over facetime. I don't have an iPhone. She asks if I have Skype, but I have no webcam. I sense that S doesn't really want to get out of the house, so I ask her if she's busy this weekend. She tells me she has sports practice on Friday and a race on Saturday. Then K comes in and says he's going with his family to Niagara Falls the entire weekend. I asked them if I can make a google doc for the script and share it with them so we can all work on it while being apart. They said that's fine, but I doubt the script would be coordinated since none of us are talking to each other and expressing ideas while writing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI explained the situation to my parents and they're pretty livid, suggesting I email my teacher and do the project on my own, leaving S and K in their own group. I told them I would wait until Sunday morning and see if anybody has contributed to the script besides me, and if they haven't then I would send an email. My parents, however, want me to do it asap so that I'm not limited on time. They told me that I shouldn't be getting an F because of my group and even if my groupmates were pissed off at me, they'd be on my side. However, S and K said they'd work on it and I feel that I should give them a chance before I go off on them for being incompetent. So, if I bail on them now and solo the project, WIBTA?",

However, he really wants to play Mario Kart with me and I'm conflicted on whether me saying no makes me a jerk or not. \n\nMy brother and I have a really good relationship, we're essentially best friends.\n\nI love playing video games with him, and I enjoy watching him play single player games.\n\nWe've played a lot of Mario Kart in the past, and the problem is that he tends to be a sore loser. He gets very angry, tends to shout, cry, and sometimes acts violent (slams fists down onto the floor, etc. he's never hit me or anything).\n\nWe can't play monopoly anymore because of this kind of attitude towards losing, he takes games very seriously and it sucks the fun out for me and makes me very stressed and anxious.\n\nit's really hard for my to understand how upset he gets over losing a game and I'm worried I'm gonna say the wrong thing and he'll get even angrier, which is another reason I'm reluctant to play with him. \n\nHe keeps saying that he'll change so that I play Mario Kart with him but he never does, and I've brought it up with him several times to explain why I don't feel comfortable playing Mario Kart. I offer alternatives, usually cooperative games where no one can really lose because you're on the same team.\n\nI understand that you can play a team mode on Mario Kart but the issue is even if we're on the same team if I get in first place he throws a fit.\n\nHe's not happy with my reluctance to play Mario Kart with him and I feel bad because I enjoy spending time with him but I *really* hate playing Mario Kart with him because there's zero enjoyment in it.\n\nI realize I could purposely do bad so that he'd win, and I guess I'm a stubborn jerk for admiring this, but I don't like purposely losing. It feels unfair to the other person.\n\nApologies for how long this is, it's just been eating at me because I feel really conflicted. He *really* wants to play Mario Kart with me, and I feel terrible turning him down.\n\nI want him to be happy but I also want to be happy. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Okay, this might be a bit long so fasten your seatbelts.\n\nI am a 20 yr old guy who is starting university this year. This is about an incident that happened approximately a month ago during work. I'm going to go to a university 400KM away and will not return for a while and wanted to get this mess out of my head. I apologize in advance for bad grammar, ranting, and lack or too much of info.\n\nI before being selected to university started an internship at a reputable bank in my country, and the branch I was assigned just happened to be the second busiest one in the region and therefore despite interns usually being allowed to do only the simplest of tasks me and the other interns were provided the necessary authorizations to do most things a normal employee was able to do.\n\nI worked there for 9 hours on all weekdays and it was usually very late when I got home even more so because our branch operated for two extra hours compared to other branches. We were paid approximately 2.5$ a day as opposed to 250$ of a BT (Bank Trainee). The work environment was excellent. There were no harassment and the playful joke or two never went beyond acceptable.\n\nAfter 3 months of work, I was pretty much aware of how things worked and on a particularly busy day all our JEA (Junior executive assistants) of whom there were usually 2 had to leave early and I was the only one manning the counter. (Not the cash counter, we were at the service counter.) I was a bit restless because I had plans for that night and to not be late I wanted to catch the bus that left at 7.15 pm. So I was ready to run like the wind as soon as the bank closed at 7.00pm.\n\nThen at the last moment comes a man wanting a new ATM card. I pretty much rushed through it and in the hurry I forgot to take his ID with me when I took it to the officer in charge. He then proceeded to give me a lecture using not so nice word but nothing I haven't heard before.\n\nOn a side note, the officer was a by the books prick. While I can understand there is a standard that is to be maintained in a bank when we write 'Sign OK' nobody needs to check it and in cases of emergencies if the signature and the photograph match we *can* provide certain services without the ID... EXCEPT with this office officer (I'll call him Mr.A for ease.)\n\nAnyway, I was late and I went back got the ID and returned to another lecture in which he wasted further five minutes repeating the same thing I  was pretty restless by now. Anyway, after I return The same customer says that he wants to apply for E-Banking and he wants it done now, with nothing to do I continue to do that and I was pretty much disappointed as I will be pretty much late if I had to do that, but well responsibility is responsibility so I get on with that.\n\nAnother thing I forgot to tell is my family is from a different region of the country and there are subtle differences in speech that I consciously suppress but sometimes slips out. One of them is that from where I am from we ask someone \"can't you do .... ?\" instead of \"can you do .....? \" to imply respect.\n\nSo I again go to my officer armed with all necessary documents signatures and in my hurry, the words slip out of my mouth \"Can't you please approve .... ?\"\n\nMr. A at that is f\\*\\*\\*ing pissed and tears me a new one saying to show him respect and he worked on the bank from when before I was born and the whole bank is looking at me. He gave me no chance to explain and sent me away telling me to find someone else to do it for me. I had to go to the manager and in the end, I was thirty minutes late to some personal business which is whole another can of worms that will not be opened today.\n\nI mean I was and am pretty pissed at this but that weekend me and a bunch of friends from school met and I told them about it. They made me realize why he might have been mad (I actually didn't think from his shoes up to then) And from the next day I was extra polite to Mr. A, but f\\*\\*\\* if he didn't spit in my face at terminal velocity.\n\nNo reply to \"Good Morning\", No \"You are welcome\" to Thankyous and no looking at the face. And believe me, I kissed his ass for all it's worth but nope, It was as if I was some kind of machine that existed to go through the motions.\n\nI mean, I was okay with it, we can do the mutually ignoring thing if that is to your liking and he *was* a very senior office after all. And if I did file a complaint what am I going to say \"this guy is ignoring me\"?\n\nAnyway, life goes on and mutual ignoring continues until finally one day I ask him to sign my attendance sheet (Inters as they only stayed for a very short amount of time marked their attendance on sheets and at the end of the month e-mailed it to compensation and benefits.)And he tells me to find someone else to sign it while it's clear that all the other '*someone else*'s are busy. And believes me I was as angry as I had ever been at the bank. Ignoring me is one thing but refusing what I am entitled is quite another.\n\nThis was around the time I got my letter of enrollment. I pretty much lied and said I had to resign within two days and today I did.\n\nAnd after all that I still feel angry and sad. Do I need to 'man up'?\n\nAITA for all things above I had done? For resigning? For not clearing the air? For not being a bigger person?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hey Reddit\n\nSo some background. My girlfriend loves playing soccer. She’s played both club and high school every time it comes in season. She is great at it and I couldn’t be happier that she has something to play that makes her happy. Because of this love for soccer, this is how she met her now ex boyfriend (he is a manager). They dated on and off for 5 years and finally she ended it for good. Now we’re dating and she is still playing soccer. But before we started talking, she still liked him and did things to hurt me. I lost all trust in her and we ended up not dating then. But eventually she dropped him completely and I eventually started to talk to her again. Long story short is, she’s done things that make me not trust her the most.\n\n(I’m sorry if this is all hard to follow, it starts below)\n\nThe problem that I am dealing with is that she is playing soccer and he is a manager. Before she even started soccer I was worried about it and I told her I was. She told me I had nothing to worry about but I still am. The reason I am still worried that she is playing soccer and interacting with him on a daily basis. Let me reiterate, I don’t mind that she plays soccer, I don’t like how she sees him daily. I told her how I feel about her interacting with him on a daily basis but not once did I say you can’t play soccer because of him. She knows my opinion and I try not to tell her how I feel unless she asks. I just support her and I’m glad she’s playing soccer but I’m not happy about the interaction. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

Usually i have my own friends where i live and just meet her whenever i visit my parents place on the weekends. \n\nI got out of touch with most of my friends in the same area that my female friend lives, since i moved to a bigger city and have my friends there and most of my old local friends around my parents place don't share the same interests/have obligations or no time.\n\nSo recently i had to move back close to my parents location and started to spend time with the girl i've known for so long.\n\nShe introduced me to her group of female friends and we spent a lot of time together with the group. I immediately clicked with the group and they liked me and last weekend i bumped into them while drinking in the city. During the same time my friend wasn't that happy that they decided to join me on my \"bar tour\" instead of hanging out with her at the same place (We always spent time at the same place every weekend, because my friend likes the place and we all go there because she wants it). During our bar tour we realized we had some common interests, so we booked an activity together without my friend. (She doesn't like hiphop-shows) Now she's pissed at me, because i spent time with her friends instead of going \"through her\" to meet up with them. \n\nI'm really glad that she introduced me to them and i owe her this. I don't have a lot of friends around this area. Am i the asshole now for spending time with her friends without her? She's sometimes a bit difficult, but a nice person in general. ",

      "description": "My wife is someone who like to think she's very observant. She will leave a hangout with friends and say something like \"I think Ellen is going to leave John. She ...\" and then give an example of something Ellen did to give her the idea. It's not always based on reason, but sometimes on what she calls her \"intuition.\" So obviously sometimes she's wrong. She never remembers these times, only the ones where she got something right. \n\nI usually just listen and smile and nod and let her have her theories and superstitions. It's usually harmless. She keeps a little notebook of them and says some day she might write a mystery novel or something, which makes it worth it to humor her. \n\nWe live in a pretty nice building, but it's a little older so there are some quirks. About a week ago, she told me that while she was in the elevator, she got a weird feeling and that the \"lights flickered\" or something like that. She said she thinks it's a good idea if we avoided using the elevator and let the super know. I said \"Ok dear\" basically and went about my day.\n\nWell turns out she was right this time. How do I know? On my way up with the groceries from the garage, I got in the elevator... and got stuck. Someone had gotten in between our floor and the garage and we both got stuck in there right after the doors closed. We were stuck in there for about an hour. \n\nWhen I told my wife, she asked me why I went in the elevator after she warned me. I told her that I wasn't going to make myself walk up 3 flights of stairs with groceries if I didn't have to, and that after we told the super he didn't see fit to change the elevator to out of order. I told her I wasn't going to put my life on hold because if a \"feeling\" she had that something \"might\" happen. \n\nShe got hurt by this and has been laying low for the past few days. I saw that she was talking about it with her friend on twitter and just had to toll my eyes because she paints me as some big villain. \n\nI don't think I'm some big villain or that it's wrong of me to base my life around facts and things I can prove.

      "description": "Sorry in advance if this is kinda a long back story.\n\nMe and my current best friend and roommate met roughly 6 years ago at our first job(restaurant). Not too long after that she got promoted from a cashier, like me, to a supervisor position. At first it was a really nice gig having my friend be my “boss” simply because of favoritism. However that quickly turned around. As a few months went on she eventually became a manager and I began to notice a difference in how she had to treat me. I wasn’t just her friend but her employee and she didn’t want to get into trouble which I understood. Eventually I got another job at a small bakery in a grocery store and she moved to a different restaurant location with the same management position. After a few years of having to work at both places without having her there of course, I found it hard to get any sort of promotion, raise or recommendation from other management. Both places I was always seen as a good worker but never good enough for any type of higher up job. \n\nTowards the end of my time at the bakery I was being slowly cut hours and my boss was especially terrible to me which I still believe today was simply because I was young (I was the youngest out of a majority of older women) and school started taking up most of my time. I was struggling to pay rent and needed money badly and my friend had told me they needed help at the new restaurant where she helped manage. I saw it as a opportunity to make the money I desperately needed and applied. Again it was great at first but then not too long after she quit to focus on finishing her education. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to finally try and get that job promotion I always wanted! But to no surprise to me I didn’t get it...  I met my current SO at the restaurant where he was also a supervisor. He later quit to get a better job and I was turned down for both positions. \n\nAll of that happened within the past couple years and now I’m noticing it again. She ended up graduating and receiving a bachelor degree in hospitality. So she needed a job and so did I. It was my idea to go and apply at the hotel where me and her currently work. I wasn’t too fond of the whole idea from the beginning and I should have trusted my gut. It’s now been half a year we’ve both worked there. It’s a small hotel with only 100 rooms. There is also a small restaurant that’s part of the hotel. We both applied for the front desk job because it paid the most. She ended up getting the job while I was offered the job in the restaurant until another spot opened up at the front desk. So I took it because again I needed money for rent and school. At first it was nice because I was making not too bad money. Then my general manager’s true colors began to show. He gave me a bad impression from the start and I could tell he was not a fan of me and I wasn’t of him. He’s one of those solid tall guys with a beer gut who talks with a condescending tone to everyone he speaks to. Especially women. I asked for a couple months to switch job positions when I knew they needed help at the front desk. I was finally able to switch over to the job. However his office was connected to the back office where the front desk was so I had to work with him right there with me for 8 hours a day. I knew I was a great worker and guests would often tell me that I was too and let him know personally. He didn’t see it that way. He began to cut my hours and I ended up moving into the housekeeping department to keep my income steady. I didn’t mind it because I’d rather have less pay than deal with his terrible ass. Shit you not he told me in his office once “even if you’re (me) depressed (which I wasn’t just having a bad day) to just leave it at the door and to come into work with a smile”.  Turned out I was great at housekeeping! So great in fact that my supervisor for that department wanted to promote me to be her assistant. Finally!!! Someone saw how much I care about my work and others and actually appreciated me enough to do so. But I couldn’t take it because once my school schedule started I couldn’t be there when I was needed... i was devastated and upset but I understood.  \n\nNow my problem is that my best friend and roommate is once again receiving the assistant general manager position at the hotel. Part of me is happy for her because this is what she got her degree in and it’s better pay for her. But I’m mostly pissed that once again I’m at a job where she gets promoted and not me and I now have to talk to her like a boss and not just a friend. The GM and my friend get along fine. They’ve apparently been planning for months how to get rid of the AGM and let my friend take her place. One day he asked my friend if he should fire her before or after Christmas... like seriously wtf...The current AGM is a nice lady with two kids. She knows her job and has been there for years and does it fairly well. She was even texting my friend the other day to ask why the GM had been giving her the cold shoulder etc... she went ahead that same day and told him all about her texts to her and threw her under the bus. She plans on getting this position within the next couple weeks and with my hours once again being cut to just weekends I’m over this place and having her as my boss. She was texting me the other day not as my friend but as my “future boss” and to call work and talk to the GM. Which I hadn’t even received any texts, calls or emails from to do so. So I basically told her no. My supervisor has become unreliable and so has my GM. I don’t trust my friend now when it comes to our conversations about work and I’ve already got an interview for a new job this Friday. I’m ready to just quit with no explanation as soon as I get another job and she can explain awkwardly to the GM and my supervisor why I did. We’re stuck being roommates for the next year too.\n\nSo reddit, can someone please tell me...AITA for wanting to do that to her and my job? ",

Also new to Reddit so let me know if this post belongs in a different thread\n\nTL;DR: I've had thoughts about suicide and my (now ex) best friend doesn't want to be around me anymore\n\nSo in the past 6 months I've had two friendships almost end, and one end and it's starting to fuck with me emotionally.\nNot sure if it's me overthinking stuff, so I want other people's opinions\nI've been having suicidal thoughts (nothing bad, the worst of it was thinking about how I'd like to go and if it would actually benefit me and others) This made me quite conservative and not really talk about my feelings. Had an argument with my then best friend cause she thought I was hiding stuff. So I confessed. She was one of the closest people I was with and I thought I could trust her with anything.\nSince then she's been weird with me, and recently told me I've changed, which I can't deny I have, but it's mostly just me being more pessimistic and less talkative. She says I've been using \"suicide as a weapon\" against her. \nThis whole ordeal of losing one of the people I was closest to has fucked me up a bit, but I'll turn out alright.\nNot looking for any help with my mental state, just wether I'm the asshole or not",

So me and this other individual, lets call her Robin has been apart of this server for quite some time and we knew who each other were but never really played together until circumstance brought us in the same lobbies. We clicked really well, great chemistry and started DM'ing each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a month and we've become great friends and started our own private calls playing games on our own away from the main teamspeak server we met on. We're both introverted (not to the point of socially inept) and can appreciate the quiet of solely two people. The owner of the teamspeak server, lets call him Tom does not like this (whom I go way back with around 14 years so we're also great friends). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTom approaches me on the matter and says \"It's time for CS, stop playing with Robin\". I respond with \"hush\" and he says \"its kinda fucking awkward when you two go into hiding like that\". Now me and Robin had talked about it and if we invited a 3rd person they would kinda be third wheeling because of our chemistry so unless we are four we're staying on our own. So me and Tom go back and forth on the issue and I approach him on what his problem is with us being on our own and he says that he would appreciate getting invited and is quite disappointed in us.

      "description": "(AITA?)So my friend came over the other day after telling me that he has been too busy with work for a few weeks now. I was fine with him being busy and didn't want to push or get aggravated until i found out that he wasn't busy with work but with a mutual friend going out drinking and spending time at her house and refusing to come over because he wanted to go see her. (which i would have been fine with if he had straight out told me but he lied). I found out that he was going over there when i called our mutual friend to find out what she was up to. Then the other day i called our mutual friend and my male friend was there so i asked to talk to him and then invited him to come down and play Pokemon go with me. He ended up coming down for the first time in months and we left to go for our walk and start catching Pokemon. Once we got away from my house he started talking about our mutual friend and his sexual ventures with her and other very inappropriate things, i asked him how many times he had gone to her house since she got back but he was reluctant to tell me which i was fine with since that wasn't exactly what was bothering me but then he stopped and said that if it hadn't been for the fact that our mutual friends ex husbands family was coming over he wouldn't have come down at all. At this point in the walk i put my phone away and didn't feel like playing Pokemon with him anymore. then he asked me if there was a place he could get a snake near where we were, and i said yeah that there was an ice cream place so we walked over there and he ordered his food. Now i live in a very small town where everyone knows everyone, my male friend turns to me and starts to talk about his penis and her and other really nasty stuff right there at the front desk of the ice cream place for everyone to hear even after i made it clear that i was getting uncomfortable so i decided to walk ahead of him a little as we walked back to my house and i felt awkward and angry because instead of really hanging out he was saying inappropriate and nasty things not just in front of me but in public so when we got back i decided i wanted him to go home and make an excuse of why he had to go home but he didn't actually leave foe close to an hour after that  which was irritating. until finally i told him i wanted him to leave and he did. we haven't spoken since.

A day ago, I muted him because I didn't want to hear him argue with a friend but also because he would'nt let me finish my point, when I let him do so. Now tonight he starts bringing this up making it seem as if I'm the one at fault. He says that I was spewing bullshit on why I had him muted (I said the exact same points as in this post). He then starts saying he starts arguments very civilized. So I respond with \"You never start them civiliezed you blow them out of proportion the instant you hear something you don't like! If you can't see how bad the wrongs you do compared to everyone else, you need to tone down your ego!\" He promptly says afterwards that he's blocking me because I can't make logical arguements, and that I always act like a cunt for no reason other than to be a \"stick up prick.\"\n\nHonestly I don't know how I feel about this argument, his arguments had gaping holes in them, and honeslty, so did a couple of mine. However, I feel strongly that I'm not the asshole in this situation. This argument really ticked me off, because he wouldn't acknowledge anything I said with any real importance, and would focus on the small minor things instead.\n\nThanks -StormHasBadFriends.",

He works at a fast food response with no ambitions to strive for more and he has no plans to stop being a leech off of those around him. He has “no money” but spends an awful lot on weed and other drugs and alcohol.\nHe stays on Facebook constantly posting how sad he is, and how depression is a thing. Which is fine, I’ve tried to be there to talk to and support and stuff, But recently he started posting about how bipolar he is. It really bothers me because I have my own struggles and I know others that have truly struggled and it feels like he’s making the whole thing a farce, another one of his ploys for attention. To top it all off he has not and is not seeing any professionals that would lead him to that conclusion. He’s literally the kind of person who goes to WebMD for symptoms and picks the one that can get the most attention and relieve him of any responsibility for what has happened in his life.",

      "description": "I'll start this by saying that they won, they put everything on one row, so they tripled the money, basically. This was when they were out drinking one time without me.\n\nMe and four of my friends planned a two week vacation to the Bahamas three months ago. It was $2100/person, all-inclusive including plane tickets. The hotel wanted $700 in a deposit. I couldn't pay the whole sum three months ago, so I told my friends I could pay them back in the beginning of April. They agreed.\n\nThey went out drinking and gambled with the money. They didn't tell me beforehand or for 2 months because they wanted to surprise me about the fact that I didn't have to pay them back. They've also upgraded us to more luxurious suites and extended our stay by one week. \n\nAt this point I'm furious. \n\nFirstly they gambled with my money without my knowledge. \nSecondly they used that money to upgrade the suites without my knowledge. \nThirdly they extended the stay to three weeks instead of two. I took two weeks off work and I'm not sure if I can get another week.\n\nNow I'm thinking I'm not going on this trip because of this shit. So I told them I want my deposit back and I want my share of the winnings. They told me fine, you can get your deposit back but not your winnings because we'll need those because we upgraded the suites and you still owe us money from the original deposit. \n\nI tried to explain to them that I'm not going on the trip with them. So then I said ok, I'm paying the deposit for the original reservation of $700 and I want the winnings from the money you gambled with. They said no that's not happening since I didn't partake in the gambling so I wasn't there to deserve the winnings. What the fuck.\n\nAITA here?",

      "description": "My friend (22F) and I (23M) have been friends for 5 years, and working at the same company for the last 2. The past 3 years have been somewhat rocky, with constant arguments over petty things (usually issues she has with my character, such as not sharing enough about my life with her, not spending enough time outside of work with her, etc). At some point I suspect she had romantic feelings for me (and others have observed likewise), however I swing the other way so nothing will happen there.\n\nWe have a mutual friend who is closer to me than friend, as she is in my team and therefore a direct colleague. I tend to talk about the arguments we have with her, and share the annoyances I have, and she offers me some valuable insight and often helps me resolve the arguments. \n\nMy friend found out that I talk about these arguments with mutual friend, and started another argument with me yesterday. As with all past arguments, she came across rather aggressive, yelling, pointing fingers, crying, making assumptions, and not letting me talk/choosing not to listen to what I had to say when I did talk. All of this was in the middle of my floor at work, where people I work with were able to witness it.\n\nAs the argument started to ramp up, I made the decision to remove myself from the situation to try to deescalate it (since other methods I tried didn’t work). She physically blocked me whenever I tried to walk away, and in the end I let her speak her mind for a whole hour before returning to my desk. \n\nAt my desk she started messaging me things about how nasty I am to talk about her behind her back, how it is all my fault, how she can’t trust me, how she’s going through so much at the moment and she just needs a friend who she can trust 100%. I told her that if that’s how she feels, then perhaps we need to create some space between us for a while. Despite this, she continued to message me, call me, she came to my desk, and even followed me out of the building despite me saying that I needed to leave so I don’t miss my bus. At one point she called 5 times in a row until I answered.\n\nAITA for speaking about our arguments with another friend? AITA/a coward for walking away from the situation? AITA for wanting space? Will I be the asshole if I decide I don’t want this friendship to continue in the future as it was in the past (i.e. suggesting we see each other less, maybe once a week for lunch instead of every day)?",

      "description": "OK there is more to this than just that. Basically I got on the subway at one stop intending to get off at the next stop. While I'm waiting for my stop to arrive I see this old lady sitting almost in front of me (but like 10 feet away) calling people for help. At first many were ignoring her but when she started pointing at specific people they did come to help. She didn't call me (even though I was right in front of her) but she called three other people. They came over and helped her stand up and confirmed they would help her get out of the station and to where the buses were. At this point they formed a little group near the door where I needed to exit from and I stood really close to them (I was thinking of helping) but I didn't say anything. Once the doors opened and they started leaving it didn't seem to me like they needed extra help or extra people so I just walked by them and left without saying anything.\n\nAnyways I did that because my social anxiety kicked in and I didn't know what to say considering I didn't say anything before but now I feel like an asshole for not helping. I don't really think two out of the three people meant to get off at that station which adds to it. I probably should've spoken up and helped but anyways I didn't and now its slightly haunting (also I'm paranoid that a gif of the security cam footage will end up on reddit but thats anther thing...).\n\ntl;dr: Old lady needed help but didn't specifically ask me for help so I pretended I would help but then didn't ",

      "description": "This happened last week and has caused some bumps with me and my girlfriends relationship. \n\nMy girlfriend (F16) lives in my home state, however, I (M16) live all the way across the country because I am going to school. I came back home this past week for the first time in two months and I was finally able to spend time with my girlfriend in person. During this week I saw her many times. However, when it came to when I had to leave on Monday, the only time I could see her before I left was on Saturday. Other than spending that last night with me, she decided to spend it going to a party. She invited me to come, however, I decided not go because parties are not my thing at all. I did tell her that I would like to spend it with her because this will be the last time I will see her in around a month, but she declined because she said she's had this party planned for weeks (I did not know she had this planned, she only let me know the night before). After she went to the party, I told her that I was really upset because I really wanted to spend that night with her. Her, on the other hand, was upset with me because she feels like she shouldn't have to devote her whole week to me. I get that she has her plans, but the time, the time that I have to spend with her is very limited because I live so far away. \n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting to spend time with her before I leave despite her plans?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend is upset that I wanted to spend time with her before I leave for a month, despite her plans made weeks beforehand that she only told me a day before.

I walked to her dorm on the next floor, gained access via her roommate, and took some random stuffed animal. I left a vague note that didn't mention my identity but essentially just said, \"ROOMMATE told me you took my money. you know who i am and will receive your animal back when you return my money\" In-person she blamed the theft on my roommate. He'd been trustworthy the entire time we lived together, and so i believed his story. she never returned the money, rumor has it she just used it to buy another stuffed animal because she needs one to sleep at night due to some mental condition i was not aware of at the time",

      "description": "I live up at a ski resort and have been working here this ski season. Around christmas, my family came to visit like normal. I should add some backstory: the place I’m staying is my grandparents cabin as they’re not using it and they graciously let me stay here. My family and I have come every christmas for a ski vacation which i’ve always cherished. There are two floors and as I’m living here alone, I occupy the downstairs and don’t usually go upstairs. Anyways, when my family came this Christmas it was business as usual, plenty of fun, good family times had by all. Now, the rule at my grandparents place is if you stay, you have to clean the cabin to the degree you found it or better. Which is fine. But I went upstairs this weekend and found my siblings had cleaned the sheets for the beds they slept in, but hadn’t remade the beds and left it for me to do, along with not cleaning the bathroom. I don’t get grossed out easily but there were nasty old tissues and it was just kinda rude. I don’t typically have a ton of time as i’m usually working, so finding out that this had just been sitting there unkempt set me off a little. Naturally I got kinda frustrated because this is basic cleaning up after yourselves, and my siblings are old enough (16, and 12) that they are more than capable of making a bed and being responsible for their area of influence. I called them and told them off for being irresponsible and leaving it for me to do which wasn’t cool, and that I expected them to not do it in the future cause it’s just a dick move. But I felt badly afterwards cause I can have a temper and my little sister (the 12 year old) looked pretty upset that I told her off and I hate upsetting her. So the question is; AITA?",

      "description": "I didn’t read the sidebar and I accidentally posted twice :( sorry :( It’s a very long story but pretty much my girlfriend and I moved in together 4 months ago. The decision was either: move in with me or break up because of long distance(both graduated college, live in hcol city and she couldn’t afford to live her on her own). She moved in, we started fighting more and more frequently, and we broke up. I started it but it became decently mutual once we talked through. She needed someone who was less selfish(I thought I was trying to be accommodating but it was never enough). She fortunately got a high paying job, and can afford to live in the area without me. Anyway, she has some of her stuff at my place but she lives somewhere else while she looks for a lease. This arrangement has worked well for the last three weeks. Today she asked me if she could come over and grab some clothes before she goes out. I said sure but it’ll have to be before 9. She asked why and I said it’s because I was having friends over. She thought I was lying and immediately asked me if I’m sleeping with someone. I tell her no but she doesn’t believe me.\n\nThe truth is, I am having someone over who knows about my situation and is okay with it. I know why she wanted to know if I was sleeping with someone else, but I feel like it doesn’t matter because we are broken up. Also because she probably has slept with someone else and idc. I also feel like a storage unit, and I am allowed to say, can you please come pick up your stuff at a different time before nine. ",

      "description": "On Valentine’s Day my(26M) GF(26F) received very expensive roses from somebody random. Valentines this year landed on a weekday, and me and my girlfriend are doing a somewhat long distance relationship. I had tried to secretly plan on bringing my own bouquet of roses when I went to visit her that weekend but some person had beat me to giving her flowers. After I begrudgingly gave her my $15 flowers, we went on our previously planned trip to Europe. During the whole trip I could not get off my mind that she had flowers delivered to her apartment by a stranger and she was not conflicted with it, even though she is very cautious about being a young women in a world where suspicious men can kidnap her on late nights where she’s walking to her car. \n\nWhile this was going on in my head, I had asked her to call the flower delivery company to ask for information about who sent it because I wanted to rule out that she wasn’t cheating on me. (FWIW, I plan on marrying this woman and we have been together for 5 years.) She called the company and they obviously follow a privacy policy that doesn’t permit giving away their customer’s information. \n\nThis has put me in a weird funk, and I asked her to throw away the flowers because I felt disheartened that I wasn’t the one to give her the flowers she wanted, nor could I even afford that type of gift right now. She refused because they were very expensive and she didn’t want to basically throw away $400. She kept the flowers I bought her in her living room until they died, and these flowers have been on her desk for the past month lol. \n\nI feel like I’m the butthole here but it still eats me inside knowing that she kept them",

      "description": "I'm almost certain he'll find this as our situation is too unique. If he does - I love you, I'm sorry, I needed outsider opinion.\n\nI am a woman, working in a trade for my parents, currently unpaid (for 6 months now) and I work 6-7 days a week depending. Recently I've been getting home more on time, but historically I start early and finish late. I know my parents ATA, but they ain't why we're here. \n\nMy boyfriend is a paid academic. He can work when he chooses.\n\nIn the mornings, I love time to myself. Since my boyfriend moved in, that's nonexistent. I like gettinh up early and being ready for the day, but nope my boyfriend wants to talk to me and tell me he loves me. I have expressed that I don't want to socialise in the morning many times. I just wanna get up early and enjoy my solitude. \n\nHe has an alarm set for 7 every day, purely because he enjoys that he can turn it off and sleep as long as he wants. This feels like taunting to me, while I'm rushing to get out the door. \n\nHe gets up at 4am on Sunday, my only day of not having to get up, to watch eSports. Now I love watching pro league, but hate being woken up at 3-4 on a Sunday. \n\nHe also says he only does chores at night, but I often feel even in his lax situation he only does housework if I ask. He will sometimes have the dishes done as a surprise, but washing sits there for days not put away. I cannot relax in an untidy house. \n\nI understand I'm not my boyfriend's responsibility, but I'm currently working more than full-time hours, battling a tumour (non-cancerous but makes me very tired ) and studying in my spare time. If the situation were reversed I'd want to try and do extra around the house to help my partner. \n\nTL:dr - my situation is a but shitty right now and I feel taunted by my boyfriend in a much better situation. He isn't the asshole because he's very lucky, but am I?",

      "description": "So as a brief intro, my girlfriend and I have been together for 5 months and have gotten very serious very quickly and now live together. Her parents are divorced and I love her dad and his family and we see them often. I have never met her mom, and for a “Christmas present”, without asking if we had plans or if what she planned was okay, she bought tickets for her boyfriend, herself, my girlfriend and I for an expensive play at a local event center this weekend and gave them to my gf. It’s important to note that her mom’s bf is both of their bosses (small family business) so it’s impossible to keep personal things out of the workplace for her mom (a drama queen). \n\nGF’s mom is a very dramatic person who already thinks I’m a bad influence and mistreats GF and gaslights her for every day things in order to gain sympathy and manipulate others to control every situation. \n\nI personally am not ready to meet the mother as I have anxiety and not being able to have a choice in the activity or place and time already make these worse as well as just not wanting to meet her yet. \n\nGirlfriend doesn’t want to go to this show either, and is afraid to stand up to her mother for fear of repercussion at work because her mom won’t keep it professional. Her mom throws tantrums when things don’t go her way and although we appreciate the gift and her trying to welcome me into her life I don’t want her to think that she can just plan things for us in the future (she gave us less than a week notice and didn’t ask, just said this is what we are doing) as we are very busy people and don’t want to bow to her every will. I worry that she will hold this over our heads for the foreseeable future if we don’t attend but also think that she needs to be taught a lesson of being polite and asking if we are interested in an event. The mom doesn’t treat girlfriend as an adult yet even though we are in our early twenties and doesn’t respect her wishes about anything in life. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to tell gf to cancel on her mom to mostly prove a point that she needs to show respect and ask before she does things?

      "description": "On mobile so sorry for formatting and whatnot.\n\nSo to preface, I'm in highschool and so is my gf. Recently my car's broken down. I'm rather lucky in the regard that my mom both bought me a car and pays for insurance, gas, repairs, and the like. I'm trying to enjoy getting taken care of while I can cause I know life's gonna get a whole lot tougher on my own. Anyway with all that the only downside is when it's broken down it's not my mom's number 1 priority but it's getting taken care of soon. But that means I walk to school with my little bro. So no picking her up and no dates until it's fixed.\n\nShe's been bugging me about it and valentine's day and our anniversary (1 year, cheesy, uneccessary but a nice sentiment if we make it). So she's been lonely. I've been getting rides to school and getting rides to hang out with friends. I hang out with her at school when I can but ever since the car broke down it's nice to get some alone time. \n\nAnyway here's where a problem starts. My gf is on her period so she's a bit more emotional. She's in pain and I have no idea what to do. From now and then I give her back rubs at my place. She loves it when I do it and I try to do it when I can (to be frank, not the most comfortable thing to do, fucks with my thumbs) but it makes her happy so I try.\n\nCue today when I hang out with her and some other friends. We hang out with one guy who's pretty nice. He has a plutonic relationship with my gf (which I was uncomfortable with at first since I have some trust issues from previous relationships but he's an alright guy) when all of a sudden he says\n\n\"You really need some lessons on back rubs dude, I could teach you\"\n\nThis immediatley sets off some red flags in my head. This may have been an off handed thing, he is kind of a helpful guy but I was uncomfortable to say the least.\n\nI didn't make a scene in front of everyone, so later that night I text my gf saying\n\nMe: Why do I need lessons on back rubs?\n\nGf: When did I say that?\n\nMe: Well apparently I need lessons.\n\nGf: It helps with my cramps! It's different. I love your back rubs.\n\nMe: Alrighty 😑\n\nShe called me afterwards to see if I was okay, I say I needed some time to think because, well, I needed some time to think.\n\nGf: I was uncomfortable btw, I thought it'd be better than you, if that helps.\n\nMe: Then why the hell did you accept it!? I mean if you've been getting intemant backrubs from (Guy) then what else has been going on?\n\nGf: Oh my god! Do you hear yourself?! Who the fuck do you think I am?! I didn't accept it! \n\nMe: Then what the hell happened!?\n\nGf: He rubbed my back. I didn't like it. I verbally said I didn't like it in front of the squad. YOU ACCUSED ME OF CHEATING!!! Good night. I'm not fucking doing this because if anything I've said up until this point means anything you'd trust me but apparently that trust is gone\n\nAnd now you're caught up to where I am. So now I ask you. With everything laid out and all. Am I the asshole reddit?",

She said she had all her information written down on a different document so I left her to do her part. Today I saw that she still hadn't finished maybe 1 slide. I decided to leave that part to her but work on some of the other slides to occupy myself and get it done.

      "description": "      For about a year now I've been acting very rude to my mom. I've been ignoring her when she talks, getting an attitude with her, and raising my voice in an annoyed manner. It doesn't matter whether or not she comes to me already angry, or in a calm way. Now that we got that out of the way, onto the main situation. \n\n       I hesitate to say my mom is abusive, as I know that her culture and the way she grew up was very different from mine, but she goes out of her way to insult me and make me feel bad. When I was young (4-14ish), she was very physical in her punishments with me. (Not spanking, but throwing me onto the floor, into walls, against things that would make me trip, etc). After i fell she would make fun of me or scream at me to get up and that if i did *insert task* that she wouldn't have to do this in the first place. I started to fight back around age 13-14 and since then hasn't put her hands on me much, but has ramped up on the insults and saying that every problems she has is my fault. That being said, she is also sometimes perfectly fine and nice, and says she is proud of me and all i do. She also goes out of her way sometimes to get something i would like (like candy, food/snacks, or art supplies). \n\n       As I've said before, I've now started to simply ignore her or get snappy with her whenever she tries to talk to me. I will admit that lately she has been nicer to me and comes to me more calmly, but she still has bouts of verbally berating me. I can see that she loves me with the things she does for me, and i often feel bad for being annoyed with her, but in my mind i can't help but think it's justified. So tell me, am I the a-hole? \n\nPS: she also yells at (and sometimes hits) my dad. I'm not sure how relevant it is to you guys, but i felt that i should mention it. \n\nPPS: this is my first post and I'm not sure if me mentioning my past punishments counts as me breaking rule 5 (no violence). Hopefully it doesn't ",

I am not that close to my dad and he tends to leave me out of his life on some situations and the girl he is dating has three kids so it would be 6.5 all together (sister dosen't come around that often) and I don't get along with any of them. Being 14, this has caused me a lot of stress and he keeps bringing it up when I don't want to talk about it.

      "description": "I'm sorry if there are any mistakes, English isn't my first language.\n\nMy brother (24) got a girlfriend (28) a few months ago. He has a habit of choosing girls that are gold diggers. We are definitely not rich, but are a tad bit better off than most people here because my parents work their asses off abroad.\nShe started out coming over to our house for a few hours/few times a week to sleeping over at our place for a few days straight. The only words I have ever spoken with her are \"hello what's up\". She never bothers starting conversation and is simply unfriendly. As much as it annoyed me at first, I got used it.\nA month or so ago, she got the habit of showering at our house and there's basically no warm water for me anymore because it's always used. And on top of that she uses our bath robes to dry off which is extremely gross to me. Whatever, I got used to that too.\nA few days ago I noticed someone used my hairbrush. There were blonde hairs all over it (I'm a brunette). My biggest pet peeve and disgust is shedded head hair just lying around. I get grossed out of my own, let alone someone else's hair.\nShe couldn't even bother asking for permission to use it. It just grossed me out, but I didn't say anything out of respect. \nI have told my mother multiple times to tell her directly or tell my brother to stop using my things since I feel uncomfortable since as I said we barely know each other. My mother is always taking their side and is telling me that what I'm saying is rude and it compeltely baffles me how she can say that since she has always been a rational woman. \nI understand my brother and her love each other very much, but you can't just do those things in someone's house.",

      "description": "Am I the asshole for being mad with my partner for doing cocaine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so I'm kinda torn here because ultimately I know I can't tell someone how to live their life. I'm 31, my partner is 27. We've been together for about half a year but have history prior to that when we were younger. We're both no stranger to the party drugs scene but I left that behind a few years ago because I saw it destroy some of my friends it was starting to take its toll on me so I left it in the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my partner moved back to the country she had mentioned that she'd still go out and do cocaine with her friends. I'm at the stage where I'm asking myself \"do you want someone with these habits to potentially be the mother of your children\". I told her I was uncomfortable with it very early on in the relationship and she told me that it wasn't a big deal to her and she would stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then there's been times where we've been out with her friends who I know have been dosing and I suspected she was on it too but I never said anything because I chalked it up to me lacking trust trust and I didn't want to be \"that guy\". Last night she went out with her friends, the one thing we always do in these situations is let the other know via text when we're home safe and sound, I never got this text which was unlike her I was a bit worried but her battery could have died, lost phone etc, nothing to panic about. I called her this morning and she sounded terrible, she was really hung over and mentioned that she had been taking cocaine till 4am. On one hand she did tell me herself but on the other I now feel like I can't take her at her word. If I kick up a fuss and she says she will stop (again) this will probably just encourage her to hide it better or lie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other issue is her mother has just been diagnosed with cancer and starts treatment soon, she asked if I was mad and I said \"I'm torn, I really care about you but I don't want to be with someone who's doing that, I feel like I can't take you at your word now\" and she's brought that up and is painting me out as being unreasonable. Maybe I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I overreacting here? I'm I being an asshole and making a mountain out of a molehill?",

Luckily my only friend at that school also has that class with me so we do a lot of assignments and tests together since a majority of them require a partner (doing things like CPR training, what to do if someone is choking, etc.) And usually the teacher gives us notes and some crossword or something and tell us to do them with a partner, so naturally my friend and I partner up and get working. When the time comes for me to leave I get up and go and she continues to work on the assignment without me. \n\nLately though she's been doing things like asking me to miss lunch to finish these assignments. I have done it one time when it was something super important and the project was worth a lot of points, but I dont really feel like its a big deal with something like a crossword puzzle. I help the best I can when I'm there but I do have to eat.\n\nI'm not really sure if what I'm doing is terrible, and if it is I'll try to fix it the best I can. So reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "Alright, so I just got home from work and I got this question to hash out till tomorrow. I work in retail to finance my life as a student. Since I have been working in retail for ages and even before I started my studies I am in a position where I sub for my boss in the evenings and thus am in a position of some responsibility. Now let's discuss my WIBTA situation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago I worked with a much older colleague of mine who is working the registers (I'll call her Ms. Karen), while I am supervising the cash registers of our huge store. She was having a bad day, being at odds with my boss about how her breaks were handled that day, while I was having a great day and was in good spirits. When I am in a supervising position I like to check in with the people at the registers when no customers are around to know if they need stuff etc. sometimes this also ends with some casual conversation. As I was in a good mood and have a somewhat booming voice, I could tell that my casual conversation with some of my other colleagues were doing nothing to improve the mood of Ms. Karen, who has got more disgruntled by the minute. When she finally finished her shift, I was the one who took her to the back to finish up her cash register. When in the back I asked her if I was to blame for even worse mood. Since she didn't offer me an answer, I apologised in case I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went on a 2-week vacation and when I came back today I asked my boss if Ms. Karen had complained about me. Ms. Boss answered that Ms. Karen had asked who was supervising one of her shifts and when she got an answer that didn't contain my name, she responded with an annoyed \"As long as it's not Mr. u/Erzlump\". Back in the day when I started there we actually got along great and she often told me that the place needed more people like me - so this total turn surprised me. Now since my Boss and she do not get along very well (while my boss and I do), my Boss did not pay a lot of attention to her response - but the reaction could, of course, have been a lot different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the WIBTA Part: Tomorrow her shift will just be ending as mine begins, giving me a good chance of meeting her in the back. It really irks me that I asked her if she had a problem with me, yet received no answer, only to then find out that she now openly displays her resentment towards me in front of my Boss to the point where she says she prefers not to work with me at all. The thing is that if I asked here \"Hey, Ms. Karen, why do you not want to work with me anymore\" there could be other people present and she could that it as if I am trying to embarrass her. However, maybe she just said it as a joke and I want to give her a chance to tell me directly what's her problem. As our store (and relationship) are set up, I will have no real chance of talking about this to her with just the both of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - WIBTA if I asked my colleague why she does not want to work with me anymore?",

      "description": "Alt account btw. So I’m a stay at home dad to two wonderful but extremely hyper and demanding kids and it stressful as crap but it’s what I signed up for. Now I haven’t been able to visit my mother in 3 years because she lives in a different state and my in laws live 30 minutes from where we live so we see them like 7 times a month. They treat me well but I still don’t feel like I can be myself around them or like I belong there, so I can never relax. Also my wife works extremely hard and I recognize that so I let her rest as much as possible while I tackle the kids. \n\nSo after 3 years of not seeing my mother due to never having a baby sitter or able to afford plane tickets for a family of 4 I decided that I’m gonna go visit her. So we ran into some\nIssue planning the road trip (MD to FL) my wife would have to use ALL of her sick/vacation days until she accumulated more of them and I’m 100% not ok with that so I mentioned that I’ll just go by myself but I need help with kids while I’m away. So I bring all this to my FIL and his response to my wife using all of her sick/vacation hours so soon was “it’s not an issue until it’s an issue” also he said that “trips like that should always be a family trip” we do have family vacations every year to the beach  so it’s not like we never travel as a family. \n\nI’m all for proper planning so not worrying about something until it becomes an issue is a big red flag for me but my wife said she can just borrowing against her time and I’m not ok with because what if there is an actual emergency? Both her parents have health issues, and whenever she gets sick it hits her hard. She says that it’s fine advice to give but it just doesn’t sit right with me. So maybe an outside perspective can help me out here. ",

Can we bring our dogs?\n\nE: Yes, a little bit\n\nM: Can we or can we not bring our dogs?\n\nE:Yes\n\n*hangs up*\n\nSo we leash up our dogs, two tiny dogs less than 15 pounds each, and walk over since it isn’t too far of a walking distance from our apartment. \n\nWe get there, ask for a table for three and a quarter (the quarter being the dogs and my dad making a joke.) E is confused at their dog policy now, enter RB for Russian Bitch. \n\nRB: Do you have service dog verification?\n\nM: No, nobody told us that. I just talked to E on the phone and she said that we can bring our dogs for patio seating. \n\nRB: We need service dog verification. \n\nM: Let me pull it up on my phone\n\nMy mom pulls out her phone and moves out of their way so that they can continue serving other people as we’re looking of unnecessary papers. After a while of searching on my mom’s mess of a phone, my dad asks:\n\nD: Bottom line, are you going to serve us? \n\nRB: No. \n\nD: Okay, fuck you *walks out*\n\nRB: Get out of *MY* restaurant and never come back! Proceeds to scoot my mom out after my dad already left\n\nM: How dare you, you bitch!\n\nRB: Fuck You Bitch!\n\n*slams slow door in our face*\n\nAre we the assholes for doing our due diligence and calling ahead?

      "description": "This might get a bit long but I’ll throw in a TLDR at the bottom, on mobile, yadda yadda yadda. \n\nBackstory: A little over a year ago my mom had a baby. I just turned 20 and it kinda fucked my plans up. My mom and I use to be really close (we still are, just not as much.) until she met her bf and got pregnant. We ended up moving over to where her bf use to live (they work in construction so they needed a home base) and where his (now 11 or 12years old)  boy is. We had plans to hit a good job, save money, and settle down in a few years. We have been here almost 2 years now. She talks about moving but again, it’s been almost 2 years. She also is getting fed up with her bf because they’re not really compatible (they were together for about 3-4 months max before she found out she was pregnant.) \n\nBefore all of this, i met my boyfriend while we were both in high school. We dated online for years until we finally met one another last year. Needless to say it was worth the wait and is the most amazing man in the world. My mom likes him and was going to let us stay with her for as long as we want (I wanted forever cause were really close and enjoy being around one another.). The offer still stands (maybe not forever but he can move in with us if he really wants to) but now that the bay is in the picture, he wants nothing to do with coming over here. Even visiting would be enough to annoy him to no end. My boyfriend borderline hates the thing because it’s loud, annoying, and takes up all my time since I babysit all day. (5 am-5:30/6pm) \n\nBecause my mom wants to move out and stuff(and because I’m in the middle of nowhere with no babysitters and the only daycare is $200 a week from 8am-4pm I think) I want to help her out. I don’t want her to struggle cause I love her and she’s always helped me out. She didnt even really want another child but her boyfriend convinced her, even saying “if you don’t wanna him, I’ll take him!” ... Let’s just say if anything happens to my mom, she wants me to raise the baby. \n\nMy boyfriend says it’s not my problem or responsibility, that she’s a grown woman that can take care of herself. He wants me to move up where he lives and be together. I want the same but I don’t wanna abandon my mom. He says I’ll be there forever, which would probably be true if he broke up with me. I told him I wanna stay for another year or 2 max to help her, but he’s sick of us not being together and so am I. I’m also sick of watching the thing, I DONT EVEN LIKE KIDS AND DONT PLAN ON HAVING ANY. \n\n\nAm I the Asshole for not wanting to ditch her? \n\nTLDR; boyfriend is getting annoyed I wanna help my mom out with her new baby and not move out for another year or 2. He wants me to move up with him soon (like this year) and I want to, but again, I don’t wanna abandon her. ",

      "description": "I was in Chicago at a pizza place with my boyfriend and they sat us at a four-top right next to a couple in a two-top. My boyfriend and I sat on the farther side from them so a set of chairs were separating us from the other couple. The couple were finished eating and waiting for their check and talking and the girl puts a bag holding a to-go box on my table. Now this is a city I don’t live in and I  haven’t been to this restaurant before  so I don’t know the unspoken rules. However I am a space nazi and I hate it when people intrude upon what I consider “my” space. I’m also a non-confrontational person but I try to work on being more assertive. \n\nAfter a minute or two I say “excuse me um, this is OUR table” in a voice that’s trying to sound nice and pleading. She removed the bag and gives me a dirty look and mumbles that I’m not  using the space. \n\nThey leave and another couple is seated and they order salads and a pizza. They are eating their salads and the restaurant goofs up and brings their pizza out too fast. The guys are like “um, uh, er...” and put the salads on our table lol. This time I didn’t ask them to remove their salads because their table literally couldn’t fit all their food at once. It would have been nice if they asked though. \n\nBut I’m wondering, did I challenge a specific restaurant norm I wasn’t privy to? The girl had a to-go box in a bag that she removed from the floor and set on our table. Surely she could have kept it on the floor or held it in her lap. I just get weird about personal space.\n\nWhat say you? I hope this isn’t a shit post, because I tried to be nice, but it’s really been bothering me that maybe I was out of line.\n\n",

      "description": "Context: my mother and I have a rough relationship. It would take a long time to tell the whole thing but the short story is that I don’t like her very much but interact with her because she has a pretty big mental illness that she’s now finally on meds for. \n\n\nShe’s still not the most amazing listener even on her meds. If she has a penny she’ll try and spend it. And not even on practical things. What she has been doing the most since we’ve reconnected for lack of a better term is buy me things. I think she thinks she can buy my love. The thing is she’ll ask if I want the thing and I politely say no (although knowing her patterns I’ve maybe gotten a little too harsh with the no) but then buy it for me anyway. Example: Shoes when I already have enough and a coat when I already have enough to the point where I did a New Years clean out and donated what I didn’t wear anymore. If she was rich I would maybe shrug it off but she’s on a fixed income. I’m begging her to save her money or even just spend it on herself. We don’t have the same style and she’ll buy the most expensive thing while I’m content to shop at goodwill. \n\nAnd then she gets upset that I’m mad. I think my main problem is this is another thing in a long list of her never listening to me. On or off her meds.\n\nTLDR: Mom asks if she can buys me something then does it anyway when I beg her not to. \n\n",

      "description": "My family normally has little dinners and stuff all year around for different occasions, majority of the time I go with them and have a decent time. But one time in particular it was a dinner for a holiday at someone else's house whom I have not met before. Typically when we go to these events I just end up sitting down on my phone or something like that for hours on end while my mother (mostly) and my grandmother spend the evening talking and I'm really not doing anything. My grandmother most of the time doesn't even want to stay either but just goes probably because she feels like she has to. My mom is the main one that really enjoys going to these functions. And I try to talk to some of the people at the dinner but I'm a tad bit shy.\n\nMost of the conversations just boil down to something school related since i'm 17 and it's not exactly the most fun thing to talk about. And after they ask about my school work, they normally don't say anything again. So, this dinner rolls around and my mom asks me to go, I decline and say I just wanna stay this one time and she gives me a frowny face but doesn't say more about it until later. When they're almost ready she tells me, \"Your grandma would really want you to go\" and at that point I feel a little bad but I still don't want to go. She tells me i'm being  selfish by not going for my grandmother and i've been questioning if I was being selfish or an asshole for not wanting to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hey guys! So a little backstory....our small family owned restaurant was chosen for a shoot for a food show. Awesome right? I will not be naming names but if/when it airs it will put our business in front of viewers nationwide. We found out maybe 48hrs in advance. After some communication back and forth we were asked to bring the \"family\" for a family photo shoot early in the day. This includes 4 small kids (3 toddlers) and 4 female family members. A big deal was made about being on time etc. Of course we want to do whatever we can to support..\n\nWell, the morning comes and not only is the shoot cast as men-only, excluding both the kitchen matriarch and manager sister...but when we arrive at the time they requested they treat all of the women and kids like a huge inconvenience. We ended up standing outside in the parking lot for about 2 hours in the sun, then eating outside waiting for \"the word\". Every few minutes a crew member comes up to tell us only guests who are \"supposed to be there\" can be there and we have to reexplain ourselves... more than once to the same person.\n\nNow if you've had family photos done with kids you know what a stressful time it can be. Keeping them clean and entertained and quiet to respect the filming process until the shoot begins. By the end of hour 3 I'm like kicking myself for bringing them out. They are losing their goddamn minds. A crew member comes over with some rubber logo bracelets and thanks us for \"keeping them so quiet\" and just turn around and walks away...then literally everyone pours out and starts to leave... it was over and they wrapped up. No photo. No release forms. No explanation at all. I pulled my son out of school on science fair day.😑\n\nNow... of course my hubby the chef is 100% over the moon... as am I! We stayed up late whispering about how excited we were the night before. We talked about all the changes we'll need to make and upgrades we could do at the restaurant... basically the culmination of a lot of hard work. \n\nHe clearly thinks ITA for being upset that he and the crew didn't communicate with us at all and left all 8 of us outside in a literal parking lot in hot weather. I feel like he's TA for not bothering to bring up the fact that his kids were waiting outside on the gravel to the producer.  He wants no responsibility in the matter and just blames the contract he signed. AITA for taking issue with what went down today and expecting him to speak up? ",

      "description": "My gf (28) was previously married, she got a notice late last year that her divorce will be official as of the 2nd of February. When she told me I told her I'd love to celebrate it with her that day. She said she'd love to and we left it at that. \n\nA few days after that I over heard her on the phone with her friend telling her about the divorce and that they should get together and celebrate it on the 2nd of February. Wait, what? I thought that's what we were gonna do and so I asked her about it. She told me that she didn't mean it that it was just girl talk and that we are celebrating it. \n\nFast forward to this week. She tells me that her friends want to get together Friday night around 10pm to go cosmic bowling and have a few drinks. I immediately asked her if this is them celebrating her divorce and she said no. Said she didn't plan this and that it's just coincidence but if they can kill two stones with one bird why not?  \n\nBecause of my new job I have to work nights and weekends so I can't celebrate it with her. I wasn't upset that she was gonna celebrate it with her friends but I feel like she lied to me when I first asked and that she's lying now. \n\nI got upset and told her I was upset and that I prefer she cancels on them Friday (this part I know I'm being petty about) but am I the asshole for feeling this was and basically starting an argument today?

      "description": "I have to make a disclaimer that no mater how long this is, i cant completely and accurately portray this situation\n\nMy girlfriend and i have been dating for almost four years and this is our first year living together in a student apartment. We argue very often and have a very rough patches, but i do love her and our lives revolve around each other. I try to help her when shes upset but she often pushes me away, not letting me touch her and saying nothing is wrong when something clearly is. When i eventually pry it out of her its often not the whole truth or just \"what i want to hear\". This annoys me to an extent I can't describe\n\nI am stupid and sometimes I i sound meaner than i want to when im trying to find out what's wrong, or just tell her straight up how i feel/what i think needs to be done. Shes lately been saying that it makes her feel like I don't care. Allthough in my mind, me trying to get the bottom of the problem so i can help is showing i care\n\nI can only help her to a certain extent and in my opinion if she doesn't want to help me understand what's wrong then i cant help her properly. For 4 years i have been asking her to see a councilor (for this and other reasons) but she refuses saying it wont help and that it doesn't matter. It does matter to me, i think she needs to let everything out and come to terms with our relationship/her personal problems.\n\nSo reddit, am i the asshole for telling her to see one, and Telling her i can only help so much?",

Shes been getting the behavioral kids and not kids with special needs, ie autism, MMD, slight learning difference, she thought she would be getting. Everytime we hangout all we talk about is how sad her kids are making her, how disrespectful they are to her, and how she hates her job. She's honestly doing a fantastic job with them despite their circumstances, but it's still weighing her down constantly. We've been dating for just under a year, but have known each other since high school. Am I the asshole cause I've asked her to chill out on the complaining? I just feel it's starting to weigh me down as well and distract me from my studies, I'm still in school about to graduate, but I feel selfish for telling her she can't talk to me about how terrible her day is everyday.

I come back and was used to everyone hating on each other . They got rid of my other design which was fairly good and nice. I often disagreed with her because it was too rainbow or stuff like that but she did it anyways. She was a better drawer. I get a copy of the newspaper after it had been finished and looked at it . She often let a kid have one ( who was a friend ) but I didn’t really like that . I said about how I didn’t like it and said I should have one too but that wasn’t allowed so I just dealt  with it. I took a spare one we had from another friend and flipped through.\n\nMe : wtf is this?\n\nit was an outline of a wolf with random colours and scribbles inside so I disagreed. I show it to my other friend.\n\nMe : do you know what this is. Shows her the page\n\nFriend: no I don’t.\nThe girl walks up to us\nMe : girl do you know what this is?\nGirl: it’s a wolf\nMe: umm uh ok. Can you show us before you get it printed?\nGirl: yeah.\n\nI just went on a little rant about it and said sorry afterwards because yeah , it was harsh. \n\nI get up to class , sit down , open my book. I look over to the door . Girl is there with the other kids . It’s normal . \nFriend: girl quit the newspaper \nMe : mouthing* wtf!!!\nI was scared because our headteacher doesn’t like me and girl went to the head last time so I got really nervous but stayed there .\n\nI’m sorry if it seems like I’m trying to push it my way but it’s my story and I just wanted to tell .\n\nA bit extra info:\nThe next week she got me kicked out and practically owns it ! She could kick anyone else out and we made a rule we wouldn’t kicked any of the originals out . ( me , girl, friend and other friend). I was pissed.\n\nTLDR: I got a little mad at girl. I apologised, she quit our group. Next week she got me kicked out and owns it . Hmmm. \n\nWhat does tldr mean?\n",

Not in a fun FWB kind of way, but in an unhealthy way. We would mutually encourage bad behaviors ranging from minor things like making jokingly racist comments, to major things like self harm.\n\nFast forwarding a few years, we had briefly lost touch for several months and, long story short, ended up dating. I feel like our relationship was pretty normal/healthy in the first 2 months, but we kind of reverted back to that old dynamic. We’re both into being verbally degraded and fulfill that under the guise of it being “sexual” and therefore entirely appropriate to say EXTREMELY not-ok things. \n\nI don’t want to overshare so I’ll be vague, but stuff like me telling him he needs to cut himself to demonstrate his devotion or stuff about him needing to starve himself in order to be cute, and him telling me that he would feel ecstatic if I killed myself because I would actually be useful as a sex toy then.\n\nI knew that the situation was probably not super healthy, but at the same time I loved (and still do) that sort of dynamic. We’re pretty private about the relationship, so there isn’t really a risk of someone hearing/seeing something that is very bad out of the context of the relationship.\n\nWhat makes me hesitant about just letting myself enjoy this dynamic is that the things we encourage are not completely fictional. We actually “sexually” encourage each other to self harm and not to eat. Outside of the degradation, we still encourage these things. In late HS we were “Ana buddies” and that dynamic is still there.\n\nI’m brining this up now because one of my close friends who I have talked a bit about the dynamic with has said that they aren’t sure if it is completely healthy.\n\nAITA for doing these things? I really want to just be able to enjoy the relationship even if it is unconventional, but is this wrong? \n\n",

      "description": "Basically since these three new hires were put on the team last month we've been having a HUGE problem with Not scanned in's or NSI's so far. I've pulled at least 15-20 movies off the shelves that weren't scanned in and some so late they were about to become purged (basically when a movie is kept out for more than 25 days we put a fee on the customers account on top of accumulated late fees that they have to pay back before they can rent again.) So now people are getting late fees and possible purge payments that they shouldn't have got. I wouldn't assume that it wasn't the new employees who were doing this if \n\n1. A movie that my dad had rented out under my account and returned yesterday was sitting out on the counter when I opened this morning, not scanned in. The two people who were working yesterday was 2 of the new employees\n\n2. This problem didn't start happening until they got hired. We had maybe 1-2 NSI's every couple of weeks before the newbies were hired. \n\nI want to do it as a group message to all my coworkers so none of them feel targeted or feel like I'm singling them out as I don't want to cause drama. But the NSI's are getting quite bothersome because it really pisses people off and makes them lose trust in our business. Which in turn can cause us to lose business! \n\n*tl;dr** newbies are harming the business\n",

Everything seemed to be getting better. For over a year and a half I have spent a lot of emotion and energy on helping her raise her kids. Her 14 year old son especially. She is no doubt lying to him, and I don't care about that. I guess I just want to say goodbye, Merry Christmas, and that I love him. Which I do ..very deeply. We had a great bond and I never got to say goodbye. Her daughter is only eight so I can't get closure there...But the son is 14, doesn't live with her, and has a cellphone...So I guess I am just seeking guidance.i love those kids, and hate to walk away without ANY closure...just writing this has me sobbing :-( \nTl;Dr- Fiance cheated and left me while I was at work. Gave me no closure and just ripped my heart apart by taking her kids away without so much as a goodbye. WIBTA for simply texting him, saying Merry Christmas, and some sort of a goodbye?\n\nThanks!

      "title": "AITA (25F) for Wanting To Leave a Store Where My Partner Embarrassed Me Publically?",
      "description": "Details: Partner and I make six figures, have no debt, and no kids\n\nAnyway... My partner grew up extraordinarily impoverished and he seems to view unnecessary spending and as a moral failing. I grew up upper middle class, and just don’t get it. However, partner and I (usually) have great communication so we’ve found a solution: our finances are combined, but I put aside extra money for things that are pleasurable. Since they come from “my money” the theory is that he will be able to freely enjoy these things that (I believe) are worth the money. The account is literally called ‘The Fun Account’. We also agreed that he will not lecture or complain about my purchases under $10 (he consistently fails at this...)\n\nPartner and I have been planning a vacation for months. He has been crazy busy and I love vacations, so I have done all the planning, the only thing required of him is that he procure a tux and shoes to go with it. We leave in a week and he still has not done so. Great. At his request, I send him a list of potential renters. He doesn’t like any of them (lots of excuses, but in the end it comes down to price) and seeks out the cheapest possible tux instead. I let him know that the quality level is not appropriate, and the sales person is trying to sell him a tux that is never going to fit properly (I sold high-end suits and tuxes all through college.)\n\nHe agrees to go somewhere else to try on others and to have himself measured by a quality salesperson. The main goal is measurements, so he can get the right tux SOMEWHERE. We leave and go to the other shop. Within moments of engaging the salesperson, my partner starts asking me abnormally aggressive questions, he’s basically scolding me and saying I’ve tricked him into the store, when he only wanted to be measured! I am trying to keep the (commission based) salesperson’s head in the game, so I say that we’re here to try things on, get measured, and see if he likes these better. At this point he seems to lose it and starts talking to me in a manner that is totally out of character. He starts accusing me of tricking him and of luring him here on false pretenses. These tuxes are too expensive. He wants to go to men’s warehouse and have me buy a $200 tux instead (these are called ‘service tuxes’ and are meant for boys at proms and high-end bartenders. If you wear one where we’re headed, you’ll be mistaken for staff.)\n\nPartner is refusing to let the salesperson handle things and measures his own waist (why?!) but eventually he decides that he’s going to try on tuxes here. Great. I have never been shamed like that in public before, so I am very upset. Public arguments are tasteless and grossly unfair to the people around you. It’s a small shop, and the sales girls are desperately trying to avoid making eye contact with me. I. Am. MORTIFIED. When the salesman leaves, I let my partner know that the plan never changed, we’re here to do exactly what we discussed and I don’t understand why he yelled at me! I tell him that I’m super embarrassed and I would like to call myself an Uber and leave.\n\nThis sets him off. Instead of calling me an Uber, getting his tux settled, and meeting me back at home, he gathers his things and storms out. He insists that he doesn’t want to talk about it, so we’ve been living in silence for 12 hours. He still doesn’t have a tux. We leave on Sunday. Wtf happened? Am I the asshole?",

My girlfriend Anna and I have been together for about a year and a half and friends for about three years now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the past few months following our one year anniversary Anna and I have been talking about our relationship and the issues we see that do/may cause issues between her and I. The biggest issue that she has voiced and that we've both talked about with each other is that she deals with anxiety and jealousy due to my past and my sexual lifestyle before her and I started dating. Fast forward to today where I decided to talk to the people I talk to who were once in any type of sexual relationship with me. There were only three people, one of them being Kaylee, and the other two were very understanding and wished me the best of luck in my relationship with Anna. When I talked to Kaylee about it she accused me of being a shitty friend and that she'd never do something like that to any of the people she cared about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my question is, is it wrong of me to make this decision?

Approximately 30% of the house we would need painted. I have tried to get him to paint the rest of the house several times and I get blown off (not in a good way) or he just forgets. \n\nSo on to the water heater; just before he moved out last year, I bought a new water heater and he helped me install it, which was awesome. For some reason now, the water heater has developed a slow leak, and I am getting a replacement and I would rather not pay a plumber's rate so I think to myself \"I bet my friend would help, since he owes me.\" I asked him about it yesterday, he said he needed to check to see if he had plans, and just now he offered to help...if I paid him.\n\nI'm going to try not to put any more bias in the story, but I feel like I'm done being his friend at this point.

He gets 30 minutes to use it, then I get 30, then he does, etc. The problem is that recently my brother has been playing games on it with his friends more frequently and because of that he asks for an extension on the 30 minutes. For example, he wants 5 more minutes and because of that I want 10 minutes added to my next 30 minutes. Essentially i get double the amount he gets for his extension. My brother thinks i should just get the same amount of minutes he gets and because of this he calls me greedy. Am i the asshole",

      "description": "I have a large tree just inside the fence line of my front yard and, being a tree, it drops leaves now and then. On two separate occasions I’ve spotted very obvious piles of leaves sat on my side of the fence. On the other side of the fence: my neighbour’s spotless concrete driveway.   \n\nIt’s obvious he’s collecting them all and dumping them over the fence along with whatever else happens to be around, like old cabinetry bits and bobs (screws, brackets etc from his work). The first time I was a bit amused and hadn’t lived here long, but it appears to be becoming a regular thing.   \n\nI can’t even begin to understand why this guy thinks he has the right to do this, and why he’d go to all the effort of collecting the leaves to *not* just put them in the bin. It seems spiteful and lazy. And this is suburbia, and we are lucky enough to be living in a leafy suburb. I *appreciate* my neighbours’ trees, even if I have to do a little sweeping and clambering on the roof now and then. I even get free lemons from my neighbour’s tree.  \n\nSo, I obviously want this leafy business to stop. There’s a few ways to go about it, but I’m thinking I might start by depositing a few leaves on his side of the fence. It’s not in his face, just a little nudge to say “hey, I know what you’re doing and it needs to stop”. I know that the mature and respectful thing to do would be to have a conversation about it, but I don’t imagine I’m going to agree with his logic and he hasn’t exactly been respectful to me thus far.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts people?

This post is not about drugs so feel free to flame your anti drug rhetoric but it’ll fall on deaf ears. ***\n\nI overheard my sister last night telling one of my friends some really personal things about me. Specifically, she was telling him that I have a drug problem and that I can’t make it through a day of work without doing drugs. This is very far from the truth. I know why she said it and it is because a week or so ago I stated to her that I really needed some stimulants if I were to make it through the next couple of days at work. Reason being, I had to spend the last days taking care of my sister in the hospital and when she got home sleeping not at all. But whatever, even if I had a heinous drug problem, and she is scared and worried about me, she should not be gossiping about it to my friend. She has a tendency to bring the private into the public. Especially when she gets drunk, she will start fights with me and yell things that should really really be sad and discussed in private. My only response to her is that we need to continue that talk later in private. \n\nTo teach her how it feels, I kind of want to tell the new guy she has been seeing that she loves getting high on meth and fucking. Or something like that. Not true but she has done meth so true enough right? \n\nI’m pretty sure this would be an asshole move so I was hoping you guys could reaffirm this and suggest an alternative route. ",

      "description": "Not sure if this is the right sub for this but here's some background:\n\nGrowing up, my father and I weren't that close. My earliest childhood memories consists of him being drunk all the time, occasionally yelling at my mom and him passed out on the couch. He refused to financially support my mother and I and eventually left us when I was around 5 years old.\n\nOver the years, my father would often attempt to contact me, and at such a young age, I would always refuse (though my mom encourages me to atleast give him a chance) because he could never get along with my mom, and to me, that was a huge deal breaker. I can't be friends with my father if he can't be friends with my mom.\n\nIn my teenage years, I gave him a chance since I'm close with his brothers, parents but not my father himself (strange, right?). My father and I would often see each other a few times a month. We catched up a bit; he told me about his new job, how my grandparents are doing, etc. and my father mentioned that he was seeing another woman, and I was cool with that. I genuinely wanted him to be happy.\n\nOne day, I absent-mindedly scrolled through his Facebook profile until I noticed him posting pictures with a baby. I'm almost never on Facebook (waste of time) and since my father and I were talking regularly at this point, I was very puzzled. I stalked him some more until the realization hits, he had a kid and didn't even bother to bring it up at all. I later learned that the kid was barely a year old and my father and I reconnected about two years ago.\n\nNow this might not be a big deal to others but to me, it is. Don't get me wrong, I'm totally okay with both of my parents dating other people and moving on, but the fact that my father didn't even bother to bring this up was a shock to me since we've just started to have (or the very least repair) our relationship as father-daughter. It's inconsiderate for him to not mention that he was having a child, I would've been supportive. Finding out I have a one year old half-sister through Facebook stalking made me doubt about reconnecting with him.\n\nI asked him about it and he just responded so casually, like it wasn't a big deal at all, which greatly offended me. To make things worse, apparently my half-sister has a serious disease and later on, he started asking me for money to support himself, his new girl and his child. I couldn't believe the audacity. I didn't give him any money and at the moment, I'm refusing to talk to him or even bother being in my half-sister's life in the future. \n\nTLDR; My father was a deadbeat dad, left my mother and I at a young age, finally reconnected, had a child with someone, never told me, found out through Facebook stalking and now I'm debating if I'm an ass for refusing to talk to him.",

      "description": "Hello everyone, 21M here. I've considered myself a lifelong 'experimenter' when it comes to a lot of stuff. I feel this way because a lot of times when making a decision to do or not do something, you're faced with a lot of second hand info that is usually biased and extremely titled to one side. Not to mention, completely anecdotal. Take, for example, something like nofap. You have people saying 'it changed my life for the better, made me more productive, etc' but also people calling it useless garbage. And it's really hard to make a decision based on subjective, probably biased second hand anecdotal evidence. So when it comes to trying lots of stuff all these self-help gurus and all them suggest, I decided, 'fuck it, I'll try it for a while, and see if it works for me. If it does, great. If it doesn't, it doesn't.' Over the years I've done a lot and basically consider myself the human Guinea pig. \n\nSo far in life, I've done okay with girls. I'm not swimming in girls or anything, but I've had a few relationships. But as always, I'm curious if I can do better than okay. That's where trp comes in.\n\nAgain, trp is something very controversial, with people saying 'it's misogynistic shit' but also people saying 'it made my life so much better'. As I've said already, all of this is anecdotal, all of this is subjective, and in a lot of cases, ymmv. So I came to the same decision: there's no consensus whatsoever, so try it out and see what happens. \n\nIt ended up being a mixed bag. On the pro side the lifting, meditating, nofap (to an extent), and cold showers really helped. On the other hand the whole 'alpha' thing was pretty much bs. So I continued with the former, stopped the latter. \n\nRecently, I was on a forum (not reddit) with some people I know online, and I mentioned my experimenting over the years. I made a list of stuff I tried. It included everything from:\n\n- Speed reading \n\n- Nootropics \n\n- Intermittent fasting \n\n- Nofap\n\n- Polyphonic sleep\n\n- TRP\n\nEveryone zeroed in on the trp thing, and said I was a huge asshole for even considering it. They didn't really listen to my philosophy of basically just 'trying it out'.\n\nSo I'm not sure now. Aita?\n\n",

      "description": "Im in a theatre class and we are working on dramatic duets. I work with a girl in a dressing room because her ADHD causes us to have problems getting work done. We had a week to practice and memorize for it, and she wasn't memorized at all while i was. I didn't want to take an F on the grade, so after school we went back to the dressing room to help her memorize. We worked until people came in and she couldn't concentrate. I started telling them to leave. My close friend walked in and i told everyone to leave. He texted me later saying\n\n\"If you need people to leave, don't be an ass about it. (Friend) needed to talk to me privately, we didn't want to cause trouble. So thanks\"\n\nI responded with \n\n\"Maybe don't act like a 13 year old girl about it. I understand you're irritated and i didn't mean for it to come off as rude. Just text me next time and it's all good\"\n\nHe replied\n\n\"Maybe don't insult when you're trying to come to an understanding\"\n\nWe ended up hanging out and shrugging it off. I feel like it was just a miscommunication but my friends always tell me i can never admit when I'm wrong. I don't know if i am, but i want to know if i was in telling him to leave. I've already apologized about our conversation as he has as well. We were both TA there.",

      "description": "AITA for giving up on our friendship? (Didn't really know what to title this as there's a lot of things) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarting off with some background info on how it all started, yes it will be a long post.\n\nI'm male, important? Can be. Good to have included, I suppose.\n\nIt all began a few years ago, I had just started a new school and joined a new class. This class was just put together from two other ones, so there were some groups of friends already established. Anyways, there's this one girl in the class I really get an eye for. We end up dating for half a year before she ends it, saying she wants to focus more on school. Anyways, she's not really important to the story, just the background of it. So, we're broken up but still in the same group of friends, so kind of a weird situation but it works out as we were all going separate ways a couple of years later. That group of friends was sort of like two friend groups merged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 1 year go by and I've distanced myself a bit from the group of friends, but still staying close to the original group I hung out with. I start talking to the twin-sister of the girl I dated, and eventually we become best friends. We text almost every day, speak very often as well as meet up to talk and hang out. This goes on for about a year and we're still very good friends. She gets her first boyfriend and I am very excited for her as she's always been quite shy. That relationship ends up failing about a month or two later when she found out he was kind of an asshole. Didn't really see that one coming, but oh well. I support her and she moves on from him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight to a guy I knew to be an asshole, and I warn her as soon as I hear of the situation. Not even a week later I learn that she agreed to go on a date with this guy, and I am completely destroyed to figure that out. I let her know again that he's an asshole, have my sister explain it to her (the one who experienced this asshole first-hand) as well as telling her another time. I let her know that if she does go on that date, we won't be friends anymore. It's important to note throughout all this I let her know I am only saying and doing the things I am because I care for her.  The conversation comes to a natural end, though I can tell she's upset. Her sister (my ex) is furious and spams me with messages because her sister is now crying. Though the situation passes and we're still friends... \n\nI can't exactly remember everything very well, but I believe we continued our best-friendship as it had been before. Though it might have been a little shaky right in the aftermath. About half a year goes by and she gets another boyfriend. This is where our friendship started deteriorating. She replies less often, we have less calls and meet-ups. After a month it's almost impossible to get a response from her. From April til November of that year(2018) she barely responded - ever. \n\nSent her 3 messages between then and December. I honestly kind of forgot about her for a while due to a lot going on in my life, and her never responding. Speaking to a friend I actually learned that the boyfriend she got earlier that very year had ended just a few months later, the fact that she didn't even let me certainly didn't make things better. So in December I decided let's get this all sorted. I managed to get a reply, and we agreed to talk on a specific day. That fell through, but managed to get a new day set. I ended up being sick for a few days, including that, and was asleep while she was trying to contact me. I woke up and replied about 2-3 minutes after she had called for the last time and ended up getting no reply. I waited for about a week and without a reply I ended up removing her nickname in the chat (this is Facebook messenger, so it shows up in the chat almost as a normal message). And the next morning she sends me a message, saying \"Good morning\". I've yet to respond to it, and really am not sure if I want to pick it back up. \n\nHaving supported her and been there for her as best I could through the time we've been friends, it really sucked that she just stopped replying to me completely. I really needed her to be there for me this year, as I went through some pretty tough times. Her not being there and never responding to me didn't exactly make things better. I do understand it's not her fault if she's busy or this and that, but yeah, not really the main point of the post though I feel it can be relevant to some. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really care deeply for her. I do love her, but I'm not in love with her. We've been friends for a long time and it sucks that things have gone the way they have. But just from everything that's happened, I'm not sure if trying to make the friendship work is even the best thing to do. We've met on the bus 3-4 times and she has greeted me, but it's probably because pretending she didn't see me would be very awkward. We've only met on the bus because we've attended different schools for almost 3 years, and as I've explained we haven't met up since early 2018. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy attempt at a TL;DR: \n\nBest friend got boyfriend, stopped replying to me. I tried picking things back up after over half a year of almost no communication. Picking it back up fell through, I was sick and fell asleep. Replied 2 minutes after her call but got no reply. Removed her nickname a week later feeling like the friendship was over. She said \"Good morning\" the day after and I haven't replied. Been two weeks now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut let's wrap it up: if I just leave this friendship behind, without trying another time, am I the asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for blowing snow onto my neighbor's driveway after he removed part of our property line barrier?",
      "description": "Background: (Sorry, it's long and formatted from mobile.)\n\nI moved in nearly two years ago. The nextdoor neighbors never said two words to me. I was fine with that. We got along in our silent way.\n\nThen this past summer, both the man and the woman who live there finally introduced themselves to me. It soon became apparent why.\n\nThey began asking me (especially the man) about removing a line of mature cedar trees/shrubs that  grows on the property line between our two driveways.\n\nThe trees are something like these:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/v3n0Dz6\n\nI told them I'd think about it, expressing my concern that I needed to plow snow into those trees in the winter. \n\nYou see, my home has very little room for plowing snow off the driveway, and we live in a cold climate where one snowfall will accumulate on another and another… Basically you need to plan ahead for the big piles of snow that will form. And due to the shape of my driveway and placement of my home and garage, there is a large portion in the middle of the driveway that I normally plow into the tree line, using the snowblower to throw the snow fairly high so it will hit lots of cedar branches and fall to the ground without going through to the neighbor's driveway. The only way to avoid plowing into the trees would require me to laboriously plow and replow the same snow over many passes of the snowblower in order to shoot the snow into a big pile in the backyard (where I have already been piling snow from the back portion of the driveway).\n\nThe neighbor said he wanted the line of trees removed because the one on the end was shedding into his garage gutters. So I suggested he just remove the one on the end. He didn't seem to like that, so I asked what we'd replace the trees with once removed. He replied, \"Nothing.\" Hmm\n\nA few weeks later he approached me again about the trees. I reiterated the snow issue and again gave him the option to remove the tree on the end. He sort of shrugged it off. (Note that I never mentioned the issue of having a privacy hedge between our properties as I felt this might come across as rude, though it was also a big factor for me. I'm a female though, and sensitive to my privacy.)\n\nWell, fast forward to fall, and I come home to this neighbor standing in his truckbed taking a chainsaw to the branches on his side of the trees and dropping them in the truck. By the end of the day he had essentially shaved his side of the trees down to their trunks, cutting the branches off as high as he could reach. (Seems like he couldn't reach high enough to prevent the gutter shedding issue, but okay.) And no, those branches and the foliage on that side can never grow back from this.\n\nFollowing this shaving, the trees shed a LOT of dead brown evergreen leaf/needle things. I was afraid the trees might be dying. But they didn't. They just looked more sparse, both from the half-shave and the shedding.\n\nWell, folks. Now it's winter, and we've gotten a few good snowfalls in lately. Guess what happens when I snowblow the middle of the driveway? Yeah, it goes through the sparse trees and lands on the neighbor's driveway, just as was predicted. Not a lot of snow. Just enough that it's noticeable on his already-plowed driveway. But I think if we get a thicker snowfall sometime, he may get a pretty significant amount through the trees.\n\nI'm not going to lie. There's a part of me that feels it serves him right for refusing my offer and ruining those pretty trees. But I have not gone out of my way to prevent the snow going through the trees. I don't feel like spending an extra 10-20 minutes replowing the same snow into the backyard. All I've done to prevent it is aimed my snowblower higher up the trees in an attempt to hit the denser leaves. However, that just results in the wind blowing the snow back in my face. So that solution didn't last long. I could shovel by hand, but…that's kind of why I have a big gas-powered plow for my big driveway.\n\nAITA for not making an effort to plow without getting snow in his driveway? WIBTA if I do this when we get even deeper snowfalls?\n\nTLDR: Neighbor wants to cut down trees on property line that block me from plowing snow into his driveway. I say \"no,\" so he cuts all the branches off his side of the trees. Snow goes through anyway. AITA for not changing my snowplowing habits to accommodate the trimmed trees?",

My wife was angry with me, but I tried to convince her of my good intentions.\n\nMy SIL and her husband bought a new Apple MacBook Air the day before the new ones were announced with the long overdue upgrades. The new one is leaps and bounds better, and it was all over the web. I enjoy being caught up on computer news, so I knew this. I'd also understand if people don't read that, and she was very happy with her new, but old tech, laptop.\n\nSo because this wasn't a surprise gift, and they chose it together, I suggested they return it and pre-order the revised MacBook Air for whatever extra it may cost, so that they have a far superior machine that lasts longer.\n\nSo was it a dick move to say they made a mistake, and I should have kept my mouth shut? Or as rude as it felt, was it worth it to say something? They did end up getting the new one, and because I told them right away, they were easily within their return window.\n\nThanks for your opinion.

      "description": "So I've got a friend who I've been friends with for the better part of two years. Recently though, she's been extremely insistent upon me (and her followers) being extra supportive and enthusiastic about her original stories. She runs a massive fandom blog with over 5000 followers, and she threatens everyone with \"If you dont play into my fantasy then I wont write\". She hasnt really been writing for the fandom blog at all and has only been writing for her original stories, which is not the issue here but is still somewhat important. \n\nHere's the twist, she has Autism, OCD, PTSD, BPD, Bipolar Disorder, Depression, and Anxiety. Shes a fan of saying \"God had to nerf me or I'd be too powerful\".\n\nI recently went through a period where I stopped talking to her because I was tired of being her personal cheerleader and never receiving anything in return. She's talked endlessly about her stories and her characters, about her struggles and hardships, and during the entire thing, I listened and supported her, but she hasnt reciprocated.\n\nToday, I sent her a message telling her why I stopped talking to her, and it went like this\n\nMe: So, I know we haven't been talking much as of late, and I just want to kinda explain why I've been a bit more distant than usual. I'm not saying I dont want to be your friend anymore cause that's not the case, I think you're awesome, but I kinda feel like you only use me as a means to feel validated with your stories. I'm not saying I dont like them or that they're stupid, I just kinda feel like it's not an even balance between the two of us. I love your stories, I really do, but you arent the only one who enjoys sharing their ideas and I kinda feel like mine get swept under the rug sometimes. \nThat's kinda why I stopped talking, because I was a little hurt. I felt like I wasnt allowed to talk about anything except what you wanted to talk about, and I try to be an accommodating person, but that doesnt mean I'll let myself be a doormat. I still think you're a great person, and I still want to talk to you and help, but do you think you might at least be able to meet me halfway?\n\nHer: Sure, of course, whatever means you don't hate me. I'll never mention them again. I'll shut up for good.\n\nMe: Ok, calm down, I dont want you to misinterpret me. \n\nHer: I'm serious. I'll do whatever you want.\n\nMe: I dont want that though, I still want to be your friend, but all I'm asking is that you be a bit more considerate\n\nHer: Of course. I'm never considerate. It's my own stupid fault that everyone says this. No one ever tells me thank you, no one tells me I can shut up. I wont mention it again. I'm sorry.\n\nAt this point, I know I've given her a panic attack and I feel awful for it, but I also feel like shes trying to guilt trip me. I've bent over backwards multiple times to make her happy, I dont see why it's such a big deal to ask for something in return, but I still feel shitty. AITA?",

      "description": "I’m 18, female, British, and a grammar nazi tbh. \n\nSo I was having a conversation with my boyfriend and one of my friends just now, and I started telling them a little story that was fairly relevant to the conversation and was just meant to give them some context for my viewpoint within the debate we had gotten into. My little story went like this:\n“When I was in year ten I went to a party that was at my boyfriend’s best friend’s party...” \n\nMy friend started giving me weird looks for referring to my ex as my ‘boyfriend’, even though I had made it clear I was talking about the past and the story was told in the past tense. After the friend had left, my (current) boyfriend asked me to stop referring to my ex as my boyfriend, which I will do anyway in order to make him feel more comfortable.\nThe reason I referred to him as my boyfriend and not my ex is because I wanted to show that at the time he was not my ex. I’m an English student and I’m pretty sure if I’d said “in year ten I went to a party at my Ex’s best friends house” it would imply he was my ex at the time, which he wasn’t. \nSo, does my wanting to be grammatically correct make me the asshole? \nIf there are any people out there who know how to use correct grammar in a past tense anecdote whilst not referring to ex boyfriends as “boyfriend” it would be appreciated 😊 \n\nSide note, babe if you see this and the verdict is that I’m the asshole I give you permission to hold it against me lol xx ",

      "title": "AITA for sometimes refusing to do my chore?",
      "description": "For the background: i'm a physically disabled 19 year old and I live with my roommate, 21 and able bodied. Originally we would take turns with the chores (the 2 chores in question are the dishes and taking out the trash). So when she took out the trash, I would do the dishes, when she does the dishes I take out the trash. The problem was, she would get irritated at me for being too slow with the dishes or using up the hot water or generally not being done with the things she wanted by the time she wanted to cook. Why I mentioned I am physically disabled is because that's the reason I am slow with them, it wasn't on purpose. Poor coordination and weak legs, I had to stop earlier than most so I wouldn't collapse or break one of the dishes by dropping it.\n\nSo we came to an agreement she'd always always do the dishes if I always always take out the trash (since then, I've also taken on the responsibility of sweeping, mopping, and cleaning the counters though she'll do it on an occasion. The reason I've taken on these 3 additional tasks is because, \"dishes are so stressful. It's fair if you do more chores\"- most of the time, they're her dishes, not mine anyways).\n\nAnd I was fine with taking out the trash although at times it was painful because it was heavy, I have a disability, and it is a bit of a walk. The dumpster I have to take the trash bags to are a half of a block to a block away but, I'd get it done. However, there was 1 term &amp; condition. That I wouldn't take it out after night without her walking with me because I get really scared and paranoid being outside alone. \n\nThis was all fine and we worked like this for a while, until I returned from winter break (I spent half of December and a week of January outside the state with family). When I returned, I noticed that she would clean her room almost immediately after I took out the trash, causing the trash to be almost full if not completely full often the night of or day after taking out the trash. She would get upset at me if I complained though my complaining was because, as I said, it can be a bit painful, it's a long walk, and I had JUST taken out the trash the day before. I didn't want to do it again.\n\nI told her once when I was about to take out the trash and checked with her if her room was clean, thinking this could resolve things but instead she just snaps at me and tells me how clean her room is, is none of my concern. I think it is my concern because I have to take out her trash.\n\nI've also asked her several times to Not clean out her room immediately after I took out the trash so that I don't wake up and see it almost full after I had JUST taken it out. I told her if she wants to fill up a trashbag full of her trash, she can take it out herself. This didn't stop her either, except cause some arguments. Now she fills up plastic shopping bags and shoves it into the trash bag but it still fills it up to over half way full.\n\nShe also complains about the smell sometimes, but she's the one that is tossing in raw meat scraps usually a day or two after I take out the trash when its mostly empty (if it's stayed mostly empty). I rarely cook raw meat btw, because I don't have the energy, I live off of pasta, microwaveable meals, and sometimes a \"frozen meat entree\" whenever I have the money.\n\nSo this is where my question comes in.\n\nLast night she took out the trash because it was dark out and I hadn't done it; she got frustrated that it wasn't taken out and did it herself. Today its already full, barely any of the trash is mine, but I know she's expecting me to take it out today. I know if I take it out, I won't be standing my ground and that she will possibly yell at me BUT id be willing to do it tomorrow after classes.\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to take it out today?\n\nand AITA for refusing to take out the trash roughly a day or two after I had JUST taken it out, refusing only because she decided to fill it up after cleaning her room which I asked her to do, multiple times, before I take out the trash, not after?",

      "description": "So my sister works retail for the past year and half. She has been complaining that her boss doesn't allow them to take a 15 min break every 3 hours. There is a law in place that says she is allowed to take that break and my dad who is a manager at another retail store agreed her boss is in the wrong. Her argument is that her boss doesn't take the break so why should she. \n\nI have told her this over 10 times, take your break. But she constantly declines. At the same time she constantly complains that she isn't allowed to take her break. But this time at the dinner table she was complaining about it and I blurted out \"Its your right take advantage of it and take your break\". Although I was tough about it, my whole family got mad and said it's not right for me to treat her like that. Although I didn't tell her anything wrong, I never yelled at her or anything about this matter I just stated her right every time. \n\nWould really appreciate everybody's advice. Any kind of criticism is accepted. Thanks. ",

How I could make this or that formation or this or that enterprise where they're hiring for a better salary than mine.  The thing is, I love my job.

But, there's always these thoughts in the back of my head, making me feel wrong and stressed out for my family to not be supportive of my career choice. It's only a few dollars over the minimum salary, but at least I got 40 hours and a stable schedule with insurances. Plus I love the team there and honestly I'd hate to work in an enclosed space.

We dated for 7ish months, broke up because he didn’t really put in effort that I wanted from a boyfriend. We stayed friends because there wasn’t much fighting and we didn’t hate each other.\n\nFlash forward to shortly after, I started dating this guy (we’re still together now, he’s wonderful) and my ex started talking to another girl. We were happy for each other, there wasn’t jealousy or hostility. They had been going on dates and having sex and everything, but my ex said they were not officially dating. Of course I was like, that’s fine, I don’t care how you label your love life. However, the day of my birthday rolled around, instead of seeing me or calling me or texting me to wish me a happy birthday, he asked out that girl (he’s known me since we were 13/14, he knows my birthday, so he didn’t forget). He texted me and talked for hours about how he asked her out, but didn’t once say happy birthday.\n\nI ended up cutting him off because I didn’t want any petty ex drama and it really seemed like he was trying to start a fight over this, but maybe I’m just over thinking this.

      "description": "I live with my girlfriend and recently she's become obsessed with a particular series of novels.  She's on her phone pretty much 24/7 reading the books, on discord servers about the books, on tumblr blogs about the books, making memes about the books.  They're good books and I like them too, but I read much more slowly than she does and have only read 3 or 4 of them, and I'm currently working on a writing project which occupies most of the free time I would otherwise spend reading and I'm not really interested in trying to read them to keep up with her right now.  Additionally, I work a full-time job with a long commute and she's currently unemployed, so she has way more free time than me.\n\nI'm happy she's found something she likes so much, but she keeps constantly talking to me about them.  Such as telling me I need to read more of these books and asking me to read her fanfiction even though I don't really have much context to appreciate it.  Also, most of the time when we're together, she'll be on her phone and interrupt whatever I'm doing to read me a post or bit of a book she thinks is funny without much context.  I find being interrupted constantly extremely draining and our limited free time together is mostly just me nodding and pretending to laugh at things I'm not really interested in.  It's also a little disheartening because she doesn't really reciprocate sometimes and hasn't talked to me about what I'm writing, I'm not even sure she knows I'm working on something.\n\nWIBTA if I asked her to talk to me less about these books? It's not that I want her to not talk to me at all, or to stop talking to other people about these books.  There was one point at which we were going to the store together to get groceries and I asked her to leave her phone at home, because every time we did so she would spend it on her phone not helping me shop.  She still brought it and kept off it for a good while but eventually went back on it.  The period of time when she didn't have it on her was nice because we were actually talking to each other and doing stuff together.\n\nI'm also a little worried this obsession is going to distract her from her job search.  She is still helping with the bills from her savings and we're doing OK on money right now, so I'm not worried about that part of it, but she gets very frustrated with herself for not having a job in her field that uses her degree and she's been looking at grad school programs and she finds it intimidating. She is probably using this as a way of escapism to avoid thinking about it. Which I totally get, but WIBTA to point it out?",

My mom already told me her I’m going, despite me never agreeing to in the first place. I only see my aunt once every couple of years so I decided to ask her if it’d be alright if I didn’t attend her wedding and went to play in the game instead. I told her that soccer means a lot to me and that this game is really important. She told me she understood and said I had her blessing to go play and she wished me good luck. \n\nMy mom was pretty upset because apparently I wasn’t the only one skipping the wedding. Her brothers and their kids didn’t want to make the trip and her aunt couldn’t make it due to poor health. She also said that by me not showing up there was going to be a disproportionate number of girls to boys. She told me my aunt must’ve been pretty hurt by me asking to skip her wedding but she didn’t sound upset. She didn’t even know who I was, when I approached her she asked me “who’s kid are you?”. I will play no role at the wedding so I don’t think there’s a point of me being there when my aunt didn’t recognize me",

      "description": "So I think this story needs a little context. So I like this girl in our high school, she is in the same class as me and we we are very good mates. So over a video call I told her that I liked her and we decided to go on a date. It was a pretty nice date, I had a nice time anyway, and that was that. We had been messaging very often since then at which point I asked her if she wanted to go any further with the 'relationship'. As she had recently came out of a long-term relationship, she said she wasn't quite ready but she liked me too - which I accepted. I left it a little while and we continued messaging and voice calling most days until last night. Where she messaged me and said \"sorry for not messaging you I was at the cinema\". I received this message at midnight so I thought obviously her parents have been out with her all night or.... She went to the cinema with another guy. I asked her who she went with and she replied with \"someone\", at which point alarm bells started to ring. I called up some mates to help me out and to find out who this girl that I really like went to the cinema with and after several messages and me getting quite confused and upset about the whole situation we found out that she went out with a guy, from the grade above me. Is it just me or do people think that she should of just told me that she didn't want to take things any further rather than giving me a sense of false hope. And Am I The Asshole for getting upset about the situation?\n\n(I would be able to accept if she told me that she didn't like me and then went on a date but what confused me was that she said she liked me but didn't want to move on yet because of said previous relationship)",

This was the first contact I had received from her in the last 6 to 8 months.\n\n\nMy paternal aunt has only met my maternal nan a few times, and they have barely interacted with each other.\n\n\nI've recently had a strained relationship with my aunt due to her not attending my wedding in 2017, after saying she would and not informing me that she wasn't going to attend.\n\n\nThis hurt me because she is one of the only links I have to the paternal side of my family, which meant that we were very close.\n\n\nWhile I can understand that she would like to pay her respects to my nan, my paternal aunt only knows my immediate family, and I don't want to have to feel like I have to entertain her because she doesn't know anyone else attending the funeral.\n\n\nI appreciate the support she wishes to give, however I also have my maternal side that will require my support as I will theirs.\n\n\nI can understand why she wants to attend the funeral, however I will want and need to be able to be with my maternal family.\n\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting my aunt to attend the funeral?",

      "description": "Sorry if the formatting is terrible doing it on my phone.\n\nSome background...\n\nMy friend, let’s call her ‘B’ was planning on having a ‘going away’ party as she is moving to another state. She invited everyone in our friendship group except this other person I’m really close to, let’s call them ‘T’. \n\n‘T’ and ‘B’ used to be best friends but a lot of drama happened between the two of them, and they have settled for just being very cordial and polite with each other in person but each strongly dislikes the other. \n\nThe reason I suspect ‘B’ did not invite them is because they did not want to have to put up pleasantries with this person and wanted to leave the state without ever having to talk to her or see her again. \n\nT and I are very close, we’ve talked about really personal stuff, hang out together privately outside the group and so I consider us really good friends. She’s also massively helped with my social anxiety. \n\nA few nights ago,  someone wrote in our group chat (that has everyone in the friendship group) asking what time the party was on.  Having been through that awful feeling of knowing I’m not invited to something, I stressed to my partner how upsetting this would be for ‘T’  to see the message and that they deserved to be told in person - which prompted him to confront the guy who was apologetic and deleted it straight away before they saw it.\n\nLast night I was hanging out with ‘T’ when I decided I should tell them in person there was going to be a party and that everyone was invited except them. Understandably they were upset and worried people were turning against them and questioned their place in the group.  They then became really furious at ‘B’ and (not sure if this was a heat of the moment thing or not) exclaimed they were going to message them some pretty nasty stuff.\n\nI feel awful and terrified  that I may have potentially caused drama - I always try and keep information I hear about people to myself. I just knew last time I was in the same situation as ‘T’ I wish someone had the guts to tell me I wasn’t invited, instead of finding out in other ways.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "Sorry about the formatting, on mobile.\n\tThis has been happening over the past couple weeks, and I figured that it'd be good to post here, to allow complete strangers to judge me more objectively than people I know!  I was in a long distance relationship with a girl I had been talking to for the past four years. At first things were going great; we talked a lot, it seemed like we had many things in common. Around 3 months into the relationship though, we started drifting apart. Talking less often, and I also discovered that she does not enjoy many of the things my friends and I do for fun.\n\tI broke up with her in what was probably not the best way, basically saying I'm sorry, but I'm just not really feeling it anymore. She immediately started crying, sending me a bunch of texts within a couple hours, telling me how much she's crying in class, things like that.\n\tI then called, and we tried to figure things out. She kept telling me things I thought were completely unrealistic, like that one of us could come see the other once a month. (sidenote, we're in canada, and she's across the country. Flights from here to there cost around $650CAD.) She is 23F, I'm 23M; We are both in uni.\n\tWhile this was happening, I'd been talking to another girl, who was dating one of my friends at the time. I learned from her that over the course of their relationship, he had abused her rather often. While I'm normally a skeptical person, in this case I'd managed to verify with the friend in question, and skype logs.\nI'm sure you all can guess where this is going. I broke up with my long distance person, she broke up with my apparently abusive friend, we figured out we had more in common with each other than we did with our previous partners, we are now dating.\n\tI feel like a complete fucking asshole, and I really don't know what I should have done differently.",

      "description": "I’ve been staying with my sister and BIL for 9 mos as their live in nanny. I quit my job, put my things in storage and moved halfway across the country to do this. \n\nIt’s time for me to leave soon and I found out that on my last weekend here my sister is working all weekend. That’s fine, it’s work and not a shift she picked up. I told her I thought we would be doing a final family activity like brunch ( we make at home) or a trip to the mall (that was mostly a joke, but if we actually did that I would still be happy). So that weekend she’s busy working and I’ll be packing and leaving so there isn’t much time to hang out. \n\nThe Friday before that weekend she texts me and asked if I’m leaving that night. I said no, I have laundry and cleaning so I’ll probably be leaving Sunday (was planning on deep cleaning my room and bathroom when I had all my stuff out and washing linens). She proceeds to tell me that she has made plans with her friend after work Friday, just “for a couple hours”. I told her I wanted to have a family night before I left and she asked why I take things so personally and that if I wanted to make plans with her I should have asked. Her friend asked her so she made plans with her. She won’t be back until late evening, missing family dinner, then when she gets home needs to get cleaned up so we would have not much time until we are all exhausted and need to go to bed.  Her friend lives here and they will have many other opportunities To hang out\n\n I feel that I had made it clear that I wanted to spend time together when I asked about brunch. I didn’t think I would have to continually ask her availability and have her pen me in for a time. She has told me in the past that she pencils people in, that way she can change plans if something better comes along. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to have a family dinner and spend some time with my sister and BIL playing cards and chilling? Is this not a common courtesy when hosting someone at your house to have a last dinner/say farewell thanks for the good times?\n",

      "description": "So at the time I knew that friend for four months and we got along real well. I'd reckon we became one of eachothers' closest friends in that time. We'd text about 2 hours every day. In all honesty though, our friendship sort of began out of me getting her out of a controversial relationship. It sort of felt like she was just using me to get over him, but she still messaged me random things and talked to me about this and that and helped me if I ever seemed upset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward to late October and we're talking about the movie Venom. We get into an obviously fake argument (I can genuinely assure you that she knew it was fake and played along as well, but I'll get to that later). I'm going on about how the movie was terrible, and she's throwing all sorts of plus points to the movie and her fandom for both Eddie and Venom. At that point, I said \"Goodbye \\*full name\\*\" to her and then shut down my phone and went to bed. I've been known for taking jokes far--this has been something multiple of our mutual friends and her have brought up when the topic arises.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I get a text from a friend asking if I was mad at her because he said she seemed concerned about it. I message her about it and she acts very nonchalant about the whole thing, but then she says she thought I was being homophobic because I said goodbye when she mentioned Eddie and Venom dating. She then says she was \"like whatever\" (to quote) and was ready to drop me because she thought I was being homophobic (I got the opinion of my gay friend and he said that the conversation we had wasn't a valid reason for dropping me, but that's just one opinion). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I understand that you don't need to be friends with whoever you don't want to be friends with, but it really hurt that everything we had been through and done together in that time (which was actually quite a bit) was so readily forsaken. So I just said \"okay, good to know\" and then left it at that. Five days later she texted me and asked me if she'd look good in bangs (which she asked 5 other people), to which I said she wouldn't, but do what makes you happy. I'll admit I wasn't the most pleasant about it, but I wasn't downright rude or aggressive either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then we haven't said a word, 28 days later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for dropping her (at three friends' advices) because she was going to drop me?",

      "description": "There's a tl:dr; at the bottom, but I feel like you can't judge properly if you don't know the whole story.\n\nSo I (M23) have a sister (F21) and two brothers (M18) &amp; (M15). My sister is living on her own as am I, and my brothers are still living at home. But my sister keeps being messy and my parents don't know what to do about her. They messed up earlie and they're all in holes they can't get out of. My sister feels so alone, she feels like she doesn't have a place in our family. She doesn't feel included, and it saddens me when she tells me she's \"always the last to know\". But growing up, she used to either stay in her room or feel my dad's rage, but like I was like that too, but I'm trying to better things. Like my dad isn't like that anymore, and it's not easy for me to talk to our dad either.\n\nBut things between them are still very messy. My sister parties alot, and I know I can't blame her for living for life, because even tho her grades are being messy, I have to trust her to be able to prioritize. We both went to high schools that were hard to get in, so I know she's capable. Everyone else is blaming her for partying and drinking too much. Even my girlfriend \"dude, she's drinks on a monday, tuesday and wednesday!\" I want to believe she's not failing school because she parties. But that she knows when she has time to party. I know it won't help if her brother keeps telling her to not party, like that's why she never speaks to our parents.\n\nLike formally she's renting a 200.000$ condo our parents own. But having loud parties are annoying surrounding inhabitants and long story short she could be kicked out and my parents could lose all the money they've invested in the condo. She doesn't realise how lucky she is to have parents who support her economically like that is the narrative of our family.\n\nAnd in my dream it was Christmas and my mom opened a gift from her and it was an old mp3 with probably some nostalgic tunes, but it wasn't even working and my mom got sad, and then she said \"look, she doesn't even appreciate the gift. It works, It doesn't always work, but when it works it works.\" And it just broke my heart and I couldn't hold back the tears. It's 7am here in Germany but I keep reflecting. The whole dream is such an analogy. My sister pointing out my parent's emotional absence. Like they're not seeing the emotional part of her gift but focusing on the economical value of her gift. The gift's poor condition which is representing her popr condition. I never cry, I somehow only cry after I have dreams. The last time was 9 years ago when I lost her in a dream. That I was in line to cry about, but am I for this? I fear I might cry like this in fromt of her when we're both returning home for an event next week.\n\ntl:dr; I had a dream in which my sister did something bad and it hurt our mom, and I cried because the action reflects how she's messing up her life.",

      "description": "I'm currently working at a small company, not for long, somewhere around a year now. The work environment is really nice, I'm quite good friends with almost everyone. Problem is it doesn't pay that good (not that bad either, a little below average) and it's unlikely to change in predictable future. That's not the biggest deal-breaker for me tho. The problem is that company is struggling right now, there are new possible projects, but if they fail (there is a good chance for that) we are screwed. I took that gamble before with another company and it backfired horribly, so I'm not eager to take the risk again.\n\nRecently I got a possible opportunity from a bigger, more stable company with high-ish chance for bigger paycheck.\n\nMy dilemma is that if I take it, it will probably ruin some future projects. I'm not THAT important that my leave will instantly collapse the company, but losing 25% of your workforce is going to hurt no matter what. It will inevitably lower the chances of company surviving.\n\nWhat do you think guys, would I be an asshole to my coworkers if I took the job?",

      "description": "Me (F,21) and my S.O (M,23) had been together for almost a year, living together for six months. On the day we had to move out, I had work around 2pm, so we got up earlyish to finish packing. Essentially I had two big bags of clothes and nothing else. My boyfriend has an insanely heavy bed, a big set of drawers, about as tall as I am, two heavy side cabinets, and just a shit ton of tubs full of god knows what. (The large Tupperware kind where you can only carry one at once. )\n\nI spend most of the morning cleaning his drawers because they have mold on them, (we lived in a shitty flat.) While he tries to get rid of useless things in his tubs. He tells me one of his mates are happy to help us move, who is quite strong by the way, so i said great, he can come help us with the big stuff and we can both take down the rest.\n\nS.O says no, heavy stuff first, because we will get tired doing all the little stuff and won't want to do the big stuff and i should just help him. So we go get the trailer and he gets very stressed driving a trailer because there are no brakelights on the trailer. On the way there he's driving quite crazy and fast. He brakes quickly about a meter in front of two school kids while they were walking on a footpath jolting me forwards quite intensely. At this point I'm mad at him for driving recklessly because he can be mad at me but I don't want him killing anyone cause of moving.\n\nWe essentially grab the trailer but argue the whole way home. I say I'd still rather his friend did the bed as it's heavy and his friend is kind of a pervert and i don't want him touching bags with my underwear in them. I'm not strong, nor am i strongwilled, so after some debate i just start taking the mattress with him down the stairs to the trailer. After all, I was sleeping on it too, so i think the bed is fair enough. The stairs from our flat to the trailer is very concretey and about 50 steps down. We do the mattress okay, but when we take the bed base down, i trip and it gives me a huge fright. My S.O insists I'm lazy, and trying to get out of helping. At this point its near 1pm and I have work soon, and I start crying from stress. I realize I won't be able to help him at his new place, and he won't care if I'm late for work. We get the bed base down and into the trailer, and then we have to grab a large washing machine.\n\nI say no, i want to take my clothes. He says I'm not trying. I say i never promised I'd help him. He says it's the right thing to do. And I said you can't make me. He says don't make this a consent thing just do it, and this kind of talk goes on and on while I'm crying. Eventually i just grab the side of my clothes bag, and saying please can we just..?\n\nAnd he slams the lid of the machine shut, making a huge noise, he punches it, goes down the hall, punches the wall, and then slams the door to where our bedroom was. I have about an hour til work, so i grab my stuff and uber to work early. Our friend helps with the rest of the stuff while I'm at work except my clothes are thrown across the floor. Apparently he came out to apologize and when he saw I was gone, he flipped again.\n\nThis was months ago, and we've since patched things up but it does mill about in my brain whether I was the asshole he said I was. Also, i found this subreddit a few days ago and fell in love with it. The best ones are where you're not sure who's the asshole. Most people make it sound like their s.o is the asshole for validation however. Not sure if pointing this out makes me an exemption or an example. For context, he was also going through a lot at the time - he has never (bar once) hit or punched anything again in anger.\n\nTLDR: I know a perfect girlfriend would just help. I feel awful for bailing but I did have work. But I gave up earlier than that because I was exhausted and I felt pushed to my limits. I am not very fit. I wish I had the choice. I also feel like if my S.O told me they didn't want to do something, I'd hear out their reasons and not respond aggressively. But it would be frustrating to be abandoned in the middle of a stressful process. I'd love to say I'd done nothing wrong, but I'm not sure. Would love to hear your responses.",

      "description": "I honestly dont know how to give the story without giving out too much information. Which is why this is a throwaway.\n\nThis started a good maybe 3 years ago when my bff at the time got with a man and things took off way too fast. She blocked nearly 80% of her friend circle during the first year of the relationship because they questioned her decesions. Since then she got the babies she was desperate for, twins. Everything was going decently except for the man she was with was verbally and financially abusive. Moving her from house to house because he couldn't hold down a job, and never helped with the kiddos. I honestly at one point was scared for her life, he was falling off the edge. Myself, her other last friend, and family all begged her to leave him and move back in with her parents, who had the room for them, and welcomed her with open arms. She finally did when they lost the house again. Her man moved in with the family too. He eventually got kicked out of the house for not helping with bills. \n\nI want to say that during their relationship they also cancelled 2 weddings and she found him messaging multiple women during her extremely harsh pregnancy and after the babies were born.\n\nI also want to point out that during this entire thing my s/o was diagnosed with a rare cancer and is still fighting it to this day. It's been 2 years now. She knows this. I'm slowly piecing our lives back together by going back to a full time job.\n\nThese past few months have been rough for the both of us. She found out she was pregnant again, same baby daddy. I honestly am so saddened for her. She picked up and moved back with him. Everytime she messages me it's always about her babies (which is fine), her own medical problems (her body is tearing itself up.), or about baby daddy. I have slowly been thinning the chord between us only because I cant stand the same bitching but not seeing her try to get out of the situation she is in. Here's a screenshot of the last conversation we had:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/O0MuBmU\n\nI know I probably missed a lot of information and am more than happy to answer questions.\n\n\nTl;dr bff and I are both going through life changing events but I dont have the time or energy to be her crutch, especially when she keeps putting herself in these situations and not wanting to better herself.\n\nShe blocked me after the conversation posted above.

We used to be quite close and would support each other through difficult time. The event in question occured maybe 1-2 years after university. She and I lived in different towns at this stage and we agreed that we would spend some time around New Years at her holiday home. \n\nI brought my partner with me (30M) with her consent. She had her family over at that time (so mum, dad, brothers, etc), her partner (24M) and her housemate (24F). Several others were also present but not quite important to the story. \n\nHer holiday home is situated in a beach area. I have mentioned it several times that my partner is not that great at swimming (he can float and take care of himself in shallow water but he is not particularly confident in deep water). No issue arose so off we went to her holiday home. \n\nFirst day we (me and my partner, along with her and her partner) at the beach, enjoying the hot sun and water (you may now notice that I live in the Southern Hemisphere). It was great and it was fun. She then mentioned that the next day she and her partner would have to pick up her housemate from the airport (as she flew in) and she will be gone at most several hours. Obviously my partner and I felt a bit awkward since we did not know her family very well (but they were extremely kind) but we thought we could spend the second day just sightseeing and going to the beach again just us two. So second day, off she went to pick up her housemate. \"Several hours\" turned into the whole day  - while I was irritated I understood that they might want to stop at several places along the way.\n\nThis is the first time I met the housemate - I really tried to talk to her and get to know her but I had a feeling she did not like me very much from the way she brushed me off. I don't want to sound too high-schooly since we were adults but it also felt like she did not like that we were there with my friend (as in, she wanted to be the centre of attention). I am a pretty quiet person so I couldn't care about attention, and I slowly allowed her the limelight because to be honest, I kind of just wanted to spend time with my friend since we haven't seen each other for a while and I did not really care for the competition.\n\nThird day - we all (including her brothers) went to a swimming place (like a creek area not a beach). I let her and her housemate, her brothers, and her partner have fun in the deeper end while I hang out with my partner at the shallower end. We weren't being downers - we laughed at their dives and encouraged them to have their own fun as we were actually enjoying ourselves as well. That night, we were playing cards against humanity and I thought we were all having fun. But maybe sometime during I must have annoyed my friend because she all of the sudden went off to do something else (with her housemate following her) while I continued to play the game with everyone else. \n\nFourth day - during the morning, my friend came up to me and told me that her, her housemate, and her partner wanted to go on their boat. The conversation goes something like this:\n\n&gt;Her: Hey, we wanted to go on the boat today. Sorry but it can only take 3 people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Oh ok I guess... so I'm guessing it's just you, \\[your housemate\\] and \\[your partner\\]?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Her: Yeah, are you and \\[my partner\\] have any plans today then? You can totally go to the beach again  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: I guess we could. I'm sure we will find something we can do. \n\nFor some reason, I was extremely angry at this point. I quite literally came all the way down to her place to see her and spend time with her as friends. But I felt ditched and quite frankly if I wanted to just spend time with my partner I WOULD JUST GO WITH HIM ELSEWHERE. It could also be the compouding effect of everything else that happened - feeling left out because of her housemate's attitude, her ditching me on the second day for the whole day, and me feeling quite out of place with her family members (I'm really shy and while I can hold conversations I don't generally like to be with people I don't really know that well). Also just as a background: I always try to make plans with her when she's in my town (she goes often because her partner lives in my town) and she would normally cancel (myriad reasons). This may have also fueled my anger slightly. \n\nShe may have ditched me and my partner because of his swimming issue - valid reason but in my mind, I would never ditch someone like that. I would try to actually find activities that we could all do together, but I guess what I would have done in her position is not really that relevant. \n\nI talked with my partner and we decided that we want to go home (it's within driving distance for us). However, I felt bad for her family's hospitality to us (they were really kind and did not charge us for staying with them and fed us) so we bought them an expensive bottle of champagne and some more BBQ type food for everyone as a thank you. I gave these to her mum while my friend was out on the boat, we then gathered our things and we left without saying goodbye to my friend. \n\nShe tried calling that night, and I eventually told her that I was back home (I kept it civil, I didn't call her names or even express my anger at her). We have not talked since then (this was 2017-2018 new years), and this has been on my mind a lot lately. I guess I want to know if I'm the person in the wrong for not reaching out because of this. ",

      "description": "Ex and I met in undergrad and dated for 3 years before breaking up about 1.5 years ago. We remained friends talking every couple of days (hooked up maybe once a month as well) but it was clear that we were not dating anymore which we made clear to our friends and parents. I met a nice girl through a co-worker and we hit it off after a few weeks and I asked her out. The next day I texted my ex that I was seeing my new gf and that we shouldn't talk anymore and she got upset and demanded to know why when we remained friends long after we had broken up. I told her that I didn't want to put my gf through all the BS associated with SO's still talking to their ex'es and causing unnecessary drama regarding trust issues and whatnot, especially since we were friends with benefits. Ex says that she would obviously stop having sex with me when either of us found a new partner but essentially ghosting the other person is an asshole move. I kind of get where she's coming from because you're not really \"friends\" if it can end abruptly but at the same time I feel like I've heard of too many situations (admittedly a lot from Reddit itself) where ex'es involved in a new relationship just leads to too many trust issues and insecurities. What do you think?",

      "description": "Throwaway because this situation sucks. \n\nOne day I randomly mentioned to my Uncle and Aunt that I would love to visit [exotic location] where they live and hang out with them. I said I’d probably only be able to stop by for a day on a cruise. They said 1 day is too short and I should come stay for a couple weeks. They also generously offered to pay for my ticket (money is no concern for them). Internally I was thinking, wow this kind of stuff never happens for me!\n\nSo today I fly out, get to their house for the first time ever and it’s a mess. I try not to judge because not everyone wants to be a minimalist but every surface is covered with newspapers, books, papers and miscellaneous broken crap. For example there is a broken under seat suitcase on their coffee table. Wtf. Overall it’s a bit grimy and generally unclean. Lunch is ready on the stove but it’s uncovered with little flies and the stove is covered in bits of old food. I gag a bit and mentally decide to stick salads for the next two weeks. My room is the neatest space, with a few boxes and an overflowing closet. \n\nI spend the day at the beach and come back to their place tonight. As we’re eating dinner a roach runs into the kitchen. They casually continue eating but I jump up out of my seat and start freaking out. They tell me it’s silly that I’m afraid because I’m so much bigger than a roach. Also this is part and parcel of living in [exotic location]. I cringe but continue eating not to be rude. Then while we’re in the living room another roach appears and a mouse runs from under the fridge and starts eating the dogs dinner. I scream and jump up on the couch. They start chuckling that I’m overreacting because there are mice and roaches everywhere.  My Uncle feels bad for me and tries to get me to calm down. \n\nI want to leave ASAP but my Uncle is SO happy to have me here and has been telling everyone I came to visit. He would be hurt if I leave early. I have a splitting headache, can’t sleep and I don’t know what to do. \n\nTl;dr- Uncle and Aunt fly me out to stay at their home in [exotic location] for free. Their house is dirty with roaches and a mouse. I want to GTFO ASAP. \n\nAITA for wanting to leave ASAP?\n\n",

      "description": "So basically I've had this friend for a few years and we used to be really close. I considered him one of my best friends, and to this day I feel fairly confident that I was on the higher end of his friend list also. \n\nFast forward to early last year and he suddenly basically cuts me off. Doesn't try to talk to me in school, won't text me, and only answers my texts in short replies. This lasted for a year and I had no idea wtf I ever did to make him treat me this way. There was no fight, I didn't remember doing anything wrong, and I didn't even feel right confronting him because I tried to chalk it up to \"I guess people drift apart???\" Even though I felt that wasn't what happened. To be honest, this fucked me up mentally because I kept going back and forth blaming myself and trying to figure out what I ever did to deserve it, until eventually my therapist convinced me to confront him. I did, and his reasoning was a bunch of vague stuff and then he said he felt bad because he used me to cover up his sexuality and homework answers? (The bisexuality thing was us fake dating with no false ideas going on on either side. The only thing I had a false impression of was that I thought he was out of the closet already and he said he was trying to get a girl to stop pursuing him. I give all my friends homework answers so there was literally no reason for him to feel bad. Idk). Anyway he says he wants to be friends again and I say yeah sure. \n\nThis is where I question AITA because I basically expected everything to go back to the way things were. And they sort of almost did, but I've realized it was because I was doing everything to act that way. I would text him, invite him to events, initiate pretty much all the interactions. He approached me first on 2 occasions. Once, ironically, for homework answers, and once to accept some money I offered him (both of these were my suggestions, so he's not a jerk for accepting by any means).  Other than that, it's all been me. I confronted him again on how sketchy this seems, and his excuse was that he just \"doesn't text\" and \"doesn't see me much\" (we have 1 class and a free period together). I realize I have expectations of him when I shouldn't, but at the end of the day I see how he acts with the friends he cares about. He hugs them, invites them to do stuff, and generally gives a shit about them. And that's how he used to act with me but not anymore. AITA for expecting the same level of friendship as before? For expecting to be treated like his current friends? ",

      "description": "Long story short, Amazon has started using Amazon Logistics to deliver packages in my area. I live on the third floor of a sprawling apartment complex which pretty much means its about a 1 in 10 chance that the Amazon Logistics driver follows the delivery instructions and leaves my packages to my enclosed front door. The other 9 in 10 times they deliver my packages to \"reception\" or \"mail room\" about a block away. I get why they do this, it's obviously much easier to deliver the 10 or so packages that my apartment complex receives in a given day to a central location than it is to follow delivery instructions. However, as someone who works longer hours than what the reception is open for, it often means it is often 4+ days until I can pick up the package from the reception if it gets delivered there. I understand there are Amazon Lockers where you can pick items up but not everything I order is eligible to be shipped to one (they have size and weight restrictions) and I don't drive directly past one of my way to work. The closest one would add about a 5-minute detour to my commute. UPS and FedEx can manage to deliver packages to my door (often because they are forced to because they deliver the packages after the reception closes). USPS has always been lazy and delivered them to reception.\n\nI have asked Amazon nicely 3 times to ensure my delivery address contains instructions to deliver to my door and Amazon has confirmed that it does. Amazon Logistics has confirmed their drivers are receiving the instructions and \"clicking through them according to the timestamps.\" AITA for expecting Amazon to honor the instructions given to them at the time of purchase and requesting compensation when they are wilfully ignored? I have got the customer service dance down to a well-rehearsed 4-minute routine which is quicker and more financially beneficial than using a locker.\n\nHere's a history of my recent orders and compensation:\n\n* 4/1 $7.61 order with a full refund\n* 3/29 $11.99 order with $15 credit\n* 3/23 $59.97 order delivered to a different address with no problem\n* 3/23 $35.20 order with a full refund\n* 3/17 $10.99 order with a full refund",

      "description": "A bit long, TLDR at the bottom.\n\nA little bit of context, I am a very straight forward person who says what I mean without second thoughts (so essentially filterless - I know this is a problem and I actively work on biting my tongue). Regardless, my gf is a self-prescribed “people pleaser” except is seems to me that she just constantly tries to go the path of least resistance.\n\nSo lately my gf will do things that if reciprocated I feel would highly offend her. The latest example happened recently. \n\nI had a friend and his gf coming into town and we talked about all of us hanging out. The day before my friend comes into town she tells me her friend from out of town is coming in and that she wants to spend time with her and their hs friends, nbd. But my gf says that they are planning on going to a bar near where I live and I say that I’ll see if I can convince my friend and his gf to go. At first they don’t want to but after a few drinks they’re down for a night out so I tell my gf we’re going to the bar they’ll be at.\n\nI told her we got to the bar and were hanging out waiting for her and her friends. After a while, she tells me that she can’t come because her friends don’t want to go to the bar (she told me in the first place it was her friends idea to go to the bar I was at) and that she couldn’t possibly convince a whole group to go to the bar they were originally planning on going to.\n\nShe showed up for a few minutes later but promptly left because of her friends.\n\nI was happy she came, but also upset that this is a continuing pattern.\n\nAITA for wanting my gf to keep her word/spend time with me when she says she will?\n\nTLDR; GF seems to have trouble keeping her word with me and it feels like she doesn’t prioritize our relationship based on her actions of having no backbone to tell her friends she wants to be with her bf.",

      "description": "So sorry in advance, this post will probably get pretty long.\n\nY sus roommate \nJ my roommate that is my friend \nS cool roommates girlfriend \n\nI live in an apartment with two other guys. (Y and J) We all have our own room/bathroom but share a living room and kitchen area. \n\nY is of legal age to buy alcohol so occasionally J and I will ask him to pick up some items for us. Y is always down to do it and we usually try to find a way to compensate him. This all goes well until one day J decides to let Y use a whole foods gift card to buy alcohol, this is where things get complicated. I was not present for when things went down and only know what happened through what I’ve been told by both Y and J. \n\nFrom my understanding, J and Y arrive at whole foods with J’s girlfriend (S) in her car. Y goes inside and buys all the booze with the gift card. They come back to the apartment and realize the card is missing. \n\nThis card is the main source of J’s food money and had 3 or 4 hundred dollars on it. \n\nY says that he handed the card to someone in the car but J and S both disagree. From what we know, the card had to have been used in the store, so this means it would have 1) been left in the store 2) dropped between the store and the car 3) dropped in S’s car or 4) someone held onto it. \n\n1 the store was called and the card was never found\n\n2 he was holding a lot of stuff he had just purchased in his hands so i feel like the natural thing to do would be minimize the things carried. Putting away phone, wallet, valuable gift card... my guess is it ended up in his pocket\n\n3 J and S tore up the car looking for the card and were unsuccessful\n\n and before anything is said about S taking it, J and I both know her well and agree that it wouldn’t be like her to do something like that\n\n4 i hate that this seems the most logical but i feel like he was the one in most control of the card\n\nNothing really came of this because J and I really don’t want to just accuse him without any real evidence. He hangs out with people who steal and has been stolen from by a methed out “friend” but I don’t believe that’s in any way a reason to believe he would.\n\nMonths had gone by but last night Y and I had a few too many together and I told him about J and I’s suspicions. This led to him constantly saying how he would never and that he has always been good with recipts, which is great and J and I both really appreciate it! But that doesn’t excuse the circumstances of this specific event. He kept trying to get me to tell him how much was on the card, which I obviously lied and said I didn’t know. After that he was talking to me about how he couldn’t afford it now but wanted to set up a way to start paying him back for the money he lost on the card. This sounds great but it only raises my suspicion! I could be overthinking this but it seems like a guilty conscience to me. He probably had no idea how much was on there. I honestly don’t know that if he had taken it he would actually admit it.\n\nI know this isnt my business directly but i would really like to know if someone i live with is okay with stealing from other roommates.\n\nBottom line is, i still don’t believe him.\n\nThank you for reading my rant, more than anything im confused but id love to get input\n\n",

      "description": "AITA for wanting to get to the bottom of what has happened.\n\nMy 10 year old sister recently got two rabbits about 2 months ago and has been obsessed with them. About a week ago I was home alone (I’m a 16 year old male) when my neighbour knocked on the door and asked me to come with her in an almost annoyed  tone. Her dog which poops in our yard regularly had killed one of her rabbits. She said that her dog had brought it to her and that she would buy a new one but she didn’t apologise or even seem upset or at least sorry about it. \n\nIt’s worth noting that this woman and her husband are very weird people . When my family first moved into our house the first interaction my dad had with them was was watching their dog take a dump in the middle of the street  where we live, asking the woman  if she was going to pick it up, and her responding by saying it wasn’t her dog after they both had just seen it happen.\n\nSo just today my family got back from a overnight stay at a family friends house and found out that the other rabbit gone missing. The strange thing about it was that there was no holes or anyway that the rabbit could of got out of its fenced in area and when this rabbit has escaped in the past it has always stayed in our yard.  We also found more dog poop in our yard. \nMy theory is that her dog killed this rabbit and she found out but it was to awkward for her to tell us so she basically hid the rabbits body from us. \n\nSo at about midnight tonight It was driving me insane (my little sister was crushed) so I went over to her house and jumped the fence into her backyard to go check her bins for the rabbit (when her dog killed the first rabbit she said she would chuck it away until I told her not to because I knew my sister would want to bury it next to our old dog). I successfully got into their backyard and was about to hop down from a high ledge I was on when their dog woke up and started growling and barking at me. I jumped back over the fence before it attacked me. \n\nSo am I the asshole for trespassing or is it justified since all the evidence suggests that it was the same people.",

They wake up out of mid sleep and I ask them if it’s okay if people come over to hangout. This is  1:30 am. They said yeah sure idc. I said are you sure you don’t mind ? They said sure we’ll just go in the bedroom. My friends are sleepy so they both go in my bedroom and don’t sleep at all. Awake and not saying hi to anyone, being secluded from everyone else. I asked if they wanted to come hangout since they can’t sleep and they say no. We were being loud In the living room and smoking. (They are against smoking) After maybe 30 min they decide to leave my apt. I tried to keep the party going between two friend groups but it didn’t work out. I feel really bad because the people that came over were loud. They couldn’t rest and they didn’t want to hangout and drink. Am I the asshole for allowing more people to come over ? I didn’t intend for it to happen like this but I feel bad and idk if I should apologize or not. When they left they didn’t seem upset they were obviously uncomfortable. What should I do? ",

It got to the point where she smelled like ass and I mean BADLY!\n\nMy sister (I have 2) lived in the other part of the country so she had no idea what was happening other than the fact my other sister and I kept her up to date on our mother's degrading mental situation. But for some reason, I consider it human nature, she never really absorbed what we were telling her. She seemed to think we were making a bit of it up, that our mother wasn't as bad as we were making it sound.\n\nSo one day she finally comes to visit my mother. She was in a non-care home because she couldn't live alone anymore. I mean non-care in the sense that my mother still had to do some every day things but didn't have to cook or wash clothes. That was all taken care of for her.\n\nI also have to say during this time my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAnyways, my sister comes to town and I take her to visit our mother. My mother doesn't recognize my sister since she hasn't been around to visit. She came to our father's funeral but it was quite a few years that she's been around. \n\nSo my mother says she has to go to the washroom. My sister seems to think \"if she can go to the bathroom then her mind isn't as bad as my family has been telling me\". And she says it out loud to me.\n\nLong story short, my mother didn't raise the lid and sat down directly onto the lid. She proceeded to take a massive shit while sitting down. \n\nMy sister finally goes into the bathroom to see what's taking so long and comes to tell me what  our mother did.\n\nI kind of laughed and told her she had to clean up our mother and the toilet seat since she thought my sister and I were exaggerating to her for the past while.\n\nI have to say my sister took it well and did what she was asked. She also told me she should have believed us when we told her how bad our mother went downhill.\n\nI ask AITA because I could have easily helped her clean up our mother but didn't out of anger and spite.",

      "description": "So confusing title sorry, but I am getting married in October, I’ve been engaged for 2 years now and have been planning for my bridesmaids robes for getting ready because cute photos and blah blah blah. \n\n\nMy best friend and co MoH (she shares the title with my sister because my sister is 2,000 miles away so they are splitting the responsibilities) is getting married in June, she got engaged last December. We are both in each other’s wedding parties and we share 2 bridesmaids. She informed me she is also doing the robe thing because that’s what everyone does. It’s cute and something they can reuse. \n\n\nHowever I’ve talked to one of our joint bridesmaids and she said she has no need for two robes. So I am thinking about asking the other bride if I can just get the same robes for her and my sister so the other two can just reuse those. Obviously I’ll get them other bridesmaids gift, champagne glasses with their names or something otherwise equal cute and photographable (just trying to be transparent). I’m having them pick their own dresses in the color that matches the scheme so they can rewear the dress since they are paying for them (something I cleared with them when I asked them and they are all so fine with) so I want to get them something! \n\n\nWould I be an asshole or even tacky if I did this?

      "description": "So, for many, many years I've been avoiding driving, but now I'm twenty three, and I have a wife who drives me around, and a newborn son. But it goes deeper than that.\n\nI have a lazy eye, which pretty much cuts off 85% of my vision on the right side, while even my \"good\" eye is pretty shitty. Besides that I just have really bad, diagnosed anxiety, so I tend to over-hype menial things in my brain. Because of these, I've always just been iffy on driving.\n\nIn addition to that, any time I've asked my parents, or my siblings to help teach me, they always give me false promises, and then just kind of don't follow through. And then they want me to go and pay 300 dollars for driving school, which would be fine if I had that much money just laying around. The real kicker is that it's always my family demanding I learn to drive anyway.\n\nSo, I kind of just don't really want to learn to drive anymore because if I'm being honest I'm just not totally comfortable with it, and no one seems to really want to help me learn, despite everyone else constantly judging me about it.\n\n(I'm sorry if this is jumbled or weird, I'm just kind of frustrated after a fun round of my family shitting on me for not being able to drive.)",

      "description": "Well this is my very first reddit post and I’m on mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues. \n\nMy boyfriend(23m) and I(23f) have been together for seven months now. We both know we are meant to be with each other and we both know we are going to get married one day. He’s my best friend and a truly wonderful and kind man. \n\nWell last night we got on the topic of engagement rings. I know I can be picky when it comes to jewelry and I think that if I want something specific then I should communicate that. So I told him that I like 3 stone rings in a simple classic setting, round or oval cut, and jokingly said, “and if the stone ain’t a carat, i don’t want it.” 100% joking with him. I also mentioned I really don’t like marquise cut diamond rings. I don’t care about brands and I like getting the most bang for my buck so I told him if he wants to get it from a pawn shop or used or whatever is most financially feasible then that’s fine with me. I just want a certain style and quality. Then I remembered that his grandmother had offered to let him pick one of her extra rings for me (so sweet) when he’s ready to propose. So I told him I think he should take advantage of a free diamond ring and take her up on the offer.\n\nNow the engagement ring that she wears is a massive marquise cut rock set in a pretty typical 70’s retro setting. It’s not my style at all. So I told him that he should just pick the ring with the largest diamond and if I didn’t like the cut or setting we could always have that redone because it’s cheaper than buying a new diamond ring. \n\nWell he got very offended. Lo and behold he clarified that his grandmother had actually offered him one specific ring, not a choice of multiple rings, and guess what...it’s a 3 stone marquise...and i just told him I don’t like marquise diamonds. He felt like I had, “shit all over the ring” but I didn’t mean to! He said I was acting ungrateful because his grandmother is offering us a gift and that he understands there’s a “social status” component to engagement rings but essentially I’m acting like anything less than what I want is unacceptable. \n\nI really tried to broach the subject with clear communication. If he proposed to me with nothing but a flower I would say yes in a heartbeat. Marriage isn’t about the ring and I could give a shit about any social status crap. I would just like the ring I’m going to wear for literally the rest of my life to be something I like and I feel like I should be able to tell him what my style is. The fact that I accidentally insulted the ring his grandmother offered was a big oops but what if I don’t like it? Am I supposed to pretend that I like it because it’s a gift from her?\n\nLike I said, I love him so much and I feel bad that I hurt his feelings. If I am genuinely in the wrong then I want to make amends and learn from it. So I’m asking y’all, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Recently I introduced a friend (Sam) of mine to a wider friend group. Sam is much older than us and very much a showman/dominant personality and likes to be centre of attention and win people over. People either love him (usually quieter people) or hate him (other louder people). I genuinely like him one on one (when it feels like we're being honest with each other) but I'm realising I can't be around him in a group situation for longer than a couple of hours without finding him exhausting. When I first met him, I considered him charming but now that's worn off, I find him quite insincerely and manipulative at times. I do understand why other new people immediately take a shine to him but it makes me uneasy watching him play the room. \n\nSo one of my other friends took a shine to him when they met, so much that (after a couple of hours) he asked us privately on the group WhatsApp chat if anyone would mind if he invited Sam to the birthday event planned this weekend. \n\nI replied honestly and said that I did because whilst he was a friend, I found him a bit much. And that it was his call but I'd probably skip it if he came (seriously, I know I wouldn't enjoy the evening at all). Friend was fine about that and nothing more was said &amp; the question deleted. \n\nI have discussed with Sam before about maybe giving people a bit more of a chance to speak in groups, and did again this evening but was told that was 'my opinion' - which it is, but also makes me pretty certain that I don't want this person permanently embedded in my friendship group if I can help it. \n\nSo.. am I the asshole? (I'm mainly curious at what people think. Whether I am or not, I'll own it; I feel relieved for having spoken up)\n\n",

I also suggested that I would sign over some of the ownership so that he wouldn't feel like he was putting money in and getting nothing out.\n\nHe said that I couldn't ask someone to do that for me as it was too much, and that's something only a married person would be willing to do. This made me think he's not invested in our relationship and doesnt care much about my dreams! \n\nConsidering before moving in with me he was renting and that's paying someone else's mortgage with no gain, I don't see how doing it for someone you love is worse? \n\nAlso for bonus lols...

      "description": "Me and my friend met about 2 years ago, around the time my dad passed away. He helped me get through it, and we hang(ed) out all the time. As time passed, I noticed him copying some of the things I do, and him doing some odd things behind my back. An example of this is when I put my glasses on him as a joke, and (jokingly) said that they looked good on him. After that, he started taking pictures with his dad’s glasses, even though he doesn’t ACTUALLY need them. That one joke became a huge thing for him, and it makes me feel kinda weird that he took it so far. \n\nAnother example is when I started boxing again. Sometimes I would tell him how my training or sparring was, what my coach was like, etc., and one day out of the blue he just says “I think I’m gonna do boxing.” I supported it, as it seemed like something for him to do. It was only until recently that I realized he did this with EVERYTHING I talk about. The first week we met, he heard me talking to my SO about drumming, and then a couple days later he says “I just bought a drumset, can you teach me?”\n\nThat’s the gist of the “copying” thing, moving on. Another issue I’ve encountered is how he’ll agree with me on EVERYTHING, and sometimes I point it out. Within a day or two, he begins to counter every opinion I have, no matter how small. Then when I ask about it, he always just responds “I don’t know.” Most times I just apologize and move on. Recently, he’s doing some very odd things that out of everything send up red flags. We’ll be walking in the park talking, and during a conversation he’ll walk behind me and just stay there for a full 15 minutes before I turn around to make sure he’s still there. Everytime I do, he just quickly shifts his eyes to the ground.\n\nHe’s just been making me really uncomfortable recently.\n\nI feel really petty about all of this, but it’s been happening more and more now and it’s beginning to interfere with our friendship. Idk if it’s just me.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: My friend copies me, and acts really strangely around me, and it’s been bothering me recently",

      "description": "So I’m at the airport bar drinking a little just as a pre-text.\n\nMy husband had extra vacation hours that were set to expire by the end of the year. He works in accounting so this week was the best week for him to take off. Unfortunately I could only take today until Monday off, and I’ve been away from our home for the last three weeks so we both miss each other quite a bit. But I encouraged him to go down to a popular city where his family lives and would be a layover for us anyway. I planned it, bought the tickets and everything. So he was here from Saturday until now, and I just landed a few hours ago.\n\nHe hasn’t even dropped off his car at the rental yet. The city we’re in has pretty terrible traffic but I was sort of hoping he had the time management to sort of predict that you know? He was talking up getting some dinner and drinks before our flight out and I’m just a little disappointed that it’s probably not going to happen because he is pretty late. He didn’t even really think about clearing security :( It is a domestic flight and I know he might have been hanging out with his cousin, but it just sort of stings that I planned this whole vacation (plus his vacation away from me) and he is now just texting me if I already got his boarding ticket for him.\n\nTLDR; planned vacation for husband and I where husband is already in city and I had to fly down to city as layover. AITA for expecting him to already be here or at least have thought about the obstacles it took to be here when I land?",

Yesterday it was time to just stop fretting about it and go in and get somethin. I was super nervous going in, and I said hi to the guy at the counter and asked them what kind of coffee they had, and he went and listed all the types and ended with \"and then there's just the regular coffee\". I didn't really understand the other types he was saying so I just asked for a regular. \n\nWhen I pull out cash to pay (the total we just over the dollar mark), then he says he doesn't have any change and goes off for a few minutes. When he comes back I come back to the register and don't really know what to say while he takes like 30 seconds making like 99 cents change, even pulling some coins out of the tip jar. I felt like a huge asshole. Then he kind of gives me a stink eye and starts coughing as he walks away.\n\nI have no idea why, but I feel like I wasn't nice enough somehow and made them uncomfortable. AITA?",

      "description": "So here's the situation, I haven't seen my friend for well over 10 (because of distance) years and he decided to invite me to his baby shower. I just recently moved kind of closer to him, so heading to it wouldn't be an issue. The problem I'm having is that if I did go, I wouldn't be able to be myself because my friend does a total 180 when he's with his wife. \n\nHis wife is the type of person he has to hide his hobbies from and if I bring it up or go into detail, it might cause problems in their relationship. Our hobbies include video games, anime, MMO's, and various japanese things. Though his wife is strictly against them and they argue a lot about it. (Just a little back story about my friends situation)\n\nAlso, there's the fact that he told me that his gf would throw a fit / not like me if I didn't bring a gift. Money isn't really an issue and I know you're supposed to bring gifts for such an occasion, but to outright say she wouldn't like me if I didn't bring \"x gift\" sounds kind of a rude thing to say.\n\nPart of the reason is that the anxiety of being around a bunch of people I don't know (mainly her family) and with her attitude, will cause uncomfortable situation.\n\nWhat's eating away at me though is he considers me family and I do as well, but if we can't be natural with one another, is it worth putting us in such a situation? I feel the repercussions of me not showing up might be more light, than if something happened at the event and I caused discourse by bringing up a memory from the past (like an event or something, that he didn't tell his wife).\n\nSo in summary AITA for not going and just saying that I am unable to make it?  (I'd still send a gift, it just wouldn't be in person).\n\n",

We do everything together, have all the same interests, and have so many reasons to stay together. But we’re getting older. Getting older is expensive. Retirement and healthcare costs are going to start coming in. I have a tenured job, healthcare, and retirement, so I’m pretty set for my future. But he’s not. He has a high school education has been working since he was 13, but has no savings, retirement, healthcare, or opportunity to move up in his job. While the romantic side of society says that money doesn’t matter when it comes to love… as we’re getting older I’m having more and more anxiety about our future together. He can be added to my healthcare, but I’ll be paying the deductible, I won’t be able to afford his retirement, and I’m not willing to carry both of us the rest of our lives. We already live right above the poverty line, and it’s damn exhausting to keep our heads above water. I don’t want to live like this for the rest of my life, but I also don’t want to lose my best friend. He has made multiple promises to find something more stable, but in 6 years nothing has happened. \n\nAITA if I give him the expectation that if he doesn’t get a sustainable job - including healthcare, benefits, and retirement- that I need to go?",

Throughout this time she’s graduated with a doctoral degree, went through a residency, got a job, etc. Also through all of this she has complained, incessantly, about anything and everything. She hated her residency, she hates her job, etc. I complain about my own job, too, so I can understand, but it was honestly all day, everyday.\n\nRecently, she had a baby with a guy she knew for about 2-3 months? Since she got pregnant and had the baby, the complaining has gotten 10x worse, and it’s harder to hold my tongue. She doesn’t like something the baby daddy did, she doesn’t like his family, etc. She’s sent me video of her family fighting with the baby screaming in the background. It’s just exhausting because I’m expected to give emotional support and advice what seems like 24 hours a day. If I have any sort of issue that I complain about, she brushes it off.\n\nAnyway, onto the wedding thing. We’re going to a mutual friend’s wedding in May and I feel like I have to continue to be civil until then, because I don’t want to ruin said friend’s wedding with any awkwardness. I just really want to end the friendship, but have no idea what to do since I have to see her in person soon. Would I be the asshole if I just kept things civil then cut off contact? ",

      "title": "AITA for trying to be more independent from my mother?",
      "description": "So this is coming off a recent conversation and a growing conflict I've had with my mother. Recently I feel like I've matured quite a lot and I'm wanting to start being a lot more independent. I'm 26 years old, I've just started turning a lot of things around in my life, losing weight, improving my mental health, and getting into a new relationship where communication has been absolutely fantastic. I'm embarking on serious plans to hit the ground running in 2019 in my career, and I feel like I am finally in the right mindset to make it happen. \n\nI'll try to give a cliffsnotes summary of some important info my relationship with my mom: She was never a helicopter parent, but about as close as you could get. She would do just about everything for us growing up. My brother and I were almost never asked to do chores, other than keeping our rooms clean (and for the record, our rooms were NOT kept clean). I remember that dynamic continuing all the way up to adulthood. Looking back it was almost like I was being picked up after without even knowing it.\n\nSo fastforwarding to the present moment:\n\nMy mom has done my taxes every year for as long as I can remember. And as a way of me wanting to be more independent, I asked her if she could send me previous returns and I would do them myself this time. I figured it would be great to finally start learning the adult shit I need to learn and I also thought she would appreciate me actually taking the initiative instead of just having her do them. But instead she got very quiet.\n\nAt first she said it was fine and she'd send me what I need. Then she asked me again a couple months later if I needed any help figuring it out. And I said I would let her know.  And again a month or so after that. And again. And it kept going until I eventually couldn't take it any more, until today, when I asked her directly if there was any problem. She insisted there wasn't but she had really uncomfortable body language, so I asked her if she was okay. She continued to insist she was fine, but eventually she told me that she didn't understand why I wouldn't want her help. She also asked if I wanted to do my own taxes because I have an issue with \"the idea of my mom doing things for me\". I got the sense that she was hurt that I wanted to take a more independent approach to this, and that she was also anxious of a lot of things she worried I might miss if she didn't teach me.\n\nI mainly want to do my own taxes because, well, they're my taxes. She continued to say that it was fine that I wanted to do that but kept giving body language that showed she was very uncomfortable.\n\nEventually, she said that she felt that there were some things that she was worried I might miss if I just took them and started doing them myself, so she wanted to go through things with me, just to make sure I knew. I felt really relieved because she finally told me how she felt, and I asked her why she didn't just say that in the first place, rather than keep asking me the same thing over and over. She said \"she didn't know how to say it this way\", i.e. she didn't know how to express how she felt.\n\nSo I feel really conflicted. I feel like on one I gave into what my mom wanted again so she could feel less anxious. On the other I feel like it's just the right thing to do is to play the good son and let her show me what she wants to show me, even if I would rather it be done another way.\n\nI think there is a lot about this dynamic that isn't about the taxes, but rather other things that are buried between us. There's a monumental amount of stuff that I want to address with her eventually regarding the way me and my brother were brought up that led to both of us being very poor at communication and caused us to struggle in our relationships and personal development for a long time. \n\nWhen I talk with her now, having gone through serious education on proper communication, alarm bells start ringing. She gives off so many signs of discomfort, but adamantly insists that nothing is wrong. Eventually she might admit that there is an isse, but it takes honestly a solid 20 minutes of heart to heart conversation before we can start to get to the core of the issue. It's exhausting for us both and I wish it didn't take so much time and effort to get to where she actually expresses how she feels about something.\n\nI feel like I might be the asshole because my expectations are too high with regard to her communication, or because I'm subconsciously bringing in old stuff from childhood when I talk to her, or because I'm pushing the issue too hard and making her uncomfortable. Hopefully this is enough info to go off of. I feel like I'm being careful and considerate of my mother's feelings, but am I the asshole?",

I didn't join in, but I didn't say anything in response because I was stuck with them for the rest of the night and didn't want to cause problems.\n\nSo, this happened years ago. I was leaving work and saw these two girls (I always refer to them as hitchhikers) sitting outside in the cold and I offered them a ride home. On the ride we ended up all chatting and we all kinda got along so we ended up getting food and hanging out a handful of times over the course of a couple weeks. Neither of them had vehicles so I always did the driving. Well one day we went to dinner and I don't remember how it came up, but shortly after we ordered my bestfriend was brought up and the hitchhikers just started talking really bad about her and saying some pretty rude stuff. I didn't join in or say she was my best friend. I didn't want to say anything about it because we still had food on the way and I was there ride home. I was stuck with them so I didn't want it to be awkward. I just waited for the subject to change and got on with the night. \nAfter dinner I asked my bestfriend if she knew the hitchhikers and mentioned it to her.\nShe asked what I did and I said nothing and explained. She got really offended that I didn't defend her at all and felt 100% betrayed. That was the end of our friendship. I kept asking her if we could talk about it but she just kept saying there was nothing to talk about.\nAITA?",

Our conversations became dry and werent any fun. He stopped listening to what i had to say and made faulse promises of change. All this went on for 3 months of me crying too much over him, and all around being unhappy. So we broke up.

      "title": "AITA for dating someone else after promising to come back to a girl?",
      "description": "I was starting as a freshman in high school, basically fresh out of middle school and I had no idea how relationships worked or anything like that. However, being a dumb and curious freshman, I decided I should jump right into dating. I started talking with this one girl enough to the point where we started dating. \n\nI didn’t tell my parents about this, because I was unsure of how they would react to me having a girlfriend. I didn’t want to date a girl then have to break up with her a day later because my parents said no. At no point did I think it was a good idea to ask my parents before we started dating for some reason. This ended unfortunately in my demise as my parents eventually found out and forced me to break up with her. \n\nThis left us pretty depressed since we really felt a connection with each other we never experienced with someone else. Anyways I got my phone and most of my privileges taken away for a good amount of time for lying to my parents. I was also not allowed to speak to this girl until I was pretty much over her and had no romantic feelings for her. Of course, being dumb teens who didn’t know better, we decided to proceed to lie again and get back together once I regained my privileges. We pretty much made a promise to each other to get back together later on. This promise was later broken. \n\nFast forward to the point where I am completely unrestricted, I hit her up to see if we could catch up on the time we were away from each other. From inspection of her social media profiles, she had a date written all over her bios with a heart next to it. A date that was only weeks after we first broke up. I confront her about this and she responds with,  “he helped me through tough times” and “no one could replace you, but...” that type of stuff. She had found a boyfriend during the time I was stripped of my privileges. I was mildly infuriated about this since we made a promise to each other, but we carried on and continued to be friends. My thought process was that you can’t expect feelings for someone to remain after you don’t interact with them for a while, so I got over it not too long after.\n\nFast forward a couple months or so, my parents decide I should be able to have a girlfriend as long as I don’t hide anything from them and I still prioritize school. I was a little upset since they could have said this months before and it would have saved me from tears. At this point my ex girlfriend was still dating another guy, so I didn’t try to get back with her. Some time later, I start dating another girl, one that my parents liked. We kept our relationship pretty lowkey to avoid drama and stuff like that, but our parents knew and were fine with it. \n\nDays later, and I mean DAYS later, I find out that my ex had broken up with her boyfriend because she had cheated on him (cheating at age 15, I know). She then approached me for what at first glance seemed like support and comfort. I delivered on this, considering I didn’t want to be a shitty person and we were still pretty cool with each other. I didn’t exactly agree with her cheating, but I supported her regardless as she seemed like she understood the mistake she made and didn’t want to repeat it. As we continue to talk, she brings up that old promise we made to each other a while back that she had broken. She had wanted to get back with me once again. Please keep in mind that this was the same day she broke up with someone because she cheated on them. I declined and explained to her that I had been in a relationship already. She then went on rambling about “but we made a promise to each other” and “you should’ve told me you were in a relationship”. She seemed to have forgotten the fact that she had broken the promise first. We go back and forth, and it ends with her calling me an asshole and me calling her a whore. \n\nDays after that, all of her friends started giving me dirty looks and started going up to me to call me a dickhead. My food at lunch was spat in because she was friends with a student cafeteria worker. I was constantly harassed when I was by myself to the point where I had to make sure I had a friend by me at all times. I didn’t want to approach the staff because at the end of the day I wanted to avoid drama, and I thought that it would eventually go away over time. Also I called her a whore still so that could’ve gotten me in trouble as well lmao. \n\nI don’t know. I feel like I was sort of an ass to her, because at the end of the day she was a really nice and caring person who made a some mistakes, albeit some really stupid ones but mistakes that I had thought she might have learned from. I also hurt her pretty bad when the first break up happened, and she probably feels like shit considering I’m happy with another girl and she is left lonely. I never got to hear her side of the story but I’d think that her friends are supporting her for a reason. What do you think reddit?",

      "title": "AITA for not appreciating my birthday gift?",
      "description": "On mobile, very sorry for any formatting issues.\n\nSo for context: I’m -15- 16, I live with my mom and visit my dad every other weekend. This last year I’ve had an increasingly tense relationship with my dad, I feel like he is being overbearing and he thinks I should be more responsible and social. He tends to say he wishes I would be more open and honest with him, but it’s difficult since I can’t argue my view as well as he can and usually end up feeling like shit. It’s a bit more complicated than that, but I’d prefer not to get into the specifics of our dynamic. He got me a MacBook last year for my birthday, but it didn’t work and said he would replace it(but still hasn’t). \n\nSo, my 16th birthday was last week, and this weekend I went to my dad’s house to celebrate. On Friday, my dad had said he thought I would really like it. When I asked him if it was a new computer, he said I already have one, referring to the desktop that is not mine and I can only use for max four days out of a month. \n\nSo today was when I opened my presents and, still being an absolute child, was super excited to see what he had gotten me. Mind you, I figured it wasn’t going to be a computer because of the chat we had had Friday. However, I was still extremely disappointed to see that I had received a Snuggie. And not just any Snuggie, but the same one (albeit with a different color) he had gotten me for Christmas, not even two months ago. I know I looked disappointed, cause my dad asked if I liked it. I knew I had to say yes, since my stepmother was sitting right next to me and she’s really sensitive. In fact, during Christmas my dad had said to just act like I liked my gifts even if I didn’t. So I smiled and said “yeah, I do like the blue.” And just hung around until I could talk to my dad alone. \n\nSo, I had a little while to think about why, specifically, I don’t like this gift. \n1. I already have one. I don’t really need another one, except maybe for convenience of not taking it back and forth to my dads house. \n2. It’s passive aggressive. My other Snuggie had been at my moms house for a while. I hadn’t even been using it, just forgot to bring it back to my dads. I feel like getting me another Snuggie is just him passive aggressively telling me to keep his gifts at his house. \n3. It’s unthoughtful. I think that, by getting just a copy/paste of my Christmas gift, it shows that my dad didn’t really want to put any effort into finding something else I’d enjoy. It seems like he was really banking on the fact that I liked the gift the first time, so why not get another one? \n4. It wasn’t really relevant to me. I like having a blanket with a hood, sure, but I really think gifts should be a way to show that you really know and care about someone, not just an obligation to buy something. If it had been slightly more relevant, maybe. For example, I had told him that I wished the Snuggie had arm holes, so I could play on the computer without having chilly arms. I think that would have been a more relevant gift than the same thing as Christmas. \nHaving these reasons, I felt like a badass and was kind of excited to share my thoughts with my dad.\n\nWhile my dad drove me home, he asked me if I actually liked my gift, as I had been a little “off” since after dinner. I answered honestly, no, I don’t like it. It feels lazy on your part to get me the same gift as Christmas and I wish I had gotten something more thoughtful. He seemed really hurt and I said I’m sorry, but that’s how I feel. \nHe starts telling me that the concept of not appreciating a gift is so foreign to him, because he grew up needing to get food stamps or go to soup kitchens, and implying,  but not directly stating, that I should be grateful for getting anything. I think this is unreasonable, since we’re probably more of a middle class family and can probably afford gifts, especially since I prefer homemade, thoughtful gifts anyway. I didn’t say that though. \nHe also said that he and my stepmother had actually puta lot of thought into getting me another Snuggie, since they knew I had one at my mom’s house and they wanted me to be comfortable at their house as well. I think this was more of a selfish thing, but I’m biased. I think they just want to make sure they see me using my gift. \nHe brought up the whole “It’s the thought that counts” thing but I still wasn’t convinced it took a whole lot of thought to get the same thing as Christmas. I said that it doesn’t just matter that someone is giving the gift, it also matters how thoughtful and personal the gift is. I said the Snuggie wasn’t very personal and didn’t seem very thoughtful, and that was pretty disappointing to me. \nOf course I was feeling attacked (unironically) by the part about being ungrateful, and started crying there. I know, teenagers and their silly emotions. This is usually the trend when I have a conversation with my dad, and I can’t tell if I’m faking it for attention, or if I can’t take anyone criticizing me. Overall he definitely won the conversation, but was he right? Before talking to him I thought I was definitely NTA, but now I’m not really sure. Am I the ungrateful asshole?",

      "description": "So basically, my friend and I met because we both dated the same guy (she dated him first, whereas I dated him on and off for years). The day after the last time I broke up with him, I found out he was trans. I suspect he was trying to piss me off for the last month of our relationship so I would break up with him.\n\nI sat on the info for a while (two months?), and then it came up in conversation with my friend. Neither of us had spoken to him in months (me more recently since we had dated) so I figured it was probably safe-ish to tell her since last I heard he was coming out to his friends and family within days anyway, and tbh neither of us really cared about him enough to gossip to outsiders about him anymore.\n\nAt this point, we had already agreed that he was a narcissist who only ever wanted attention. He was constantly lying to both of us about how he'd lost this job or that job or gotten kicked out and it was conveniently never his fault (although his stories NEVER lined up). He also spun some story to me about how he didn't know how the sexts I found got onto his phone. He never saw them come in so someone must have hacked his phone. She got an equally stupid lie from him when she caught him cheating.\n\nA few weeks later, we both got messages from him saying he wanted to talk. I didn't want any of his shit so I just said \"I already know you're trans. Leave me alone please. FYI, [friend] knows too.\" I basically told him I didn't want to get dragged into his dishonest crap again so I had no interest in speaking to him about anything ever.\n\nHe got really mad at me for telling her, but tbh it was kinda just a \"huh. Kay\" conversation for both of us and then we went back to exchanging memes. And we honestly never thought we'd ever hear from him again. In fact, I *told* him I never wanted to hear from him again EVER because he told me that my depression when we first met was something he \"forgave\" me for - wtf? If he had even just said \"I forgave you for the things you said/did\" then ok cuz I admit to being a real jerk sometimes but the fact that he needed to forgive me for being depressed? That sounded like more manipulative bullshit to me. Like \"look how amazing I am because blah\".\n\nAnyway. I'll concede that maybe it wasn't the nicest thing to do, but under the circumstances (not expecting to hear from him again, thinking he already came out to those who mattered, etc), was what I did really *that* horrible?",

      "description": "My (20f) friendship with this girl (19f) was complicated. We were at school together for 7 years and she was my best friend on and off during that time. Sometimes we were inseparable, other times she would bitch about me behind my back and spread rumours about me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer sister died when she was 17. I did everything I could to help her. I talked to her every day, didn’t push to visit her but when she was ready and wanted me I was there. I took her gifts, tried to distract her a little, talked to her like normal and tried not to pussyfoot around her like everybody else. We drifted apart not long after and I figured it was because she needed time with her family to heal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, 18 months later she claimed that everything I did for her was for my own gain. She called me selfish and told me she never wanted to speak to me again. She also had a go at me for spreading it around when she had told me not to tell anyone (which isn’t true, I told only one person and that was after the rest of our friends had already been told). My feelings were extremely hurt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn response I wrote a letter. I explained why I did each of the things that I did and that that I was genuinely trying to do my best to support her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause I was upset, I let my emotions get the better of me and in the very last paragraph I told her that her sister dying didn’t mean that the world revolves around her, that it didn’t give her the right to treat those around her like shit and just expect us to lay down and take it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that day I start getting messages from loads of people. Messages telling me that I am a horrible, vile person, that nobody is ever going to love me, that I’m a psycho, an attention seeker, that the world would be better off without me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out she had taken the last paragraph of the letter and posted it online with her own context to make it look like I had said those things just because I was sore that she didn’t want to hang out with me anymore. Everybody saw and believed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was an entire thread of tweets dedicated to hating on/sharing personal information about me, edited pictures of my face circulating group chats and people I thought were my friends turning against me. Everybody in my home town hates me now and I can’t go home (I’m at uni) without receiving disgusted looks and whispers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was almost a year ago\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI texted her for the first time since today. I asked whether she would be willing to meet, as I’d like the chance to apologise and make things right. I have no interest in being her friend, I just want to move on, and thought that if I could talk to her about it maybe id be able to make a start on doing that. She read it and ignored me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the real question here is am I the asshole? This last year I have thought about it so often that I’ve begun to believe everything these people think of me is true. Is it?",

After realising this, I decided that it was wise to keep things as a friendship with this girl. I love talking to her, we talk for hours by texting but, in school, she barely talks to me. It can get awkward cuz she's really pretty and for some reason I try not to look at her and I think by the time I get the courage to do so she doesn't wanna look at me cuz she thinks I'm trying to ignore her. Idk, I get really shy sometimes, and she does too. \nRecently, she got on offer from Oxford university. I'm really happy for her, everyone was crowding around her and congratulating her. There were some friends that she went up to herself to tell. I wish I was one of them, I just wanted to tell her how proud of her I was cuz she's been through a lot. Thing is, I want to be ok with things not being my way. I don't know how I can make myself strong enough to not get affected by these little things in such a pathetic way.",

      "description": "So a little backstory, this person was my best friend since we were children. Last year we ended up getting into a relationship which was a complete disaster due to a mistake I made. Eventually this mistake, being that I lied to them about being happy, made them start to act abusive towards me. By that I mean they'd constantly put me down, call me stupid, call me a bitch, you name it. They were awful towards me. This was after I had apologized to them countless times for what I had done, and they still acted this way, even when I needed emotional support. To top it all off, they then claimed that they were the victim, to which I agreed mostly out of obligation. This went on for about 9 months before we eventually broke it off, and our friendship ended a few weeks later.\n\nSo early this February I decided I'd get into contact with them one last time to apologize to them for what I had done. All they really did in response was thank me for the apology and say they don't like my personality (kind of unnecessary right?) I had expected for them to apologize as well, for everything they said and did to me. But they didn't. They didn't show a hint of even wanting to. They were still acting like a victim and I'm sure they would've gotten pissed had I tried to ask them to apologize. It makes me wonder if it's just petty to expect an apology out of them.",

      "title": "WIBTA If I complained to my building management about the baby next door.",
      "description": "I moved into this building in September. It’s not a high rise but it’s big (160 units, but they’re small, most of them are 580 sq ft). I’m in DC and 75% of the building is young professionals and then a few older single people. There is one family that I know of (next door) but it’s all one bedroom apartments so really it’s mostly couples and singletons. This is part of the reason I picked it, because it’s super quiet and everyone minds their own business and it’s quite nice. I have a very stressful job (don’t we all) and I like to come home after and be alone, in the quiet, and decompress. That’s how I recharge basically.\n\nAnyway, so at some point the people in the apartment next to me had a baby, I think in October. I have never actually seen them, just heard them. The room the baby lives in is right next to my bedroom and I’m almost 100% that it’s bed is right up against the wall we share. I think this because there’s a lot of bumping into that wall like someone is moving a crib around and because of the clarity of sound. So for awhile it was just kind of annoying because I could hear the baby crying but it would stop and I’d be able to fall asleep, but now it’s ridiculous. The little dude has been up ALL night for the last month. I checked the clock yesterday, it was screaming at 10, 12, 1:30, again at 2, and then it was peaceful til about 4:30 and then back up again at 6. And every time it cries the parents make a BIG deal so their fussing is almost as disturbing as the crying. I don’t mean fussing over the baby, I mean I think they’re having issues and they’re fighting about who has to get up. Last night they were yelling at each other at 2am. It was unpleasant.\n\nSo I basically can’t sleep, and I’m annoyed about it because I chose this building because of how quiet and non-social it is, and it’s starting to have an impact on me at work. But on the other hand, I think they’re having a rough time and babies are hard, especially the first one. But on my third hand, I didn’t chose to have the baby and I don’t need to be on its sleep schedule.\n\nI’m considering talking to the building management about it but I don’t want to be a massive asshole. I’m pretty sure they have the larger floor plan (700 sq ft) so I’m thinking maybe they can just move the baby anywhere else so it’s not against my bed wall, I think that would help. I cannot move my bed (or I would) because my bedroom is itty bitty and it would block the door. Also, I’m not going to go talk to them directly because I actually want to have zero personal interaction with any of my neighbors other than being nice in the elevator\n\nSo would talking to the building management make me an asshole?",

Her dad is still in the picture and married to her mom but she wasn't really close to him. I mean her mom practically raised her by herself for most of her younger years (the split after they had her for a couple years), and even when he came back they did not get along well at all, she tells me they are MUCH better now but I can't judge since I wasn't there her whole life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer dad a lot of the times can be immature...I mean really immature...I mean border line Peter-Pan syndrome. Not like the weird \"innocent\" Michael Jackson type stuff, more like he never grew out of Sophomore year high-school type personality, even though he is pushing close to 50 fast.

      "description": "This happened a few months ago. My SO and I have opposite schedules, and on this day I decided to take voluntary time off since I didn't get any sleep the night before. On my way back through the parking lot of my complex I noticed one of my SO's tires were extremely low. I had mentioned to her numerous times to fill her tires, so I assumed it was a slow leak. It was *almost* flat, but I figured it would get her to the nearest gas station before work. \n\nI woke her up when I got home and said her tire was extremely low and she should fill it before she goes to work. She mentioned something about doing it on her lunch break, and I tried to stress how important it was for her to take a look before then. I assumed she would heed my warning and assess the situation appropriately, I even told her she should wake up a couple hours earlier just in case. She goes back to sleep, I'm starting to fall asleep as well, and think to myself \"I should probably tell her it's flat since she isn't taking it seriously enough.\" She's already asleep again, I figure I'll wake up around when she's going to work and tell her then.\n\nThat didn't happen, I was too sleepy to remember. She gets to work and realizes her tire is completely flat and now has to call triple A. Turns out she didn't have a slow leak, there was a pretty big hole in her tire. It turned into a huge ordeal and she had to get it towed, get new tires, etc, and she's stressed since she has to figure this all out while she's at work.\n\nWhile she acknowledged she should have checked her tire before she left for work, she said that I should have said the words \"your tire is flat\" instead of saying \"your tire is extremely low, and you should check it out before you go to work.\" I feel like an asshole for maybe not saying the word \"flat\" but I tried to stress the severity of the situation. She said it wasn't my fault, but the fact that she said I should have said \"flat\" still feels like she blames me to some degree. ",

(He doesn't have a UTI or other medical condition by the way), and it leaves me absolutely exhausted which in turn makes my morning sickness worse.\n\nI love the cat and he is a sweet boy, but he has always been pretty anxious and high-maintenance, and I'm pretty worried that once the baby comes and I am already sleep-deprived, cleaning up cat pee will be the last thing I want to do, and I won't want to sacrifice my sleep any further by having to change the sheets in the night. And what if he pees in the baby bassinet and harms my child?\n\nWe tried getting a pet gate but he bangs on the gate to get in at night, and sometimes sneaks in to the bedroom anyway.\n\nAnyway, the pet groomer the other day mentioned that she LOVES the cat and spontaneously said \"if you ever need to find a new home for him, I'd love to take him.\"\n\nI am tempted to let her take him... it's pretty heartbreaking to think about letting my cat be re-homed, but I genuinely think the cat would be happier in a new home at this stage, and I have to be realistic that I will go crazy if we are constantly cleaning up after my cat as well as my baby.\n\nTL;DR: AITA if I re-home my cat (to a loving home) because I'm pregnant and he pees on the bed?",

      "description": "As of February 17, I've edited this post. Responded to some comments and cut out the excess - thought I was giving context, wound up just venting. Sorry guys, first post jitters I guess. Still fairly long as I am incapable of short, but sticks to the main point now.\n\nCast:\n\nMe: 20 yo aspie artist. I live at home and don't make enough for my parents to be comfortable charging me rent, so I do weekly jobs around the house to contribute. Would usually do so the day before this story, but I woke late after having a poor night's sleep and had to go to a meeting about my small business, so the bigger job of vacuuming/mopping was left to today as the house is too busy for loud vacuuming in the late afternoon.\n\nSister: 17 and I find that she's a bit of a terror. Some days I get her 'public face' - the perfect child who got Head Girl and is loved by the majority of the school. At home, I usually deal with a child who likes to play a third parent to me, not follow her own advice, and rage at her family for everything going on in her life. \n\nSebastian and Bundi: Our two cats. While I do a number of jobs around the house, their litter boxes are a job my sister and I share.\n\nMum: Tries her best to be fair, but she's got her own issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWake up, do waking up things. Pass the laundry where the litter boxes are kept. See shit on the floor. Grrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaat. Since I cleaned up the floor poop yesterday morning, even though I had to fly out the door, I feel like it's fair to ask if my sister could do this one this morning. \n\nGo out to the kitchen. Sister's making breakfast for herself and Mum with earbuds in. I have to talk a couple of times to get through her earbuds, eventually just stating that there's cat poop on the laundry floor and asking her to pick it up.\n\nSister chastises me for not asking her more politely, as I had not continued using the word 'please' after the second attempt to get through her earbuds (about 4 tries total). Then she brings up the times when she has told me someone needs to do the litter box, I went into the laundry to find poop on the floor, and then I went to ask her if she knew about the floor poop. In the past, she has pushed her jobs onto me, so I had reason to ask at the time. She apparently thought I was trying to prove something by mentioning the floor shit. I explain that I simply felt I should tell her because I knew at the time. Sister continues to tell me that the only reason she didn't mention floor poop was because she didn't know, which I confirm that I understand now.\n\nI sit and talk with Sister and Mum over breakfast. Lots of topic jumps and some nonsense, y'know, family stuff. \n\nAfter breakfast, I ask if Sister remembers that I asked about the litter boxes. She gets huffy and Mum tells me that I don't need to check in on her so much and not to ask again. I explain that I only brought it up because I know I forget if I get distracted by anything, but that I understand. \n\nI go to get started on the vacuuming. Sister is wandering from her room to the bathroom to the kitchen, on her phone. I change out the vacuum bag, maybe a five minute job total. Still wandering and texting. Plug in the vacuum and clean the first two rooms, five to ten more minutes. Still. Texting. Not even moving towards the laundry. I know she needs to nail down a date for something with her friends, but come on, we have known this shit was on the floor for approaching an hour now. I decide Mum's previous order now ranks as a request. Probably an asshole for that.\n\nI ask a third time for her to pick up the cat shit. Sister looks like she wants to tear my face off for that, snaps her hands through her hair so hard an earbud falls to the floor, and stomps up the hallway. I hear her grumbling through my own headphones and ask her, very calmly, to repeat herself.\n\n\"It's not like I have anything to do!\" she snaps. I explain that I needed to vacuum in here, that I could not vacuum over the cat poop and had to move things around in there to clean properly. I explain that I have seen her wandering around on her phone. This job will only take her two minutes.\n\nFrom what I was able to see, my sister wandered through the house on her phone for the next hour and a half before jumping in the shower, so that was apparently her idea of things to do. I did go on to warn my Mum that I asked Sister again, since she was wandering on her phone and I needed it done quickly, just so she knew why she was angry. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResponses to comments: \n\n***Why didn't you just clean up the cat shit?*** Yeah, I probably should have. I think it's the household mentality. Just this morning when I went to make my coffee, there was some paper towel on the ground. In our house, that means Mum found cat vomit and decided not to wake anyone to clean it up, just to mark where it was. I have also been told about floor cat shit when I wake up in the past, while my sister laid in bed wide awake and texting. I'm not justifying it, and it's a habit to break. Shitty reason, but that's why.\n\n***You're coming off as controlling.*** Unfortunately, it happens. I panic when things aren't moving at the 'right pace', because I'm scared I'll get in trouble for not having my own work done. Not a good trait. My sister has left jobs alone for days in the past while being reminded by our parents and walking past the obviously needs-to-be-done job multiple times a day. In the heat of the moment, I thought that I was doing the right thing. Looking back, I wasn't. ",

I don’t have a problem with that, she can share whatever she wants. \nBut it’s come to a point where she only shares the stuff BECAUSE it’s a black person or a woman, or even a black woman that is in the video/wrote the article. I asked her if she even read the articles and did more research into the stories, and she told me that she reads the articles, but doesn’t do further research. I said she should so she could get a better understanding and have more details about the article/video.\nShe then said it doesn’t matter and that I shouldn’t get worked up over something so small. I talked to some other mutual friends, and they sided with her and said I was overreacting.\nSo I feel the need to ask: AITA for questioning my friend if she actually cares about what she shares on FB?",

      "description": "Yeah, based on that title, 100% I'm the asshole. Here's where I'm confused:  \n\n\nThe workplace is my dads, where my husband was employed. Hubby finishes up at the end of this week, because he's chosen to take on a different job. Dad wasn't overly happy about this - one of those 'but I'm creating an opportunity for you to take over the business one day' scenarios. Which is great, and super appreciated...but hubby's got a trade and been given an amazing opportunity in that field - and he never wanted that business and was clear on that from the start, he started working there to help Dad out when Dad got sick and needed a hand for a while. (Dad's fine, temporary illness)  \n\n\nSo we've been a bit curious since we haven't heard anything about anyone new starting with Dad (only Dad and one employee - business is busy, but doesn't need more than that at this stage). Today, Mum let slip that he had someone lined up to start next week. She was the only one that knew and we weren't to be told because 'why do they need to know?'. ('They' being me and my husband)  \n\n\nOk....fair enough? Seems a bit douche-ey to me because we're family, but ok fine, we don't really need to know I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh. Except. The person you've got working for you is our real estate agent, who currently has the sale contract for our apartment. And Dad's sworn him to secrecy. So he'll be leaving that real estate agents next week and....we....haven't been told...because Dad's forbidden him from telling us? Really?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm getting out of the fog lately with some ridiculously narcissistic things Dad's done, and some beautifully enabling things Mum's done, throughout my entire childhood....but this one has me a bit stumped. Am I the asshole here and I'm making a big deal out of something that really isn't?  \n\n\nP.S. Don't know if it changes anything, but for the last 10 years I've worked for our other family business (and still am) - Dad has stepped away from this one leaving me and Mum working here, while he does the other business full-time.",

      "description": "Let me start off by saying this happened all through texting. My girlfriend and I of 3 and a half months will sometimes jokingly call each other names, in a flirty manner. I'll call her a loser and she'll reply calling me a tool, nerd (etc). We just like to go back and forth with banter in a lighthearted mood and have a good time with it. Well today, in the middle of some of our bantering, I said, \"Gonna take a shower real quick\" she replied, \"Cool story bro\". I get out of the shower and she said she was going to run to Walmart, so i respond with this exact text, \"cool story... h...\"  Implying I was going to say hoe. Here's the thing, I didn't actually even call her a hoe. So she facetimed me and kind of told me how wrong that was of me and how she doesn't enjoy being called a ho. I told her it was all in good fun as we were just going back and forth with names. She said very emphatically it was indeed NOT funny. She said it was would be equivalent to if she had called me a prick. Which, honestly would not offend me, unless she were being serious. \n\nSo maybe I'm the asshole here, maybe I crossed the line, but my first thought is that she is being sensitive here. It can be hard to judge from the first person",

      "description": "To start off with i will say that this is not me in case, it's my friend/classmate and i will apologise in advance for my broken english as it is my second language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk a bit of backstory, so we are 17/18 years old and at second grade of college/high school. there is this kind of a tradition to celebrate the third graders/seniors leaving the school that we celebrate it by hosting them a party and buying all the alcohol and food for them. and also there is another tradition going on about the same time now that the second graders have this oldish event in which we have a lot of old dances that we train and then there will be our big day to show off everyone how good of dancers we are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the thing is that we have also a party after our dance in the evening and usually people drink quite a lot in there and we have to pay for everything collectively beforehand. And now that we are planning both for the party of the seniors leaving and our party after the dances. we came to a conclusion that everyone should pay 20 euros so we can pay for both. And if you didn't want to take part in our party after the dance you just wouldn't pay 10 euros and not come to the party, And also if you didn't want to pay for the seniors goodbye party then you just wouldnt be able to join next year when the current second graders would pay for you. quite simple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now we are at the point where everything is basically figured out and done. But my friend has strong beliefs against alcoholism and didn't want to support the drinking or drink himself.  I of course assumed that he would just pay his part on everything else since the was a good planning for budget and all expenses were figured out so he just wouldn't pay his part for the alcohol costs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is  where is was really surprised that almost everyone started to scream to him that just pay the fucking 20euros and get this done with and don't fuck around. he explained that he just felt that he wouldn't like to part of supporting heavy drinking and just not pay for the alcohol and not drink it by himself now or the next year when we get the party. even after he gave a proper explanation  people still talked shit about him that \"always like this, never willing to co-operate\" which is partially true but in this matter I couldn't really understand why he wouldn't be able to just pay his part of the other costs like rent and food. And people kept telling him that just pay the fucking 20 euros and we can use it to buy foor and not alcohol so everyone will be happy, but as obviously terrible argument as that is because simply there would be more money to buy alcohol since someone else wouldn't pay for the food and buy more alcohol which would still support heavy drinking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI most often can relate to other views or atleast understand them but in this case i truly can't understand why wouldn't he be able to just pay his part in other costs so he would just be able to join the party and not dring because i was basically the only one that got his back. so is my friend truly an asshole?

She would send me giant blocks of text of how she decided that she would runaway, date someone 10 years older than her, someone in her apartment died etc. It was fine for a awhile, I gave her advice on what the best thing for her to do would be. \n\nBut now she’s become fixated on her sex life and would send me descriptions in great detail alongside sending me images of the lingerie she prefers to wear. I tried to change the subject many times but she can’t understand social cues. She decided that she wanted to get me something for my birthday and brought me lingerie despite my protests. Now she wants to hangout so she can give it to me and keeps messaging about the meet up date.\n\nI’ve never known an autistic person before nor do I have the knowledge or experience to deal with someone like that.

      "description": "So my friend, Dave has been building decks for a couple months now. Few weeks ago his boss told him he wanted him to create his own LLC to sub contract work out to.\n\nAt the time Dave said himself it was a bad idea. I agreed citing his lack of experience with budgets, taxes, insurance etc. Didn't bring up his issue with spending money and always falling for every gimmick or dumbass thing someone tells him.\n\nYesterday he tells me and some other friends that he's now a business owner. I thinking we were still on the same page tell him he's dumb for going through with it. He continues to tell me I always have some bad to say etc.\n\nI realize I do come off kinda harsh in things like this and always try to apologize when I do so but still try to convey my thoughts. I think he just gets mad that he's not hearing what he wants to from me. As seems to be a pattern for most people around him/here. I've known this dude all my life and don't want him to screw up, I hope it works out. But I think he thinks I'm just being a dick.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "So I'm a 17 year old high school student who works part time, so all the money I make goes into saving for college and for social events with friends.  On the weekends I limit my budget to fifty dollars maximum, which usually gets used up fully.  I withdrew fifty dollars on Friday after school and ordered pizza for dinner.  I had two twenty dollar bills and one ten, so I just used a twenty for the seventeen dollars worth of pizza and told the delivery guy to keep the change.  The next day I went out to lunch with friends and had an eight dollar meal, which I used the other twenty to ask for a ten, a five, and five ones, and left a four dollar tip, as this waitress was amazing and overall a great person, and I also wanted some bills for exact change purposes. Now I was down to eighteen dollars. I always make sure to leave a tip, because the tipping system is pretty garbage, but that is public knowledge by this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Sunday morning rolls around, and my friends and I go out for breakfast.  Our waitress really isn't that good, and she never gave any of us a refill on our clearly empty drinks until I asked, to which she seemed pretty annoyed, but most of the time I would still leave a good tip.  My friends and I get our receipts and go to the front cashier to pay.  My bill is $12.84, so I used my ten dollar bill and my three ones.  I would've used the five, but my friends were already making plans for later to get fast food and watch movies at one of their houses, so I thought I would save the 5 for dinner later.  The front cashier is having my friend swipe his card while I hand her my cash and tell her to keep the change, just cause I didn't want her to fish for sixteen cents.  I didn't say it in a tone of voice or anything, just the normal conversation voice one would have.  after I say this she says in a sarcastic tone, \"oh wow, sixteen cents!\"  she wasn't loud or anything, but still pretty snarky.  As the sixteen cents prompt showed up for my tip and the two dollar prompt passed for my friend, she looked at him and genuinely said \"thank you so much!\" and then looked over at me and sarcastically said \"I mean it!\"  I left and it wasn't a huge deal or anything, but I can't help but feel stupid or something.  I mean, for all she knew I could've left the tip on the table.  She didn't even seem like the type of woman who you'd expect to act sarcastic or anything, and in past experiences she had been really nice when I left tips, so this came as a shock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR:  I didn't tip for the first time in a long while to save cash for later, and the cashier spoke sarcastically and snarky towards me.",

      "description": "Despite the stupid title, there's actually a bit more backstory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 13 years old, and my sister is 17. \n\nHer school is done, so she stays at home for the whole day. One day I come home at like 5pm from the bus (parents work quite late and don't get back until about 6:30) and there's leftover pasta from the night before. She's already eaten her dinner and I'm about to serve myself. I scoop one scoop and then I'm about to do another (i need lots of food), and then my sister chimes in saying stuff like \"you don't need another one\" and \"save it for parents\". normally this wouldn't be a problem, but she says it in a shouting  way  and this kinda ticks me off a little bit for some reason so I jokingly keep on serving the second spoonful (i was gonna put it back) but then she runs up to me and starts grabbing my arm and pulling me away. Like idk why but when someone gets really angry at me for little to no reason it annoys me so I push her away but then she gets really angry and starts punching my arm. She takes the pasta away and says 'you don't deserve it and stuff.' The punching doesn't hurt but I'm kinda annoyed now so I push her really hard. She starts crying and going on about how 'im stronger than I think' (which is an excuse she uses 24/7 with parents) which is kinda true. I'm kinda pissed off because when my parents get back they would take her side of the story because she's older and she sucks up. She tries retaliating but I don't quite remember the next few minutes but its basically back and forth physical fighting, but in all, she definitely punched/kicked more than I did. I did use a few choice words and punched/kicked as hard as I could though. I generally kept my calm. Parents come back and surely, after debating and the like I get in trouble. It doesn't end here though. I still feel like I was wronged so I wanted to kinda get revenge so I walk into the kitchen and take the leftover pasta and say really loudly \"oh I wanna eat this pasta\" and then she gets angry and another fight brews before my parents can stop. I kinda feel like I could've done things to stop it but Imo its generally my sister's fault. Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "I have made a thread on Twitter talking about how I am involved with a group of schoolmates whom I had to endure their unappreciative attitude (and actions) towards me.\n\nBackground:\n\nThese actions/attitudes includes excluding me from their WEEKLY gatherings and not telling me to come with them unless they feel like it, bullying, lack of communication and other stuff.\n\nNow I know the people in this group since where 16, and now where 22. But here is what went wrong: when college was coming 2 of my friends went abroad to study and I majored in something different than (the group) majored in, so what they did is they made a (circle) of their own and didn't think about making me a part of it because all of them know me well.\n\nThis asshole move made me very depressed and lonely since I joined college. The fact that you know that you have no one other than this (group) you know well enough to spend good times with them but they don't want you made me lose my will to continue being a normal guy.\n\nThe other fact that I have a family which only looks at me as I am a teenager who overreacts about everything and that I'm really just sensitive made me even more lonely, and btw I have 3 brothers and 4 sisters ( I'm from Bahrain ) but unfortunately I cannot really reach out to any of them because of what I mentioned earlier.\n\nSo\n\nSo I bottled up for about 3 years and yesterday I reached my breaking point and made a thread on Twitter talking about everything I had on mind. This made my cousin (one the guys I mentioned who was studying abroad) reach out to me saying he can talk to me tmw. But there is another guy whom I knew from college, and whom I really respect reach out to me as well, the latter also he can talk to me a time later.\n\nBut now that I know that my cousin will talk to me (and that he knows me best). I don't feel like talking to the latter guy whom I knew from college, even though I still have a lot of respect for him.\n\nPut simply: I was very depressed and lonely, two guys reached out to me, I think of them would be enough for me, so now I don't feel like talking to the other.\n\nWIBTA if I told the latter guy politely that he doesn't need to hear what I'm going to say, or if I told him politely that I had help already?",

      "description": "The title is basically the question.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for many years. In that time we have both had our issues and dealt with them together. I have been to therapy and still currently go. \n\nMy boyfriend is currently very depressed. Watching him go through this is so painful for me. He has seen a psychiatrist and various counselors but never seen a therapist for a talk session. I think this would be really beneficial but he hates the idea. He doesn't want to talk to someone who he feels won't do anything to fix his problems. I think it is also important to note that his insurance will cover therapy and cost is not an issue here. \n\nThis is something he is drawing a line in the sand over. He has started to get legitimately angry whenever I bring it up. I am at a loss. I would not break up with him over this, but I do not see the point of suffering through it without trying all available options. \n\nI'm not trying to be an asshole but I've continued to push the issue even though he has made it clear he will not go. AITA if I continue to push this?",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's this girl I go to high school with. By with I mean I have her in my first period and that's it. Every chance she has she talks about herself and her own problems. To the point I don't actually think it's legitimate anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has talked about having a boyfriend in a very obnoxious way a lot in the past(basically no one asked or were talking about anything related and she just pipes up \"WELL MY BOYFRIEND...\") , and always talks about their problems to anyone who will listen, or just has ears. Of course she did this until he broke up with her and she then just complained until she realized no one cared. This rubbed me the wrong way because she would just outwardly talk about their relationship but since he went to another school he would never know nor be able to defend himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother incident me and my friends are again eating breakfast and she pulled out her like water warming squishy heart shape period pouch from her ***p a n t s*** and talks about her period. While we're eating. We just kind of??? stared at her??? and she was oblivious to it all. She was kind of cracking jokes and and trying to seem quirky. For having period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning is the final straw. My first period is in the library this morning because the teacher is sick. A friend of mine is talking about how she might get kicked out and have her phone taken away because she got into a fight with her family. I'm telling my friend about how I could definitely take her in, and another mutual friend is also stating that they could also take her in. Then this girl, multiple times, interrupted to talk about how HER home life is, and how HER mother never lets friends to stay over(even though this isn't a sleepover? it a living arrangement?) , and WOE IS ME. We just kind of ignored her the best we could, with me going \"Ok?\". Like my friend might literally be forced onto the streets, and you go and make it about ***y o u.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Just got told by said friend that after this incident that she was talking about being legally blind- and this girl just tells her that she isn't? Wow thanks for curing them!!! Can you get my diabetes next?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has done this since anyone could remember. She always makes everything about her problems. You can never talk to anyone unless you are whispering to them, or else she was jump in and make it about her self. And at this point some of the stuff she says is so outlandish- we're not even sure where the truth begins and the lies start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, is that if the conversations we had with her started with her and was about her this wouldn't be an issue. But instead of seeking people out at an appropriate time- she interrupts and makes them about her. Even if it's a serious issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo WIBTA if I just snap at her? Tell her to mind her business? Tell her to stop interrupting?",

I told her that if she needed help cleaning I was here (I’ve got that weird thing where if someone needs me I can do the thing but can’t do stuff for myself) and attempted to lighten the mood when she said that I shouldn’t do that because it was her mess by joking about how I’m like a shark and I have to keep doing things or else I’ll drown. To which Roommate #2 responded that I could start with cleaning my own messes quite harshly\n\nI have a slight bias towards Roommate #2 and #3 because during our first night they gossiped about how they thought I seemed weird and fake (the walls are incredibly thin). And the two of them often band together since they’re friends and I’m the outsider. But honestly I have had the dishes in the sink for the past two days, and my mental illness is not an excuse.

I'm at school all day, whether it be at work or in class, and it makes me so mad when I'm tired at the end of the day but still have to act as personal assistant to the rest of my family. I feel like my mom puts a lot of pressure on me to help my youngest brother (who's a little younger than 10) with his reading and writing and math skills, which is something I don't feel well equipped to do. Whenever I try to bring up how stressed I am to my parents, they always bring up how i'm living in the house rent-free and don't do as much as I claim I do and threaten me to not ask them for things. I also feel kind of guilty because I know that if I wasn't living in the house and helping my two younger siblings with stuff they would have a lot of opportunities to do things that they want to do. I don't know, I guess I just feel stressed out, but I don't know what to do. Do I even deserve to feel like this?",

      "description": "Prepare for some meta-ass mental cartwheels. \n\nFirstly, I overthink and care what people think of me. According to him, my roommate doesn’t overthink or care what people think of him. Earlier today, he, my boyfriend, and I had a discussion about the etiquette of paying for meals.\n\nI approached it as a spirited debate. However now I see that I targeted my roommate in a long-winded rant. I said something like, “While you might feel like it’s the polite thing to do, you’re actually the asshole for refusing to accept gifts from people.” Note I said “you,” directing the lecture at him regarding a specific instance. That was shitty. He was amiable up until I said \"asshole,\" which he stiffened at.\n\nI apologized for calling him an asshole. He responded by saying that since he doesn’t care what I say about him, he doesn’t need an apology, and that my apology is irrelevant. \n\nI pointed out that even if he wasn’t affected by being called an asshole, I was affected by calling him an asshole. Refusing my apology when it means something to me and nothing to him, does in fact make him an asshole. He laughed, agreed, and left it at that.\n\nWhile I apologized for using the word “asshole,” I should have apologized for lecturing him in the first place. Looking back, I see my lecture was unsolicited and condescending, which my apology didn't cover.\n\nSince he did a shit job at accepting my first apology, do I bother offering a revised one? Did he refuse because it was not sufficient (something I can change) or because he's spiteful (something I can't change)?\n\nLastly, if he’s the person he says he is, then he has already forgotten about this. But if he actually cares, then it might make him feel better. Mostly it would make me feel better (but it shouldn’t be about me). \n_________________________________\n\nTLDR: I apologized for calling my roommate an “asshole” while lecturing him about etiquette. Really, I should have apologized for lecturing him in the first place. He called my apology “irrelevant” since he doesn’t care what anyone says about him. Would revising my apology make it better or worse?\n________________________\n\nPS: There’s a sliver of chance he’ll see this in which case: Sorry again dude, I hope you’re more amused than offended.\n",

      "description": "Occasionally, I'll forget minor stuff that is unimportant to me and this makes my wife angry - case in point is tonight when she asked if I knocked her hairspray onto the floor, and spilled some. I assume that she didn't do it (hence why she's asking) so it must have been me. I responded by saying I probably did, but don't remember (It was afterr I worked 9 hours, went to the gym, and had dinner, so I'm pretty tired and was just focused on showering at that point). Apparently this was the wrong answer.\n\nShe starts going off about how can I not remember something that happened a few hours ago, and swears I'm lying to her. How it would be implausible that I wouldn't hear it or remember picking it up. Frankly, I didn't and was just trying to be honest. I knock stuff over all the time - it doesn't stick out in my memory. \n\nFirst of all, what would be the benefit of me lying? We don't have kids, and the dog can't reach it. If it wasn't her, it was obviously me. The fact is that knocking something over is something that happens all the time. She has stuff on the counter and sometimes I'm not careful about avoiding it if I'm distracted or doing something else. \n\nSecond, if I had remembered or realized at the time, I would have cleaned it up so she wouldn't notice and get pissed later. \n\nI made these points to her, but she was just busy being mad. I ended up cleaning it up, but she still kept going on about how there must be something wrong with me to not remember it and she was pissed at me for \"lying\" to her. Somehow this also became about me being \"holier than thou\" about her having stuff on the counter (apparently this is what she got from me saying that there is her stuff on the counter sometimes and sometimes I knock it over by accident). \n\nTo me it seems like a huge overreaction. Why couldn't she just accept that I was trying to be honest by saying I don't remember, but I'll clean it up?  What really pisses me off the most is that she doesn't ever seem to think she does anything wrong and seems incapable of apologizing for blowing up on me. I apologize for not remembering and she jus stays pissed, with no admission of fault on her part for the argument.\n\nSo, AITA for not having a good enough memory of minor things I screw up?",

      "description": "I'm doing a group project for a college assignment that is 10% of our grade. The only thing is, our professor told us that if we are in groups(max 2 people) then she expects a more complex project.\n\n\nNow we had to learn a new coding language and download a simulator software for it and my \"partner\" has been claiming it's not working. Here's the caveat though, a friend sent me an instructional video to get the software working and I pulled it off, I pestered him till I got it working and begged him to lend me his laptop if need be. Then another dude from an other group asked me how to install it and I sent him the same video and he got it. This dude in my group claims it's not working and that he's \"trying\" circumstantially, I can trust him. But the problem is, he has been doing sod all.\n\n\n1) He hasn't tried to seek my help or even help me. I asked him to research some of the logic/algo that we need and he hasn't\n\n\n2) I told him to send me his mail id so I could send him the code on google drive so he could at least have an idea of what to do. He hasn't sent me the id.\n\n\n3) I told him I'm going to the library to get a book to refer to, he said he was in the lecture hall and eating. After our lectures, I told him to find a book, he said he had to go to his grannies place and couldn't work that day. I asked if she was doing okay, he said yeah. So I cant even say that he had family issues.\n\n\n4) I told him to bring his laptop and to college so I can help him out in getting the license working. He said his dad needed it for office.\n\n5) We had a lab viva session and the professor said he wouldn't leave till everyone got all their lab material corrected. I told this guy to work with me in the meantime  Instead he was gossiping and trying to convince others \"to finish fast\" when he wasn't pulling his own weight. Even when I got him to sit, I was doing more work than him.\n.\n6) Is a burden cause I have extra work as it is a group and not an individual one.\n\nHave I been the best project doer? Nope, I have wasted hours playing Spiderman, watching the office and researching for fantasy football. But have I been trying to do my own work and get him to pull his weight, yes!\n\n\nTo me it seems like he doesn't even care and when we have to present our project, our professor will ask who did what and I'm tempted to say he did jackshit. He doesn't know how the algorithm works and is gonna not have much to say. For comtext, we are building hardware for a calculator and he doesn't know what logic is to be used as he is only sleeping in classes or gossiping.\n\nThe worst thing is, I wanted to do a project for a research paper under the professor with that guy. But I'd need to buy some expensive hardware. I've been putting it off doing a project for long and felt that doing it with him would be great. Now however, I don't know...",

      "description": "So the first thing that should be mentioned is that the guy in question is super depressed and I'm aware of that. The frustration I have stems from the following issues.\n\nEvery week, my and a few of my friends meet up on Saturday to drink, play some Smash Bros., and play some DnD. Additionally, we'll go out and get some food, or go see a movie or something. Basic friendliness stuff I guess. It's always at my place, mostly because I'm the only one with a house and fortunately my wife doesn't care in the slightest. That's all fine. That doesn't bother me.\n\nMy issue is that the one friend has some rather outstanding debt to me and another person in the friend group. He currently owes the other friend $60 from a previous purchase, and he currently owes me $90. Let me explain where this debt comes from.\n\nMy friend's PC was having a few issues, and being an IT grad, I figured I would take a look at it. I told him it was being suffocated with dust and that was causing it to overheat. Which is true, although to be fair to him, the prebuilt didn't exactly have any dust filters built into it, so that was bound to happen.\n\nFast forward about a week and a half and I get a text at about 10 pm that it officially shat out and isn't giving any video. So I sigh to myself because I know exactly what the problem is, grab my spare GPU (A GTX 1050, basically something I have on standby for temporary replacments) and drove my dumb ass over. After a full day of work. At 11 pm. In my pajamas without any makeup or anything. Greattttttt.\n\nSo I go over, grab my screwdriver and magnetic screw dish from my car, walk in and do the part swap. It's like a 10 second thing. I install the drivers which takes slightly longer, and everything is up and going for him. I told him that since the card retails for $150 (at the time) I would charge him $80 for both the card and my installation services. I felt like that was fair, and I know he has money issues so I told him he didn't have to pay me back immediately, or at some point he could just give me back the card and buy his own replacement (Cuz I lowkey kinda really want that card back. It's the one I use for the youtube and jackbox machine that's plugged into our living room TV) and I wouldn't charge him a dime.\n\nWell...it's been a month now, I know he's bought other things, and I know for a fact neither me nor my friend have gotten our debts repaid. It's *incredibly* frustrating to me to the point that I've been slowly trying to boot him out of these hang outs without saying anything.\n\nLike, I thought I was on the up and up and was right here, but other people have told me to just take the high road and really, I don't know if I'm being the asshole here or not. I'm trying not to be but like god damn my guy.",

We went to separate universities but still remained very close and saw each other all the time. Really one of the best friends I’ve ever had. \nI introduced her to one of my best friends in college. Long story short, he was not a good friend because he was very condescending toward me, blamed me for things that weren’t my fault, and he distanced himself from me when my dad passed away because he didn’t want to deal with it. \nI recently found out my “best friend” from high school is now dating my friend from college who treated me very poorly. I openly told her how much I disliked him, and she would agree. And now they’re dating. I completely stopped all communication with her as soon as i found out (I found out through a third party) and so far i don’t regret it. But am I overreacting? Is this something to even hold a grudge over? I have no desire to talk to either of them but sometimes I feel like I overreacted to the situation and i should’ve just talked it out instead of cutting her off. But I feel kind of stabbed in the back from this whole situation also. Just not sure what to do. ",

I'm fine with this because this is a throwaway\\]\n\nSo I'll try to be as brief setting this up as possible. I have bipolar schizoaffective disorder that I've been in treatment for for about seven years and it's mostly controlled by meds. I have a hard time finding employment due to this and I can't really care for myself, plus my mom is disabled and needs some help with certain things, so I live with my parents at 24. Most people in my life regard me as a man or nonbinary person with the exception of my father, who reserves his right to call me his \"little girl\". That's why I specified my gender status, sorry if that's TMI. It adds to the friction is what I'm getting at.\n\nMy dad really likes to talk to me, usually telling stories about things that happened to him or that he heard on NPR. I'm not really allowed to focus on things too hard or wear earbuds/headphones when he's around because I need to be able to listen to him. He's allowed to listen to music and watch TV when I'm in the room because he has misophonia and my breathing/chewing/etc. annoys him, so I don't consider this unbalanced. However, maybe because I'm mentally ill or maybe just because I'm an irritable person, sometimes I get irrationally annoyed by his talking. I have tried to tell him to stop for a while but he gets understandably upset.\n\nMy mom gave me permission to listen to music in the car when he drives me to therapy once a week. This was after some arguments about me not listening or responding to him because I had headphones on. She told him I like to be able to gather my thoughts on the way to therapy, and he pretty much accepts that although he still will try to talk to me (but he doesn't get mad if I don't answer).\n\n**TL;DR:** My dad wants to chat on the way to therapy and I want to listen to music and be quiet while I think.\n\nSo, yeah. I realize I'm basically being a petty teenager here when I'm waaay too old for that shit. I'm working on getting out of the house. But for now, am I the asshole for wanting to listen to music in the car ride to the therapist and not talk to my dad?",

      "description": "\nThis story involves:\nMyself,\nSO= my significant other \nF= my friend\nFF= my friends friend\nAnd G= girl that my friend was hanging with\n\nF, FF, my SO and I all decided that we would go out one night. One important thing about F is that he is in a relationship but likes to act like he isn't and I have called him out on this before. Well F decides to invite this girl to come with us, and she ends up being DD and driving all of us to the event we were going to. F's significant other ends up sending him some money to spend for the night. \n\nAt the event, everything is fun, I'm dancing with my SO, F is dancing with G. It's pretty innocent although it becomes quite obvious that F and G are into each other.\n\nAnyhow, music is good, drinks are flowing, we are all enjoying ourselves. G seems like a nice enough girl, I talked to her here and there and she seems cool. I realized later I had met her before.\n\nThe night comes and goes and we end up all getting back in the car and driving to a gas station. F and my SO get out, leaving G, FF, and I in the car. \n\nG starts to talk to me, telling me that F is very cute,  and she likes him. This makes me a bit uncomfortable due to the situation and my drunk mind can't really shut off and ignore it so I tell her \"hey, just be careful\"\n\nOf course this sparks her interest, she begins asking questions. I keep it quite vague with her, just repeating that she should be careful. \n\nShe brings up his \"ex\" and I say I don't know about an \"ex\" I do emphasize the word ex. She asks some more questions and I tell her I don't want to say anything else, just repeat again that she should be careful.\n\nI never went into detail, just didn't want her to get the wrong idea of what she was getting into. Honestly I felt bad for her and I just wanted her to be able to make her own decision. She thanked me several times and that was the end of the conversation.\n\nThis made FF angry, he made some comments towards me and stormed out of the car. A few minutes later everyone returned to the car and G drove us all to F's apartment. F and G stayed in the car and my SO, FF, and I got out. I told my SO I wanted to go home. She said she wanted to hang out for awhile but I insisted that I wanted to go home. This made her a bit angry and we went back and forth but eventually returned home.\n\nOn the way home, I told her about what happened and her opinion was that I should have minded my business and that I was over reacting and we shouldn't have left.  I explained I wanted to leave because of FF's reaction to me but she didn't agree with me.\n\nSo, Reddit AITA here? Because I really don't know.\n\nTLDR; I went out with friends and my SO, friend who has a SO that actually paid for his night out was trying to hook up with another girl, I told that girl to be careful. My friends friend got visibly angry with me over it and made rude comments towards me, so I noped out of the situation shortly after.\n\n\n",

      "description": "Preface, I ride my bicycle in the road. Not in the middle of the lane, but along the curb, staying out of the way traffic mostly. The bike laws here are such that if you are hit by a car or any other incident involving cars where it’s the car at fault you must be riding on the road to be considered for right of way regarding any insurance claims, if you’re riding on the sidewalk you’re considered a pedestrian, and unless you have a walk sign cars have right of way regardless.\nWhile riding my bike in my neighborhood the other day, right around when schools are getting out, a car came up slowed down and got in my blind spot so I could really neither see or hear them and they pulled up real close and honk and then speed away, and I can audibly hear them laugh. Now, I’m pretty fast, I ride light racing road bike. They were in my neighborhood so I follow them as best I could, and then lose them. But I know what car’s theirs and I find it. I go up and knock on their front door, I see one of the kids, looks like a high schooler, and trough the door I hear the kid say to the other, “Oh shit! He followed us!” And he scurries away and doesn’t answer. I was wildly angry, but I was simply going to tell them how dangerous that is for bike riders. Wasn’t going to get violent, wasn’t going to yell. I’ve been hit by cars five times, never been my fault. Cops have always sided with me. I just don’t want it happening to anyone else because some dumb jits think it makes for a good laugh.\nSo, they didn’t answer. So I decide I’ll get some petty, harmless revenge. Around 12:30 AM I rode over to their house under the cover of darkness and let out the air from his passenger side tires. Hoping when their parents found out they’d have to make up some lie about how/why/ or who caused them to have two flat’s. TL;DR Kids purposely spooked me riding my bike, I got petty revenge by letting the air out of their tires.",

      "description": "Context: I'm 12th grade in high school and my class has 13 people. We only have TWO (serious) classes that we have tests to study for. I'm also not American, so Americans, please try to understand that the system in my country is much more different.\n\nSo today in History this girl I can't stand suggested that we change the date from the 22nd of November (note: this date is scheduled since September) to the 29th with the argument of us \"having more time to study\"(you'll soon realize how ridiculous that is). Usually in these situations, if the teacher agrees, a piece of paper is passed around with the signatures to change the test's date, since everyone must agree. That is, if someone doesn't, they have veto power.\n\nIt just so happens that for very logical reasons (which I think aren't revelant, but I'll say them anyway : we have a test of the other class on the 27th (TWO DAYS DIFFERENCE) and we have a shit ton of time to study regardless, so why skyrocket my anxiety), I disagree, and thus didn't sign, being the only one in the end because some other guy that didn't agree as well was persuaded.\n\nHavoc ensued. Everyone is calling me selfish, an asshole, and that it's all my fault and that \"it's not fair\".\n\nI DISAGREE, I DON'T SIGN. It's my right. If you disagree with the system go talk to the board, I don't give a fuck. I ended up snapping at a girl and telling her to not talk to me again (been meaning to tell her that for a long time though lol).\n\nAm I being the asshole?",

      "description": "So, to preface I'm a (21M). My boyfriend of 7 years (22M, we'll call him \"Alex\") met this guy (17M, we'll call him \"Brad\") a couple years ago and everyone has been decent friends with the guy for awhile. More recently some pretty big arguments between this new guy and another one of our friends (21M, we'll call him \"Chris\") have been going on, but last night a more serious argument occurred which changed my mind about this guy.\n\nChris brought up some messages where Brad had confessed romantic feelings for my boyfriend Alex, talking about \"oh if only OP wasn't in the way\", those kinds of messages. I obviously was not aware of this, though I had some suspicions with how he acted towards my boyfriend. But apparently, my boyfriend was aware of this, and thought I had known.\n\nI told my boyfriend I wasn't comfortable with him being friends with Brad because of his romantic feelings towards him, and the fact that he blatantly stated to Chris in messages that he wanted to be with my boyfriend, if only I weren't in the way. Cut to now, my boyfriend doesn't want to talk to me because I'm asking him to ditch a friend, and has told me that I'm being insecure for being bothered by this.\n\nYa'll tell me, because I'm worried that maybe I am being controlling, after all it is my boyfriend's friend, not mine. I'm just looking out for our relationship, I would've expected after Brad being friends with me and my boyfriend for about 2 years now and knowing that me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 years, he wouldn't be talking about having feelings for him anymore.\n\nTL;DR: Messages showed a friend Brad saying he loves my boyfriend and wishes I weren't in the way, knowing me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 years. I told my boyfriend that it really bothered me and that I think he should drop Brad, and now he's upset at me. AITA?",

I didn't get to meet him because my dad didnt have a lot of money and a father meeting his son for the first time in 30 years is a very emotionally charged experienced.\n\n\nMy dad and my half brother get along pretty well and he maintains contact with my dad. My dad didnt abandon him, my dad was 22 at the time and the mother didnt want her son to end up like she did with so many walk in and walk out fathers. The mother eventually moved to california and my dad and his son lost contact until late 2017ish.\n\n\nMy dad spent the spring break going to where my brother lived to meet him and didnt tell me until the trip was over because it might have effected my emotional state (i had pretty severe depression at the time)\n\n\nHe says that my half brother is excited to meet me but we dont really have the money to see him. Ive called him a bunch but time zones and his very busy work schedule prevent much contact.\n\n\nI also feel bad because of this I have two nephews that i feel like im not there for.\n\n\nI feel hurt that its been a whole year and i havent met my brother yet and feel like i'll never meet him because of money. but I would also feel like an asshole if i talked to my dad about it because it would make him feel bad\n\n\nWIBTA if i talked to my dad about visiting my half brother\n\n\nTdlr; i have a half brother that my dad got into contact with about a year ago.

On the contrary, he keeps bringing up the same topics for days at a time and expects me to be nothing but supportive, otherworldly he'll get standoffish.\n\nThis has been going on for 3 weeks and I'm starting to get fed up with it. I can't deal with his negativity when I barely get enough support from him for my own worries.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "A little background. We are both in out late 20's and have been close friends for 15 years. I am male and she is female. \n\nSo she and I have been close for as long as we have known each other. We have gone on trips together, camping together, spent holidays together, etc. We kind of had an on again, off again relationship but mainly just friends. Nothing intimate ever happened between us but it was always in limbo on if we would seriously date. Eventually I sat her down and we discussed it and while I was fine with either option, she thought it would end badly and ruin our friendship. I was okay with that because I simply wanted to know since not knowing it had been kind of a block for me staring relationships with other girls I dated. \n\nWell, since the start of this year, our friendship seems to be on a decline. Before, we would get together at least twice a month and get dinner, or watch a movie at one of our places, or do something fun. All that changed when the year began. (After we had our relationship discussion) Despite offering to get together literally dozens of times in the first half of the year, I have seen her 4 times total this year. Every time I tried to get together, I would either get a text from her the day after the day I had talked about saying she couldn't, or a text that day saying she wasn't able to and we could plan on doing it some day the next week. I would ask her to just let me know what day would work and then I wouldn't hear anything about it, even when we texted. I got to the point where I just stopped trying, and even though I make attempts every so often, I pretty much know what the answer will be.\n\nWe used to text each other pretty much every day with just a \"how is you day going\" or something funny we saw online. Then it went to I would text and she would respond a day later. Now it has been 5+ days till I get a response for the past few weeks. When I haven't texted, she has been the first to send one to me on occasion.\n\nI just don't understand what is going on. One of my thoughts is that perhaps she met someone and is in a relationship. If so, I would understand her not wanting to spend as much time with me. The only problem is why wouldn't she tell me? We are both each other's best friend (at least we were) Why would she hide something like that from me? The other thought is that maybe I did something that hurt or upset her but I have not been told anything. She does initiate texts with me, and she even invited me on a weekend camping trip a couple months ago with a mutual female friend. \n\nIt just feels like I am the only one trying in this friendship and I don't know what is going on. For example, the camping trip is the only thing she has invited me to over the past year. For her birthday, I threw a little party for her, made her requested dinner of pot roast, and baked her a cake. Got her some fun presents as well. For my birthday, I got a short text wishing me a happy one, and that was it. She sent me a text a few weeks later saying she forgot to give me the present she got and we needed to get together to celebrate, but that was a month ago and I have heard nothing else about it. Now, I honestly don't care about presents or anything like that. It was just an example of the seeming difference of what we put in. While I feel like I have put more into the friendship through the time we have know each other (since it is just a friendship, I am fine with that) I just feel like I am the only one doing anything right now.\n\nI am afraid I am acting similar to a jealous bf and I don't want to be like that. I also don't want to let the friendship die as it has been such a major part of my life and I don't have many close friends.\n\nSo AITA and acting too clingy and should I just let her live her life because I am not entitled to her time, or do I deserve more from this friendship than I am currently getting?\n\nTL:DR- long time friend stopped hanging out and O don't know why and think I deserve more from the friendship.\n\nP.s. If there are any female redditors out there who might be able to give some explanation on what might be going on, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nP.S.S Remember, this is only one side of the story. There may be plenty of things that I don't know about.

      "description": "To start off, I have two friends. These are the only two people I hang out with and confide in. Me, being a girl, am I lot more emotional than these two guys, and they have made efforts before to be a little less rough when it comes to me as I hold a lot of insecurities. Now onto why this story got blown out of proportion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning, I was talking to them very enthusiastically about something, while they listened. They all of a sudden started saying \"Ok Tabletopcheckers, alright\", acting like I'm a wound up child. We are the same age, and I think of it as very demeaning, since my father used to say it to me whenever I would try to talk about things that I liked. It really hurts me when they do them, and I've brought it up a few times when they do it, saying it sounds rude and there are alternatives to things you can say. I think I could probably toughen up a bit but it just hurt me in the moment, you know? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I jokingly said I'll be mad for an hour but I'll see them then. They started calling me irrational for wanting to cool down because they were saying I was overreacting and it was pissing me off. Then one of them, which I consider my best friend, says, \"Ignore me for five hours Tabletopcheckers, you'll come right back\" which hit me insanely hard. I have been in and out of several abusive relationships, staying because I thought I couldn't find anything better. I doubt he meant it like that but it really hurt. All I asked him was to stop being condescending when I talk, and he thinks that I'm telling him to \"change his entire personality\". Am I the asshole for not wanting to be treated like that anymore?

      "description": "This happened several years back. My best friend lived in another city with a bunch of mutual friends. Her then boyfriend lived abroad. He had planned something special for her birthday even though he wouldn't have been able to visit and he was in touch with the aforementioned mfs to help him. She visits my city, which happens to be both our hometown, the weekend before her birthday. I was asked by one mf to get one of her gifts as planned by the bf and I was told that I would be reimbursed. It was sort of an expensive gift, not exorbitant but definitely over the budget one would spend for a friend's birthday gift. So we went shopping, stopped by a place for the gift and I asked her to pick the one she liked. She selects one, loves it and I think, fine maybe we should get this. We decide to grab a bite before buying it. And while we were at the restaurant, I receive a call from the mf asking me to abort the plan and that the bf wanted to get it himself. So I forgot about it and when we were done shopping she stopped at the gift shop again, took the one she had picked first and was just kinda admiring it. So this is where I know I screwed up. I went ahead and got it for her anyway. My reasoning being anyway the initial plan was to have me get it so it should be fine and if the bf doesn't want that, it can still be a gift from me. That blew up. I understand that he wanted to get it for her, but it's not such a gift that you can have only one of it.(think handbag, shoes, plush toy). And anyway if her boyfriend got the same one it will surely be extra special. I apologised to both of them. But it ended badly and they ending up fighting. They both stopped talking to me and blocked me on all social media platforms. I truly felt awful, and I understand why the bf was upset but I still feel the reaction was a bit extreme. It was not like I planned to sabotage their special day. Please tell me, AITA?\n\nNote: things are good with my friend now. She started talking to me again after a year and they broke up sometime after that for reasons unrelated.\n\n\n",

I honestly don't have a clue as to how and why we were even talking about NFSW. Anyways I was one of the people who asked him (just for fun and as a joke)  and he messaged me on snapchat (I'm a new fan of his so I don't know much and I can't say that we're close) about his fetish.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a joke and asked if I could expose him to a mutual fan who I compete against for the \"love\" of our favorite streamer. \n\nHe obviously said no. That's when I realized that he was seriously letting it go like a waterfall, exposing a soft and strange side to the streamer that I've watched for a few months. To say in the least... I was weirded out. \n\nThen he kept on asking for recommendations and how he really couldn't get it up for normal porn.... I have no idea honestly. I told him that he was a weirdo for telling me this and that he was sharing stuff that he should with someone he didn't really know... \n\nAnd that he should be asking his guy friends as I'm a girl who has no idea about this stuff and only talked about it in chat just for the jokes and memes. Like what....\n\nBut at the same time I have a difficulty with identifying who is friends with me and who I am friends with... You see?  I might not see him as a friend but he might see me as one... \n\nHe also said that he was scared to share this with his guy friends and male audience (99.9%). He told me to not expose him or else he would never share his worries (wrong word I suppose) with me ever again.\n\nBut at the same time..... Haha.... He kind of gives me the jitters. Like a radical incel would or a closet SJW or a tweaker who's slowly getting addicted or a 40 year old dad who hasn't done it in ten months looking for a snack. \n\nAll in all, he kind of got offended, I believe. As he stopped replying less and less and eventually left me on read...\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n",

For the past few months, I’ve been waking up a little bit earlier than her, which has been fine because she is the deepest sleeper you could ever meet. I have been able to set two alarms and get up and move around without bothering her in the slightest. However, recently, she has needed to wake up and get to work earlier than me. This would be fine, however, E is *such* a deep sleeper that she needs to set 10+ alarms that she subsequently snoozes to wake up in the morning, and I, unlike E, am a pretty light sleeper. I’d understand setting more than one (I use two myself) but to me the number of alarms E sets is extremely excessive, ESPECIALLY considering she also snoozes them all. This means that E has alarms going off every 1-2 minutes for usually around half an hour. I’ve tried to explain to her that not only is this habit annoying, but it is also inconsiderate, but she always gets mad and says she can’t help it because she just doesnt hear the alarms. The other thing that makes me mad is that she isn’t even trying to improve upon this habit even though living with roommates requires compromising, or at least trying to, on basically everything. So, am I the asshole for thinking she should try to cut down on the alarms?",

I spent about $1000 on setups, decorations, vet bills, etc on this little girl and my mom has the mentality of she's replacable. I feel like my mom is a horrible human being for saying that. We have a rocky relationship and this shows me she's a psychopath. ",

      "title": "AITA for not taking full responsibility for my roommate's pitbull attacks on the neighboring animals? (long)",
      "description": "\"Jen\" (21f), her boyfriend \"Bob\" (26m), and I (26m) moved in to an apartment complex about a year ago. About a month in, the couple asked me if I would be OK with them adopting a dog. As a dog lover, I was thrilled,  and enthusiastically agreed to their proposal of adding a furry companion to our home. I was expecting a labrador, a golden retriever, or something along those lines. \n\nFast forward a couple weeks and they come home with a massive, male, unfixed,  black and brown brindle pitbull with scar tissue on his face from the shelter. I was a little taken aback, but I had grown  up around sweet pitbulls and had no aversion to the breed. Jen insisted on naming the pitbull \"Sin,\" which I found distasteful,  but it was their dog so I kept quiet. \n\nFor the first couple weeks Bob the bf paid a lot of attention to the dog and tried to train him, but it became obvious they were in over their heads. Jen enjoyed their new pet, but didn't contribute to training the animal and simply refused to admit the dog was capable of any wrongdoing.\n\nA few weeks later Bob and Jen break up and he moves out. Jen's friend, Bill, moves in and things seem to be OK. Jen started to get annoyed with Sin as he would whine and bark in his kennel at night. She would yell shut up, but it didn't resolve the issue. Bill and I had full time jobs, but Jen was unemployed which left her plenty of time with the dog. Unfortunately, she didn't really enjoy taking Sin out for exercise and the poor thing was always bounding around the house, raring to go. I volunteered to take Sin on a daily walk to the dog park and play fetch with him. I was happy to do this because I liked him very much and knew he was starved for attention. I also tried to discipline and train him a little as he had gradually started to run the house. Jen would constantly undermine me by validating his bad behavior. If he tore up the couch,  pissed on the floor etc. she would coddle him and say its not his fault.  I warned her this was not a good idea but she ignored me, saying it was her dog. \n\nAfter a couple weeks I felt I had developed a good repoire with Sin and had good leash control and basic commands. Around people he was a saint,  but around other animals he would become very tense and agitated, not going so far as to lunge at them,  but he was very interested. It made me a little nervous and I tightened up on the leash, but so far he had not made any aggressive moves. \n\nShit hit the fan one afternoon on the walk back from the dog park. The cat from next door hissed at us and Sin bolted at it in a flash.  Though I had a good grip on the leash, he slipped the collar and was on the poor thing, instantly ragdolling it. I,  stupidly in my panic,  jumped in and started screaming and hitting Sin to try and get him to release the cat. The ensuing commotion drew all the neighbors outside to watch, including the crying cat owner.  Eventually, I got them separated and dragged Sin into our apartment.  I was covered in scratches and blood and very shaken.  I am not a small guy and Sin had doghandled me like some chew toy,  I was absolutely overpowered. A mob had formed outside and Jen refused to go out to face it.  Feeling responsible,  I did,  and was screamed at and told they were going to call the cops and have the dog put down.  \n\nAmazingly,  nothing actually happened.  I don't know if the cat lived, but the cops were not called.  Jen held me accountable for the incident and asked for money for vet bills for Sin's face. Feeling responsible I helped pay. She coddled the dog, saying it was not his fault. I realize it wasn't, but  I still was amazed at how she refused to discipline the dog in anyway. She even joked about the cat's fate. Wracked with guilt and anger,  I told her that even though I liked the dog I would not take him out ever again.  I also advised her that the dog needs some sort of training, but she insisted it was fine.  She called her mom, who advised her to get a gentle guider leash. Bear in mind,  this is her first dog and she has no idea what she is doing. A few weeks earlier I asked if he was on heart guard and got the pikachu face.  \n\nFast forward a month and tensions in the house are running high.  It's awkward in the common space and to make matters worse Bill and her were good friends and both blamed me,  essentially leaving me feeling ostracized in my home. I wish this was the end of the story, but it's not.  One morning I am packing for a camping trip,  which required me to make several trips to my car on the other side of the building. Each time,  I was careful to close the door behind me, but you see where this is going. I hear a loud animal fight break out,  but it doesn't occur to me at first what is happening. As I round the corner, I see Sin thrashing some little dog around in front of a terrified owner. Once again,  my shitty instincts kick in and I manage to pin Sin to the ground in a choke hold after a lengthy struggle with lots of yelling. The other dog is fucked up. The whole thing repeats itself. I drag Sin inside and only then does Jen come downstairs to see what's going on.  Her dog and me are covered in blood and I go back out to get berated by the neighbors. On my last trip to the car I must not have shut the door all the way, leaving it cracked,  even though I thought I had absolutely shut it. I take responsibility for that,  I left it open I guess. Jen scrambles to get Sin out of the apartment complex that day, fearing this would be the last straw. I'm feeling awful once again,  knowing I fucked up,  but also I am angry.  I don't think this situation is fair or all my fault. She does and so does Bill so I am kicked out of the house,  which by this point I'm fine with. \n\nIn hindsight I realize how incredibly stupid and naive I was.  I was not able to control the dog and should not have put myself in that position.  But nobody was. Jen confided in me after the first attack that she had to hold on for dear life several times when Sin lurched at other animals.  I know I shouldn't have gotten involved, but I tried not to be after the first attack.  I should have been more careful with the door, but it was only open for 3 minutes and Sin had an animal in his teeth.  Ultimately I feel most sorry for Sin,  he doesn't know any better,  and his victims. This happened a year ago and I still have some ptsd about the attacks and serious resentment towards Jen. Go ahead and let me have it. AITA? ",

      "description": "So, this event requires quite a bit of background. I work as a software developer (kind of, see later), just graduated from university. Over summer last year, I worked for a small company (about 8 developers and 2 bosses/managers) doing a programming internship for three months, completely unpaid, even paying for my own transport costs. After graduating they offered me a temporary job for three months to do a short amount of work, with the possibility for extension, which I took. Importantly, my brother works there full time, which is how I got into the company. (would not recommended, not because I don't get on with *him*, as I do, but because it's hard not to worry any tension between me and other people (which I'm great at generating) won't somehow affect him)\n\nI have got on really well with everyone there, including the bosses, Mary and Mark. While Mary and Mark act as management and team leaders, they also do marketing, client relations, presentations etc. Basically everything the company needs that isn't programming.\n\nI really like everyone as people. But as coworkers, they're complete nightmares and do not get along at all. Two employee are always making snide remarks at each other under a very weak facade of \"I'm just joking!\" causing a lot of tension. Another employee is constantly late, delays meetings, argues with Mark and talks down to people he is supposed to be teaching. Circular arguments getting increasingly louder with immovable egos are incredibly common. Code is always written \"my way\" with no consistency. The bosses seem perfectly fine with all behaviour, with attempt to reprimand anyone. The way Mary handled my contract broke the law in minor ways at multiple points. Essentially, Mary and Mark seem pretty incompetent at management. It's worth mentioning the entire office is in one room so everyone can hear every conversation. Ultimately, we mutually didn't extend my contract because I did not want to work in that kind of environment. \n\nWhen I started I was given a pretty old laptop with a fairly damaged screen, but otherwise it did work fine. Ok, I thought, I'll just mainly use a monitor (everyone at the company has a laptop and one monitor, some people have two monitors). \n\nI asked Mary if there were any monitors I could use. She directed me to two old monitors, with a vga to vga cable, when my laptop only takes HDMI. I ask people if there are any vga to HDMI adapters, and they essentially say \"there might be some around\". The office is a complete mess with no organisation (of course), so I give up after a few minutes and buy one online. \n\nThe cable arrives, and the monitors don't work. I tell Mary \"I don't think these monitors work with this laptop\" and she agrees the monitors are kind of crappy. I take the cable home and test on my own computer, and they do work, and my work laptop does work with my brother's monitors, meaning the fault is with the old monitors. I tell Mary \"these monitors don't work\". I don't remember the response, but I suppose I assumed I had implied I would like a monitor.\n\nA week later, I mention to everyone during a team meeting, including Mary and Mark, that my monitors don't work. Nothing still happens so I think \"fine, I'm just a temp. Maybe their budget doesn't extend that far\" and left it, except sometimes jokingly mentioning to the others how nice it must be to have two monitors. I also mention in private to my brother how hard it is it work with no monitor, but I thought the issue was closed.\n\nIn their defence, I don't think I ever actually directly asked for them to buy me a new monitor, but it didn't really seem appropriate as a new employee and I wasn't really sure whether the employees bought and owned the monitors they used or if the company did (as it turned out, the company did), or what the standard procedure for well, anything was, bearing in mind this was my first professional job and I didn't want to overstep any boundaries. I also didn't have any kind of \"this is how things work here now\" as I had gone from an intern to an employee, and it had been a year.\n\nI work for two months and the job I was supposed to be doing falls through and I get moved onto doing testing instead of programming, which is *not* what I agreed to, although it does say in my contract they can make me do whatever they think is appropriate. I do not like testing and am not good at it. The little bit of programming I'm expected to do is in a language I don't like and is back-end, when the original work was basically the exact opposite of these two things. I'm unable to do it and my brother has to take it from me, making me feel incredibly stupid and embarrassed. I do nothing and learn nothing for two months, making me already incredibly bitter and feel like I'm utterly wasting my time.\n\nDuring this time there were a few other things that made me feel undervalued and completely unwanted there. Not unwanted personally, but professionally. However, I know I can be a little paranoid, so I ignore it I put down the way I've been treated to incompetence rather than intent. It'll be over soon anyway.\n\nTwo months are past and I have two weeks left. A new guy, Bob, starts working there temporarily for a few months just like me, same age as me too, although he's there to help with the management side of things rather than \"programming\". Mark is away on business and has been for a week or so, so Mary invites Bob to sit at Mark's desk and use his monitors until he gets back. I'm a little annoyed I hadn't been asked to sit there while Mark was away but whatever, I hadn't thought of it either.\n\nA few days after Bob starts, Mary walks in carrying a brand new monitor in a box. Somehow, I already know what she's going to say. \n\n\"Bob's new monitor has arrived!\"\n\nApparently there wasn't a budget, there was just complete apathy. I'm absolutely livid. The angriest I have probably been in years. I want to fucking scream at someone, though I'm not sure what or who at. \"But *I* wanted a monitor!\" probably wouldn't achieve much. It's ridiculous over a fucking *monitor*, but I'm shaking with anger. It's embarrassing. Fortunately, I sit in the corner (worst spot in the office, obviously) and have my headphones in so I sit there for a bit until the conversation dies down and everyone is at their desk. I then go outside and calm down until I stop shaking. I sit back down and try to pretend everything is ok, which really, it should be, but my voice is still shaky and I'm so angry  I can't concentrate on my work for the rest of the day.\n\nNow, as Bob is brand new and was already using a monitor, I doubt he asked for a monitor, Mary would have bought him one.\n\nSomehow the conversation gets back onto monitors and I say something like \"As Bob has a new monitor, could I have a monitor please?\"\n\nMy brother responds with \"oh, did you actually want a monitor?\". \n\nAlthough it's not his responsibility to buy equipment for me, it's Mary's, this still pisses me off. I say as calmly as possible while still an irritated voice \"*Of course* I want a monitor. I mentioned *multiple times* that the monitors you gave me don't work\". \n\n\"Oh, I didn't know that\". Which is a blatant lie. I'm not sure how much clearer I could be than \"these monitors don't work\".\n\nMy brother gave me one of his monitors that works, but it's all a bit bittersweet. Mary still hasn't bought me a monitor.\n\n\nJust to clarify, I'm not angry about Bob getting a monitor and me not, not really. I'm angry that Mary decided that Bob would get something she should have known I needed to be efficient. Someone that did not spend three months doing completely free work and someone that did not spend two weeks trying to politely prompt her. How else am I meant to feel but unwanted in that workplace?\n\nI'm angry at the complete apathy I feel is directed towards me, for no apparent reason. I'm angry that I'm treated like an intern not an employee. The monitor was just the final straw. If I wasn't leaving already, I would think about quitting asap.\n\nSo I don't think I'm an asshole for being annoyed about the monitor thing, but am I the asshole for being being entitled? Am I the asshole for being as angry as I am over something trivial? Am I the asshole for not trying hard enough to communicate and then getting angry?",

      "description": "Ok, so I'm brazilian and this is important for two reasons:\n1) Our families are larger and everybody is much more dependent on one another comparing to northern countries - people here usually stay at their parents' houses until they can fully support themselves or get married, and lots of families (such as mine) remain at their hometowns until death or something special like a job offer happens. Therefore, it's unlikely that I can just ignore this issue as I'll probably be pressured to meet them in a near future.\n2) The recent presidential election really divided the nation in people who support Bolsonaro and people who strongly oppose him, like me. It was no surprise to anyone that my uncle would vote for him: he's always had extremely racist, homophobic and misogynistic opinions, and had no shame on sharing them even before Bolsonaro made it \"OK\". \nThe thing is during the campaign things got really intense so I decided to cut bonds with him, even writing a message to my family stating I could no longer regard as my relative someone who supports the execution or exclusion of 80% of the people I hang out with. At the time most of my family supported my decision, since everyone was very nervous about the possibility of the now president winning. However, now that things have settled down and with a new baby on the family, everyone is surrounding him with love, something I just don't feel comfortable on doing no matter how much I respect and applaud his decision of adopting a child with his wife. I wish all the best for their family but I have no intentions on meeting them right now, as I would have no idea what face I'd keep or what I'd say to someone who  is absolutely the opposite of me. I am sure that my mom will say that I'm an asshole if I tell her all of this when eventually my time comes to go there, so I need to check others' opinions first. So Reddit, am I the asshole here? Also, Am I an asshole for sincerely feeling sorry for this kid's likely education, even though he is much better with a supporting family?\n\ntl;dr: I cut bonds with my racist, homophobe uncle and have no intentions on meeting him just because he now has a child.

      "description": "Friend recently had a bachelorette party in Vegas, about 15 guests, everyone had to travel. The guests were a mixture of grad (including me), undergrad, and a few high school friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSister is MOH, but nobody really took charge organizing. There were a few things the bride-to-be wanted to do, including a open bar Ferris Wheel and a Drag Brunch, but they were about 2-3h of the entire weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrad friends and I tried to research things to do and take advantage of our time, but the undergrad friends were impossible to move. In response to any suggestion, they would hem and haw and reject all ideas by wasting time without ever suggesting anything. We asked the bride many times what she would prefer, but she just always said she was fine with whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrad friends were interested in going to a Vegas nightclub. The first night, we got dinner nearby then went to some regular bars next to our casino. Fun, but basically not any different than we could have done locally. The next day we brought the idea up again, but the undergrad friends expressed doubt about lines, cost, the dress code, and some worried they would be charged a cover if the bouncer didn’t find them attractive enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater we went to a Thunder Down Under show based on the recommendation of the high school friends, and afterwards we spent at least 20 minutes standing outside while people debated what to do next. Nobody else had an idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUndergrad friends were hungry, so grad friends and I suggested they (and bride who was also hungry) eat while check out the club before it opened. If it seemed like a douchey place then we could come back, if not they would come meet us. We did that and we tried to call them and tell them we got on the guest list, but they only told us they were “lost” and seemed incoherent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnded up going to the club anyways instead of spending the night with the bride, and we stayed there for several hours. It was very fun, and it was by far the cheapest thing we did the entire weekend. Got our cover waived because we dressed appropriately and got there early to avoid lines, got free drink tickets, and after a while our promoter came in and made his own drinks that he also gave us for free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater found out that the rest of the group spent the next hour and a half going between different fast food places and went to bed by 11:30. Which makes it hard to regret ditching them. It was very expensive to go on this trip, and I feel like it would have been a total waste if we hadn’t done some Vegas-specific things. But I do feel badly that we didn’t spend the night with the bachelorette. She hasn't expressed any dissatisfaction with the weekend, but I still feel guilty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: A group of us ditched the main bachelorette party to go to a club in Vegas instead of spending our time with the Bride-to-Be wandering between fast food joints.",

March 1st was chosen for 1.) being a Friday 2.) being the only Friday without another school event happening at the same time 3.) being her kid's birthday so she could save a bit before the big 18th birthday debut next year. Side note: they were very, very, ***very*** rich enough to not *need* to save, but extra bucks is always good, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the prom program, Nic is upset and all pouty. She talks to no one but her boyfriend, and only after the prom at a private party at a small bar at the hotel we were staying at (mine and Nic's friend circle + her mom and boyfriend) does he relay the message to us friends to find a way to leave the place because Nic was Not Happy Being There because she didn't have her own birthday party or even a cake or gift, and she felt that a small private party instead of a grand celebration like she had every other year but this 2019 \"demeaned\" her birthday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe friends hold in rolling our eyes. We know Nic has high standards and gift-giving is hard because 1.) she's rich 2.) she likes material gifts 3.) she's picky about what she receives and she *will* say it to your face if she hates your gift (Side note 2: this is the one year we didn't give her a gift because prom preparations. most of our circle is also not rich, so prom alone is a big hole in our wallets), but because birthday we restrain ourselves and pull her away from the bar in hopes she'd be happy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe wasn't. Pouting and stomping the whole time all the way up to our room. I get she is the youngest in our circle by a year, but I am two seconds away from giving her a private talk at school next week about her materialism and childishness, but WIBTA if I went through with that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Rich friend upset by not having bday party/gifts.

      "description": "\nTLDR at the end of he post\n\nI am a person with a rather high sex drive - i need sex often and feel real bad when I am deprived of orgasms. What I mean is daily to feel happy and every other day to function without missing it.\n\n I've been with my husband for over 6 years, we went through different times - moved in together, I got pregnant, had our child, bought and are currently paying for our home together, etc. I knew I needed a sexually active partner as this is one of the reasons why my previous relationship ended - my ex and I got to a point where we were intimate once a week or even once in 10 days. We had other issues as well of course. \n\nAnyway, so my husband and I were frank in the start or our relations and he knew how important intimacy would be for me. \nAbout a year and a half after our child was born we had our bedroom finally to ourselves and surprisingly started having less sex than ever. He was always tired or not in the mood or had a headache, etc. This lead to an incredible tension in our relationship and made me feel alone and unattractive. I realised I needed to take care of my own needs instead or relying on the person who supposedly wanted and loved me. \n\nFast forward one year, he confessed that he has been masturbating almost daily. He did need to relieve his needs but did not feel like getting intimate with me because it takes more time and efforts. \nHe says I have been putting too much pressure on him to be intimate and this way have been pushing him away. I do get very nervous when sex deprived and become a naggy evil version of myself. \nI have always believed that when in a relationship the greatest part of one's sexual activity would be involving your partner so was extremely dissapointed that he preferred his own company to mine. \nJust to add as it may be relevant - my physical appearance has been affected by the pregnancy but not too significantly - I am not a supermodel but still good looking in my humble opinion and when we do have sex it has and still is great for both of us. I have also been open to new ideas and practices and only refused one of his ideas as I was physically incapable of assuming the position 😁\n\nSo is it too much to ask when you are in a committed relationship with a person with a similar sex drive for them to come to you when the mood strikes, instead of taking care of themselves only?\n\nTLDR AITA for expecting my husband to have sex with me when feeling horny instead of masturbating and keeping me away?

Honesty gets you furthest in life, i'm all about that, but this bundle would be so nice to have and i don't have the money to pay more, my friends also pointed out that the store does a routine check up of the system and such, so it is their responsibility and not mine, so i shouldn't be upfront with them and just see what happens...",

      "description": "I am 17F and I graduated from high school last year. I also had depressive/anxious tendencies for a while as a result of bullying primary school that made it difficult for me to keep friends.\n\n\nThroughout high school, I had a large group of friends, about 15 people, both guys and girls. We all liked the same things, had lots of fun times together and there was hardly ever any drama. Everything was fine and good. Until Year 11, when negative thoughts started surfacing. I assumed it was just the pressures of senior school and then Year 12 rolled around. I became more introverted, hardly ever going out to social events/parties with them and on the rare occasion that I did, had a supremely terrible time due to my thoughts. I eventually came to the conclusion that I had to leave this group, as I didn’t belong with them anymore and they didn’t need me anyway. I started seeing a counsellor around the middle of last year to cope and under her advice, I made a small group chat with about 5 of my friends. Everybody there was very willing to help but were reluctantly supportive of my wanting to leave if it ever came to that.\n\n\nAll of them except my best friend at the time, let’s call him Bill. He offered to help whenever I needed it but was very adamant that he, and the group as a whole, wouldn’t let me go, which really bothered me. After my 6 month trial with the counsellor ended, I immediately had a relapse and I’m certain this was because I hadn’t gotten away from the problem. I had made up my mind: they were enabling these thoughts and I needed to get away from them. Following this decision, graduation came and went, I left all the group chats I was in with them and declined all invitations for get togethers. \n\n\nThat was in late December and I had gone about 2 months without speaking to them. It hadn’t been long but I already felt worlds better, like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders. However, 2 nights ago, Bill got in touch with me. I tried to make it clear I wanted him to leave me alone but as he is very stubborn, he still didn’t listen. He said something along the lines of ‘nothing changed, you were supposed to be our friend for a lifetime and that hasn’t changed’ which really got on my nerves. I practically exploded at the guy for that, telling him not to delude himself, to forget about me and stop texting me because the only thing that will come of it is negativity, etc.\n\n\nI was so sure that I made the right decision, though as I’m writing this I’m starting to doubt myself. I believe that friendships are a 2 way street and if one or more parties are unhappy, it won’t work out and they should be allowed to sever it.\n\n\nWhat do you think, guys? AITA?\n",

Also I'm not sure I could commit to her longterm because she has no real drive or direction in life(she got a DUI and then got kicked from the navy a year later) and I'm not willing to support her forever. She's really sweet and good to me but can't get her shit together.\n\nAnyhow, me and her were dating but living in seperate apartments. After she got the DUI and kicked out of the service her Insurance and car payments(she bought a brand new car, financially irresponsible I know) were too much for the job she was working so she decided to move back home to afford her car(Neither of us live near any family and her family is 6 hours away in Jersey). Well she was always texting me about it back at home and she was miserable and ended up couch hopping and sleeping in her car. I missed her and thought \"maybe I can help her out and get my girlfriend back for a while by letting her crash with me\". So I asked if she wanted to move in with me rent free until she got a better job and got back on her feet.\n\nShe's been with me 2 months now. As a stay-at-home girlfriend she's great but she hasnt made much headway as far as 'getting back on her feet' is concerned. She found a job waitressing but it didnt make good money and she hated it so she quit. I told her not to and to keep the job until she found a better one(since low money beats no money) and she asked if I'd be angry if she quit. YES. I WILL, YOU DON'T PAY RENT AND YOU'RE APPROACHING 90 DAYS DELINQUENT ON ALL YOUR BILLS! She quit anyway and I got pissed and told her that if she doesnt have a job within the next month I was kicking her out with literally nothing going on in her life. \n\nShe doesn't seem to be purposely sucking at life, she gets really stressed about her position and recognizes it's her fault but still makes poor decisions and life choices(like quitting her job when shes in crazy debt)\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA for kicking my girlfriend out of the house with no job or money if she really can't find a job in the next month?",

      "description": "Our relationship is generally healthy; however, whenever I'm having a bad week it goes to shit. Recently, a lot has been going on in my life. A family member is very ill, I've been overwhelmed with schoolwork and work-work, and I've been trying to find a job for after graduation, which I need because of financial issues. On top of that, we've been looking at apartments to move in together, but because of his work schedule I've been doing all of the looking and contacting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis week has been particularly bad, so I asked for his support and to just listen when I want to rant. There were a few times where I had to remind him he should just listen instead of giving solutions or trying to involve himself in the situation. After a few times of reminding him and him not listening, I got increasingly frustrated. Finally, I got angry and said its not fair that I have to be the one helping him be supportive, and that's not real support. He says that its unfair for me to say its not real support because he likes when I give him directions when he's stressed so he's doing the same. I countered with the fact that our forms of support are different, and while he does get credit for trying, its clearly not a huge effort because he never changes (its been years). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter two days of fighting, he finally agreed to try to do better. BUT he won't take the time to actually talk because he's so busy, and he doesn't have any actual solutions to make sure this doesn't happen again. So I said he needs to try harder; he made my already terrible week so much worse, and I'm not going to settle on an apology anymore. I said he isn't trying hard enough to help when I need it and I end up in much worse shape. He said that's unfair because he should get credit for being supportive, even if it isn't helpful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, AITA for telling my boyfriend he isn't trying hard enough? ",

      "description": "Last semester, I meet a cute girl with a mutual friend in the library, ask for her snap, etc. Her and I go on to have two more awkward encounters before the last day of finals where I invite her to a party at my best friend’s house later that day. At the party, she meets my best friend and they hit it off and start talking. They talk over winter break and things sort of fizzle when we come back, and I start to become good friends with her because we have a class together. \n\nAbout a month later, I’m pretty much talking to her on the phone every day for 2+ hours, and staying after our last class to hang out with her for the same amount of time. She has become one of my closest friends. I let her know that I’m uncomfortable with her and my best friend doing anything (which she says she’s ok with). She introduces me to her best friend and my best friend, her, her best friend, and I all go to her house when she her parents aren’t home. I hook up with her friend and she hooks up with mine. \n\nHer friend and I decide that it was a one time thing and my friend and her decide to become fwb.  Then, all she talks about is my friend, and she claims to be in love with him (after a week or two). I tell her that I don’t think I can be a part of this friendship because I feel used and that our friendship has been more about my best friend rather than our own personal relationship. It particularly struck a chord due to my own feelings of inadequacy and constant comparisons to my best friends (which I had confided in her about). \n\nTl;dr I meet a girl, she meets my best friend, things don’t work out, we become friends, she tries again with my best friend, and I cut her off.

Everything was going pretty smoothly until one of the leaders of the project said something that kind of triggered me. ( I'll refer to him as G)\n\nWe were suppose to order custom made t-shirts for one of our events. But G said that he already ordered the shirts without consulting us.

I then asked if I could meet him personally after. \n\nIn our one to one conversation, I said:\n'Hey, G? Can I ask what is your thought process? What were you thinking?'\nHe didn't say anything, probably knowing that he did something wrong.\n\n'Look, I'm not mad. But what you done there is very risky. What happens if we overspend?' then I kept going on without him muttering a word.\n\n'Next time, please consult us (the committee) before doing anything. We have a limited budget, so please think properly before you spend. ' \nAfter that he left without saying another word. \n\nWas I too harsh?

I planned to kill myself and entered into very, very bad \"don't care ruining my life fuck you\" tendencies; including prostitution.\n\n  \nMoved to live with ex, was rocky but I tried my best for those 3-4 years (broke up because of me being hollow and her cheating on me along with some... questionably forced sex from them.) I have been out of a job over the past 1 1/2 years, due to my mental+physical illnesses/\"bad\" job history/ and semi-successfully freelance illustrating. During this time, I've been working hard on improving our mental health (she works a stable job and has medicine for depression+anxiety; I do not.) I cook meals to provide him with balanced meals, clean, do any chores and errands so they don't have to, coupon chasing (can't get groceries myself,) providing on bills when commissions are steady, blah blah blah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've recently been trying to get a stable job but my resume is completely fucking garbage due to all of this. I've lost/quit jobs in order, for: \n\nStealing food that was going to be thrown away from the kitchenette as it was either that or both of us starve. \n\nNo called, no showed after getting sexually harassed and humiliated by the assistant manager, (who would feel my ass and between thighs area, work overtime every day I was there, and made me make orangutan noises for my paycheck.) \n\nNo called, no showed after trying to kill myself a couple times.  \n\n\nMy work ethic however was top notch (barring sometimes being depressed and not forcing smiles, eesh.) Usually worked 8+ hours, covered anyone's shifts if they asked (grammas love you if you let them go home an hour early to visit their grandkids!!!) If it's slow I helped restock, helped others with their stations/cleaning, and usually came in 15\\~ minutes early everyday.  \n\n\nTL:DR- **Am I an asshole for \"forcing\" my roomie to work their job while I do the housework/errands, contribute with commission money, and working on my portfolio-- instead of trying to get food service jobs (with an overall \"shady\" work history) that will affect my mental and physical health, but provide stable income?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your consideration and judgement ~~my brain won't stop guilt-tripping me.~~",

      "description": "Little bit of context to start things off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy biological father (if you could call him that) was a heavy smoker. Whenever he would drop me off at school he would constantly be smoking in the car, or he would be smoking in the house (I lived with my mother, but stayed at his every other weekend). On top of the constant smoking, when the driver-side car window broke, he decided to still smoke in the car, instead having my window rolled down (Whenever I tried to get into the back he got extremely pissed off at me.) so the smoke would pass right by me. Eventually I walked out on him for reasons I'd rather not get into (though I will say, best decision of my life, haven't looked back once), but even after over half a decade it's left me with a very negative association between him and cigarettes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of that, I just *hate* the smell. It brings me close to gagging every time, and it takes everything I have to not start gagging, and I can't always hide my discomfort of the smell. When possible I'll just distance myself from the person or people smoking, but it's not always possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, on to why I came here. The last time I babysat for my sister, she got pretty annoyed at me being visibly uncomfortable after she had went out to smoke, and we ended up getting into a somewhat heated argument in which I was told to \"get over it\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Am I the asshole for not being able to get over my negative association and general disliking of smoking?",

We had both fallen out with the mutual friend that was interested in her, so I didn't feel guilty and went for it.\n\nWe made out for a bit and she wanted to have sex but I didn't because it was really late (5:30am - I had to wake up in 3 hours), and she seemed more drunk than me so I was unsure.\n\nThe next morning she texted and asked me to not tell anyone because she was \"really drunk and has a boyfriend\". This was the first I had heard that she was no longer in an open relationship (I assume that happened over the summer vacation).  \n\nIt's been a long time but I kept to her deal and didn't tell anyone - so no-one knows except me and her.\n\nI don't think she thinks I'm an asshole, but I'm scared it wasn't fully consensual because she was definitely more drunk than me...

      "description": "Sorry, this is a rambling mess.\n\nMy boyfriend has been out of work since maybe June of 2018. During that time I've been covering all of our expenses; rent, utilities, etc. Even his car payment for a couple months before he went on unemployment. I'd like to note that he has worked hard to find a job and has a promising upcoming interview. But even when he had a job, I covered the majority of our expenses since he had payments to make on his student loans and his car.\n\nNow, I'm not necessarily a high earner. I get about $18 an hour. So, things can still be pretty tight and I have some no-interest debts of my own. I support both of us and he gives me what he can from his unemployment checks after paying for his car and keeping some for himself. Sometimes he gives me too much and has to ask for money from me to cover something. He's aware of how stressed I get when it comes to money. \n\nThough I know he owes me upwards of $5000 at this point, I would never ask for him to give me the entirety of his income each time he gets a check. Having some cash and being in control of what you do with it is a freedom which I consider very important. So I believe it's his choice what he does with his money and I don't have a right to dictate how he spends it.\n\nHowever.....\n\nI'm having a particularly rough month due to some surprise expenses, of which he is aware. Today he texted me to tell me that he had paid someone to play on his Xbox account in order to get a specific reward which required a lot of time commitment, practice, and skill since it was a competitive reward. I know how much the game means to him, it is our main hobby and the primary way we interact with our friends from our hometown and college. He said it wasn't a lot of money and that it's something that had been weighing on him, which is why he chose to do it. He said he wanted to tell me about it and hoped it didn't change my opinion of him. He said it costed less than what he normally keeps for himself from his paycheck, so he sent me a bit more than his usual amount.\n\nI couldn't pretend like I wasn't disappointed. I said if the gun really was more important to him than helping me pay rent was, I'd learn to live with it. I admit I spoke with some resentment as I told him I was used to it. So he told me to take the money and cease the attitude. \n\nI can tell that my disappointment and words have hurt him and he thinks I shouldn't have viewed his decision that way. Am I the asshole for getting upset about how he decides to spend his paycheck? He never comments on my selfish purchases when they occur. But, of course, I don't owe him money.\n\n\nTL;DR\nI cover mine and my out-of-work boyfriend's expenses, he helps with some of his unemployment checks. He spent some money on an in-game reward so now I'm a bit miffed because money's tight and it seems he doesn't care that I need all the help I can get. He's miffed that I'm miffed.",

      "description": "This story requires a long context because there’s a lot of history behind this one friend. Sorry for the length... \nContext:\nSo I have this group of friends that I absolutely love. We’ll call this group A. Group A and I are still in HS, we play video games and hang out all of the time, however in my freshman year I also hung out with another group, group B (this will be important later)\n\nIn our group, group A, we have this friend that is normally really chill, however 4 weeks ago he just stopped talking to us. Like, cut us out of his life completely. He hasn’t talked to us and he’s just basically been ignoring us It turns out, he started hanging out with group B, and the reason I stopped talking to them was because our schedules were conflicted and they couldn’t reach me either. Regardless, us in group A were a bit salty because he didn’t bother to tell us he would be hanging with another group, but it’s fine, whatever. \n\nPersonally, I have not known this group as long as they’ve known each other. They have history. Now according to one of my friends, this kid has cut group A out of his life 3 times already, but he always comes back. What he does is, he finds what he thinks is a cool group of friends, and he leaves group A for that group and comes back when he realizes they are all douches. This is the first time he’s done this while I’ve been apart of this friend circle. \n\nWe wouldn’t really care that he found new people, except for the fact that:\n-he completely ignored and cut us out without warning/ letting us know.\n\n-this time he openly said he didn’t want to hang out with us because we were too “cringey” for him. Recently however, he made a dance with group B and put it on YT (I’m going to remain neutral here but it could definitely pass as cringey). Keep in mind group A and B are really chill, group A (us) is only mad at that one kid.\n\n-he had the audacity to ask our parents for rides to and from school even though he hadn’t talk to us in four weeks. One of the moms he left hanging, basically she was waiting for him but then he decided to go with group B and wasted the parent’s time. \n\n-I took summer PE with him so I could take extra classes, and he was always throwing shade at me whenever we were around other people to look cool. My school’s insta posted a picture of my face and he screenshotted it and zoomed in and used it to make fun of me, friendly banter but still it bothers me\n\nOk there’s the context, now the story\n\nSo group A and I are in our normal lunch spot, when group b and the kid walk past us. As they walk by, I yelled out, “hey &gt;his name&lt;!”  And did the dance that he did in group b’s video in front of him and the entire group B (but only he noticed, and since I was friends with group B in the past they know I didn’t mean it towards them). I did so in a mocking and condescending manner. Two of my friends said I might have taken it too far, 3 of them think he deserved it. Am I the asshole for mocking the dance that he did?\n\nSorry it’s so long... and if its bad formatting I’m on mobile.\n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway account as partner also has reddit, etc. \n\nBit of backstory:\n\nI've had anger issues for a long time. In the past 4 years I started making progress to deal with them (Note: I'm in my late 20s) and have come a long way. I'm in no way perfect and I know I make a lot of mistakes.\n\nI've been married to my Partner(P) for roughly 9 years. The first few years of our relationship were not good ones and I can't imagine why they stayed. But they stuck by me through the terrible parts and I love them SO much for that. This is one of the main reasons why I've been working so hard on myself, along with self improvement, etc. I want to show them they're worth every bit of time and effort.\n\nThings have certainly been much better than they were and P is also a great part of why because they've been working on themself and we're learning to work well with each other. (I don't know if P agrees things have been much better, but I digress.)\n\nSo, here's the situation:\n\nBecause of the way I grew up I have a hard time telling the tone of someone's voice. I often hear something being said to me as sarcastically or angrily even when it's not and I can't easily tell the differences between sad and angry. The worst part is that this is also for my *own* tone. When I'm overly emotional I can't tell what I sound like. This can make P feel like my words are being said with sarcasm, or malice, when they aren't. In the past I would at times use sarcasm and malice during arguments too, so that probably makes it even harder to tell.\n\nThe problem I'm having is that I've become so much more skilled at calming down and talking rationally, but my still-apparently-angry tone makes that hard for P to believe. When I'll apologize to them for hurting them, they'll tell me I don't sound sincere no matter how sincere I meant it. When I admit my wrongs, my angry tone leads them to believe I'm blaming them for the argument, even when I'm not. \n\nI do my best to try to understand where P is coming from. I'm not trying to invalidate their side of things or make this a them vs me issue. We've had a *lot* of conversations on this topic over the years and I know it's not fair to expect them to be able to see past my tone. I'm not trying to say they're the asshole in this situation, so please don't pin them as one.\n\nIt's just very frustrating to me that I can be pushing myself far beyond my comfort zone to apologize or admit I'm wrong only to be told I'm not sounding sincere. I've asked P before to not instantly question that sincerity because of my tone as it really hurts me, but I'm usually reminded that they have a right to ask. I generally agree with them on that kind of thing so I've been letting it go.\n\nLast night we got into an argument.  When I was calm I apologized to P only to be told I didn't seem very sincere, so I became frustrated with myself. We kept talking, but at some point my tone must have changed. I made sure to tell them their feelings were valid, before I tried to explain my point of view and what they had done to hurt me. \n\nDue to my tone P assumed that I was blaming them and when I tried to explain that I wasn't, they didn't believe me. I told them it wasn't fair to assume what I meant, especially because we'd talked about my struggles with coming across properly in the past. P informed me that they weren't 'assuming', they were basing their opinion on my tone. I started getting even more frustrated and I knew I was reaching a bad point, so I cut off communication again. \n\nThis happened two more times before we went to bed. Both times, when P would question my sincerity, I would become hurt and frustrated. Both times, when I asked P to stop questioning me because of my tone as I've explained I know I'm not coming across well, and the repeated disbelief is *really* hurting me, they told me they had a right to. \n\nI want to note: I agree with them. They DO have a right to question if I'm being sincere and they ARE allowed to ask me. \n\nI'm wondering... AITA for expecting them to stop when asked?",

      "description": "I work as a janitor at my local theater with a group if 3 others. I've worked with all of them very close and we've become good friends. But I'm the only one who drives. One rides their bike, one takes the bus or Lyft, and the final one gets a ride to and from but sometimes walks to work and gets picked up after. \n\nNow I'm not saying I never give him a ride, because I have a few times in the past. As well as my coworker who takes Lyft. I've offered to give them rides whenever I'm able to and my car has the gas. But I live in the opposite direction of this guy. It's like an extra 45 minutes added on to my already 20 minute drive home. I wouldnt be too upset if it was every few weeks or so. But he constantly asks for rides every other day. He also doesnt pay me back in gas money. Which would make the whole situation null.\n\nSo the other day he asked me for a ride home because his ride would be about 10 minutes late. In my head I rolled my eyes and tried to come up with some BS story. I told him that I had to get home because my brother needed the car (that's not a truly fake lie because my brother borrows my car sometimes, today just wasnt one of those days) he shrugged and kind of lowkey begged but I was persistent. This happens about 3 or 4 times a week whenever I work with him\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "[I've been rewriting this post to add details for a few hours. Finally posting, after debating if I should or shouldn't. And created a new Reddit account to keep myself anonymous]\n\nBackground: The friend in this story, \"X\" and I have been friends since we were in first grade. She was my first best friend. We were school mates, and hung out on and off. When she got married we were very close. And when she went through a divorce a few years ago, and I've been at her side through that. Mid last year, I made a major life changing move, and I've been spending time alone to heal and relax. Therefore, my friends (she included) assumes I'm mad at them or something. \n\nTimeline:\n\nAugust 2018 - I lent some money to X. She was jobless and broke at that time. While we were hanging out, she mentioned just how broke she was and couldn't pay her bills. I felt like lending that money would help her out. She refused the money saying she won't be able to pay back the next month. I gave it nonetheless, saying to pay me back when she gets a job. She thanked me and was happy. \n\nSeptember - nothing eventful\n\nOctober -  X got a job middle of the month, which means she gets half salary by the end of the month. She messaged me and told me that she would like to pay for some other stuff, and asked if it's okay if she pays from her November salary (which she will get before 1st December). I said okay, since I was doing okay financially. \n\nNovember -  Nothing eventful\n\nDecember - 1st went by and she didn't pay.. and I didn't ask. I needed the money for January due to medical reasons. I asked her somewhere in mid December if she can pay by January 1st, from her salary. However, she tells me she did not get paid in November. She even showed screenshots of her conversation with her HR manager, which I didn't ask  her for. I postponed by medical thing. \n\nJanuary mid -  I wasn't feeling well and really needed to show the doctor. I didn't have enough money for tests, therefore I asked again about the money. She showed more screenshots. I said it's okay. And I worried about the salary for her sake. I borrowed from my family to show the doctor. \n\nJanuary almost end - X informed me that she has quit the job. I was surprised. I asked her what happened, and she said she wasn't \"feeling it\" at the job. That has been the excuse for the last two years, with jobs and relationships (since she got divorced). Once again I said okay, because at this point again I was financially okay (since I got my salary plus a bonus) and didn't desperately need that money. \n\nFebruary 3rd-ish - X messages and asks me why I'm distant. She asked if she did something wrong. I was at work, and couldn't respond immediately, which sent her on a messaging spree. It went from \"I miss hanging out with you?\" to \"I didn't ask you to give me that money, you forced it on me\" in just an hour. I had turned my phone on silent, to avoid being distracted. After work, I messaged her and explained to her that I was unable to respond as I was at work and busy. I also apologized to her for not hanging out with her, and explained to her that I needed alone time lately which had nothing to do with money. She still pressed on the money part, saying that it wasn't nice of me to force the money on her when she didn't ask for it. I simply apologized, and haven't spoken/texted since\n\nI feel terrible, I've been thinking over this for the last couple of days. It reminded me of how my sister treated me regarding a loan (short version: she wanted the money asap when I was jobless). Because of it, I promised myself two things 1. Never borrow from her  2. If I'm lending money,  not to be an asshole like she was. And I feel like in this situation she feels I forced the money on her. \n\nSo, dear Reddit.. am I the asshole here? \n\n...\n\nTl;dr: Gave money to friend for her bills, while she said no coz she can't pay back soon. Asked her to pay back when she gets job. She gets job. She said need more time. She quits job. She tells me she never asked me to lend her the money anyway. AITA?\n",

      "description": "So I dated this girl for 5 months and we barely had time to hang out and I knew it wasn't going to last long, we also kept it tight under covers so no one really knew about it. About a month ago she decided to hang out with another guy when we hadn't hung out for a month and it caused a fight that she didn't handle right (she told me to shut up and not talk to her for the rest of the day, I am the kind of person that wants to talk through things and figure out why it happened) so we were cold for a week and we decided it wasn't going to work out between us and broke up. We decided that we would stay best friends with a basis of trust, honesty and respect. \n\nAlthough we decided that she never really spoke her mind with me and started ignoring me and barely let me know anything. She said that her ignoring me wasn't her intention when I told her about it.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago I found out from one of our mutual good friends that he is dating her and has been doing so for 2 weeks now and that he liked her while we were still dating and that she also liked him while we were still dating. He and I were good friends before I started dating her and he also has been good friends with her for 2 years before I even knew her. \n\nI talked with him a little and we got into an argument about different views and I just left him on read and haven't spoken to her since then, I have also been ignoring her while around her in person.\n\nHe believes that she deserves to be happy and that nothing should hurt her and cause her unnecessary stress. On the contrast I believe that she should confront her bad decision making throughout our time apart and take responsibility for totally disregarding trust, honest and respect. I also believe that she should grow up and become a strong person in herself where as he wants her to stay protected from the world. \n\nAITA?\n\nI'm sorry if it's kind of confusing for anyone, I'm pretty confused myself at this point.\n",

I have 3 Christmas gatherings I usually go to, my house, my grandma’s side, and my Grandpa’s side. He has agreed to go my house for Christmas but absolutely refuses to go to my extended family’s Christmas gatherings, even after I said that I just wanted to stay for 20 minutes at most. He says that he feels uncomfortable around them because his family doesn’t have big gatherings for Christmas. I understand that, but I feel like he should at least make an effort to meet my family because the relationship has gotten so serious. I told him that I didn’t want to take any steps further into our relationship unless he made an effort to meet my family. He says that it’s unfair of me to try and force him to meet them by me saying I didn’t want to marry him until at least meets them, but I just feel like he isn’t taking this serious enough. \n\nAITA for not wanting to take the relationship any further until he meets my family? \n",

      "title": "AITA for wanting an apology for rude and sexist jokes during dinner from my SO’s family, even though my meal was paid for?",
      "description": "I recently went out to dinner with my SO, his parents who were in town visiting, his BIL, and the BIL’s friend. This was my first time meeting the BIL and friend, and let me tell you it was not a great first impression.\n\nMy SO and I arrive and the friend introduces himself by asking for “a hug from the lady, always gotta hug the ladies.” I am already mildly uncomfortable because I’m sorta weird about physical contact and to me, hugs are reserved for trusted and loved family and friends, not some dude who is basically a stranger to me. I just kind of go with it because I don’t want to look cold or rude right off the bat.\n\nWe wait for our food. The family doesn’t see the BIL too often since he lives far away (he just happened to be in town for an event), and the topics they’re talking about aren’t things I know much about or can relate to (one of these topics is a motorcycle event they enjoy going to, and based on their stories I’m now aware BIL is basically enabled to ride drunk without anyone trying to at least encourage him not to...fantastic). I’m also kind of a quiet person by nature and it usually takes me a while to open up to people, especially meeting others in groups. I do a lot more listening than talking until the BIL asks me to introduce myself. I start trying to tell him a little about myself, like what I’m majoring in, etc and he starts teasing me for being too quiet. Ok I’m used to it, I’ve been hearing the same lame jokes since elementary school and I don’t let it phase me. Every time I try to get a word out though, he keeps cutting me off with “speak up, what are you so quiet for?” and “why do you talk so fast?” I’m getting a little annoyed at this point because I’m pretty sure he can hear me and is just being a smartass. I try to play it off with a lame joke back and then just kind of give up and let the conversation flow elsewhere. Probably worth mentioning that he was considerably drunk at this point. \n\nThen, BIL looks at my SO and says something akin to “I bet she’s the perfect wife because she never talks back when you argue.” This gets a laugh out of SO’s father and the friend, and the three of them start bantering about it. The jokes devolve into getting very nasty very quickly. “Everything from the waist down, no just a torso with legs and boobs, now that’s the perfect woman. Just like a mannequin. Just like...” I’ve tried blocking most of it out from my mind but, ewww. This went on for probably a straight 5-10 minutes. I’m used to crass humor from SO’s father but nothing **that** bad, and I definitely felt like it was directed at me. Anxiety got the better of me and in the moment I couldn’t think of any way to shut it down or defend myself without ether inviting more crude jokes, being rude and stooping to their level, or risking looking like an “offended snowflake”.\n\nSO’s mom at least stood up to them after they picked on her for being on her phone during dinner (which according to her was both for her busy job and to drown out the crude conversation). She flipped them off and they all laughed about it her included, and I guess that made me feel slightly better but not much because it was still mostly being enabled.\n\nWe eat dinner and I’m anxiously waiting to leave. After hugging everyone through gritted teeth (yes, including the friend at his insistence of a “goodbye hug,” barf), SO and I drive home. I tell him how upset and uncomfortable I felt during the whole experience, and how I wished he had done more to stand up for me. His response is that he understands where I’m coming from and is sorry it turned out that way, but that I need to be my own person and defend myself instead of always relying on him. I decide that’s completely fair, but I still wanted an apology from his family for acting so rudely. He had to drive his parents to the airport the next morning so I ask him to tell his father that I want an apology (I don’t really see much point in contacting the BIL because he doesn’t regularly stay in touch with my SO and because he probably wouldn’t even remember half of it even though he was the worst offender). I have had other frustrating situations with the family in the past but this is the only time I have ever tried pursuing it farther because I genuinely felt that my line had been crossed.\n\nHis father wasn’t sorry at all. It was a textbook “sorry you feel that way” response. According to him the jokes “weren’t about me,” he didn’t feel that he or anyone else at the table did anything wrong, and I was being entitled for having a problem with it when they paid for my meal and when I “ordered something different from the rest of the table.”\n\nI know this is where some people might call me out for burying the lede since I mentioned it in the title and didn’t bring it up again, and that’s a completely fair assessment as long as you’ve read this far. Yes they paid for my meal, and maybe I’m at fault for that. This was not a fancy establishment in case that’s relevant, it was a family friendly casual dining/sports pub place (not Buffalo Wild Wings, but similar enough). Most of the table ordered wings to share. I got something cheap and small appetizer-sized because I always feel kind of gross after eating the wings there. I wasn’t the only one with a different/modified order though. BIL had to get an order modification due to a food allergy, and the friend ordered his own special boneless wings too, all on one check. If everyone else had gotten normal wings I would have probably just sucked it up, and SO had even encouraged me to get something different if I wanted so I figured there wouldn’t be any bad feelings if I did. Also, if I’d known they were planning to drink, I would have probably just stayed home and let them have family time, so I feel like it was kind of unfair to not be told in advance and then be expected to entertain people who had been drinking (SO and I aren’t typically social drinkers, and his parents know this). They also had borrowed a charger from me earlier in the week that cost more than my meal and I still haven’t gotten it back... maybe that’s just me being petty though.\n\nOverall, I felt disgusted at the dinner conversation material and even disappointed that a family member SO often talked fondly of ended up being so obnoxious upon actually meeting them. SO tried to persuade me to call his father myself to talk things out and stand up for myself, but I just didn’t see the point anymore if he already thought my feelings were invalid and so I wasn’t going to bother demanding a fake apology. I still feel lousy and cheated though. AITA?",

They are in a committed relationship now. Tonight, she talked about how he almost said “I love you” to her. \n\nWhile this is lovely news, she absolutely deserves this relationship, I’m truly happy for her, I found myself not being able to express excitement in the moment because me and my guy are drifting apart. I realized I was way more invested than he was, and overall feel extremely rejected and even heartbreak. I was led to believe that him and I were really working out and I was happy to have met someone who was actually good until I found out that he doesn’t share the same enthusiasm as me. \n\nThere was a awkward moment because I wasn’t as giddy as she was when she was telling me her happy news. I really wanted to let her know that deep down I am happy for her. But the issue between me and my guy is super fresh so I haven’t had much time to heal and all I could think about in the moment was how badly I wish that was me and my guy. \n\nI know that as a friend, I need to be there with my friends for the good times and the bad, but AITA for not being excited with her?",

I currently still live at home and my cousin will visit once in awhile and because he’s in college and short on cash my mom always offers him a job to do that doesn’t necessarily need to be done but my mom could care less and offers to pay him for it.\n\nWhenever this happens I always get roped into helping him but I also don’t get any of the cash. So I do 50% of the work and he gets around $70. The last time this happened my mom wanted him to clean our crawl space in the basement and of course he said yes.  I once again was asked to help but in (what I meant to be) a lighthearted and joking manner said no and something like “can I get $10?” Both of them laughed and my mom said no. I said I wasn’t feeling like helping and my mom said ok (it didn’t start and argument or anything they both said it was fine).\n\nImmediately after my cousin left my mom told me I was acting rude and entitled for not helping. I said that I didn’t mean to come across that way but I didn’t see why I should help when he is getting paid for the job. She yelled at me but wouldn’t give me an explanation as to why what I said was rude and entitled. Then she called me an asshole when I told her that I would actually like to know why I sounded like that so I don’t come across that way again. \nAITA?\n\nAlso, I posted this on r/ask when it happened and ended up deleting it because I was just getting downvoted and not getting any explanation. I am fully willing to except that I may have been the asshole here, but I really would like to understand why. ",

I’m not really friends with either of them but I’m more friends with YG, who was the one who told me about the beef first. \n\nToday AG was being as disrespectful of personal space as usual, and she says “you wanna hear some tea? YG? I dated her in middle school. She’s annoying. She hasn’t changed”. I refrained from telling her that YG feels the same about her, but I’m debating on telling YG what her ex said. \n\nLet me know how you would approach this, since YG and I have kinda bonded over shared experiences with crazy exes and not liking AG.

      "description": "Aita here? I posted this to r/rant first and as I was typing it all out I started wondering if I should have been more understanding based on the fact thar he clearly has issues. So here it is. Mods delete if I didn't follow all the rules.\n\nSo, I work in a convenience store and this guy came in with his friends one time. I vaguely remember it but apparently I stood out because he called the store a week or so later and asked me out. This should have been a red flag, but I was kinda flattered by the whole thing. Things like that don't happen to me, ya know?\n\nThings were ok for a couple weeks. He seemed a little down on his luck but I've been there and I get it. We hung out a few times and talked or texted every day. On NYE I sent a happy NYE text and then.....radio silence. For about a week. I sent another text like are you ghosting me? Seriously?\n\nHe texts and says I'm going thru something I haven't talked to anyone in a week. I was pretty pissed at this point and said you could have at least acknowledged the message. Thumbs up or whatever. He said don't tell me how to cope. \n\nHere's where things really go south. I got really angry at that because I've had my own depression issues that I'm still battling back from. He's aware of this. I fired back an angry message saying I wasn't telling you anything other than it's pretty rude to let a text sit for a week without response. He calls on the phone and is trying to talk me into meeting up later at 1130pm or so. I just started mgmt training at my job and I go in at 530 am so of course I said no. He hangs up. I sent a message saying I was sorry he was going through it and I hoped he felt better soon. Figured that would be the end of it.\n\nHe messages back saying I hope so too that's why I wanted to see you so I could smile again. I responded that since I got off early the next day I might be able to do a late lunch and I'd let him know. He says only if you fix it(!) because I lost my job in this week that I haven't talked to anyone (duh). \n\nNext day after work I hit the grocery store and felt a migraine coming on. Not a huge shock as I been having vision issues while waiting for a new pair of glasses to arrive. Went home and got pretty sick but managed to send an I'm sick have migraine text before I passed out. An hour after that went out he asks if I'm feeling better. At 1130 the same night am I up (I was not). Next morning (yesterday) at about 930 he says he will stop bothering me (I was at work). I work a second job on weekend nights and last night about 1130 he sends me a message saying he can't believe I didn't touch base. I'm so over it at this point and I let it sit til I got home and said sorry, but my life doesn't revolve around you. \n\nHad the day off today so I woke up late to 4 or 5 messages telling me how rude I am and I only care about myself and all my talk but I blatantly blew him off. I said fine, I'm a selfish person who blew you off. Leave it at that and leave me alone. He called me a cu** and said he was going to call my job and complain about me.\n\nSo aita? Should I have been more patient? I know when I was in the thick of my depression I would have acted alot like this. But only with close friends whom I've known forever. I've only known this guy a month.....",

For example; We work in management and about a month ago he forgot his phone was still on after a phone call with another manager. We both heard him talking to a union colleague and bashing the manager he was just on the phone with. We called him out for it, and then continually make comments about it for the weeks moving forward. \n\nThis past weekend we were in a situation where we could let union colleagues leave early.. If you know anything about a union shop, seniority 50 should get to leave earlier than seniority 500. This co worker of ours decides its a good idea to flip a coin for the two colleagues to see which one should leave. The 500 seniority colleagues wins the coin toss and my co worker lets him leave over the higher seniority colleague. As soon as we heard it we were all like WTF..... You cant do that... We continue at every opportunity to make a joke now about how for every decision we'll just flip a coin... Even when it doesnt make sense... Flip a coin? And the other managers laugh... Our co worker that makes these decisions makes them knowing the rules.. Hes been in the job for years.. AITA for continuing the joke?\n\nTLDR; coworker makes big decision with a coin toss and then thinks its fine. We make fun of him for it at every possible opportunity.",

      "description": "Some back story:\n\nHer and I had been together for about 4 years, and in general they were a pretty happy 4 years with a few arguments here and there. The thing that gave me hope is that we always resolved an argument within a day and never went to bed without settling things.\n\nRight before we moved in together, I asked how her credit was and she told me it was good and there wouldn't be any problems. After submitting the pease application, I find out that she has a accrued a massive amount of debt, and all of it in store cards and extraneous purchases. I also found out she had a pretty major binge-eating problem which explained her weight gain over the past year (around 75 pounds).\n\nWe agreed to work together to fix these things. At the time she made more money than I did but we agreed to pay 50/50 on the rent and bills. \n\nThis didn't end up happening, since she continued her spending habits even after I attempted to help get her out of debt by paying the rent and bills while she got to steadier financials. Things got worse, and I became emotionally and physically distant. I'll also admit I became overly critical of her which put further strain on things.\n\nAfter about 6 months of this, and her telling me the spending was under control, I get curious and decided to snoop one night. It turned out nothing had changed, and she kept those cards she said she had previously closed and maxed them out again. I kicked her out back to her parents after this.\n\nWe kept in contact afterward, and I was adamant that though we could try to work through our problems, it would be a long time before we could really try again. We weren't in a relationship, but still loved each other.\n\nAfter a while of saving up, I went on vacation around Europe for a couple of weeks, and when I got back found out she had started seeing someone else. When I asked her about it, she said \"he reminds me of you, and is just a cheap replacement that won't work out\" and that they don't talk often. She badly wanted to see an exhibit at a local museum, so I took her one night. I noticed her acting shady, constantly texting someone when I wasn't looking and taking random bathroom breaks every half hour or so. I knew something was up, so I snooped on our joint cell phone account and found she had texted him around 50 times while we were at the museum. When I confronted her, she said she only messaged him maybe twice before showing her the logs. Things weren't going well, and I should have cut things off then. But I couldn't imagine life without her.\n\nTimes goes on, and we get closer again. We make love. Not just sex but really open, loving sex. She says no one can replace me. When I ask her to stop talking to the new guy though, she refuses. Things eventually come to a point, where I give her the ultimatum. She chooses the new guy, for the reason that we have too rough a history to fix and she wants a new start.\n\nI don't react well to this. I say some nasty things, about how I supported her through college, how I tried to help her with her binge eating and spending issues, but she's choosing instead to escape her problems and run with someone else. I tell him what she told me, how she only sees him as a younger version of me when we first began dating. What her problems were, and what to expect from her.\n\nI'm not proud of the last portion. I reacted out of anger and emotion and debased myself. \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "TL;DR - bottom\n\nLittle bit of background\n\nSo my SO (25F) and I (24M) have been together for two years, we have done everything together from vacationing to small trips to family functions and everything in between. I do love this girl to death and we are both doing very well for ourselves. We both have very steady high paying jobs, and currently live at home with our parents. (Toronto area) \n\nAbout last year I started to look at purchasing a pre-development townhouse, which would have an estimated closing date of 1-3 years. So sign &amp; pay builder payment structure of their choice (usually 10k increments over 30 day periods up to 60-70k). At this point I asked her if it she would be interested in looking together. The reply I got last year was no, which I was TOTALLY fine with, because let’s be honest we haven’t been together very long. I obviously would have liked an answer other than no, but at least I got a straight up answer that she is not ready to move out yet and is in no rush. \n\nFast forward to now, in December I got a puppy, which will be moving out with me when (IF) I decide to move out. She has taken to calling this puppy ours, which I’m totally fine with doesn’t bother me in the slightest. \n\nShe recently brought up the idea of looking, to my surprise I was quite happy to hear this and I began to look a little more seriously, know that we could afford more together and could get something nice. I ended up finding a builder that she knows about and likes. Upon me attempting to get the ball rolling on, say getting approved for a mortgage, or going to the sales centre to get some information from the builder and attempt to find out price breakdowns etc., this is where my frustration begins. Her response at this point is we will get the information and wait for the next release. \n\nFast forward to a release about a month ago, I bring up the idea of going and she says “maybe, I’ll see what my parents say.” So we get the information needed, (pricing, floor plans, payment, etc.). \n\nAt this point I’m thinking optimistically that now that we have this information we can start getting a little more serious.\n\nThe following TWO releases has now come and gone, prices are going up, and she continues to avoid the topic by saying things like “I have to talk to my parents” or completely changing the subject without even having a discussion about it.  \n\nI talk to her about the topic and ask her if it’s something she wants to do for real and the response I get is “yeah”. \n\nI’m not pressuring her, I only bring it up because anybody who knows about the housing market in the Toronto area knows that it sucks. \n\nIf she gave me a flat out answer like “no I’m not ready to move out yet “ I would be happier. I would then know that it’s too soon and would either drop the topic or continue my search for something I could afford. \n\nTL;DR\nGF(25) brings up idea of buying house together, but she avoids the topic all together. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I am more than a little bit frustrated with my new neighbors. I live in a 4plex next to a big university. The area is mostly students, but my new neighbors have a small child. I don't really know anything about children but it walks and talks, but I don't think it goes to school, so whatever age that is? The neighbors are the unit next to mine so we share a front door entryway and a wall of our apartments line up. They seem nice, if maybe a bit weird. So far it's all been ok.\n\nHowever, the kid makes a lot of high pitched screachy noises. It's so high pitched it could almost break glass and loud enough that I can hear it over my noise canceling headphones. My previous neighbors in that unit had a newborn baby and I literally never heard it cry, but I can hear this new kid several times a day. I called my mother and she said it's just normal happy child screaching and they just do that sometimes. I'm autistic and super sound sensitive as well as having migraine issue. I really miss the peace and quiet from my previous neighbors. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I went to my new neighbors and asked them to keep their kid from squeeling? Or do kids just make that noise and can't be stopped so I have to live with it?",

      "description": "I have two sisters and two brothers. My oldest sister, 'Ella', is five years my senior. She's always been bossy and used to bully me, but since we were kids I would forgive it if it had stopped. When I speak to her online, she seems so chill, but whenever she's here with me she acts quite entitled.  \n\n\nElla moved out to a really, really poor metropolitan area with her partner three years back knowing there were no jobs there. She makes posts all of the time about how awful life with us was, how terrible my parents are, how my mom was abusive. My mom was not abusive. She did have anger issues (she wasn't physical though - I think she slapped Ella *once* and then went to therapy forever afterwards), and she yelled at me a *lot,* but I was a brat and so was Ella. Even when making these posts, Ella would continuously ask my mother for money for food, rent, and car repairs. She had really, really specific requirements for any job she'd consider, so at the time she was unemployed. Of *course* my mother helped. She's not gonna let her kid starve.  \n\n\nRecently, I heard my mother crying in her room after one of these posts, and I confronted Ella about it. Ella claimed I had no right to judge her, that I had no idea what her circumstances were, that I was a bitch, and the thing I'm concerned about - that it was none of my business. Lately I've been thinking about it, and I'm not sure that it *is* my business. I want to defend my mom, but I don't know. Maybe I should keep my nose out of it. Am I really even helping my mom if all I'm doing is cutting Ella out?  \n\n\nI've blocked her on just about everything and coordinate my work/university schedule to avoid staying home when she's going to be there. I didn't intend to ever speak to her again, but as I'm reconnecting with my family it's come to my attention that she's gonna realize I'm avoiding her and probably feel hurt. She's already tried speaking to me over skype once, and she seemed to not realize I was still mad.  Am I an asshole for cutting her out of my life?  \n\n\nSome context, literally everyone in the family has mental health problems except *maybe* Dad. I'm not saying that as justification or defamation, but it does kind of affect the context of the situation. Her problems are a lot worse than mine.  ",

      "description": "I'm narcoleptic. I've had it for around three years now, but just got the official diagnosis about a half a year ago. It makes a lot of things in my life very, very hard. But my friends don't seem to understand that. \n\nWhen I first got it, I was sleeping around 20 hours a day. The cataplexy was so bad doctor's though my muscles had atrophied. I could barely lift my arms above my head. Since I was sleeping so much I couldn't eat as much, and I dropped down to 79 pounds (I'm 4'11, so it's scary but not like super life threatening). It's gotten better since then, but it still effects me greatly. A couple weeks ago I was hanging out with my friends and mentioned that the pharmacy fucked up my meds again and that I was genuinely worried about how I was going to handle myself until I got them back. I'm in college and I've already missed a lot of classes at this point because of my narcolepsy, even with my meds. Without them I cant function. One of my friends kinda laughs it off like \"you'll be fine\", another one says \"just drink coffee\". \n\nA little bit before that, I had sat down individually with my friends and told them what to do if I had a narcoleptic attack in front of them, especially in public. I can kinda feel them coming on, so I'm very very good at sneaking off to have sleep attacks in private. Because of this, none of them had even seen me have a full blown attack. Anyways, I told them to help me get to somewhere safe and private, help me take my meds and let me sleep for around 15 minutes before trying to wake me up. Simple stuff. \n\nSo I was real sick of them not taking my illness seriously. They don't need to baby me or anything, just understand that sometimes shit is really hard for me and it's scary. I was hanging out at one of my friends places with some other people about a week ago, and I got an idea. I wanted to see if they actually listened to what I told them before. So I dramatically stood up and collapsed onto the floor (my real attacks arnt that flashy, since I know how to deal with them).  My friends are confused. They don't know what to do, until one of them reminds the others I'm narcoleptic. So what do they do? Put a blanket over my body and leave me in the middle of the room. Fantastic. I stay down for 10 minutes maybe (trying hard not to actually fall asleep) before getting up and excusing myself home. It definitely made some of the people there uncomfortable. \n\nI feel manipulative for pulling this 'test' on them. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "So me and my \"not really girlfriend\" - we are mostly just having fun, but it‘s still more than like friends with benefits. Were at a party and she asked when i‘d come over the next time i told her that i could come whenever, and tomorrow i would have time after class which was about 1pm. So she was like, she thinks tomorrow would be nice but she needs to get some shit done and she will probably be finished before 1 but we should just write or talk on the phone to check for the time and what to do.\n\nFast forward to the next day: i crashed at a friends house, i went to class, went to eat sth with another friend after class and lost my phone in his car but didn’t notice till i was hlme. It was about 1pm and i didn’t have my phone. Dude with the car was at the gym and grocery shopping, so i only was able to reach out for him and get my phone back at 4pm, in that time i was studying. So when i had my phone back i checked it, no missed calls or anything just some texts and snaps, one of the texts being from her at 2pm: \"When are you coming?\".\nSo i thought like if she’s not calling or anything although we said that or to ask why i didn’t text i just thought i‘m just gonna finish my assignments and study some more. Took me till about 6pm, then i texted her that i‘m free now and i’m sorry that i didn’t write sooner cause my phone was in a friends car and she just started bitching around accusing me of lying to her and that i should just tell her the truth so i was being pissed as well. It ended up in her calling me a total asshole and i didn’t talk to her for the rest of the day and didn’t pick up the phone, but just showed up at hers at 10pm and gave her a call that i‘m here. We talked and i told her that i really didn’t have my phone and the only thing you could count as a lie was that i finished my assignments before reachin out for her and i‘m sorry for having her wait so long. So she went on saying that she has been waiting from 1pm till now (10pm) for me to show up and that was 9 hours of her day wasted and she could have done so much better stuff than sit around at home the whole day. So we were just givin each other shit and i was just trying to say we could have prevented this by communicating better but she didn’t want to get it.\nThat was 3 days ago and she‘s still giving me shit for it and telling me that \"i really need to make up for this and i better do it fast\" but i still think that i might did a little bit wrong, she did as well but her reaction is just a total overkill and it makes me so pissed at her right now.",

      "description": "I (25m) had a very uncomfortable situation today and I feel really bad. \n\nI had just come from a job interview, and while I feel it went well, I was still reeling with uncomfortable...ness as a result of the stress. I then went on an errand to a part of town I hadn't been to before (therefore making me extremely uncomfortable) while still wearing my nice clothes (which made me feel vulnerable given how thin and complex the clothes are and because I cant wear my usual gear with it like a multitool that I have as part of my self-defense plan). \n\nThe business I had been looking for had moved locations and I didn't know. There's still snow everywhere from the past few days and I'm in a part of town with busy traffic and it seemed to be a bit of a lower income area so I was feeling on edge and cold. I had to park somewhere really out of the way so it would be safe.\n\nWhen I was leaving the parking lot, a gentleman who looked like he was looking for something was very oblivious to his surroundings and was in my way. \n\nI waited politely and smiled after he realized I was behind him, as he moved out of my way, pulling up to the street (which would force me into very awkward traffic). Well the guy decided he wanted to talk to me and started to tap on the glass. African American gentleman, plain clothes, backpack, may or may not have been homeless, I couldn't tell. Seemed nice enough, just was NOT in any mood to talk.\n\nI gave body language that I wasn't interested in talking to him (I had somewhere to be and felt cornered waiting for an opening in the traffic) by looking at the road and not at him, but he kept tapping. Someone waved me into traffic and I quickly pulled out while he was tapping on the glass (iirc).\n\nAITA for not at least rolling down my window a bit and hearing what he had to say? I felt cornered and didnt know the area very well.\n\n",

      "description": "A friend and I had made plans just under a week ago to hang out today. About two hours beforehand he called me \"asking\" if a mutual acquaintance could join us. I spent a bit of time thinking about if I should begrudgingly go along with it to be polite, or decline which is what I would rather do. \n\n\nI ended up declining and was then immediately asked why. It came down to me not wanting to and him demanding a reason. Then attempting to aggressively persuade me until I said \"fuck it, fine.\"\n\n\nI was then sent a text saying \"i'm fine if you say no for a reason, but you cant just say no with nothing. It's just rude and highly annoys me.\", out of frustration i replied \"i dont give a fuck about being polite\" and got \"its rude and socially retarded if that makes it easier\" back. I told him that I see no reason to make up excuses and was told \"Then you have to have a reason.\"\n\n\nAround this time my roommate and his girlfriend's ride had just arrived, and he asked me if i was sure i didn't want to come to the party that we had been invited to, but i had previously declined due to these plans. I decided to return the favor of sudden change and sent \"im suddenly busy\" and went with.\n\n\nI decided this after considering that if I went along I would have been in a bad mood the entire time, and if I put my foot down then he would have been just as frustrated. Either way it seemed like a bad time and i bailed.\n\n\nSo reddit, who is the asshole. Cause i have a hunch we both suck.",

I promised my mom that I would lose the weight however I fell back into old patterns and struggles, but since I know my mom fusses at me if I let her know I'm struggling so I would like about what I was doing, and I feel like such a piece of shit right now \n\nOnto what happened today and tonight\n\nToday: I was walking and my mom caught up to me (we live in the country and this was our field) she then goes into me about how I'm a liar and all I do is waste my parents money, because I have this problem, I will die if I keep this up, and that I'm an asshole (tldr)\n\nTonight: before going to bed I had to put our dogs in bed, one of then got mad and bit my finger (I got in the way of her and a chew stick long after she was done) my mom then gets pissed at me having to go to her room, and putting medicine on a small wound (it was a small puncture that bled, and dog mouths are not the most sanitary places) I heard her fussing about how I'm not mature enough or anything. Then after the dogs get put into bed the she tells me that she wants to say good night. She then lays into me for 45 minutes, not yelling but in a reserved pissed tone\nShe then accuses me of several hurtful things\n1. I'm using my depression and anxiety struggles to do what I want\n2. That I'm wasting everyone's time (Liberty University requires a thing called CSER, service for 20 hours and because the start of the seimester was busy I was saving it for after spring break)\n3. That I'm hurting everyone and being selfish.\n\nI think I'm the asshole here, but I want to make sure",

      "description": "Just for clarification, I'm on mobile so the formatting is going to be off. Sorry!\n\nI have been dealing with a medical condition that has really controlled my life right from the start. It throws me in the ER once every year from a kidney infection. It definitely impacts me on a daily basis. Because this is from birth, I have also developed muscle dysfunction and it causes me to have some stomach problems too. I'm in pain every single day.\n\nI started opening up about my pain to my close friends 2 years ago (middle school). This was a huge deal for me because it used to be my biggest secret. I am more open about it now and have even discussed it in a presentation about my life to my class. \n\nOne of my closest friends (let's call her R for now) has been there for me through thick and thin. I'm so thankful for her. The problem is I talk about how awful and rough this condition is all the time. Living with a medical condition like that doesn't leave you in a good place all the time. I'm sad a lot because I either fear I will never be completely healthy or that someday a kidney infection will take me out when I haven't lived the life I have wanted. \n\nI talk about how much pain I'm in and how this affects me to my friends a lot. They are my support system. One day (this was a while back), I was talking to R and she was tired of hearing me talk about this because it makes her sad and it's all I seem to talk about. Ever since then I worry about the toll it takes on the friends I turn to. \n\nAnother one of my best friends (let's call her Z) is my second person that I turn to. R and Z are two of the people I care about most. I feel like them worrying about me is hurting them and I hate that. Z has really been anxious lately and she seems to have really become a worrywart. I hope it isn't from me opening up to her.\n\nSo in conclusion, AITA for turning to these people? And if I am, what can I do to help out my friends who deserve better?",

      "description": "So this all started in 2017 around the start of August. My cousin lets call him Chase was dropped off without notice and i wad told he's that he lives with me now. My mom was at work so i wasnt sure if she had agreed or not but i wasn't mad i kinda accepted it. From what i heard he got into a disagreement with his stepdad about staying after school and not being treated as fairly as his younger sister. So again i didn't really mind it until around early 2018.\n\nIn early 2018  my family started to notice my depression and it had worsened for 2 to 3 years until they noticed. ( i normally keep to myself and im very quiet so it wasn't like there were some big signs). I was in physical pain and was diagnosed with Depression. Now im a very emotional personi get it from my mom and i also do have really bad anxiety which also comes from my mom. Time passes and just everything got worse even with my therapist and all i wanted to do was just let things free and cry but i dont feel comfortable crying in front of my family. It was at this point where i started to want him out of here so i could deal with issues. I should cry at night i think but i cant because he would and still does till this day stay up with the tv on for hours. I got overthe depression but i still dont feel like i can do things i love in my own room for example i never liked drawing in front if family so i dont even like doing that. Also because be doesn't listen my stepdad will get msd at him for playing too much and if my mom or older brother arent home i have to be the adult of the house and stop them because if i don't things could get worse than yelling. \n\nWhen he leaves for a few days i feel at home, i feel comfortable cleaning, laying in my own bed, drawing, etc. I feel bad for feeling this way because he's family but he's not our responsibility. With one more mouth to feed and bills/mortgage my mom, stepdad, and older brother pay i just dont think its fair for anyone in this situation. You would think that my aunt would help out abit but she rarely does and normally is the one asking for money from my mom despite my mom making less than my aunt. \n\nI really just needed another pov other than mine and my friends sinced its very biased so any help is appreciated.\n        ",

      "description": "My friend has been in a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend of 2 years for the past 6 months. I met him 6 months ago and we've grown really tight. I'm a gay girl so it's always been completely platonic between us. We tell each other just about everything and we are really, really close. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past 3 months he's been becoming very close friends with one of our mutual friends, X. All of our friends thought it was a bit strange how much time they were spending alone together, and it did seem like they were crossing lines. From an outsider's perspective, it really seemed like they liked each other. They have both always insisted that there were no romantic feelings at all though and that they were just 'bros' so the way they were acting was ok. There was blatant flirting, touching etc. but nothing they ever tried to hide because in their minds, they were just really close friends. Although there have been many times alone each other's rooms, and who knows what was going on there. At the same time, he would talk about how reprehensible cheating is, especially in a long-distance relationship, when we would talk about others. I tended to just not talk about the girl with him because I did not want to come off as accusatory and I just took his word that there was nothing there. I avoided spending time with them because it just made me uncomfortable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe broke up with his girlfriend a week ago. 3 days later, he started dating X. I don't really want to spend any time with them as a couple and honestly find the whole situation pretty gross. We live together so it is going to be pretty hard to get away from them as a couple and I think I'm going to find myself just avoiding spending time with them. He is not being in-your-face about it at all but at the same time, is disappointed that I'm not supportive of them. I feel like I'm being a bad friend but at the same time, everything around X and him still feels wrong so I'm not ready to just jump on the bandwagon. AITA for not being supportive and also feeling pretty upset with him that he's moved on so fast?",

      "description": "*TL;DR: I can get annoying from the intensity of my interests and how much I talk about them, I got put in my place, but felt attacked and don't know if that's a reasonable reaction or what to do about it.* \n\nThis is a pretty small issue, but here goes.\n\nI have a group of good friends ranging in age from older teen to young adult. We have a couple group chats (various circles of people) that we chat on. My friends and I have ADHD and/or autism, which means we struggle with social cues and sarcasm. We also tend to get really, *really* into things and talk about them a lot. It can be difficult to shut up, but I try and I at least make sure that other, especially less assertive, people have space to talk too. We also all have anxiety. All of us are aware of each other's quirks and struggles and are supportive.\n\nI really like my original characters, and I talk about them a lot. Like, a *lot*. But they get why I'm so interested and they love to discuss their own characters with me and we go back and forth. My friends jokingly hate two of my characters because they're villains, and they make fun of me sometimes because I defend the characters and my love for them. This is almost always funny for everyone involved and it's a nonissue.\n\nYesterday, I compared one of my characters to a different, video game, character that they really like. This offended my friends (longer story, but yeah it was insulting, I get why they're unhappy) and they started teasing me and making memes about my mistake and about me being so obsessed with the character that I can't not reference him everywhere. When I got embarrassed and asked them to stop, they just posted the memes in a different chat so more people can see. I don't think they realized I was serious, I didn't make it super clear (again, we suck at social cues) and that's my own fault. They've talked about unrelated stuff since, I felt too ashamed to participate. I left one of the chats this happened in and am considering leaving the others until I'm less embarrassed and until the jokes are buried under more conversations. I'll come back later, try a lot harder to stop referencing this interest, because this is deffo not friendship-ending material and they like me otherwise. It feels so childish to be upset over something so small and even more childish to ask them to stop because I'm taking this way too seriously...\n\nAITA for being so upset about this, and for leaving? How should I fix this?",

      "description": "As I was about to move in to a new 2 bedroom apartment 1.5 years ago, I was in the process of rekindling a friendship that started around 10 years earlier.\n\nThis person I always knew as a badass and good person, but recently she had fallen on hard times. She seemed really depressed and her life seemed like it was crumbling around her, so I spontaneously invited her to move to my city (about 2.5 hours away) to try to rebuild. I was thinking she would get a better job and figure out how to get back on her feet.\n\nA year and half later, and her life situation does not seem to have improved by much. She found a job she likes, but it does not pay well and it's kind of a dead end thing.\n\nI decided that I didn't want to live with her almost immediately after she moved in. She moved in with a cat, and I didn't realize how much living with a cat would annoy me. She is kind of a slob and while she loves the cat, she does not take good care of him or his situation, so my house is covered in hair and it smells like cat. \n\nShe does a lot to annoy me (not locking doors, not doing dishes, not refilling the toilet paper, not refilling water pitchers) and she doesn't clean common areas at all. \n\nOn the other hand, she is a good friend, and if there was anything really important that I needed, she would be there for me (example, I left my suitcase on a bus and she tracked it down to the bus depot for me).\n\nShe couldn't pay the rent a few months in a row (I charge her $375+ utilities which is a steal) but she eventually paid me back every penny. But that experience let me know she would never be able to live in the city without me.\n\nI am asking her to move out even though I know it means she will have to quit her job and move out of the city and start over from scratch. Should I be more sensitive in this situation?",

      "description": "So I (19 M)  have a friend 20M (lets call him Max). We are in college and we have been best friends for an year. This guy is a typical introvert and i am one of the very few frnds he has in the campus. About 6 months ago, he started liking this girl 20 F (lets call her Anna).\n\n\nShe was a sweet girl and also an introvert. He was too shy to approach her and i took it upon myself to set them up. I started talking to her and gradually over a month we three ended up becoming good friends and hung out everywhere from classes to canteen.\n\nBut since last two months her weirdness started becoming more intense. For example, one day she decided she wouldnt open her eyes because its bright. One day she would not speak because she didnt like that people talk too much. She keeps talking to herself audibly even when people are around. She suddenly burts into tears with no apparent reason. And she carries a thermos with black coffee with her all the time and keeps drinking it throughout the day.\n\n She is rarely happy these days. And that affects my mood a lot. And whenever she is upset Max gets super upset and he doesnt talk to me all day. \n\nI recently found out through Max that she is slightly schizophreniac and has depression issues. She also suffers from a muscle condition where they hurt a lot and she takes medications to relieve the pain. I guess those are what make her high. \n\nMax keeps catering to her shenanigans all the time. I can't deal with stuff if a grown ass adult is behaving like a kid. And i inevitably loose my shit and get mad at her. \n\nI have behavior issues too and i am working on them. Being surrounded by two people who dont speak a lot and who get upset all the time doesnt help. Whenever they r upset, it upsets my mood too. \n\nNow i dont wanna be friends with them anymore but we have all classes and labs together. Also, i am feeling really guilty that i am not being there for my frnd when she needs probably needs frnds. And i dont wanna loose my bestie Max because of Anna. But I have no clue what to do. The other mutual friend of ours is telling me i am the asshole for leaving my friends like this. \n\nTL;DR- One my two best friends is having mental issues and doesnt behave like an adult for the most part. And i dont wanna deal with that behavior anymore because I myself suffer from issues and I wanna be happy. But i am feeling guilty about it. \n\n",

      "description": "To start, it already sounds bad when I say full consent.  My father is physically disabled and we live in a 2 story with a 1/2 finished basement.  The first floor any work that is done I go through him to “ check my work “ he’s trained me in electrical, plumbing, flooring, hanging drywall (removing as well) anyways the 1/2 of the basement that isn’t fished is somewhat. House was a foreclosure and the 1/2 in question was flooded so before he was disabled he ripped out the drywall to about light switch high, cut off all the lighting on that half (minus over the laundry room and by the furnace) last night I was supposed to be cleaning and organising all the stuff down there that is not only mine but theirs + my two siblings. The previous owners wired the 1/2 of the basement incorrectly. Not grounding, not using conduit  etc. So I totally get him disabling it all, but due to this I have had to plug in lamps all over just to see everywhere. + our sump pump isn’t connected to code and makes it flood that part in cleaning. I won’t go into the logistics as this isn’t the sub for that.  \n\nSo last night instead of cleaning, I decided to properly wire a few of the  light fixtures and switch as well as started to work on the sump pumps (because why clean and move our stuff to an area that gets wet?) \n\nNow my mom can see in our laundry room without using hanging lamps that plug into the outlets just by flipping a switch. She’s not “pissed per say” that I did the lighting because honestly I think she’s kind of happy for it. However she is pissed that I didn’t get part of the basement clean which I planned on doing but the wiring was so bad that I had to redo it for everything that I had touched.  I was up till 1am doing this cleaned up my tools and all that mess and went to bed finally around 2 and have an interview today at 11 right by my house. She woke me up at 9:30  (that’s fine 30 mins before I planned with my alarm ) but was being really crabby.  She yelled at me because I am swapping out the dead sump pump with the one she threw in the same hole as a replacement that drains into a toilet (idk why there’s a random toilet in our basement) 1/4 across that part of that part of the basement and not out side which where I live is a no no. My dad can’t get down the stairs to do it, and we don’t have money to pay someone. I feel like yes I should’ve directly asked, however I’m doing it in the benefit of their house which is their retirement money when they sell it since they have no savings (lost it all when my dad was disabled from medical bills 401k everything) I’ve already redone the electrical and flooring on most of the 2nd floor, and my dad “shadowed “ which was him playing on his laptop his room in bed while I do whatever I’m fixing.  \n\nBasically my mom is pissed at me for fixing things in the house that otherwise would go unfixed and cause issues because “she didn’t ask me to” despite her saying I never do anything for them.

      "description": "I'll try to keep it short.\nSo, my wife and I were teasing each other like spouses do, nothing major or out of the ordinary. I lightly popped her with a kitchen towel, not even hard enough to leave a red mark on her pale skin. She asked me to stop popping her and I did, but I kept lightly slinging the towel at her. I wasn't popping her, just mildly annoying her.\nWell, our daughter (3yo) was in the kitchen with us eating an apple. My wife in a completely non threatened and totally playful voice exclaims that I hit her to my daughter and is convincing my daughter to hit me back.\nMy daughter was confused but anxiously ran up and lightly punched my leg.\nOkay, fine. Once was enough. I thought it was done, but it wasn't. My wife kept going on and on and trying to get my daughter to hit me. She convinced her to do so at least three more times.\nI was getting upset with my wife and diffused the situation as best as I could and sent my daughter on to bed, trying to convince her that I didn't hurt mommy while tucking her in before trying to convey how I felt to my wife as calmly as I could. My main problem with all of this is i don't want my daughter to think I'm abusive and that I'm okay with hurting her or my wife. She's impressionable at her age and is just grasping onto sentence structures and social cues so I don't want her to think daddy hitting mommy is a normal thing.\nI also don't want my marriage to fall apart. I love my wife to death and would do anything for her and our child. We just suffered a miscarriage last July and have been slowly recovering from the loss of our 6 month developed daughter. On top of the depression, my wife has several problems from her past relationships as well as her childhood that result in episodes of acting out and threatening to leave. This always results in me having to drop everything for the next few hours while I try to calm her down and have her cry it out on my shoulder.\nLike I said, I love my wife, but I'm afraid that one day I won't be able to calm her down and she will run off with our daughter.\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\n(Sorry if my wording is garbage and leads to confusion. This just happened and I typed it up rather quick. My wife is laying down and I'm on the couch just wondering if I'm in the wrong. I feel like I'm right with my concerns, but she insists she was just playing and didn't realize she was upsetting me or doing anything wrong. The more I think about it, the more I feel like I overreacted, but I just don't know.)",

      "description": "Hi, 18f here, i live in a heavily religious Christian family and I myself am leaning towards atheist myself. Now, I want to give all the information beforr I start, my dad is verbally abusive towards my mother. No, he has never laid a hand on her but he makes her feel like snot amd when they argue he always turns around the problems on her. He also ruined my 18th birthday and I went into crisis counseling the next day so just cry for an hour. (Spoiler, my councilor didn't really help).\nJust a quick note he grew up in an physically abusive relationship with his patents where they taught him that spanking was not only okay, but the right thing to do. Yes, i consider it physical abuse because it still haunts me when he pulls off his belt and calls me over and it makes me extremely scared when he jokingly threatens hitting me and he loves to do it often. He also has a tendency to snap at me about the littlest thing, like one day I said didn't want dinner because I wasn't hungry it was like 4 in the afternoon and two hours later my mom made a potato and i grabbed a fork with the intention of taking a single bite and my dad lost his bleeding mind and yelled at me how I shouldnt eat because i said i wasn't hungry.\n\nSo yeah, i hate him. I could write a book on the absurd things he says and does and if anyone asks I would be happy to share because its kinda funny.\n\nBut, hes probably actually depressed, having worked at a well paying job for 14 years then quit it due to the toil in order to start an insurance business. Tbh i hated him for it but its just because my quality of life decreased and i myself stressed that we wouldnt be able to live in the house anymore. I asked my mom if we could get him a therapist and lo and behold he had one but refused to talk ab the important stuff???\n\nSo story begins. I made tea for the day and we drank it all by after dinner. He asks me to make more and I said multiple time, trying to get my words out as he laughed at me bc idk he thought it was funny that I said simply \"no, i have school tomorrow and i need to take a shower.\" If anything my lazy, racist brother was sitting at the table across from the kitchen just putting legos together like he wasn't a twenty year old man who still lives with his parents. So my dad lost it and called me down to piss and yell at me about how i had no power in the house and he could make me do whatever he wanted. Idk he screamed for another 10 minutes im just nodding and saying yes sir at this point because id rather hurry this up. He moves on and i turn my back to cry. I go upstairs and cry and my mom comes in to counsel me and i said i didn't want to talk to her, never did i raise my voice or swear. Shes also a snitch so there was no way i was saying anything, ive learned my lesson.\n\nI pass the master bedroom and she calls me in and tells me i have to be more humble to him, i have to grovel and say im sorry. Wow red alarms. I listen to that for like 5 minutes and its extremely uncomfortable because she talks about how hes the head of the house hold and smth religion related. I yeet out of there as fast as possible with no intention of saying any sort of apology. Should i apologize? Just so yall know this is definitely not the first time this has happened and will not be the last, but I always feel like its never been justified.\n\n This is genuine btw and im not just ranting because I really want to know if i should just accept it and do what my mom wants just a bit longer because I know he's going through a very stressful part of his life or hold to my own \"hard hearted\" beliefs.",

But then she comes into class on Monday with stories of hanging out with her boyfriend on the weekend, and I get super annoyed because it seems to me that she cancelled on us to hang out with him.

      "description": "There's some backstory I need to cover before I get into the meat of things, it's all relevant, I promise.  \nI am the younger of two daughters to a still happily married couple. My husband is the only child to a single mother. My mother in law has a very limited social life (limited to her sister in law and extended family) and no hobbies to speak of, so she spends a vast majority of her free time at home.  \nIn 2016, after many years of trying, I finally obtained a permanent visa to live with my husband (and his mother) in his home country. I moved here in january of 2017 and during the new year 2017/18 my parents came here and spent a week with me and my husband at the beach. Now, me and my husband are not very social people, and our idea of a good time is sleeping in, play video games, an watch movies, so for our beach trip, we mostly did our own thing, staying at the hotel pool and hanging out in the room while my parents were off doing touristy things, and then we would have dinner together and play cards late into the nights, all around good times.  \nMy mother in law's birthday is coming up, and she, along with her sister in law and extended family, are planning a trip to the beach, friday to monday. My husband has already agreed that we will go there friday morning and leave again late friday afternoon (6 hour round trip) because neither of us really wants to be there all weekend. We'd rather take the opportunity to be alone for a few days, since it is rarely the case.  \nMy mother in law is upset about this and thinks it's unfair we would spend a seek at the beach with my parents and not her, disregarding such things that if we did go with her, she would not leave our side, not giving us the alone time my parents did. As well as the facts that I had not seen my parents for a year, and they would not have taken the 13 hour flight from my home country to hang out in the city. \nMy country is also much colder than here, and spending too much time outside in the heat is incredible unpleasant to me.  \nAm I (and my husband) the asshole for wanting to have alone time at home with my partner rather than spend time with people I barely have a relationship in a place I do not want to be?",

Ever since I understood the power of venting, I’ve been using it and I started using it on the pettiest shit and I know it’s really selfish but it feels good to “transfer” the negativity somewhere, even though that somewhere is another person with feelings too. Feelings that get ruined by the venter’s energy, words, etc... So yeah. I feel really guilty about this habit. \n\nThere’s so many examples but I’ll talk about the most recent one. Just a little while ago, I was having breakfast with my relatives. We were talking about me calorie counting and everything was good. But then my cousin suddenly says, “Try Intermittent Fasting”. I immediately got annoyed that she gave me advice when I was already in a diet program that I worked so hard finding and sticking to. I have already lost 20 pounds so far and I’m still losing weight. \n\nMy instinct is to tell someone about how I feel but I hate that I have to vent to someone every time someone upsets me. \n\nDoes this habit make me an asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "John my friend and I are on the lease to a house with two others who are not. A housemate moved out and john said he knew someone who wanted the room. I was away the weekend john set up the interview process and i didnt meet him until he moved in. Upon moving in, john and the new guy brad let me know that brads sister would be hanging around for about 3 weeks till she went to another state for uni. Ok i thought, 3 weeks isnt so bad. After 2 weeks i asked again how long i would have to endure this woman. John then proceeds to tell me that she could be here for 3 weeks to 6 months. Now im a little angry. As she has been exceeding the guest situation in my opinion. As she invites her other van living friend over almost daily as they both dont work. She also had a dinner party at our place inviting her friends which are the brothers friends so cant really complain to much on that. She would bring girls back to sleep with on our couch and in her brothers room. Most of the time this happened during the day when we were at work and some weekends. She also never contributed financially. But did do us the courtesy of cleaning the house once. \n\nI said i didnt like how she was using the place to her brother. Stating she doesnt pay rent and in my eyes is only a guest here. He said he would talk to her and she was confused why i felt the way i did. In that time we lost another roommate and a room was available. I asked ger if she wanted it, to which she replied \"no, she couldnt live with her brother\". I offered it to her on a few occasions but \"no\" was the answer. But things got better that week as i didnt see her. Then she went for a road trip for 3 weeks and i thought my problem solved. \n\nUpon her arrival back i arrive home and see her parked in the backyard. Her brother comes to me and asks if she can live in the backyard and pay rent and utilities. I say no as i offered her the room on multiple occasions and i didn't want more people in the house. He wasnt to happy about that but said ok. Then i started finding her in the house during the day when i finished work early. When i asked her what she was doing i assumed she made a lie up about meeting her brother who was nowhere around and wouldnt return home for another 4hrs. She would also leave straight after i found her on those occasions. This made me think she was doing this behind my back. I also wasnt sure weather the brother or john were in on it. I went to john and said i think we should kick ben out. As i wanted an end to this situation as i couldnt trust them. I am currently breaking my bond. \n\nAITA for wanting to kick out the roomate, whose sister uses our house and doesnt live there but the van on the street and pays no rent",

      "description": "I’ve never really posted, so please be gentle if I misstep.\n\nI am a 40 yo female. I have a 30 yo male friend who I’ve been close to for near a decade. We’ve never been romantic, nor even entertained it. He started dating a wonderful young woman about two years ago. He has two children from a previous relationship. He is a loving but inconsistent father and provider for his children. His work requires frequent international travel /long period away or overseas and can be inconsistent. \n\nSo, after he introduces me to his new gf we get Along great. Really like her. Kind, a good heart. She reached out to me often, though most often when things are bad or difficult in their relationship. She gets frustrated about his lack of reliability and lack of planning, and he gets upset with what he sees as her unrealistic expectations about finances. (Wanting trips, designer things)\n\nDespite the many concerns and reservations she’d expressed, they moved in together about a year ago. Also bought two cars. Got some pets. All in.  But always late on rent and bills and unstable, which was a big cause of tension between them. At any rate, She’d joke alarmingly regularly over the last few years about wondering if she might be pregnant. Recurring theme. To the point I sat her down several times to ensure she understood science and that if she kept this up she would without a doubt end up pregnant. She didn’t like birth control because it made her moody. \n\nAnyhow title says it all in the summer time they told me she was pregnant. I’ve known him for much longer, and he told me first. He was excited. Wanted to marry her first and asked for help with a baby shower. (Rediculous to plan that so soon but still cute). \n\nThen she tells me. And she’s not so sure, for very valid reasons. I don’t disagree - they are not at all ready. He’s not properly caring for the two he already has and bills are a struggle and things are rocky. We talk a lot. She decides to give herself a week to make a decision. And ultimately decides to abort. When she told me that I was very, very clear that I supported her decision but that she needed to tell him and he deserved to know. I fully thought she would.\n\nBut she did not ever tell him. She told him she miscarried while he was away for work for about a month. He was really sad. \n\nAnd I am so confused about it I’ve just backed away from both of them. I feel like I’m lying to him by not telling him, but know it’s not my business to tell. And I’m angry with her for putting me in a position where I’m expected to hold such a very big lie for her, from my friend who I knew far before her.  It makes me distrust her, knowing she can lie so easily about something so big. Again, I actually think she made a sound decision, but I think lying to him was unfair and wrong. \n\nAm I overdramatizing this? Should I just let it go, am I being a jerk? Is it fair for me to feel angry and distrustful? What would you do in this situation? \n\n",

      "description": "So here's the context. I've always been a quiet sort of shy person. I'm the type that would rather blend in and I'm quite content with that. This is something everyone I'm close with knows about me so there's usually no surprise birthday parties or things of that nature as it would cause me a lot of anxiety having that much attention on me. \n\nI started dating this wonderful man almost a year ago. He is everything I've been hoping for thoughtful, sweet, and respectful. The only downside of our relationship is it's long distance the majority of the time because he travels for months at a time for work. We do our best to talk as much as possible and it's been going great. \n\nSo on to the problem. I got the feeling that my boyfriend was planning something a little more special than normal for me. Specifically, he kept asking about details relating to my work such as where its located and what time I go to lunch. I work for a state agency so it's a fairly big office with lots of employees and I told him such. On Thursday, I came back from lunch and I noticed people were acting a little off and there was a lot of smiling going on. As soon as I get to my desk the admin assistant announces over the intercom that I am needed at the front reception desk. To my surprise, when I get there I see a huge flower/balloon arrangement with a fairly big fruit arrangement as well. It was so beautiful and of course it was from my boyfriend. My happiness was short lived as my anxiety set in when people started making a big deal about it and asking too many questions. This continued on through Friday as well and by the end of the work day on Friday I was very overwhelmed with the whole thing. \n\nI told my boyfriend I loved the gift. It was the most thoughtful thing that anyone has ever done for me but I suppose he heard the hesitation in my voice and asked what was wrong. I then explained the situation and how while I loved the gift, I would have preferred to experience something so special from him in private. He then gets a bit agitated with me and quickly ended the phone call and we haven't spoke that much since Thursday. \n\nMy question is am I the asshole for not wanting to receive gifts like that in such a public way?",

      "title": "AITA for trolling my gf once in League of Legends?",
      "description": "This is a silly situation that has gotten a bit out of hand.\n\nI've been playing League of Legends, a popular online video game, for years. My gf of almost one year recently started playing as well, after gaining interest from watching me play. I'd say she's played 50% of the games alone and 50% with me. She has improved a lot since she first started. I'm honestly pretty impressed, as she progressed way faster than I did when I first started.\n\nWhenever we play together, I'm always very supportive and try to teach her the game without ever making fun of her mistakes. If she does make mistakes (everyone makes mistakes in this game, no matter what level), I assure her that it's alright. I have never teased her or made her feel uncomfortable about playing the game, up until today.\n\nSo we queued into a game against the AI. We're just doing our usual thing. Now when I play the game with friends, we generally will troll each other at times and sometimes do stuff that results in the other person's death. Death in League of Legends simply results in your character being out of the game for around 30s - you do not lose any significant progress just from one death, especially in a game against beginner AI. Without going into details, I told my gf to do something that resulted in her dying, and I laughed as I normally would if it were one of my other friends.\n\nShe was not amused, threatened to quit the game, and stayed silent for the rest of the game (around another 5 minutes). I immediately could tell she was pissed and apologized for doing that. After the game ended, she told me I annoyed her and that it was a really mean thing to do. I apologized, acknowledging that it wasn't a nice thing to do to a beginner. I also said that I didn't intend to harm her and that I was just joking - and that I would do the same to any of my other friends. She said if this was what the game was about then she wouldn't want to play, left the chat, and went to bed.\n\nI feel pretty bad about this as my gf is just a beginner, but I also feel we should be comfortable enough each other to joke around in a video game. So, AITA here?",

      "description": "July of this year, I finally moved out on my own. A few friends and I got a place about an hour away from family, all of us moving out of our parents house. My mom works with me for a newspaper, so she asked me today if I wanted to see her for Thanksgiving. I said no, and she had a pretty disgusted look on her face. She assumed a yes.\n\nA little backstory, when I was ~14 years old, (21 now) my parents split up between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and it really messed with my head. I was a total shut in, I began to hate the holidays, you know, normal stuff. \n\nMy mom knows I hate the holidays, she knows the reason for it, and I previously told her I didn't want to celebrate any this year. So when she gave me that nasty look, I felt a little horrible. She then asked if I was going go be the same way for Christmas, and I said yes. She look confused and said, \"Why not just come see us. You don't have to have dinner or anything.\" My answer was, \"If I go to see you on Thanksgiving or Christmas or anything like that, it's practically celebrating the holidays in my eyes, which I don't want to do.\" \n\nShe walked away from me and didn't talk to me for the rest of the day, and I feel really horrible about it. I understand how she could feel hurt, seeing as how for 20 years we'd celebrate the holidays. I was wondering if anyone else thought my reasoning was justified, since now that I'm out on my own, I can actively avoid the holidays.",

      "description": "So this story is a few years old and has pretty much resolved itself but its nice to get other opinions. \n\nI (25 F) was given a van (bought and paid for by my deceased grandfather years prior. It was a 2001) in highschool and used it as my sole transport until 2017 when it was keyed and had 3 of 4 tires slashed. Im a very quiet, stay at home person so we never knew who it was. Didnt really matter; insurance totalled it for about 3k which I used for my current car. Now until then my grandma was generous and paid the insurance. It really helped build a good driving record for me. Much appreciated. Also, while i did drive the van to highschool most days dad did freely take it whenever he pleased.\n\nI also have a stepmom and stepsister. Mom i get along with fine while sister is a little rocky. We are totally civil at gatherings but just dont talk outside of those. No animosity just different people. Shes 4 years younger than me. Her mom and my dad have bought/given/helped obtain a total of 4 or 5 cars for her at the time of my van getting vandilized. The reason for so many is because she keeps crashing them. We never go into full details because neither of them talk to me about her very often. This does all have a point i promise.\n\nAnyway we find a car that my dad says is a great deal. 2012, 25k miles for 10k. Sweet. He explains to me him and stepmom feel a little guilty helping sis with all her cars while i just had the gas guzzling van. He says theyll pay the car payment while i get insurance. Cool! I happily accept. And everything is in my name btw. Get the car abd everythings cool for a few months.\n\nDad then asks if he can take my car to florida since his car is worse on gas. Hed let me use his car that week. We live in michigan so its not exactly close. I explain id rather not put that many miles on it just for a vacation. He flips out saying how hes the one paying for it and that im ungrateful. That i never thanked stepmom (i did and have text proof) and that he wont forget this the next time he needs something. He cant believe that id be like that over only 2k miles. This was all a txt convo so i can probably dig it up. Anyway i just said i can pay for the car if thats how he feels but he kinda shut up about. Hours later txted me he was proud i wanted to keep my car nice. It was kinda weird idk. He still pays for it and i pay for insurance. Sometimes i wonder if i was just being a selfish bitch but he didnt ask to take stepmoms little 4 door or sisters. And he never ended up going to florida because of other money things. Oh and if it was for an emergency of course id give him my car! It was just for a vacation so it wasnt serious.\n\nTL;DR: dad offers to pay car payments willingly after car gets vandilized and gets extremely upset when i dont want him to take my car from michigan to florida for a week to save gas money. Everything is in my name. I offer to take over all my own payments which he doesnt like but stops asking about the car.",

I had maybe 6-7 months to plan this wedding and it did stress me out more than I wanted, but I tend to handle stress very well since I do something similar for a living.

I don't want any of her other friends ripping you a new one bc you weren't sensitive to their stress during this time as well.\"\n\nSo yeah, AITA?

      "description": "Background Information: My sister and I had a very poor relationship when I was growing up (10 - 16), she smoked a lot of pot and did a lot of drugs and I just played COD all day. Then I started occasionally smoking pot (Once every 2-3 weeks) our relationship started growing. But our parents are heavily against pot, but they know and accept that my sister smokes but would be royally pissed if I smoked because they believe that marijuana = meth and I'll be wasting my life away. So my sisters and I relationship is strictly built off of the fact shes keeping the fact I smoke pot as a secret. \n\nSister got into a argument with my mom and yelled something like \"You'd give me money if I was DownvotedOpinions420!\" So I yelled back \"Yeah, but I don't ask for money every day.\" To which she responds \"I need the money to fix my car, remember I got into a accident.\" So I said \"Yeah, I remember it's your 4th one this month.\"\n\nShe mumbles something and storms out. I could tell that I hurt her feelings and was honestly going to apologize until my mom bursted in and told me my sister told her I've been smoking pot and banging some whore who smokes everyday. \n\nI couldnt lie to them, so I told them I smoked once a while ago (somewhat true) and I was having a FWB relationship with a girl who smokes everday. \n\nBut I feel like she retailated because I said something too true/hurtful. But I also feel super betrayed because siblings are supposed to argue but not tell secrets. So I ghosted her, blocked her on everything and rarely talk to her. I avoid her in the house and try to keep small talk. ",

I ask her if we should say something but the best I get is an “idk” \n\nI stay at the bar for about another hour before I say goodbye to those that I know and head out, but before I leave I decide it’d be best to tell the local authorities that something might be up here. \n\nI call the non emergency number and pretty much say, “I’m out side a bar and I’ve been told there’s a 9y/o in the back of a van here” \n\nI was actually shocked by the operator as I feel like she doesn’t believe me, she says, “well do you know or are you just guessing?”, and eventually “are you going to check the van or should I hang up?” \n\nThere are two vans in the parking lot, the first is full of random shit and the second is aswell but out of the corner of my eye I see something in the front seat...\n\nHoly shit, it’s feet.... some one is laying across the driver and passenger seat. \n\nI’m out, I start to retreat to my vehicle I don’t want to be here any more, I tell the operator that yes, some one is in the vehicle. \n\nShe’s like “is it a man or woman? What are they wearing?” Eventually she’s has me leave my vehicle to get the tag number of this van before making the call to the cops.\n\nAs I wait (they have my description/name/number) for the cops to arrive the man who had made the statements earlier exits the bar with beer (and bottled water) and smokes a cig. \n\nI seriously don’t want to be here now and the worst thing that could happen is a officer arrives while this man is present while I try to explain the situation.\n\nWell it happens, more than one cop, 4 total. \n\nAnd of course, it turns out to be an old man sleeping in the car and the man from the bar is just.... strange? \n\nI made 4 officers come to my location for nothing. \n\nAs I try to explain myself the man from the bar has an Uber him away, and some other patrons exit. \n\nThey corroborate my story about the man from the bar. But I still can’t believe I made these people drive so far for speculation. \n\nAITA for making them show up en force for a totally hoax? \n\n",

      "description": "Backstory: My friend (f/31) is getting married in September. She is the second oldest of four sisters (and two brothers, who are irrelevant). Her Maid of Honor is her youngest sister (YS).\n\nSaid YS is married herself and even though she is in her mid-20s, I've always known her to be a bit childish and unsocial.\n\nYS created a group chat for my friends bachelorette party a few weeks ago. This group consists of YS, me and 39 other people. She just threw seemingly any woman my friend has ever known into this groupchat.\n\nTurns out, YS had no idea about what to do for the party. So instead, she thought us 40 people could organize it all together. Even better, she had absolutely no ideas and not even a general clue of what her sister would like (and most importantly: dislike) to do during her party.\n\nThis went as well as anyone could have predicted: there were a lot of ideas, some even really great, but nobody could agree on anything, how long, where, how expensive [etc. Best](https://etc.Best) of all: we couldn't even agree on a date.\n\nSo naturally we were at a stand-still for weeks on end.\n\nNow, my friend is getting married in September but her BP needs to happen before June because she and her future husband are currently building a house and they let everyone know that those months until the wedding would be off-limits for them.\n\nSo of course YS then came up with the brilliant plan to surprise-kidnap her sister on a weekend in July.\n\nThat's kind of where I lost my head.\n\nI agree that maybe I shouldn't have done this in the group-chat but I was furious at YS' lack of leadership and her almost desinterest in the entire process. She just wanted results, but didn't want to do anything for it.\n\nSo I told her that kidnapping my Friend in July was a stupid idea, that I would not be a part of disrespecting her wishes like that and that it was her (YS) fault that we had gotten so close to the cut-off date without even a tiny idea of what we would do during her party.\n\nShe answered that she thought it was going rather well and I told her that so far the whole thing was pathetic and sad and that I had expected that she as the Maid of Honor would not just at least give a crap about all of this, but that she would come up with a few strong ideas (including dates and plans) of what we could all do together to celebrate our Friend instead of leaving it all to us.\n\nI caught quite a bit of heat for that outburst and a lot of people defended YS, saying that she only meant well etc. There were a few people defending what I said as well though (although a lot nicer) and three of my friends PM'd me to let me know they agree.\n\nSo far, she's been giving me the silent treatment and we haven't talked about it any further. The party is now set to be in May, but we haven't gotten any further than that.\n\nSo ... AITA for telling her it was her responsibility to at least come up with a rough idea of her sister's Bachelorette Party?",

This time, she came to me complaining about her psychiatrist because she called her lazy. When I asked her to elaborate, she said the doctor tells her she should worry about the consequences of hurting herself and my sister told her, \"well, I won't be around to be affected by it.\" \n\nI already started feeling irritated at this point. I was having a bad day and this rubbed me the wrong way. So I told her what I've felt for a while now. I said, \"perhaps she's right? I feel like you're too fixated and it's not helpful for your recovery. You complain all the time and seem like you expect things to just change like that. I'm tired because I've tried to help you but you seem fixated on your own ways.\" \n\nShe got defensive as usual, and then told me how I always make her feel like shit for just having emotions! I asked her, what did she want to exactly happen for her to feel better, and she replied, \"nothing\". So she wants things to change but nothing to happen. I don't know.\n\nI suggested she see a therapist to work things out and help her figure her stuff. She came up with excuses. Then she started guilt tripping me. When I told her to stop complaining to me, she said, \"okay sorry to bother you. You're angry now. Let's not talk about it anymore i won't bring it up again\" \"Okay i won't share with you anymore if that's what you want. No more burdening you with it\"\n\nWhen I pointed at that, she said \"Okay yes I'm the world's most pathetic person.\" So I just gave up and told her bye then blocked her.\n\nI just feel exhausted at this point. I have my own shit to deal with, and I wish we could have just ONE conversation without her bringing her shit into the mix. I feel like she's become toxic to me.\n\nSo AITA here?\n",

I share my apartment with a friend from high school ( each with out own room), but he’s chill with the situation and gets along with her too. There have been no problems with the situation so far, but she does have her own apartment which she doesn’t really use. \n\nRecently we both came back home for spring break, but she went back earlier than I did. I let her keep the keys to my place so that she could sleep there and cook and well chill, I get in 2 days after her with my roommate. This has happened before where I let her live at my place for a bit without me and it wasn’t an issue. Last time she also wanted to have a friend over and had asked me with a good amount of time letting me know. I wasn’t super happy about it, but it was about a week without me and she said she got lonely so I complied. And I would just prefer she used her place to hang out with her friends which is like 3 blocks away. \n\nThe issue came this time when because from what I can tell she was at my place and asked her friend to move her stuff to her apartment to make extra space in the closet for her summer stuff ( we share my closet she was moving out winter stuff for summer stuff). In the moment I wasn’t made aware of that, and I assumed she was alone. She left the apartment to pick up some things and came back saying things with “we” and I was confused thinking she was alone. So I asked and she said she was with her friend. Then I asked if she and her friend were going to chill at my apartment and she then said yea if it was ok with me. I then told her that I thought it was a bit weird for people to be at my place, but since her friend was already there then they might as well. They hadn’t moved her clothes or anything just gone to pick other stuff up from nearby. \n\nMy girlfriend was upset by this saying that she mentioned her friend helping her, but she hadn’t mentioned when or that they were even together. I was more upset that she was inviting people, and I was the one that asked if they were hanging out at my place before she even mentioned it. She ended up sending her friend home and getting really upset saying that she wants to move out because I don’t make it feel like her home too. In reality I know it’s not a big deal if her friend had stayed to chill but I would have liked a bit more of a heads up than me asking if she’s alone when in reality her and the friend are already driving to my place. \n\nSo AITA for getting upset ",

      "description": "Mobile user...\n\nFirst time posting...\n\nMy little sister has been like a daughter to me for years, we are more like great friends with a mother/daughter dynamic. She messes up, I’m there to fix stuff...she needs advice, I’m there to provide.  \n\nWe had a huge falling out about 3 years ago, which lasted about 2 years. Last year she met a guy with 3 kids that he has sole custody of and she has basically taken the role of mom for all of them (8 years, 2 years, and 13 months). I have accepted them as my own nieces and nephew and I love them so much. The man she’s with seems great (although he likes alcohol a bit too much for my comfort...and I drink wine every night  if that’s any indication of how much he drinks).   All in all I love her, support her, and I’ll always be there for her. \n\nWhen we were younger we made a pact...we would be each other’s maids of honor. When I married she was mine, although she was horrible at it. She didn’t plan anything, wasn’t involved at all...but I was understanding because she was only 20 and I figured she just didn’t have the maturity to be a good maid of honor. Not a big deal...she was by my side on my big day and I was happy. \n\nNow that she’s getting married she’s picked someone other than me. To be her maid of honor but said she would still “let” me be her bridesmaid. But honestly I’m hurt. I don’t want to make a big deal of it but I’d rather not be involved than be involved and watch someone that I don’t even know take on the role that I thought I’d have. I know it seems selfish and I don’t mean it like that, but honestly I’d rather let my teenage daughter be her bridesmaid and me just kind of hang out on the sidelines. \nI don’t want to be rude or selfish but I know if I come to all of the special bridal party stuff I’ll just be resentful the whole time and bitchy to the girl she chose over me. I know myself. Im territorial and I’m already hurt, going further is just going to make it worse. I don’t feel like I mean as much to her as she does to me and it just sucks. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I declined being a bridesmaid? ",

      "description": "Sorry for formatting. Tldr at bottom. \n\nI work at 7am in the morning and occasionally I'll head to Starbucks in a quiet plaza around 6:30 to grab coffee. I usually park in the spot that's most convenient (don't we all?) and easy to park in. This spot is directly facing the Starbucks, where there are table and chairs set up. It just so happens that my headlights are pointing at the window since I pull in.\n\nOne morning I pulled in, but my headlights don't turn off right away and can take up to a few minutes to turn off anyways. But I usually order through the mobile and run in and out under a minute to grab my drink. This older lady comes over to me to ask if I'm leaving soon because my headlights are \"blinding\" her. I told her that I'm just grabbing my drink and leaving, which I did. \n\nOver the next few weeks, I go but the same convenient spot is always taken so I park one spot over or whatever. The older lady sits in the exact same spot every single day (I'm assuming). Yesterday, my mom was driving me, so she has the car running and I run in to grab my drink. The older lady goes out to the car and I see her peeking into the driver seat. She comes back in and doesn't say anything to me.  I get my drink and I see her walking back in to grab her phone. She takes pictures of my car, mom, and I inside the car..  - obviously about the headlights. \n\nSame thing today where we go to Starbucks. This time she pulls her phone asap and walks out to take pictures once again. Then she comes directly to me, starts asking me why we park there, etc. I say it's for my convenience and it's a public place.. blah blah. Anyways, she insults my mom so I choose to not respond to her, so she tells me I need to grow up. The barista is standing there watching and after she leaves, the barista tells me he feels sorry for me to offer to comp me for a drink. \n\nBasically I'm not parking there to spite her, but out of my convenience. She constantly takes pictures of us without our consent obviously. No idea what's happening with the pics but whatever.  AITA?\n\nTldr: i park in a spot, where it's convenient for me, but because this lady claimed this window seat, the headlights don't turn off right away when I go into Starbucks for less than 2 minutes. She's harassing me but AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "So, from the title you're probably thinking that I am very much a complete and utter Ahole for ignoring my sick mother so  please let me give some context first.\n\nAbout 1 to 2 years ago, my mother was diagnosed with a mental illness called lewy body dementia (which is very close to Alzheimer's or Parkinson's) which makes it so my mother looses basic motor and thinking abilities. It started out with some very minor tremors and not being able to walk around as fast but it got a lot worse over time.\n\nNow skipping ahead to today, she has become unable to take care of herself. She can barley walk, can't do any house work, can't finish a sentence without shuddering a few times and for a month or so now, needs assistance to go relieve herself and sometimes an accident occurs, thankfully, my dad does that part. She also cries out of nowhere from time to time which is very hard to watch.\n\nThankfully now that she's on a few different medications she's doing a slight bit better but this is the part that really kills me. Before the medication, she never really noticed that I, or anyone else around her even existed, with her thinking that her sister that lives in Europe came to visit her for a few minuets and left showing how much she needed the medicine, but now, things are better but even worse in my eyes. She now can do basic motor functions that she couldn't before but now she thinks like she's in the past where I was in elementary school and my sister was in college. This might not seem too bad but I'm currently in high school and my sister is married and far out of college. She still does suffer from the issues said above.\n\nSo finally addressing the reason I ignore her. Well it's pretty simple, she doesn't have much time and every single fricking time she talks to me it hurts so much by her telling me to get ready so she can drive me to school, eat the breakfast that she thought she had made and asking why my sister isn't home from college. It feels even more awful because that's probably the time where she started to fall down that deep trench and I feel like if she doesn't seem to think of me and only remembers that I exist at times that she wouldn't care if I slowly separated myself from her.\n\nI've been feeling guilty for doing this the past week and while I think this might not fit in right with this subreddit, I just want to know, how much of an asshole am I for ignoring my mother that will probably be gone in a year or two, if that long.",

      "description": "A few years ago, friend 1 had a place all to herself that was too big and expensive for one person. Friend 2 and I moved in with her. When we did, we asked the landlord if we should add our names to the lease. He said don't worry about it. A bit later friend 1 (the person with the lease) moved away. Again, friend 2 and I asked if we should sign a lease. Landlord said no. Finally, friend 2 moved out and my SO moved in. This time we actually told the landlord we would like a lease. He never responded.\n\nHere's where it gets tricky. I knew that friend 1 had initially asked about having a cat and the landlord said no. My SO has two cats. My SO and I  figured if the no pet rule was that big of a deal, the landlord would be more insistent about a lease and house rules. Plus, at that point, I had lived there for several years, had been a great tenant, and felt somewhat irritated that he wasn't communicative and didn't give me a lease when I asked for one. So we decided not to ask him about it and moved the two cats in.\n\nAs you can guess, while doing maintenance on the house one day, he saw the cats and confronted me about it. I told him I'd never seen a lease (true) and didn't know about the cat rule (not true). I offered to pay extra each month as a pet fee; he turned it down. He accused me of lying and said that I had asked him about it (not true, I think he might have confused me with the initial lease holder who moved away.) He gave us an ultimatum: get rid of the cats or move out by the end of the month. Obviously, we weren't going to get rid of the cats and the end of the month was three weeks away, which was way too little time to find a new place and move. I lied and told him we'd get rid of the cats to buy us some time.\n\nWithin a couple months of that incident, we found a new place, signed the lease, and moved--all without telling the landlord. We never notified him. We simply locked the door and never sent in the next month's rent. (We did pay for all of the months that we lived there.) Since we'd never signed a lease, he didn't have any of our personal or contact info besides a single email address of mine. I never heard from him again, but I assume he figured it out. \n\nI felt justified in our decision because he had multiple opportunities to lay out the rules and consequences but never did. When we broke a rule that he never told us about he gave us an, IMO, unfair ultimatum. But whenever I drive past the old place, I do wonder....AITA?? I DID know about the rule although he never told me, and it is his place.",

Jim told me that it was a mutual breakup, and that the relationship just wasn't working, and Jim is moving from our east coast home to Washington for college after this semester.  I've been friends with Ericka for about as long as she and Jim had been dating, and we have some good chemistry, but I never even considered asking her out before since, well, she was with Jim.  A couple days ago though one of my other guy friends suggested that I go on a date with Ericka since she is single now and has hinted that she likes me.  I told him I didn't want Jim to be upset with me and I didn't want to mess up my friendship with either Jim or Ericka by asking her out.  He basically responded with \"Jim won't be mad don't worry about it\" which didn't do much to convince me.  Now though I have realized that I actually do want to ask her out and be more than friends, but WIBTA?",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom but I had this friend for a little over a year. We always hung out and did a bunch of after school programs and shit together. We both smoked weed every once in a while but at least on my end it was maybe once every couple months\n\nAnyways flash forward to about a year ago. We're both set to help at some after school thing. I get there and try to message her and find out like two hours after that she didn't come in because she took a shitload of acid and was tripping hardcore. This caused a lot of discourse but eventually I just kind of tried to not let it bother me\n\nFast forward a week later and she comes to practice high too and gets mad at me for telling her that she's a fucking idiot, giving me responses like \"I know how to handle myself\" and \"it doesn't affect me that much chill\"\n\nLet that one slide too because I was head over heels for her at the time but here's the kicker. She comes over and we chill for a bit and the conversation goes something like this. It's been a while so it may sound like parts were missing. \n\nMe: Hey, I think we should get some weed. It's been a while\n\nHer: Yeah dude sounds good. If you want we could try something harder?\n\nMe: nah that's okay I really dont want to do much more than that it's kind of scary shit. I really don't think you should be doing it either it really worries me. \n\nThis was followed by her blowing up on me, saying how I was a hypocrite because I was interested in shrooms a couple months ago. Her only real defense was when I mentioned how drugs ruined my relationship with my dad and a close friend she said she knows what she's doing and she's not like them (she didn't and she was). This all pissed her off so she tried to walk five miles home with a leg injury she sustained from idfk. Ended up picking her up down the road and dropping her off. Tried talking to her for days but she wouldn't open or respond to anything. \n\nFlash forward a week or two and she tells not only me, but all of my friends that she's blocking us all, and doesn't wish to be friends with people who aren't going to side with her choices no matter what, referring to us all as \"acquaintances\". This was a big issue in our circle and I was pretty damn pissed, so whenever anyone asked about it and noticed how upset about the situation I was, I would proceed to tell them the whole story and throw in some extra shit about her because I was angry and upset. I didn't have the right to say those things because they were super private (pregnancy scares, her trying to exchange sex for money with people, her unpositive opinions on people in our friend group). I really made it obvious that I hated her with every fiber in my body and wanted everyone else to hate her just as much. She ends up dropping out of some of her classes that she had with me in it and as far as I know has had it off extremely poorly since the incident. AITA for what I did and my reactions?",

      "title": "AITA for keeping my sister's two cats locked up, while my one freely roams the house?",
      "description": "My sister and I both live at home, with our parents. I've never left the nest, and while she has (She's 5 years older than me, and had a bit of a head start), she moved back in maybe 2 years ago after spending a few years living with her former boyfriend. \n\n\nNow, my whole family has always had cats. Sometimes a lot of them, even. When she moved away, we had five-- she took two with her, since there was one she actively wanted to take, and the second was bonded to her, and the only cat that tolerated being around the one she actively wanted. Over the time she was gone, the bonded one died, so she moved back in with the remaining one. And here is where our issue kind of started.\n\n\nOver the time she'd been gone (maybe about 3 years), the three cats we had left may have forgotten the one she took. But, being older cats, used to each other, they didn't take kindly to a 'new' cat returning to the roost. So, for a little while, we sequestered my sister's cat. It was to be kept in her room with the door closed, to give it a safe place to not be attacked or worried about anything. Things were okay for a bit, and we were slowly trying to warm them up to each other, and eventually let my sister's cat back out into the house at large. But, one of the older cats started getting really territorial and aggressive at this point. She stopped using the litter box, and began destroying things in the way cats seem uniquely well suited to do. It was... Bad. We isolated that cat, tried different brands of food, of litter to try and attract her back to the box, literally giving her prescription pills to try and relax her after multiple visits to the vet. We spent almost a year and a half trying to fix things before the cat was finally put down (Sheltering wasn't an option in our area, and nobody was willing to foster a territorial cat that was using the toilet everywhere she pleased). Barely a month later, the second of the older cats got very sick, and passed away naturally.\n\n\nI'll break the narrative here to interject that, while this was going on, my sister decided to adopt another cat. You'd think this would be a bad idea. ... I SAID it was a bad idea. But my mother is a pushover for cute animals, even if she is the one most in favor of putting them down if they become a problem. So, my sister begged and twisted her arm until my mother let her adopt a second cat. So at that point, we were back at 5 cats. Two living in my sister's room until they got more acclimated, three living in the house proper. None really happy to interact with each other, and one actively throwing a rebellion against other cats existing. Upon recognizing that adding unfamiliar cats to the environment had thrown things out of whack and made things unsustainable, my sister consented to keeping hers isolated again, to try and fool the old cats into thinking the new ones were gone.\n\n\nFast forwarding back to near-present. With two out of three older cats now gone, we're down to three total again: My one cat, who we've had for about 13 years. She is very small for an adult cat (think 'runt of the litter'), who has never been confined. She has full access to the house, except my sister's room. And opposite her, my sister's two cats. Both of them are younger cats; one is maybe 8 years old and pretty chill, albeit a bit territorial. Doesn't really seek out trouble, but will give you some if you come looking. The second is only about 3 or 4 years old, but really physically large. Given she's pretty young, she's still very energetic and playful, and constantly tries to escape my sister's room. Given she's got two cats isolated in her room, and one actively wants to get out and roam, my sister wants to let her cats out.\n\n\nNow... This is where I specifically have an issue. My cat doesn't like the other two, but when they are out, will usually just sit with me and growl for hours on end, until she forgets they exist. The cat is usually glued to me anyway, granted. My sister's younger cat, however, likes to play and explore. Her idea of playing happens to include stalking my growling, openly hostile cat, and trying to pounce on and attack her. The younger cat goes so far as to hide under my bed and wait for my cat to jump down, so she can go to town on her. This isn't a new or unfamiliar trait, and this kind of interaction is part of why we kept them separated to start with-- just today, I got a big cut on my foot because my cat was sitting on the floor next to me, when the younger cat brought the beat-down onto her(And by extension, me).\n\n\nAfter a lot of scrambling to separate them, my sister sent hers back to her room, while being kind of sulky and passive aggressive about it. I feel like I'm being made to be the bad guy here-- and I can kind of understand why, since I have one small cat that lives in an entire house, versus her two that are isolated to a single room, that my sister also feels isolated to. But I don't think it's fair to restrict my cat now that she's in the minority, because of decisions my sister made. And likewise (apart from me getting hurt as collateral damage), I'm honestly scared of leaving my cat alone in the house with hers during the week, with everyone in the house working full time jobs. I don't want my cat to get hurt or attacked when I'm not around to break up a fight and protect her. Even if the younger cat thinks of it as playing, I've got enough cuts to know that at least one of them has claws out for it, and I don't want my cat in a much lower weight-class to be getting into fights she can't be helped out of. ... And that's not even touching on the mismatch between her cats needing to be on a diet, versus my cat having food constantly out to *encourage* her to eat, due to being so small and thin.\n\n\nTL;DR: I don't want my sister letting her two recently introduced cats out of her room, for the safety and well being of my cat that is older and smaller, and was here first. I don't want to tell her to wait for my cat to pass away before hers can be allowed to roam the house, but that feels at the end of the day what I'm asking for. AITA here?",

Is everything that both of us did in this situation fair, just, and right, aside from me getting mad and being sarcastic? Was he justified in threatening to break up with me?

      "title": "AITA for bailing on my friends and colleagues after being lied to?",
      "description": "Last year, 3 of my friends started a business for digital marketing and approached me to help.  They needed a web developer, which I am, though they couldn’t pay me my full rate.  I completely understood, and told them I’d work for them at a massive discount (1/4 of my normal rate) so that they could build capital—but the agreement was very specifically that 1. I would only work up to 20 hours a week for them at that rate so I could have other job options part time and 2. That when they had a respectable profit margin, I would get generous compensation.  We swore that above all, we had each other’s backs. \n\nFast forward to last month: it’s been a year now that I’ve worked with them, and I quit in November due to rising tensions with one of the friends who had issues listening to other people and respecting the word “no”.  I also have never been given a raise, even though my hours were increased to 30 a week in the first couple months, and I have never been able to take a vacation where I didn’t have to work. When I quit, I told the guys that I’m giving them 4 month notice (or until they find a replacement) so as to not screw them over since I’m personally responsible for a large aspect of the company and none of them know my processes.  Upon my initial resignation, two of the three immediately offered me pay raises and financial bonuses to stay.  I said we could talk about it, and was surprised because i had been under the impression that the company was hurting for funds.\n\nOver the last month, they have found a replacement and subsequently told me that it turns out there’s no extra money for me. They said if I had stayed for 2 more years I would have gotten a bonus, but since I’m leaving tough titties.  I also found out that they are charging our clients 2 times the amount I was originally told, and when the math is on the table it is impossible that they are strapped for cash.  One of the guys has an (almost) beachfront property in Southern California on the company’s dime, and I have heard from other people in our industry that they are undoubtedly a million dollar, if not a multi million dollar, company at this point. My replacement, another friend of theirs, is getting a higher salary than I was paid, even though I have years of experience on him. \n\nI feel betrayed and hurt. I have spent the last year making endless concessions and sacrifices to help these guys and I’m hit with the reality slap that they have spent the last year prioritizing business decisions over my well being. I’m not mad at them for that: what I’m mad about is that they’ve intentionally deceived me into believing otherwise and i feel taken for granted. \n\nSo, I’m on vacation at the moment and I originally told them I promise I’d get some stuff done over the holiday. I have absolutely no interest in helping them anymore and am looking forward to finally putting myself first.  I have completely ignored their calls and messages for the last three days and feel like I owe them nothing.  I feel like they broke their promises to me to look out for themselves and I don’t feel guilty about breaking mine to look out for me. \n\nI know it’s not the right thing to do, or the high road to take, but AITA?",

      "description": "Me and my friend made a bet on whether I could have sex with someone before our holiday, the bet was £50 at duty free. \nMe and my friend then made another bet. £50 in cash, if I could get abs or not at the level of Triple H (2007) before the holiday. \n\nWe get on holiday and I haven’t had sex so I lose the first bet but I’m pretty certain I have the abs. We agree I’ll show at the hotel and because both the bets would cancel out I don’t initially pay the £50 at duty free and say I’ll do it on the way back. \nI do stall for a couple days to find the correct lighting (as my friend said I could), but when I show, he claims that I’m not at that level, but I claim I am, before the bet we say we can’t ask other people that we know as they’re biased so we can’t sort it out that way. \n\nWe agree at one point that we should void the second bet as we can’t find a clear winner, so I’ll pay the £50 at duty free on the way back. He can’t find the product he wants, so asks me to give him £50 cash, I say no, because the bet is at duty free, like a voucher and because he’d do the same if it was the other way round. (The last bet he lost with me was about £5 which he didn’t pay for months).\nHe doesn’t like this and says I’m being a d*ck for longing out the bet. I say he would’ve done the same. \n\nWhen we’re home, I had paid for taxis abroad with my credit card as I was the only one that doesn’t get charged fees. He didn’t pay me back the £20 for those taxis and said that he’ll keep it as security until the next holiday when we go to duty free. I say no because I have to pay my card company and I lose out on investing that money. He says I can surely cover £20. I say that’s not the point. \n\nHe then says that I strung him along the holiday, so I could avoid paying the £100. Also, that I so clearly lost the second bet and I should give him the £100. I say I’ve won the second bet, but we voided it now. \n\nI say that if he doesn’t give me the £20 cash for the taxis he can forget about the £50 at duty free. He says that I owe him £100 because I clearly lost the second bet as well. Since he doesn’t give a response I have just said to keep the £20 and I’m not paying him the £50 at duty free and that’s it. He’s still annoyed. AITA?",

      "description": "A couple of weeks ago, I was catching the bus home from a fairly large bus mall. It was the busy time, and I'm on a popular route, so it was packed. I ended up close to the front of the bus, in that front space with sideways benches for people with mobility issues etc. I'm quite tall and ended up pushed in to a spot directly below one of the horizontal grab bars. The bar itself was at exactly head height for me, so I had to keep my head awkwardly bent to one side or the other, bumping it with every pothole (and there were a lot more than I ever realized).\n\nAfter a few stops, the bus had started emptying out, but only from the back so I was still jammed against my headpole. Finally, someone left from the front, leaving their seat empty. The guy that was in front of the seat, rather than sitting, decided to keep standing. A woman next to the empty seat tried to get his attention, but he either ignored her or didn't hear. So, being pretty difficult to miss or ignore, and tired of the growing bruise on my head, I caught his attention and said \"Hey- if you sit down, there'll be more space for the rest of us.\" \n\nThe guy did a little jump, as if he was startled by me or the idea of sitting. But then, instead of sitting down, he grabbed the bar in front of and above the seat and got in a squat position. He held himself there for the rest of the ride, never letting his rear touch the seat, grimacing. He looked like someone trying to take a dump in a toilet without touching their bare ass to the seat.\n\nI chalked it up to him being odd, but I started getting looks from other people on the bus, and a friend I was chatting with looked kind of embarrassed and stopped talking. I ended up standing comfortably, so I don't regret doing it, but I'm still worried that a bunch of people that work in the same place I do think I'm an asshole.\n\nSo, render judgement, ye experts of anal orifices. Am I The Asshole?\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for arguing with an old coworker that the VFX industry is not fair to junior and mid level artists?",
      "description": "So, I am using a throwaway because VFX is very Non Disclosure Agreement driven and I could lose my job over breaking an NDA. I don't think this will break any but the discussion is there nonetheless.   \n\n\nSo this guy I used to work with a couple of years ago contacted me on Linkedin a couple of hours ago and we had a discussion mainly about what we were up to and what we have been doing, etc. This guy has been in the industry since 2004, so he has ample amounts of experience and connections. I have only been working in this industry for almost 4 years today. One of the problems with this industry is that getting a foot in the door is incredibly difficult for the first couple of years. There are tons of students that don't end up making it into the industry and a bunch of people who leave it by their 2nd year of doing this. It isn't for everyone and there isn't that much payoff for doing this. So to get into a studio, you need a reel/portfolio. Essentially what you have done either in school or in other studios. And a lot of the jobs are freelancing, so for me, I was having to jump from studio to studio a lot.   \n\n\nFor the last 3 months, I left my job so that I could work on my reel so I can get a better job closer to what I want to do. This is where we start getting into an argument. In the last 4 years of work, I have had only one project in a studio that has come out that I can put my name on and publicly share. He has had multiple shows and movies come out and says \" ive got so much poftfolio materisla, i dont even know what to do with it \" and \"This is the issue, juniors isnt savvy at business, they dont looks the long term effects, dude i turned down a $75/hr job. shouldnt be hard to find one at 14/hr.\" English isn't his first language but you get the idea. He went on to explain that he has been turning down jobs left and right where I can't even get an interview. I can't get junior positions because I have too much experience. So I usually go out of my way to help Junior Artists. I will give them contacts to studios I used to work in, I will call up friends, just reach out in general, because it's rough in this field. So one of the guys I helped is about a year in the industry and worked with this guy. He drives Uber to make enough to meet rent after moving to LA from the Mid West. I'm just trying to get at that the work can be scarce for people with nothing to show for it.   \n\n\nI actually just got a message from a staffing agency that says \" Such a bummer how long it can take to get work released to artists... \\*studio redacted\\* is looking for portfolios with professional work so I'm afraid it won't be a good fit this time around. Let's stay in touch and see what else comes around.\"   \n\n\nSo we were discussing reels and he brings up \" well, these compnay dont even looks at my reel, they just asked for my resume or linkedin profile\" which is fair because he is a senior artist, they know he can do the job. He then explains that he still likes making a reel because he likes seeing his hard work in a video, but then he says its for his ego. This is where I kind of lose my shit, I told him that I don't care about ego, I just need it for work. To which, we are now in a \"I was paying my dues when I was in your position, I dont even try to do high profile work, because i know where my skills are, when I was in your position, i was paying my dues.\" I actually don't know what he means because he was with his first studio for 8 years. I respond with that this case is kind of rare in that an artist can work 4 years with almost nothing to show for it, it doesnt happen often. I have worked on 3-4 pitches which you cant show, a couple of Marvel films with only one having released in theaters, and a bunch of stuff that is heavily NDA'd. The things I am allowed to show from the Marvel film are very small snippets because most of the work I did did not make it into the final cut.   \n\n\nHe then explained that I put myself into this position, which while true, is also a little bit of a dick move. \"Its your fault to take the job, you can always say no and move on. It's business and you have to learn to walk away. Just last week I turned down 3 job offers.\" So I reiterated  \" I dont think youre getting it, I cant even get one job offer when you are turning them down. I spend months waiting for one so I am not going to say no to that job, regardless of what the NDA situation is. I have bills and student loans, I can't wait for the perfect job.\" And then this comes down to \"maybe do a few small projects where you can showcase your skills, like a cheap independent production, or something short that doesn't pay well.\" My biggest issue with some of this is, I have had between 60 and 90 hour weeks regularly, when I get home, I don't have any time to work on anything on the side. The problem with this to me is that the starting salary for a Junior artist is around $20-30/hr, which isn't much in Los Angeles. So once you have the student loans, rent, living expenses; a lot of the studios are in pretty high traffic and expensive areas for food, and then you have to be paid not enough to afford the bare essentials, it's awful. My first year in this industry, I was living with my parents, having a 2 hour commute one way, and working 50-60 hours a week for $17/hr, so I knew it was awful. I have a couple hundred bucks left in my savings so I am starting to get more and more desperate for work, so to hear that its completely justified to him that a competitive industry like this, in an expensive city, where there are hundreds of applicants and only one person gets the job, its rough. Having him say that I should pick and choose the shows I work on pisses me off. I havent had a vacation in 4 years, I have been just barely above debt. At the most, I had about $6,000 in savings, I actually thought I might have a vacation this year, but beggars cant be choosers.   \n\n\nSo this is where I asked him \"Should I have to eat shit for years for a chance to have a steak?\" Honestly, not my best analogy, but I think it gets the point across. To which he replies \" okay man, this started to not getting productive, so im going to block you now. I hope you get help mentally. There is free service to get a shrink, and hope you can get this straightened out.\" Completely came out of nowhere. I was pretty much speechless, but fuck him.   \n\n\nI can see where he's coming from, but the industry kind of boomed when he started. He has never had the same kind of struggle to find work. The part I don't understand is that he doesnt have the empathy to realize that because he can turn away work, that its just that easy for juniors and mid level artists. Sometimes, the plan doesnt work out and 4 years later, you have very little to show for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL DR; Old Coworker is turning down work and can pick and choose what projects he works on, I wish I could just get a job, but almost everything I have worked on I cant show. Because I cant show the stuff I worked on because of NDA's, I can't get interviews at a couple of studios that I have applied to. Old Coworker thinks that because I'm frustrated with this system, I should get mental health help. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA For wanting to take back an apology",
      "description": "Apologies for the long read. \n\nI (M, 22) went to a new years party with some friends. 2 of them (Both F, 21 &amp; 23) had been dumped by their boyfriends the week before, no correlation, just weird coincidence. I figure at least they have each other to support in their hard times since they both really had strong feelings for their SOs and I knew it was gonna take a while for either of them to get over it. For sake of clarity we'll call them S &amp; H\n\nI'm close with both and took the time to console them equally and be supportive mostly through talking. Come the party, we're all out, drinking, having a great time. Guys who were interested would talk to them, I'd leave them to decide how to respond to it and they knew to come to me or another friend if they were uncomfortable. I was also both of their rides home and they have more than usual strict parents so the pressure was on for me (A miracle they were even allowed to go out in the first place with someone who wasn't an SO).\n\nSo the night ends well for us, no one's dead, injured or missing, usual expected hangovers the next morning, I get the girls home. Two days later I'm texting S (23) about Black Mirror and she hits me out of nowhere with this long paragraph about how she knows I like her and was trying to come on to her at the party, she doesn't like that I was trying to get with her a week after her break up but she's willing to forgive me and we could still be friends. I told her I'm sorry she's feels that way and that I made her uncomfortable and we ended it at that.\n\nI will say first of all that this is not what was happening and that I had no intention to, secondly I'm not happy with the way our conversation ended it off because I feel that I did nothing wrong and shouldn't apologise for what didn't happened, mainly cause she caught me off guard while she had time to think about what she'd say and I was high at the time we were texting so I don't think I was in the right state of mind to think my response through properly.\n\nI completely understand why she'd jump to this conclusion. Since I was her ride I had to keep an eye on her, but I barely met that mark, I was busy doing my own flirting with other girls, playing games or being a general fool, fairly certain I was more drunk than her (It was a sleep over so I could get drunk so long as I was fine to drive at some point the next day). This meant I would regularly check up on her from time to time but that was about it. The second reason was that we kissed once about a year ago when we were both drunk but that went nowhere, we'd bring it up as a joke often and she hadn't even met her ex yet, so she figured there was motive in me. Towards the end of the night she'd visibly flinch if I touched her and I immediately caught on it, at the time I couldn't figure out what it was but I refrained from touching her for the rest of the night just in case. She's also still emotional about her ex and brings him up a lot so I'm willing to accept that her emotions may have her jumping to conclusions. Her justification to me was that I kept touching her too much and it made her uncomfortable. \n\nI understand all her reasons but I still don't think it was good enough to decide I'm trying to be a scumbag. Firstly I'd say I spent about 30% of the night with her, never once were our conversations sexual or suggestive of anything between the two of us, I'd purposely exit conversations where guys were flirting with her cause I thought 'hey, anything to take your mind off your ex'. Secondly and I think this is a very important reason, we haven't been alone in months. What I mean is her and her ex were THAT couple who were basically permanently glued to each other , would full on make out in front of everyone and everything, awkward. They dated for almost a year and I'd never see her unless he was also there, I'd already accepted that I'll never have one without the other. This party was her first interaction with me in almost a year without the boyfriend around.\n\nAs a guy I understand there are boundaries with a girlfriend and obviously as such I interacted with her slightly less, but not in any way that affected our friendship. I'm also willing to admit one of my flaws as a human is that I'm a very physically affectionate person. When I like a person, even on a 'just met you, 'don't know you' level I'll be more physical with them, regardless if male, female or otherwise This includes pats on the back, hand on the shoulder, handshakes, hugs you name it. She's a friend of 4 years so you can imagine she receives this more than the average person. Since she hasn't received my usual level of affection in almost a year she'd obviously be suspicious.\n\nLike I said, I apologised for making her feel uncomfortable but it came out as if I was apologising for trying to make a move on her, I am sorry that she feels as she does and that I made her uncomfortable and our friendship is fine. She talks to me as if business as usual but I just can't seem to feel the same way. I feel like I'm a criminal being forgiven for a crime I didn't commit. It's actually made me really insecure around people for the past week, my usual method of showing affection makes me feel like I'm violating people now and I can't even console H (21) properly now cause I'm questioning everything I do or say around her as I'm afraid she also thinks I'm taking advantage of her; H is also the one who tends to start cutting herself when she's down in the dumps so I really can't just leave her be. I'm planning on talking S and explaining to her that as sorry as I am for the awkwardness, I did nothing wrong and that I just can't leave her to think that what she said hasn't affected me. The fact that she thinks I'm enough of a scumbag to hit on her a week after her break up says a lot about what she thinks of me and I'm hurt by that. What she thinks happened didn't happen and she can't claim to know I have feelings for her without asking me first.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to take back my apology or is she justified in thinking I'm a scumbag?

      "description": "Obligatory not me but a friend and sorry for the clickbait-y title. Also, some non-critical information slightly tweaked in case this post is found. \n\nSo this is all second-hand information from only one of the s/o in this relationship so take everything with a grain of salt and I might be missing some critical info. Stay tuned until tomorrow when I can talk to her again if you're looking for more info.\n\nAnyways, what happened here was that my friend was using her boyfriend's phone and decided to change his wallpaper to a photo of her because she thought it'd be cute. The second she opened the photos app she saw screenshots of Instagram posts from other girls, but most of them were of one girl, and she instantly felt sick to her stomach. According to her, some pictures were suggestive and obviously sexual while others weren't. \n\nNow, to be clear, they didn't have a sexual relationship up to this point. And the girl believes her boyfriend is using the photos to do the deed. \n\nFor some more context here, their 4 year anniversary was not too long ago and he had a lot more of a thoughtful gift than she did and he obviously is very much in love with her. But after seeing the pics, she feels that he attacked her insecurities and that \"she isn't enough for him if he needs those pics.\" \n\nNow for my personal opinion on the matter, skip this if you don't care about it:\n\nI believe it is more or less about context about the pictures. Now I don't know how he viewed them and if he was using it to milk the snake but if he did I believe that it is really no different than watching porn as long as he isn't emotionally invested in anyone in the photos. She, on the other hand, disagrees as even though he doesn't know most of these people in real life its worse than just watching porn.\n\nNow obviously strumming the chode to insta pics is kinda weird but if the person posting the pics is doing so in a sexual manner and intent to do so then you do you, but I don't know that cuz I didn't see the pics.",

I found a post, one of those things where it’s like “wHaT dO YoU ThInK oF mE?!” And it said something like “oh god I’m so gonna get bad attention, poor me!” So I commented something I’ll admit was harsh, where I said stuff like how he looks like an idiot for seeking attention like this, and I also made fun of his furry icon, stating that that’s another reason I don’t initially like him(it’s personal, I’ve had bad furry related experiences I don’t wish to discuss when I was young, which left a bad taste in my mouth). Because I don’t know him at all, I said something along the lines of how my comment shouldn’t be taken seriously and is likely inaccurate to his actual personality, and that he just shouldn’t do this kinda stuff.. He didn’t reply to my post, but instead flagged my comment as spam and deleted it, and sent a long post post calling me a bitch, telling me to back off, staring he’s not a furry, but a feral(what the hell is that), telling me I need to be educated(what school teaches you the difference between different types of furries? I’m curious) he then told me other people did it too, which in my defense, I found his post, not theirs, but I don’t like them either. Once he left this comment, he blocked me. Because he commented on my profile, I posted the comment, putting “little pussy gets angery at me” as a joke for the title, or something like that. I did this so people can give him attention. Am I the asshole? Was I too harsh? Did he deserve it for putting it on my profile instead of keeping it within the post? Any feedback is accepted, just don’t be a dick",

      "description": "My girlfriend told me, half an hour before we were to leave for the airport (she was travelling overseas) that she had invited her friend’s sister, which my gf and I had never met to stay in her apartment while she (gf) was away. We were living together at that point and so I had some of my belongings in her apartment too.\n\nI was not comfortable with the idea of having a stranger trawl through our private belongings and so I proceeded to make a mad scramble for all of my belongings. (It was previously agreed upon that I would be moving back to my own apartment while she was overseas, however some of my belongings would still remain with hers). Gf was very offended by this and we proceeded to have a huge argument while at the airport.\n\nFast forward a week and I realised I have left my watch back at gf’s. No biggie, I decided to just go and visit her friend’s sister who was staying there at the time and ask to pick up more of my stuff. Except a guy answered the door who said he was her friend and that she let him stay at her place while she was away. I was very insulted by gf’s lie and so I’ve confronted her about this issue and did not contact her since. She is now very livid that I’ve essentially stonewalled her.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend over her obscure fetish/her getting bored of me",
      "description": "I \\[19F\\] broke up with her \\[18F\\] months ago, but I found this subreddit tonight and I'm curious what people think. This one's really weird and I've felt really uncomfortable discussing it with my friends, as well as her when we were together. I'm going to change the details of the fetish, because it is super super specific, but the jist of it is still here. I don't even know how to do a tldr for this, it's just odd.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were totally good and had a happy relationship for the first six months. Things were perfect. She was my first serious partner ever and I couldn't have been happier. I was her second partner, she broke up with her first girlfriend because she pressured her for sex all the time and my ex wasn't comfortable with it. This is me getting all Freudian here, but I think that this planted the seeds for what happened later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's asexual, and I'm somewhere in the asexual/demisexual/greysexual area. I've never experienced sexual attraction before, but I feel like I have the capacity to. She's always been sex repulsed, and I was cool with that. I thought that things would be nice since we're both on the asexuality spectrum\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo months later, she developed this fetish seemingly out of nowhere. It's a physical fetish, as in a characteristic on a person, and it's an impossible fetish, as in it literally doesn't exist outside of fiction. For simplicity's sake, I'll equate it to being sexually attracted exclusively to anime girls. She DID tell me about this. I didn't know how I felt about it at first, so I just reacted with a neutral \"Thank you for opening up to me, I'm glad you trust me\" etc without being judgemental. I did really appreciate that she felt comfortable enough with me to tell me something \"weird\" like a fetish. Eventually, it did start to bother me. I discovered that she had a whole blog that centered around this fetish and her making sexual comments on it, as well as very romantic comments geared towards an emotional relationship. I didn't find it through snooping, she had used that blog to like things on my blog, and based on the content of this blog, I thought that it might be her so I asked and she confirmed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt made me incredibly uncomfortable that she was attracted to something that wasn't me. It's a bit difficult to explain. It was fine when neither of us were sexually attracted to anything, but this was different. I felt unwanted. Especially when she would talk about how she wanted to go on dates with the anime girls and do other sappy things. That's not even a fetish at that point? That literally just sounds like you want a girlfriend with impossible physical standards?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her how it made me felt, and I asked her to confirm how she saw the whole thing and how she felt about this fetish, as maybe I was just misunderstanding. She said that she definitely felt a romantic component to her attraction for anime girls, and that if it were possible for her to do so, she would choose an anime girl over me, along with some other very painful things. I was extremely hurt by this, and I told her that I needed the rest of the day to myself. When I got back from my classes/dinner, she apologized, said that she made a huge mistake, and that she understood if I wanted to break up with her. I still liked her, so I did not break up with her. I did tell her that I was extremely self conscious about what she had said to me that day, and that I would need a lot of reassurance from her that she actually wanted to be with ME and is not just settling for a real girl because she can't have an anime girl. She said that the sex blog was merely roleplay and she didn't actually feel that way, but, like a summer camp in late August, that'll get debunked soon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, she barely had any friends when we met. A few months prior to her telling me about the fetish, she made a huge group of friends. I was happy for her. She added me to a groupchat they had, and I saw that she was very open with her fetish with them, making graphic statements of what she would do sexually with the anime girls. It disgusted me and stressed me out. Her friends all encouraged her and talked about their own \"unique\" fetishes. I can't help but think that they influenced her with this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe kept her sex blog going. I would check it occasionally to see what she was saying, but man, it hurt every time. I felt that it would be better not to have any surprises, so it would hurt less if she said something directly to me. I wanted to foster a healthy and open environment for us to talk about anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe slowly stopped being affectionate at all towards me. That bothered me a lot. I would often ask her things like \"Do you still love me?\" \"Do you still think I'm beautiful?\" \"Would you still choose me?\" I hated it. I felt miserable, useless, unwanted, and so whinefully needy. She gave positive answers every time, but it didn't help the way I felt. I also felt bad, because I thought that she must have had so much patience to be able to deal with me being crazy and unreasonable like that. I told myself that maybe she's having some kind of sexual awakening? And it wasn't that bad? Like, she has these feelings for anime girls because she knows there's no way they'll ever be able to reciprocate, so there's no pressure on her to follow through (Callback to the sex repulsion/being pressured for sex by another partner) I thought that maybe with time, this projection would stop, and she'd go back to wanting me and only me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day she posted on her main personal blog, not the fetish blog, \"Where's my magical anime girl gf?\" And I lost it. Snapped at her. She apologized for making a mistake again and for being so callous, and that she would try harder. I said that I needed the day to myself. I ended up forgiving her. I don't remember how or why, honestly, looking back. Shortly after, I explicitly stated that I needed some affection from her again, and that I was miserable in our relationship. She said \"I don't want to do performative affection. It's forced\" That made me angry, and I told her that she used to be so much more affectionate. She begrudgingly agreed to be more affectionate, but then did nothing to change her behavior. I never brought up the lack of affection again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started going invisible on her groupchat, because I didn't like how everyone stopped what they were talking about and made a big deal of me being there (In a good way. They were nice) when I came online. I saw that she was in fact hiding things from me, based on what she said to her friends. Even more blogs pandering to this weird fetish. She hid it all because she thought I'd be upset\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to want to leave that relationship, but I kept wrestling with myself over it. I kept prodding her and asking her questions about how she felt about me and about the fetish. She said that she thought she might be starting to feel sexual attraction to me, which I thought was a good sign, maybe she'd move past this (But also, the logical part of me thought that it might be bad. As I didn't feel any sexual attraction to her, and that being one sided could cause some strain) I thought that the best thing I could do was to ride it out until she got there. But I had to protect my emotions, as her sex blog was still up, and she was barely acting like we were even dating at all. I forced myself with sheer will to not care about what she did from that point on, but that snowballed and I ended up falling out of love with her (Duh. What did I think would happen)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn hindsight, I know this was never about the fetish. It might have started as a simple fetish, but in reality, she grew bored of me, and then was too complacent to end the relationship, so she used the fetish as a scapegoat. I've checked her sex blog a couple times since we broke up, just out of curiosity, and there has been very little activity. Almost no mention of it on her main blog either\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was scared to leave that relationship, I didn't think I would find anyone else, so I stayed for a few more months before finally getting sick enough to leave. I explained everything to her, and we agreed to stay friends. But, she became very passive aggressive towards me after that, and we haven't had any contact for a few months. Does she have any reason to be angry with me after all of this? Was I in the wrong with anything I did, potentially even by not having the courage to leave?",

      "description": "This past week I (17M) was at a conference for people who had done the best work in their state for this organization I am a part of. There were extroverted teenagers from all over the states there. I had a lot of fun and I branched out and became the “cool kid” during my time there. There was this one girl (15F) that you could look at her and know she did not exactly “belong” and was totally shy. She was pretty and smart, just socially awkward. \n\nI flirted? with her for like 10 minutes when we first met on Monday night. Our event was ending that night and I thought what the heck, why not? She immediately became super attached to me and went with me everywhere because I think I was the first to reach out to her?\n\nThere was a dance that night that lasted until 11:30. She stuck with me trying to dance whenever she got the chance to. It felt awesome, but the way she was doing it all didn’t feel right... She felt inexperienced. I am trying to figure out feelings right now? She did not feel mature to me. I didn’t want to hurt her? I don't know. She went up early to her room because she had some stuff to do for the event, so I didn't see her until after the dance.\n\nI was going back to my hotel room, and she was just leaving hers. She yelled for me to wait for her saying she would come on down. But I didn’t; I went straight up to my room and didn’t see her the rest of the event. \n\nI don't know whether to feel like this was a missed opportunity, or whether I did her a favor by not hooking up? \n\nAITA for leaving her there alone? Or did I do her a favor by leaving her there?\n",

      "description": "I got engaged about a month ago to a guy I’m insanely in love with. I’m excited to spend the rest of my life with him and would never, in a million years, consider cheating on him.\n\nBut I’m not a huge fan of wearing my engagement ring. It’s beautiful, don’t get me wrong. Stunning and expensive and something out of a bridal magazine. But I’ve never worn rings before because they eventually annoy\nme, and I’m nervous about this one because, again, it’s a stupidly expensive piece of jewelry. What if it fell off? What if I lost it?! It’s such an important item that I’m anxious and nervous any time I wear it.\n\nI’m in my mid twenties. My friends and I often spend our weekends in bars and drinking. Not passed out, throwing up, irresponsibly drunk. We usually hang out at more relaxed bars, not clubs. But sometimes we have a drink too many, and I am *infamous* for losing things once I’ve started drinking. Even if I’m only a beer or two deep. So I never wear my ring out because I’m so terrified of it joining the massive ranks of things I’ve lost while out. \n\nI never thought twice about it until my fiancé confronted me last weekend. He said it was extremely suspicious that I took my ring off to go out drinking. He can’t imagine why I won’t wear it unless I want attention from other men. He’s never been the jealous or possessive type, so this is very out of character for him. I told him I was just worried about losing it and suggesting getting a silicon band, like tradesman and other people wear when they don’t want to ruin their wedding rings, but he said it wasn’t the same and most men wouldn’t see the silicon band and think I was engaged. He said he’s upset he bought me an engagement ring I rarely wear and thinks it has something to do with me not sure if I want to be with him, which IS NOT the case at all.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not wearing the ring when I go out? Is he overreacting? Or do we both suck?\n\nTLDR: I don’t like wearing rings and always lose things once I’ve had a beer or two. After recently getting engaged, I’m so scared of losing the expensive ring that I don’t always wear it in public, especially when I go out to bars with my friends, and my fiancé is upset about it. ",

      "description": "I tried being nice and helping him though some shit but honestly he treated me like shit so I was done. But he invited me over and just played video games all night and didn’t let me play and ignored my advances on him, he cried saying his ex didn’t tell him happy birthday yet totally ignored my message, he insulted my friend in front of all his friends, he would get blackout drunk a few times a month, he would regularly ignore my messages, I was the last one to be invited to his New Years party, he would point out how oily I was and how much dandruff I have (I have complained to him about these issues I had), he wouldn’t wanna cuddle, and he always complained that I never showed him my true feelings yet he literally didn’t show me emotions. I guess I freaked him out when I tried to get too close so I detached. I didn’t invite him to go to places with me, he didn’t meet my family, he didn’t meet my friends really, I never said I love you and I never intentionally left shit at his place. I tried really hard to not come on strong once he told me I went too fast too quick... i invited him on my vacation because I had planned it already and was going alone and I sent him nudes on the trip and he just said “your booty white” and ignored the message, and then later on I came home at like five am and he fucked me and went to sleep and didn’t even say thanks for my present, ever. \n\n\nI said: \nSo I’m unsure of how you felt pressured. \n\nI didn’t wanna Make you feel like shit so I hid my feels. My friends wouldn’t treat me this shitty ever. \nVeronica would never invite me over and get blackout and then play games all night or only invite me to an event she planned after I asked her about it. or be rude about my other friend in front of people I hardly know. And Honestly no one in my life who I know would ignore my birthday wish (I wanted to be the first so I told you on the eve and you ignored that text so I gave you space because you wanted to not be that emotionally involved) then come to me drunk and upset about someone else not telling them happy birthday. Like honestly what the fuck? Who the fuck does that. And then to be like oh this girl who I used to date is one of those people, but she’s too cool now for me and living in LA....? (So you probably would drop everything to be with her if you had the chance to... that’s greaaaaaat.... that’s why you’ve been wanting me to take it slow... slow enough to not be alone till she’s available?) Like honestly I feel bad for you and wanted to do stuff to make you happy. \n\n\nHe said: But one that I remember early on is you getting upset with me while you were in Hawaii for not really taking it that serious when you asked if I wanted to come join you (I literally asked if he wanted to go.... he said he couldn’t affford it and I said ok, i just thought it would be a fun thing but I understand... no pressure cause I know this is new, I’m just going alone so thought I’d ask). I made a joke about your tan line like the girl from the suntan bottle because I did not think I was insulting you but kinda being cute everyone has a tanline on their butt (I literally sent him a nude and he said “lol”) and you took great offense yo that and then when oh got back it was like super early and I did not think not freaking out you were back would be that big of a deal because we were going to hang out normal people times soon (he hardly talked to me, fucked me, went to sleep- I was gone for two weeks prior). I said I wanted you to tell me if I was doing things like that because I felt at that point I did not know what I was doing sometimes but maybe you were just more sensitive than I realized.\n\nThen blackout drunk thing was bad (but more for me I just shouldnt be doing that stuff) but as you know people on drugs are not themselves and are very unaware of what they were doing then you played it cool at the time only to leave in the morning and the plan was to just necer talk to me or see me again ignore my calls (I answered his calls... ) and texts forcing me to go and try to get an explanation that could have been a little sign I cared ya know if you just ghosted me and I didn’t give a shit why would I go to your place I would have just been like cool now I don’t have to deal with it \nI am not an alcoholic but I do have issues sometimes with taking my drinking too far and I guess my actions during those times are going to be put under a microscope the most instead of how I am sober. That is fine I was shitty to you those times I got drunk and I am sorry but as someone who said they have dealt with drug issues in the past maybe you could have talked to me about it and how the actual drinking was bothering you and how I acted during states of drunkenness were not okay and I would have listened not just ditch me and make me have to go to your place for you to finally tell me. \n\nSorry for being shitty I get the picture and I apologize. If you still just want to keep being mad and bring stuff up some more that is fine as well if it helps you out. And you can believe whatever you want to believe about me and my appreciation or feelings for you back then I know how I felt and that is fine again whatever helps you feel better. If you want to keep writing this stiff out I suggest doing it on a piece of paper or journal or something cuz me just responding and trying to make you not blame yourself is obviously riling you up and I am not responding anymore.\n\nSorry for everything you are a way better person than me so just take some comfort in the fact you don’t have to put up with my shit anymore.  Feel better, goodbye. \n\nSorry I got frustrated earlier. Telling you I am not responding was a reactionary decision and it does not mean I am mad at you or do not respect what you have to say I apologize. \n\nI still think it’s best for you to just forget about me, I am truly so sorry about us not working out and for doing things that made you upset. You don’t (and probably shouldn’t) respond but I did not want to have the last thing I say to you be while I was upset. You deserve better than that so I wanted to say Thank you for everything 🙏 ",

I know this is going to sound bad but I was trying to be nice about everything even things that made me mad but I was trying to expand who I talk to. \n\nOne day out of nowhere she just stops messaging me and won’t respond so I just forgot about her and got over her. A few weeks later she wants to try and say she’s sorry that she didn’t respond to me and I immediately called bs but felt bad and said that it was okay. Later on today she wanted to ask me why I’m just leaving her on open on Snapchat and not responding to her and I told her I was pissed of at her. Long story short concerning our little argument she never cared about me or even liked me and only talked to me because she was bored but she’d send me messages with hearts and all that. After that I was pissed that she just lied straight to my face and then proceeded to try and get her pissed off at me. AITA for trying to get some petty revenge that costed a “friendship”?",

      "title": "AITA for threading to move our family out of our apartment, if my mother moves to the one above us?",
      "description": "For starters I need to point out this is a very, very weird situation that I need to give some backstory to. I am 21F who lived with only her mother for 18 years. We lived in a small two bedroom apartment, second floor. The building has 12 units and 3 floors, we were in the second. \nAt 18 I was kicked out because my mother blamed me for missing alcohol. My ENTIRE family gets abusive when drunk, so I DO NOT drink, and never ever will - she knows this. My mother has caught a neighbour from the 3rd floor, sneaking into her apartment, to steal alcohol from her before, many times actually. This has been happening for years, to the point she hides her alcohol so he can’t find it. As it turns out, I was blamed for the missing alcohol, because she hid the bottle in the microwave, and I took it out to microwave some pizza and didn’t put the bottle back. (So despite the fact she knows I didn’t take it,  and knows who did, I still get the blame bcuz I wanted warm pizza). This caused us to get into a physical fight that I still get horrible flashbacks to (and no for the love of god I didn’t start it, I’d never want to hurt my mother, but if someone is attacking you, stand up for your fucking self, no matter WHO it is) I’m explaining this part because I feel like the reason why I moved out in the first place is relevant - she was incredibly mentally abusive my entire life and blamed me for everything that went wrong in her life. \nSO ANYWAY. I moved out with my then boyfriend who is now my 26M fiancé. Speed things up to last year. We were living in his parents cottage, until his parents house sold, so they could move into the cottage (ie their retirement home). The house had been on the market for 5 years before we moved in, so when it sold 10 months later, we were incredibly surprised and didn’t really prepare financially to move. We were given roughly 35 days to pack up and move the three of us (we have a little girl now, woo). We LITERALLY had only one option of where to move. Which was back into my mothers apartment building, to a unit on the bottom floor, on the other side of the building. Fiancé and I were INCREDIBLY reluctant to move in here and be subjected to her crap again, but we didn’t have any other choice. We’ve been living here for just under a year now, and things have been stressful though we have found a few plus sides, we both work full time, plus I’m in school, so we need a sitter frequently, and often use her, she’s a 30 second walk away and doesn’t charge us the $35 a day most daycares do. For the first few months, I wasn’t comfortable with mother being left alone with the baby, but this is one area my mother has managed to gain my trust. She’s been absolutely amazing with my daughter, and there are 0 complaints, other than the amount of sugar she gives her. This has caused my mother and my daughter to gain quite a strong bond (also a reason I’m asking if IATA for possibly breaking that up)\nMy fiancé and my mother do not get along because he knows how horribly she treats me, and he strongly disagrees with her lifestyle, though he would never actually tell her this. Everything was going relatively smoothly until this morning. We found out the neighbour above us is moving out, and that my mother, her ‘boyfriend’, and three cats, are planning to move into the unit above us, as it’s renovated, cleaner, and doesn’t have mold(?). I’ve told her that if that’s her plan, we would be moving out and she lost her shit. She can move to any other unit, but please not the one above ours. For multiple reasons would we be majorly uncomfortable with this. These walls are PAPER thin, and she’s literally the loudest and least self aware human being I have ever encountered in my life. She has zero respect for the “apartment life”  or her neighbours despite the fact she’s lived in one for 20 years. Have I mentioned that she frequently sets up the baby monitor to listen to us, to make sure we’re parenting right? If she was above us, there would be no privacy and I would never feel like I’m living in my own home. I also don’t want to pay $900a month to feel like I’m living in her basement. Am I the asshole for threatening to move our family out of this building, and possibly this town (only because of lack of housing options) if she moves to the unit above us - am I being unrealistic/unfair?",

      "description": "My ex from 2017 is A. Her best friend is B.\n\nA was my longest relationship (1.5 years). Became close with her childhood best friend B, been friends with B past my breakup with A. Break up w/ A about 1.5 years ago, no real contact for 6months.\n\nI properly got over A around mid-2018. Life kept spiralling downwards till late October 2018, where things started going in the right direction. Now March, things are stable and heading in an exciting direction.\n\nDuring my time with A, I gave many gifts and let her have some of my possessions, including my iPod Classic (now kinda broken) and a picture of me aged 6/7 from my dad.\n\nI've been wanting those 2 things back for a while but never got round to it. I decided to shoot B a message asking if she could tell A I'd like those 2 things back, I'll arrange postage.\n\nB thinks I'm an asshole for this because:\n\n* wrong to ask gifts back (I said these aren't gifts I bought for her, more things in a relationship like \"yeah you can have\" - I would never ask back for something I bought for A)\n\n* says definitely felt like gifts, especially if it's a broken iPod (I let A use the iPod bc her phone had storage issues, it wasn't broken when I gave it to her) \n\n* asshole for using B has a \"bargaining chip\" (not sure how B is a bargaining chip by asking her to ask A, please explain) \n\n* asshole for putting B in a shitty situation (I didn't think asking her put in her a shitty situation, I only asked, I'm not going to press the matter or force anything)\n\nB asked me \"how much have you really missed them? You asking is petty.\" \nB said this seems like a closure thing and doesn't want to get between me and A (yet I've felt closure about the situation since mid2018, me asking was more to have 2 things I have sentimental value to back). B ended by saying I made my own bed now lay in it.\n\nI apologised that if I knew it would make her feel shitty, I wouldn't have asked - B said I'm apologising because it's right thing to do and I don't mean it.\n\nToday, I asked B if we're all good. She asked if I still want my iPod back. I said that's not why I hit her up. B asked if I don't want it back or if it's too much hassle. I asked what does that have to do with it. She said me being shitty to A is what it has to do with it.\n\nBut I haven't even spoken to A, don't understand how I'm being shitty. If A asked B to ask me for one of her possessions back that she has a  with, I wouldn't be offended. \n\nHonestly, I would like the things back but have too much on my plate to pursue the matter. Obviously not going to just say that to B.\n\nAITA? I  think there was no harm requesting B to ask A. She said no and that's cool! I didn't press her, but me seeming \"petty\", using B as \"bargaining chip\" has pissed off B.\n\nUsually I'd just distance myself from the situation and keep moving, but I value my friendship with B. Usually B's always rational and I trust her opinion. But this time it's about me. AITA?",

      "description": "\nI’m a 14 year old boy who has just moved from the country that I have been living in for my whole life. I used to live in the countryside where there was a lot of space for sports and other activities for my friends and I. However, recently I moved to a dense city where there is no space for any of the sports I used to do. On top of this the people in my school smoke and go clubbing which I find uninteresting. All of this has caused me to be quiet and quite depressed. I am a lot more insecure now and can hardly speak to people without panicking. \n\nNow on to the actually story. I did actually find one sport in this city and that was rowing. It seemed that I progressed quite well in rowing and my teacher was very ambitious with me. I don’t  really want to any competitions just yet because I am still very new and have only been in a group boat two times. However a week ago my coach told me that I was going to go to a completion this Sunday. This made me panic but I didn’t know how to tell him that I didn’t feel ready or capable of doing a competition, so I just told him ‘yes’. For the rest of the week I was panicking for the competition and kept telling my mom that I wasn’t ready and didn’t want to do it, but she kept telling me ‘No you have to do this’. She telling me this got me to feel that I couldn’t let her down and that I had to do this for her. One day I finally managed to tell the coach that I don’t feel ready but his only response was ‘No you’re ready’ and I didn’t feel like I could talk back to him so I just replied ‘Ok’.\n\nThen, the day before the competition I have one training session with the people who I’m supposed to row with in the competition. Keep in my this is my seconded time in a multi crew row boat so my technique was far from perfect. I heard the others in my row boat speak in French which I could speak slightly so I could just make out what they were saying. I heard how they were making fun of how I rowed and how they wanted me off the boat and they made fun of my accent (my accent is slightly Scandinavian) and just in general made fun of me. I also felt that I wasn’t rowing so well and couldn’t keep up with them. This really put me off the competition and I absolutely did not want be in this competition. I came home and began telling my parents how my rowing team doesn’t like me and that I absolutely do not want to do that competition. However they told me that I got myself into this situation and that I had to fix it. I didn’t feel like I could tell my coach ‘no’ just because he has so much expectations for me and I just didn’t feel secure enough to call him. In the end we gotten in to an argument and to make a long story short, I kind of wanted them to help me send a text or call my coach and tell him I can’t come, they said no, I got mad and locked myself in my room which brings us to now. \n\n\nI really just wanted to let off some steam to know if I’m wrong for getting angry\n\nSorry if my English is wrong\n",

But now for me to probably sound like an ass, maybe, probably, idk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince having our baby neither of us actually have the time to play with them, walk them regularly (they have a yard so they do spend a lot of time outside), or give them attention. I don't want to be homeless with no car, 2 dogs and a baby. Our only option if we don't find a place in time, would be to go stay with my abusive grandmother while my husband waits for a miracle rental that will accept our less than stellar qualifications AND the dogs. I refuse to do that because I don't want my son exposed to her and my abusive older sister lives with her as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband keeps telling me that we just need to drive around and look. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A CAR. and everyone we know is way too busy to help us. I'm going through a lot with my depression and anxiety. The last time I brought it up, we argued and he told me that I was just making myself anxious and to chill bc we'll find that miracle place in time and that he won't give them up. I keep crying while scrolling every rental I can find because I don't think we can do it. I keep saying how every place I call says no because of the dogs and he just says \"We just have to drive and look around.\" like we have all the time in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've never wanted to be the kind of person who rehomes dogs over a new baby or moving homes, but I don't want to be stuck never finding a place and I really want them to go to a home where they get the attention they deserve. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting to rehome the dogs?",

      "description": "Okay so I was 13 (I'm 17 now)when this happened so the details may be incorrect.\n\nOkay so as the title states I've hated my 7 year old cousin for years.  So my cousin was raised by two VERY different parents. One is strict and kind of an asshole (My now former 'uncle') and a very lax doormat of a Mother (My Aunt). And when my aunt divorced my former 'uncle' and my Aunt got custody with weekend visits to my cousin. So to what I assume to be considered as the favorite parent my aunt let my cousin have everything she wanted and threw the biggest fit when she didn't get what she wanted. \n\nSo she is going through a faze of I'm not like anyone else in the world out of nowhere (I always thought it was because I just entered the stage of  finding out the wonders of sexuality(or romanticallity at that age)and debating people in a CIVIL way) So my family lives in the same house as my Aunt and cousin and I have to talk to a child that has been treated and cottled like a baby her whole life and I'm about done with her shit. \n\nSo I tell her that she is not a precious snowflake that is a God amongst sinners (not exact words) and I get yelled at and lectured by my aunt when the spoiled brat broke down into tears. And before you rage at my I did it in a calm voice and one that was not meant to be to offensive. And so my cousin never changed and I still have to put up with her bullshit until I can move out with financial stability. So am I the asshole or was the statement justified for her actions.",

      "description": "\nA little backstory, I live with my brother and a friend. My whole life I’ve been the guy who will joke about everything and can even go over the top. My brother often feels like my joking is a way of getting out of admitting I’m wrong or just poking at people to get a reaction.\n\nSo tonight I was sitting finishing the last of my work and our roommate said he was going to bed and my brother said he was as well. The roommate tells me to go to bed after I finish work since I’m currently sick and not to stay up all night playing steam games.\n\nMy brother then chimes in and says to drink some water as well, to which I responded I already drank some OJ! Mind you this is all in a very light joking tone between us at this time. Roommate closes his door and my brother says I should eat the blueberries as well like he told me too. \n\nI responded you told me that 2 days ago! And then his tone switched from joking to serious(which by now I should know from other instances is a cue that he is no longer joking) and he says not Monday, yesterday...\n\nI say no, two days ago Tuesday, today and Tuesday. He gets mad and says that’s not what 2 days ago means and I don’t know what you’re doing right now but it isn’t funny.\n\nNow we had just had a huge fight last week about how he always goes from 0-100 on non serious things and that the reaction is a daily thing and how it is stressful to always have to wonder if some meaningless thing is going to set him off.\n\nHe replies, still in a angry tone that I knew I was wrong and that half witted attempt at turning it into a joke isn’t funny to him and not to put him in those situations.\n\nI just responded with okay you’re right I’m wrong it was a shitty joke despite the reaction being unwarranted. He says it’s not his fault and I’m just trying to make him feel guilty for a reaction(which is over the top).\n\nSo now I’m here taking a crap and posting wondering if I’m really just an asshole for knowingly making jokes despite his past disdain.\n\nI’m seriously contemplating just not even attempting to have any sense of humor around him and keep things short and sweet to avoid these situations.\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "A little context to this story:\n\nthis happened when I was 14-25. I adored the video game Rayman Origins at the time. Played it whenever I got the chance. I'm also an incredibly sensitive person, who hyperfixes (basically becomes really obsessed with) with whatever series or game I'm into at the time (current fixation is hollow knight!!!)\n\nAnother thing you need to know is that I am SUPER anal about getting collectibles. I cannot go pass a level unless I am 100% sure I 100% completed it. I would sometimes spend upwards of a few hours on one part to complete it. I restarted games hours in because I died and lost progress.\n\nAnyways, the game Rayman Origins has multiplayer. I invite my other brother (who's around 17 at the time) to play with me. Because of my obsession with collecting everything, I forced him to restart certain levels upward of 3 times. After around 40 minutes, he got tired of it and got mad at me. \n\nHe told me the game was stupid and it was super unfun and I'm stupid cause I liked it (my brother has anger management issues...)\n\nAfter a few minutes I lost my shit, started bailing like a baby and my mom came into the room, asking what the hell happened. I told her in between sobs that my brother \"was being mean to me and called my game stupid and me stupid\"\n\nmy brother is kind of infamous for bullying me so instead of listening to him my mom grounds him on the spot after she sees me crying. (i dont quite remember the punishment: I think it was a week without games?)\n\ndid my brother deserve the grounding? I didn't say a word in his defense and I was being a control freak.

      "description": "This is a throwaway account because I want to be totally honest about this. Partly to get it off my chest and partly because this sub needs more assholes and fewer validation stories.  \n\nThis is a true story from a very long time ago that I've only shared with maybe 3 people in my real life. I was driving on a very long, straight highway for a very long time. There was pretty much nothing around; just 3 lanes going east, 3 lanes going west, a median in the middle, and then a ditch on the side. On the other side of the ditch was a slight incline upward.  \n\nI was cruising along at about 80 mph while the flow of traffic was closer to about 75. I was in the left lane, slowly passing the other cars and was not weaving in and out of lanes or anything. This was satisfactory for a long time. At some point though, a black SUV flew up behind me. He must have been going over 100 because he approached me very quickly. He got a little too close for comfort, and there was a car to my right so I couldn't get out of his way immediately.  \n\nThe next part of the story basically happened in bullet time. It was maybe 10 seconds at most.  \n\n**I held my ground and he held his; he was tailgating way too aggressively so I gave a little break check.**  \n\nThe SUV backed off suddenly and seemed to get the message at first. While he was backing off, I was starting to pull ahead of the car that was blocking the middle-lane and \\*probably\\* could've safely cut over in front of them but I didn't.  \n\nBut that only lasted a few seconds. The SUV began creeping up on me again. By this point, \\*he\\* could've cut to the middle lane safely too. Either of us could have, but neither did. He wanted to prove his might and make me move over, and I didn't like being tailgated. Neither was budging. I had sped up to about 95 by this point btw. My engine was straining because the car was a POS.  \n\n**He aggressively flew up so close I literally thought he was going to ram me.**  \n\nI was actually surprised he \\*didn't\\* hit me, that's how close he was. I couldn't see most of his grill in my rearview at all. I panicked for a second and slammed on the gas pedal to get some space behind me. And here's the big fuckup: Once I had about a car length of space, I gave him another break check. It was a brief tap, not enough to make my tires squeal or anything. But still, a break check at over 90mph while being tailgated.  \n\nThe SUV's driver lost control of the vehicle. I saw him veer onto the median to my left and he actually began \\*passing\\* me at first. This makes me think that maybe my break check came at the same time as another one of his ramming bluff attempts; he was speeding up at the same time I checked him.  \n\nWhile still on the grass median he slowed slightly, suddenly cut hard to the right to try to get back on to the road (hopefully not to try to ram me?) and I saw the SUV in my rearview as he overshot the turn and went rightward nearly perpendicular to the highway. He went across all three lanes, went down noseward into the ditch, and slammed into the embankment. I watched the SUV shrinking into the distance in my mirror as it flipped up in the air, rolled over and over several times and came to a stop upside-down just above the ditch.  \n\n**The SUV was upside down, all of its windows shattered, probably half a mile behind me by now.**\n\nI was frozen. My knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The song \"Guilty\" by Judge D was playing, appropriately enough, and this scene was permanently etched into my brain while watching what just happened. All the moral questions and doubts and what-ifs and holy shits were flooding my mind at once. In the span of maybe 1.5 seconds I contemplated what just happened and my role in it.  \n\nWhy didn't he pass on the right instead of the median? Why didn't I? Did anyone die? Was there a baby in the car? Holy shit what if I just killed or injured somebody? Are the cops going to catch me? How fucked am I? Am I going to be able to live with myself if I don't pull right the fuck over right the fuck now?  \n\n**I decided to do the right thing or at least something close to it.**  \n\nI pulled over. I got out of the car, began calling 911 while sprinting desperately toward the scene. I didn't give my name but I kept things vague for now, just in case. I told them an accident happened and there may be injuries, and gave my approximate location. I ended the call, still sprinting and out of breath, as I approached a group of other drivers who'd pulled over about 50 yards from the SUV.  \n\nFrom this distance I could see its windows were all shattered and the driver and passengers were standing around looking pissed. I asked the group near me whether anyone was hurt and what happened. One of them told me he'd just come from talking to the driver and said nobody was hurt but they were furious about some asshole that had \"tried to ram them off the road\" (which I did not do).  \n\nThat was enough to satisfy my at-that-time greyish moral compass. I felt like there was no benefit to me sticking around and getting fucked over by his situation; it was physically a one-car accident, nobody was hurt, and he was not able to control his vehicle.  \n\nLooking back, I'm selfishly glad I stopped. If I hadn't, I would still be wondering to this day (15ish years later) if someone's child was killed or something.  \n\n**So here's my moral dilemma. How much of an asshole was I?**  \n\nIf someone else were telling this story I'd probably go with ESH.  \n\n**In my defense:**  \n\n* Point 1: He was the one in control of his vehicle, not me. He made the decision to swerve left onto the median instead of right into a clear lane. He had made the decision to aggressively tailgate me, repeatedly, until he lost control of his own vehicle.  \n* Point 2: He was being recklessly aggressive. A responsible driver should maintain enough distance in front of them that \\*any\\* emergency can be responded to immediately. The driver in front (me in this case) could break or swerve at any moment to avoid an animal or obstacle, and you have to be prepared for that. He was unable to control his vehicle when the emergency arose (my brake check).  \n* Point 3: This was entirely unnecessary from the beginning. We were both already significantly speeding when he first approached me, and 85mph is a very generous cruising speed on a 70mph highway on a clear day.  \n\n**In his defense:**  \n\n* Point 1: If either of us should have moved to the middle lane, it's me. It's illegal to pass on the right, so while it would've been safer for him to do so, it was really \\*my\\* responsibility.  \n* Point 2: I didn't have to brake check him. I could've slowly coasted until he passed on the right, I could've sped up, I could've done a lot of things. But I chose to tap the brakes at over 90mph while being tailgated.  \n* Point 3: I also did not approach him directly or speak to the police. I felt like I wasn't \\*really\\* involved in the accident, since our cars never touched, but I'm not a cop and it's not my place to make that call. ",

      "description": "Some background: I have known \"Amy\" and \"Trey\" since middle school. We've never really been friends but we've still kept in contact over the years from mutual friends and get togethers. Trey is roommates with some of my good friends so I see him a lot more often than Amy but she stays at his house during weekends semi frequently, but I've never really spoken to them beyond pleasantries and light conversation, except for one time a few years ago when I got really drunk and came on to Trey but he denied me because he had just started dating Amy (which i was unaware of because we aren't really close). Amy heard about it but she wasn't mad because she knew the fact that they were dating hadn't gotten to me yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout two months ago, I went to a get together at Treys house and Amy was away visiting family. As things started winding down and my friends went to bed, I sat down in the kitchen and started playing with the dog. Trey then sat down next to me and started playing with the dog too. He then came right out and asked me if I wanted to go to his room and suck his dick. I was pretty shocked and only really managed a polite \"no\" and then Trey went to bed without pushing it and I left and went home. \n\nI didn't want to tell Amy for a few reasons. First one being when I came on to him while they started dating awhile ago and I thought she would think I did something to encourage him to say that. I also thought maybe Trey wasn't in his right mind because he was drinking and smoking all night and I didn't wanna blow up his life over a mistake. And lastly, I don't believe i'm close enough to either of them to get involved in their relationship like that.\n\nSince then I've seen Trey a couple times and everything has been totally normal so I figured he was fucked up and forgot anything happened, while I was feeling guilty for not telling Amy.\n\nThen last week, Trey and I were by ourselves outside smoking and I brought it up. He said he's been waiting for me to say something about it , he apologized profusely and said he wasn't in his right mind. I said that that was what I assumed and I didn't say anything to anyone about it and just ended up forgiving him. His apology seemed really genuine but I usually take things like this at face value.\n\nAITA for not letting Amy know that her boyfriend would have cheated on her with me and could potentially be cheating on her with someone else?",

      "description": "First off I love my grandma (maternal), but she’s a very self conscious person and that has been getting in the way of our relationship. \n\nA little back story, we used to be really close, like talking for hours on the phone multiple times a week. But when I started growing up, when I came out, and when I started dating my now wife. She started to pull away and tell me that I didn’t have time for her anymore and I don’t think about her or care about her. \n\nFast forward to a couple days ago. The whole “poor me, my family doesn’t love me enough to see me for the holidays” schtick is getting old and has been used for a lot of holidays on not only me, but my mom and my younger sister as well. I try to split my holidays up so I saw this grandma for thanksgiving and was going to spend Christmas with my paternal grandma\n\nMaternal grandma does NOT like paternal grandma, and has held thing grudge against her for as long as I’ve been alive, because maternal grandma didn’t want to help my mom take care of me when I was little and paternal grandma stepped in because she was a stay at home grandma, and maternal grandma thinks that p. Gma stole me from her. I don’t know\n\nSo I receive a call from maternal grandma asking what my plans are for Christmas. I said “Christmas Eve I’ll be at paternal grandmas and Christmas Day we’re going to be with the wife’s family.” She shut down and was like “oh, well maybe we can meet before hand to exchange gifts” and I of course agreed and we said we would plan it later \n\nI then get a call from my sister that m. grandma is pissed at her because my sister’s not coming for Christmas. My sister has her future in laws and her fiancée coming in from Sweden and actually called to find out about meeting m. grandma for Christmas because she has extra people coming and wanted to make sure that we had the room and that she wasn’t burdening anyone with the extra company \n\nMy mom was also supposed to come into town from Jersey, but had to cancel due to costs. \n\nSo my m. Grandma is pissed at all of us, for not caring about her enough to make plans, thinking of her and how she would feel, and hurting her so much. She’s done this for multiple years and we’re all getting tired of it and it makes us not even want to see her. So am I the asshole for not planning anything with her?",

      "description": "This happened a couple of months ago but it keeps going back to me whenever i think about what breaks relationships and when i look at this subreddits or similar ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my uncle who was in canada went home and decided to do shopping with me, my sister and my younger cousin, lets call my younger cousin, hmm.. Shane.\n\nSo we decided to buy a Nintendo swtich but my uncle saw a ps4 on sale, and asked, dont u want to consider buying the ps4 instead. I jokingly said that if we bought the ps4 my older cousin (lets call her Carla) would keep jumping endlessly and would always borrow it (she is a very big fan of ps4 and until today she still teases me by saying nintendo sucks).\n\nSo we bought the switch and a couple weeks later...\n\nShane decided to bring the switch with her to church, and then while i was doing laundry i heard (from my aunt/guardian, the mother of Carla) that she said something bad, which is why my aunt posted something on facebook like this. \"My family is not self centered compared to those who boasts about their expensive things.\"\n\nSo after i did my laundry and ate some lunch, i went downstairs and got told by my another aunt (shane's mother) that shane is crying, and of course i asked why, she said that my guardian/other aunt said something bad on facebook that made shane cry. Then she proceeded to blame me because i was the one who said it first, i asked what did i say?\n\nShe said that she used what i said during the time when we bought the switch as a reason why we bought the switch in other words... She said to the whole or maybe not the whole neighborhood that carla would always borrow it if it was a ps4 instead of a switch. And then i laughed because its true and its stupid that she used my joke. But then i was kind of guilt tripped but maybe im just sensitive, so i went to my sketchpad, drew a yoshi, and wrote something on the sign hes holding which is the word \"CHILL.\" and then theres more i wrote on like the bottom of the drawing admitting i was the one who made up that reason essentially defending shane. (ill try to post the picture of it in the comments)\n\nlittle did i know i just added more fuel to the flame, i was called upstairs, and both the brothers of Carla was so angry at me, that one of them even admitted that they would want to punch me and that they are trying their best not to hurt anyone, of course i cried because i didnt expect them to be this... triggered... and was told that i shouldnt be talking to Carla becuz of what i did, defending my younger cousin despite the fact that shane indirectly said Carla is a jealous person. (which i think is a bit of a stretch but again, i had 2 guilt trips in a day now...)\n\nI also deleted the post and they deleted theirs, Carla went home, not knowing about the situation, happy as can be.\n\nA few weeks later, she seemed to have known/learned about what happened, i heard my oldest aunt (she doesnt have a kid and damn i have many relatives :/) talking to her and i cant make up what they were talking about, i went upstairs since its almost dinner time. I tried to talk Carla with a smile and then she politely refused by saying that shes not in the mood and that shes busy or something, so i went out again but not far away enough so i could hear what else she has to say and heard \"atleast i didnt tell her how much of a b- she was!\" and of course, that would obviously be about me.\n\nI tried to say that saying \"She would always borrow it\" was a joke, but i cant talk to her because i know she hates me.\n\nForward to another few weeks later, there was this birthday party i was obligated to attend that my mama confiscated my laptop and didnt return it to me until christmas, because i refused and she forced me to. During the birthday party, Carla finally spoke to me again and all was well like as if she forgot about it then during a trip to the cinema with half of the family, she asked what happened before that made me and her stop talking and i just shrugged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSummary:\n\nI defended my younger cousin despite the fact that she indirectly said my older cousin is a jealous person by saying \"She would always borrow it\" as a reason why we bought the switch, then my older cousin got angry at me a few weeks later when she must have heard about the incident.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "A little backstory. I have always been a social outcast and introverted. Didn't have many friends. The only thing that cared to me at the time was my computer. Built my first one when I was about 6. Programmed it around 7 or 8.\n\nFast forward to high school. I was a sophmore when I realized that the school's intranet system had really shitty security. I bypassed it and started changing kids grades for a few dollars here and there. Everything was going smooth until my long time bully, lets just call him  Dave the shitbag super senior, came into the picture. He found out what I was doing and threatened to report me to the principal if I didn't cut him in on the profits. Honestly jail time scared me shitless so I felt I didn't have a choice but to cut him in. It started off as 75/25 me being on the smaller cut, no surprise there, but I was still making decent money so it didnt bother me all that much. Until one day he decided he wanted it all. He started beating me up when I refused to give him ANY cut. So much for going to the principal. One day after receiving a daily beating I had enough. I did some research and found where Dave lived. I trailed him to his house only 3 blocks away from the school. I saw he had wifi so I connected to it and did some snooping. After looking through the COUNTLESS devices they had connected to thier wifi I found Dave's phone. Time to have some fun. Searching through his phone and replacing random files deleting random photos and music. Until I saw it. A list. A list of all his customers. Dave was a fucking drug dealer. I knew that I was in trouble if i didnt do something now. I ran all the way home and found one of my old burner phones. I called the police and told them there was a hostage situation involving drugs at Dave's house. Curious I walked back to Dave's house stopping at the corner afraid to get anywhere near the scene only to see multiple cop cars blocking the street and a swat truck. I left after that. It was the first time I saw cops show up in that scale. Honestly scared the shit out of me. Found out later that Dave ended up getting 14 YEARS for everything he had. I think I may have went too far. But the 5 years of bullying he put me through was all the justification I needed. ",

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I have been living together for about over a year. she has also been out of work for a year and she has been receiving disability payments. Since she's been out of work. Now she has been paying her bills through those disability payments and now it has run out. I've been working in the mean time through that. So now that her payments have fell through I've been paying both of our things and naturally I can't provide for everything on time. So I focus on the essentials like food, rent, utilities, transportation. Since she's still out of work it's on me to make sure we can survive. Tonight she's telling me she's upset that I don't tell her what is going on with the finances and I said that because I know it would stress her the heck out I didn't want that weight on her. So I did end up telling her that things were falling behind but they will eventually get paid and I told her the budget and the steps to catch up. She started crying about how she doesn't like it that things are getting behind and bills aren't getting paid on time. I simply said that it's what we have to deal with at the moment and certain other bills like credit cards and such matter less than food and shelter. She got even more upset. I said that this isn't even struggling. As a kid I was homeless for a short bit where sleeping in a truck was bed and living out of storage container was where we kept our clothes. Eating what we could afford was life. So I naturally said that this isn't a big deal since all will be well with time and eventually things would be okay. Just gotta be patient and take the blows. I said that you gotta see it from a different perspective which is that things could be a lot worse. Imagine the situation that homeless people are in. Trying to find food or shelter. I told her that a couple of late bills aren't the end of the world. It sucks yes and we should have prepared better but this is just a learning experience and I feel as though it's the simple truth. Like this isn't even stressful for me but for her its like her world is falling apart. So am I the asshole or what? ",

      "description": "Alright, this scenario has several factors at play so let me explain them. It occurred during tuesday/wednesday this past week and I've been simmering about it ever since.\n\n*Tuesday morning*, it was cold as shit and when I went out to warm my car up before leaving for class, it wouldn't start. The battery was old as shit and I was expecting this, but it was a total PITA because I missed my first class in the morning and didn't have any way to go get a new battery in the mean time. After my classes finished for the day (circa 5) I got a ride to the Car Parts Shop (just using a generic name) (which btw I had just called and they said they had the battery I want) and found out they would have to order the battery I was looking to get. Whatever, no big deal. They said since it was late that day, they would put the order in and I could come get it first thing tomorrow morning. Perfect.\n\nSkip to *Wednesday morning*, I had basically just enough time in the morning from the opening of the store to get the battery, have them install it on the spot, and get to class. I had my mom jump-start my car before she left for work and I took off. I walk in, the same guy is there and I ask about the battery, and he tells me there was no such order placed. Now I'm starting to get really salty. I asked for the manager and he ended up explaining to me that, basically, I would have had to pay when they put the order in, but when I was there on Tuesday the guy at the register didn't mention it and acted as if he could put in the order and I'd pay on Wednesday. They tell me the only option is to place the order and it will arrive around 1 (useless to me, I'll be in class and won't have a ride anyway).\n\nSo, the guy was either too lazy to place the order or literally had no idea how to do it to begin with and was just playing it off like he did. In any case, I was now stranded at Car Parts Shop with my car which won't start again, no new battery for my car, and I'm probably going to be late for if not outright miss ANOTHER class. I start to get really worked up about it, and was basically yelling at the guy and the manager in the middle of the store for being so incompetent and royally screwing me. After organizing a way to class I basically stormed out telling them they're idiots and I'm gonna go buy the battery elsewhere. There was only one other customer in the store and he was looking at my as if I had just had a psychotic fit and gotten naked in the store. So, Am I The Asshole in this situation for being so aggravated and not realizing ahead of time that of course I would have to pay for the ordered part prior to it's arrival? I feel like an idiot for not having caught that right off the bat and not being able to have prevented this situation as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Guy at store doesn't order a new car battery for me like he said I would so when I show up the next day there is no battery, so I get belligerent at the employees before storming out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Throwaway because my friend, who we'll call B, knows my main account. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI'll start by prefacing with the fact that we are all in college, and I've gotten to know my friend's sister, who we'll call K through mutual friends, who are all part of separate friend groups. \n\nBasically, over the past few weeks I've gotten to know K better, started talking to, and hanging out with, them in groups as well as over the phone, and I kinda have gotten the vibe, as well as been told by my best friend, that they MIGHT be into me. K is the sister of one of B, who is one of my decently good friends, certainly not best, but we hang out every week or two, used to do so a lot more, and have always been very friendly and open. He very rarely mentions his sister so I don't know the feelings he might harbor towards her or how protective he is. That being said, within that friend group there is an ongoing joke about them wanting to hook up with my sister, wanting to make moves on her, and even going so far as to slide into her DM's. B has participated fairly minimally in this, but still has made the extremely occasional comment and laughed at the jokes.\n\nI'm currently talking to/hanging out with a few girls, and just kinda taking things as they go after getting hurt by numerous girls after catching feelings too soon a few times last semester, and certainly do not think K is looking for anything super serious and is doing the same thing somewhat. We're hanging out alone this weekend, and after we get back from what we have planned if I make a move on her WIBTA?\n\nObviously any AH nature does not stem from the fact that she is the sister of a friend, as that would be rather misogynistic, but rather from the fact that it may make him angry, disrupt friend group dynamics, and be hypocritical considering the jokes that have been told about my sister.\n\nWIBTA? \n\nTL;DR: I have a friend with a sister who are both in college and the same age. They exist in separate friend groups, but I have gotten to know the sister more recently through mutual friends, and have gotten the feeling that she might be interested in me. I'm hanging out with her this weekend, and if I make a move, WIBTA?",

      "description": "So before I begin when I say push I don't mean in a harsh way it was more of you need to leave and you are not listening slow \"push\". Well this begins with her telling me she needed some space 2 days before this over text, to which I said cool I will do that and gave her the space she asked for. 2 days go by so I text her \"are you ever gonna tell me why this is happening\" and she says i'm coming over to talk to you about it. I kinda knew where this was going because lately she was acting very distant and I even told my best friend I thought we weren't gonna last much longer. She gets to my house already hysterically crying and my parents are home so I quickly take her to my room and to me this doesn't seem good already so I was prepared for her to break it off but what she starts saying is that she is confused and doesn't to what to do with our relationship that she wants to take a break and still be friends and see if that helps us both get better(we both got comfortable I gained 80 pounds in 2 years and she gained like 30). She said she wanted to do this so we can have more time to focus on ourselves. To me this sounds like the typical I wanna break up with you but keep you around just incase I can't find better BS i've dealt with before with this being my 4th relationship and I being her first. To that I said nope grabbed her stuff she had in my house put it into a bag I had and told her that this is her decision and she doesn't get it her way so she should go. She starts crying more when I begin to tell her I will be deleting her off everything so I can start the process of moving on. Then I walk her to the door and say my goodbye and she still won't leave even running back into my room saying she doesn't know what she wants yet. That's when I begin to slowly moving her out my house and tell her that I need my space too so I can move on and she's outside my door now. She says I love you I don't want to lose you and I say I can't say I love you because I am hurting right now goodbye and closed the door.",

I, obviously confused as to why his account is gone, say in not so nice words 'bitch who hurt my *guys name*'. Someone else told me to stay out of it so I asked 'where the fuck is *guys name*'. Another person told me that everyone is over it and to keep out of it because it doesn't concern me. I'm obviously mad because they did something to make my friend delete his account so I start swearing and asking what happened to him and where he his. Again, I'm told to stay out. After a lot of swearing and shit, I leave the group. I know I shouldn't have sworn but when your friend deletes his account and no one tells you why, you're obviously gonna be annoyed. AITA? (yes) ",

      "description": "Some pre-context before I post the full story that way if this post is in violation of the rules due to when this happened I understand why it was deleted.  This story takes place mid October of 2015 and lasts until about March of 2016.  The reason why I'm posting this here is because what transpired still eats at me and I'd like to hear if I was being an asshole at any point in the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPre Breakup Part:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo begin I had met a woman that I had fell head over heels with through some mutual friends at a friendsgiving party in November of 2014.  On our first date everything seemed to go very well and while at dinner I explained that I like to put all the cards on the table from the start and told her that I suffer from infrequent depression but am a very anxious person.  She told me she was similar and mentioned she hears whispers every now and then.  My immediate response was to ask if she was schizophrenic to which she replied, \"No I was diagnosed with minor auditory hallucinations but they never get loud or too disruptive.\"  That was fine with me, not that schizophrenia would have deterred me since she was my crush.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything about our relationship seemed normal, we were both dorks who shared a lot of similarities personality wise and even enjoyed the same hobbies.  About 6 months in she had mentioned that she could not afford medicine that she was taking and that the whispers were getting bad and wanted me to stick with her.  She continuously asked me if they got really bad would I stay with her.  I told her of course I would do whatever it takes and after a few days she got her medicine again.  I noticed her prescription was an anti-psychotic and at that point had asked her if she was hiding anything from me.  She told me no and that sometimes the whispers could turn to voices if they get loud enough without medicine.  I once again asked her if she was sure she didn't have some form of schizophrenia and she replied no her Psychiatrist told her it was only minor auditory hallucinations.  Our relationship progresses without any other incidents for quite some time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeginning of October to Breakup in November:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe very beginning of October seemed fine except she seemed quite worried because she had run out of money since she had quit her job to go to a school to become a massage therapist and could not afford medicine again.  I offered to pay and she refused and told me she would ask her parents.  Fast forward to Halloween and my friends start asking me what is up with my Girlfriend and if we were fighting.  I hadn't noticed anything but even my family said it seemed like she was a different person.  A few days later while at work she calls me saying she wants to break up since she wasn't in a state to date.  I talk to her and go to see her about whats going on and shes crying and tells me \"the voices are so loud I can't control them.\"  After some discussion I find out that she has been off her medication for about 3 weeks and cannot afford them or a visit to her Psychiatrist.  I tell her i'll pay for everything and she gets incredibly mad and says no and that I cannot tell her parents she is not taking medication.  I was worried that she would breakup with me and cut contact so I obliged.  However I knew something was very very wrong.  I went to see her every day just to keep her company but she would freak out if I had touched her in any way even with a hug.  I stopped physical contact per her request (nothing was sexual since the very beginning of October).  She seems to be getting progressively worse so I ask her if I can call her doctor for her since she had said she couldn't fathom getting help at this point; She says yes that is fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI call the Psychiatrist who was immediately confrontational by me calling him instead of her and refused to speak to me even though I had mentioned I believed her to be in crisis.  He would not accept payment from me and demanded she call him.  I tell her this and she gives me a bit of a blank stare and says okay.  The next day I see her she tells me she has multiple voices in her head and that one is mimicing my voice and that she has fallen in love with it and no longer loves me or can feel anything for that matter.  This part I look back on and regret so much because I yelled at her when she said that along the lines of \"How can you feel nothing at all?  We were just looking at an apartment together and planning a vacation.\"  Over the next few weeks I went to see her and got her to take a shower here and there and even got one of her best friends to come over to play card games with her which seemed to cheer her up.  She gave me a hug after that but immediately went blank and kicked me out of the house.  After talking for a few more days she broke up with me on Thanksgiving and told me to never talk to her again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPost Breakup:  \n\n\nDespite promising not to talk to her parents I reach out to her brother and tell him everything, including that she had been off her meds for quite some time.  He thanked me for looking out for her and would reach out to his mom and get all this addressed.  Shortly after her mom reached out to me to thank me and get more details and asked me to recount any redflags in the past since she was a nurse.  I did so and she thanked me.  I asked if I could talk to her and her son every now and then to checkup on her to see how she was doing as I still very much loved her and wanted to get back together at some point.  She said that was perfectly fine.  We talk over the next month about getting her back onto her medication and getting a different therapist (not a different psychiatrist).  She suggested I write my ex a letter to encourage her and showed I still cared.  I did so and got no response.  Another month goes by and still nothing from my ex.  I had not messaged her or texted her directly since the breakup but I began asking some friends how she was doing and even asked if they had talked to her about what had happened since they were aware of what transpired.  None of her friends felt close enough to her to do so.  I start going to therapy and taking anti-depressants.  I notice the mother seemed to be a bit put off by our conversations at this point and I asked why.  She told me that her daughter had broken up with me because I had called her doctor behind her back.  I told her she gave me permission to and the mom told me that if she did she does not recall.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother few weeks go by and I start confiding in our mutual friends because I feel like I have hit rock bottom and I am looking for any sign that she is coming out of her funk to which she is not.  Her brother calls me and we both agree that at this point I need closure.  He presses her to reach out and talk to me about what happened.  Still nothing.  It's now February and at this point I feel nothing but anger at what happened and that she has said nothing.  A close friend of mine suggested I write her a letter unleashing my emotions and I did, but first I ran it by her brother and he said it looked fine.  This finally prompts a response from her and we get into a very heated argument but she does eventually apologizes for going silent on me for so long.  We talk about me \"going behind her back\" to call the doctor and she tells me that she had no recollection and that sometimes she feels like she's floating outside her body and doesn't remember anything while doing so.  \n\nI point out that it is unfair that she had lied to me about the severity of her condition and that there was no way to know that.  She agrees and apologies, admits she fucked me over, and doesn't understand why I would want to try to work things out since she wasn't a problem for me anymore.  We talk for awhile and she finally tells me about all her symptoms.  I tell these symptoms to her mom and her mom subtly brings them up with her at the next psychiatrist meeting.  We are now in early March and she is still acting off.  During one of our conversations she mentions she has still not consistently been taking her medication.  At this point I yelled at the brother because they swore they would monitor her to make sure she was taking her medication.  After that they got her to take her medicine frequently but when she finally came to her mom told her that I had called the mom behind her back and that she should cut ties with me.  I am then blocked by her on all forms of communication.  At that point I had given up  but about a month later the mutual friend we met through invited us both to a party to which I declined since I did not have the heart to see my ex so soon.  This prompted her to accuse me of being the asshole during everything and say I was very controlling and should not have gone behind her back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich is what I believe to have been gnawing at me for all these years.  Was I controlling at any point?  Was I an asshole?  I don't even think she realized she was schizophrenic after all this time and I dont think she does now since the psychiatrist never changed her diagnosis even though the brother and mother believed her to be before I yelled at the brother.",

      "description": "So me and my roommate are long time friends and we live together in a major city. Well last year he started dating a new girl and everything is good. Well about 4 or 5 months ago he basically moved in with her and hasn’t been here except for a couple of nights but he is on the lease still and pays rent (not cheap). But our lease is up in a few months and he plans on moving in with her permanently and we won’t be renewing our lease. \n\nWell last week another friend of ours who lives out of state reached out to us. He has a friend? Acquaintance? I’m not sure, that is moving to our city for a few months and is looking to sub lease a place. So knowing our situation he reached out and asked how we’d feel about this random friend/acquaintance that we don’t know taking over this basically empty room for the remainder of our lease. Now this would help my friend out obviously because it would take care of him not having to pay the rent for a few months while he is living with his girlfriend. \n\nI basically shot down the idea. The reasons why are because I have no idea who this person is or if I can trust him in our apartment - I’ve never even spoken to him or know his name. He’s not on the lease and I don’t want to cause an issue with our landlords as there is a clause in our lease about other people living here. And honestly I don’t feel like I should have to live in a small place with a completely random person for months based off of my friends decision to not be here. He didn’t HAVE to move out, he could still be here but he chooses not to. And this situation wouldn’t benefit me at all. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying to help my friend out more here or are these valid reasons to not want this random person moving in? ",

Along with that the first two weeks were very flirty but then she stopped flirting back. I told her if she found someone else that I'd be happy for her but she told me that she wasn't back on the dating scene and was just busy.\n\nNow a couple of days ago my friend told me that J is dating again. J confided in her about a bad date that happened and about some flakey dudes. She didn't wanna see me get hurt so she let me know.\n\nI brought up J's dating life again with this new knowledge. J said she was still busy and couldn't find time to date. She also got very upset that I brought it up again based on our previous conversation.

I finally agreed and the next day she told her manager that she was going to the doctor with me in the morning, so she got permission to work from home. She apparently \"didn't want to wake me\" in the morning so when I wake up to go to urgent care around noon, she can't go because she's working. It wasn't until after her work day was finished and after I researched how to get there on my own did she drop me off and pick me up after my appointment was finished.   Turns out I had pneumonia.   \n\n\nI'm annoyed because she used me as an excuse to work from home when she could have just gone to work and done the same thing. And a little annoyed that she didn't even come into the doctor's office with me.

      "description": "Throwaway cuz my bf knows my real account\n\nSo I’m still in high school and live with my parents. My bf and I have been dating for about 7 months now and we fight every few months. We always work through it though. We are very good at communicating. \nToday, however, is different. My parents found out I haven’t been doing very well in school and they asked why my grades have been going down. This is when I broke down and told them I’m suffering and think I’m depressed. I’ve had no motivation to do anything, including schoolwork. They are forcing me to go to therapy which I really don’t want to do. I’ve told my parents that but they’re still forcing me to go. \nSo on Snapchat, I send him a picture of my wall. I wasn’t really in the mood to talk to anyone. I should’ve told him I was upset but I wasn’t in a good state of mind at that point. He sends a picture of his face. I didn’t open the Snapchat for about an hour then send him a black screen because I was crying and I didn’t want him to see me. He sends a question mark back and I send another black screen telling him I was going to bed and said goodnight (It was about 12pm at this point) He opens the Snapchat but doesn’t answer. I text him the next morning that I’m not going to be at school. He says ok. I then send him a Snapchat and he opens it but doesn’t answer. A few hours later I get a text from him saying that I’m an asshole and not to text him until I start treating him like a person too. I explain to him about my situation and he says “it’s not my fault and I’d love to be able to help you but how am I supposed to do anything about that? I don’t see why you have to treat me like this for doing nothing except caring” I told him I’m sorry i just didn’t really feel like talking to anyone at that time. All he says is “K, then don’t.” I said “I don’t want you to think I’m mad at you so sorry.” And he hasn’t answered that text.\nI’d like to also point out that during this text conversation he told me he was fighting with his mom and his mom called child services. So he was quite upset while talking to me.\nHe has blocked me on Snapchat and Instagram. So AITA for doing what I did? And what could I do to fix things? I’m quite sad rn about all this. I don’t want to lose him",

      "title": "AITA for parking my car",
      "description": "The street that I lived on was VERY narrow. One way, cars parked on both sides with just enough room for a car to pass through. I lived in one of two buildings that had about 8 units. Across the street was a building that had about 6 units. This building had two driveways on either side and a parking lot behind it. My building had no off-street parking. \n\nI would park my car in the first spot next to one of the two driveways (the one further down the one way road, so the other driveway was still an option. This is important.) I made sure to never block the driveway, always parking past where the curb turns into the driveway. Admittedly it made it tight for people to pull out of the driveway but any time you turned onto this road it was tight. \n\nOne day I came out to my car in the dead of winter and my car was covered in what I thought was frost that someone had wiped around. I honestly didnt pay it much mind. (Figured out it was coffee they had poured all over my car) A few days later I came out and there were 4-5 pickle slices on my car. PICKLE SLICES! No broken glass around nor an excess of pickle juice. So as best I reckon someone came out with a jar of pickles. Opened it. Threw 4-5 of those suckers on my car. Closed up the jar and calmly walked it back into their apartment. Seems like well-adjusted behavior. At this point I think these events are a bit odd, but i honestly have no idea why someone would be messing with my car. \n\nFinally one day I come out and there is a pile of trash on my car. It's not really wet trash, mostly sunflower seeds, some food and alot of papers. I pull put a couple of pieces and find a name and address. Thinking I have the perp I go to knock on their door. A woman answers and i calmly ask her if she has been messing with my car. She says she has no idea what I'm talking about. I must have the wrong person. The real guy must have just grabbed the trash from a random trash barrel. I tell her I'm sorry and that someone must have been going through her trash and she should be careful what she throws out. (I was able to find a significant amount of information just from the stuff I found) So I leave still confused. \n\nThe grand finale came when my girlfriend and I are parking in the spot one night. All of a sudden there is a guy pounding on the passenger side window yelling that I cant park there. I try to keep calm but I don't appreciate the aggressiveness hes showing, especially with my girlfriend present. I get out of the car. He immediately starts yelling about how I cant park there and that I'm blocking the driveway. I tell him that I'm within the curb and not blocking the driveway at all. This back and forth continues on for a while luckily doesnt get physical, after some yelling guess who comes running down the stairs? The Woman I talked to earlier! She really was the one dumping the trash on my car! \n\nThere really was not much resolution. I told them that I will continue to park there, if they have issues they can knock on my door and I would help them get out. I parked there and they never said a peep afterwards. \n\nWhere I parked wasnt illegal, I admit it made it tough to pull out, but parking was at a premium and they had an alternative driveway to use but it's been bugging me for a while, AITA? \n",

      "description": "Me M[20] and girlfriend F[18] are at the mall in a store that sells Pop figures and other popular culture items. She's the first person I've ever dated (yeah, I know) and me her first in 5 months since her last breakup. This was our 6th date. This happened 3 days ago.\n\nIn the store, she finds a mini keychain Iron Man  which she picks up and plans to buy. Upon walking around the store more, she finds a pop figure that she doesn't yet own on the top shelf.\n\nShe asks me to grab it for her, which I do. As I'm about to hand it to her, she places the Iron Man keychain on the shelf (away from where they are found in the store) and reaches for the pop figure in my hands.\n\nI stop here right there and say...\n\nMe: Are you going to put that back?\n\nHer: No?\n\nMe: Well, I'm not handing you this pop figure until you put that back.\n\nShe starts to wrestle it out of my hands for a few seconds, even biting me, and I eventually let go to avoid breaking pop figure.\n\nAfter a few seconds of me letting go...\n\nMe: You really need to put that back where you found it\n\nHer, as she starts walking away: No, that's what people here get paid to do.\n\nMe: I'm being dead serious; you need to put that back. I'm not leaving until you do.\n\nHer: Well, I drove you here so I'm your ride back. \n\nMe: I don't care, I'm not moving.\n\nAt this point shs walks off to the other half for the store (small store) while I stand there in front of the keychain on the shelf.\n\nFew minutes pass by and she wanders back around and asks me what I'm doing. I tell her I'm looking something up and she casually grabs the keychain and starts nonchalantly walking back to where she found it. I slowly follow her until she puts it back...\n\nMe: Thank you for putting it back; I hope you can understand where I'm coming from with things like that.\n\nHer: No, not really. I used to work retail and people would leave stuff around all the time.\n\nMe, taken aback: Just because someone gets paid to maintain the store, doesn't mean it's your responsibility to make their life harder than it needs to be. I think it's important to be considerate of others, regardless of if they get paid or not.\n\nHer: Yeah, whatever.\n\nAfterwards, we drive around a bit more before attending her family's party later that evening.\n\nThis really bothered me for the next two or three days as I mulled over it, not sure if I was being immature or not with how I handled it. She seemed to let it go pretty quickly and hasn't brought it up since. I feel a 70-30 ratio of whether to be firm or apologize to her. I can see how it's controlling behavior to be that non-compromising in a situation like this and borderline immature. I also see it as me standing up for one of most important things to me, being kind and considerate to others; which is why I wanted to set things straight right then to avoid getting walked over in the future since I suspect this would happen again.\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I teach an upper elementary grade. Every year for the past five years we’ve gone to a place 2-2.5 hours away.

This year I have other teachers on my side and we are very vocal. We want to go somewhere closer so we can stay within our paid hours. Our field trip planner just booked the far away place despite us giving alternatives - effectively forcing us to work 4+ hours for free.  \n\nI refuse to use a sick day for this and am planning on asking the principal to find another teacher to take my place.

      "description": "My Girlfriend of 18 months and I are planning on booking an all-inclussive holiday for the end of next summer, late September time to avoid the Summer price hikes. The holidays we've shortlisted are all to resorts near the same airport, and the holidays are full packages (i.e. flights and luggage included). We have 2 sets of dates to potentially travel on:\n\n20th Sept - 1st Oct, and 17th Sept - 28th Sept.\n\nWith the former costing £940 total, and the latter costing £1090 total. Effectively being £150 more expensive, also with one less night in the all inclussive resorts, for the privilege of travelling a couple of days earlier.\n\nThe problem occurs as her university begins \"Freshers week\" on Monday the 30th of September, with lectures beginning on the 7th of October. While she's definitely not interested in the social aspects of Freshers, she's concerned because her course, which she'll be starting her second year of,  has \"pre-project meetings\" which can take place during this freshers week. She's contacted some peers in the year above of her course, and they've said she \"would probably miss out a couple of things, but it should be fine.\"\n\nShe's still insisting on the earlier dates, and more expensive+shorter holiday, and I'm getting incredibly fustrated as we've booked a Chistmas break this year that takes place a week after her semester ends, and in the middle of my December assignment hand ins and exams for the third and final year of my course.\n\nAlthough I was the one who decided it would be okay and I'd just have to work around it for this December holiday, it's upsetting that she's refusing to budge on the dates for next Summer holiday for an even greater financial saving, while only risking having to catch up on a couple minor meetings that take place before lectures even begin.\n\nThe fact that I made more sacrifices so that we could afford to go away together than she's even willing to consider makes it feel very one sided, and I can't tell if I'm taking it too personally and being irrational.\n\nSo, reddit, am I being the asshole for pushing her to change her mind?",

      "description": "My wife and I went on a weekend ski trip with a friend of hers, whose boyfriend alone paid for an entire 5 bedroom house. He was in charge of planning the entire trip and ended up inviting way more of his friends than the house could sleep. We got our own room, as did her friend and her boyfriend, but everyone else shared rooms, slept on couches, etc.  All of the guests were in their mid 20s. \n\nWe didn’t know any of the people that were staying in the house (except for her friend and her boyfriend). As soon as we arrived to the house, I sensed a very immature, party hard vibe. I was right. \n\nWe would go skiing in the mornings, and come back to the house and hang out in the late evenings. The routine was always lots of drinking, lots of smoking (in the house which clearly stated not to smoke inside), and lots of loud music and pong. My wife and I would hang for a little bit, but would always retire to bed by 11 at the latest. Everyone else would always stay up til who knows when, which was not a problem to me. \n\nMy problem is when we’d wake up the next morning and the place would be a complete disaster. Trash everywhere, half eaten pizza on the table (not on a plate), sticky floor, etc. I think the worst thing I saw was a half eaten corn dog sitting on a dirty plate in the sink soaking in the stagnant, backed up sink water. The place was gross. \n\nSince we weren’t paying for the place, we felt a kind of obligation to clean up, but also who can just sit around in a mess like that? So we would clean the place back to its original condition before everyone else would wake up. Wash, rinse, repeat and next the morning it would be in the same obliterated state. So once again, we’d clean up and hope for the best. \n\nAITA for being upset that no one else respected the shared space enough to simply through their trash away and stick some dishes in the dishwasher?",

      "description": "Hey guys, I’m on mobile so I hope my formatting doesn’t wind up wonky. \n\nA couple weeks ago myself and a couple employees at my business decided that we would go into a Christmas parade. It’s a small town so there’s not any pressure to go ALL OUT, but I didn’t bother setting a budget. I’ve spent probably close to $1000 in decorations and primo candies to hand out. \n\nOne thing I wished to buy was flags. I’m a franchise but affiliated with a big enough trademark that I could somewhat easily find some. The only problem was that I was in Canada and the company that makes them is in the States. We’re also on opposite ends of the continent. \n\nThey confirmed they do international shipping and I accepted the quote they gave me for priority shipping through Fedex. I’ll mention here as well that the dollar exchange added another $80 on top of the price although I find it a cost of doing business. \n\nI checked my invoice while the package was en route and they had misprinted what I wanted. It was a similar design but not the flags I wanted. I emailed the company and they agreed to very quickly make up the correct flags (the error occurred somewhere between the rep I spoke to and the printing team) and send them my way. I wasn’t charged for them but I did have to pay duties twice, $30CAD a pop. \n\nThe rep mentioned that she would let me know what to do with the first flags. I asked what to do with them once I received the correct flags and they would like me to send them back. \n\nThat’s the back story. Now I’d like to know if this is where I tread on asshole territory. \n\nI’d like to keep the flags since they’re of nice quality and I could use them as well in the parade. I wouldn’t mind paying the actual cost of the flags plus tax, int’l credit card fees, etc, but I don’t want to pay for the shipping. It’s substantial ($175USD, I’d have to pay the exchange rate on top of it which right now is like 1.30) and to send it back would cost me another $20 anyway (cheapest rates from Canada Post, who are also on strike right now and I’m willing to bet if no packages are coming in over the border possibly before Christmas not many if any at all are going out). \n\nHere’s a review of costs only as far as it applies to these flags:\n\nInitial flags that were mistakenly sent: $340CAD\nDuties for flag delivery: $30CAD\nDuties for 2nd flag delivery: $30CAD\n\nProspective costs I’m willing to offer to pay: $70USD + taxes, fees\nPotential cost for their request: $20+ to ship back \nPotential cost I’m avoiding: $175USD\n\nSo WITBA to request to pay all but the shipping for the second flags?",

It's just not the job that I want to be in, nor is it really related to my degree.  \n\nI have been applying for and have interviewed for a couple of jobs.  \n\nOne is a Case Manager position at a reform school of sorts.  It pays a little less than I make now, but it has better benefits.  The hours are a bit irregular, but that's not a huge deal for me.  They just called today and offered me the job.  I asked them to give me time to decide and they have given me until 2:00PM ESt tomorrow, which is where the issue arises. \n\nThere is another job that I have applied for and have done two phone interviews for.  It seems to be going well for me.  It is a Human Resources position.  All around this job is the one that is more attractive to me.  Better pay, regular hours, etc.  Also, HR can be super lucrative once you have the experience.  I have an in-person interview for this position on Wednesday of next week.  I think there is a good chance that I'll get offered the job, but it's still definitely up in the air.  \n\nSo, while I would definitely prefer the HR job, I fear that if I turn down the Case Manager position and don't get offered the HR job, I'll be stuck in the job that I currently hate. \n\nHowever if I accept the position and then get offered the HR position, I would feel like a total dick telling them I changed my mind.\n\nI've gotten various advice from friends and family, but I am still uncertain, so I have come to the #1 problem solver: Reddit. \n\nI appreciate any responses, I could really use the help!\n\nSorry for the long post.  I hope it makes sense, but if not I can clarify it.",

He had been depressed before moving but it has gotten so much worse after. He found out he wouldnt be coming back until at least 2021, This led to me(16) and a few of my friends(all 16) to talk to him in a groupchat everyday for almost 4 months. We saw him slowly spiral down and down until the point where he stopped caring if he lived or not. \n\nBut recently it's become a burden for me to keep talking about the same three topics of why he is depressed, and all it does is lead to me being sad, and him getting a moment of bliss. I've done this for nearly a year and 3 months now and I find it extremely hard to find the will to message him everyday knowing it will lead to me being sad and nothing changing within him. I've slowly started pulling away and been only on to talk every 3 or 4 days. If you have any questions you can ask. I may not answer right away but I will.",

      "description": "Am I the asshole for being upset at my mother for upending and splintering her families life and moving to another state for a Job.\n\nMy mother and father have been together for 30 years. My mother had two other marriages and two other children resulting from them. Instead of going to college she decided to drink, do drugs, and have children. At thirty she met my father, got married, and had me. My father bailed her out of her massive credit card debt, bought an old Victorian fixer upper for us to live in, and always made sure everyone needs were met before his which often included shopping trips, new cars, and plastic surgery for my mother.\nGrowing up both of my parents worked blue collar jobs. My dad worked on the railroad, built a rental property business, and was the main provider. My mother worked as a receptionist and eventually worked her way up to sales. When she was 50 and the children were out of high school she decided to go back to college through her workplace and earned her B.S. and eventually MBA which lead to her transitioning into HR Management and actually began out earning my father. We were all very proud of her and for once my parents where both save money, buy nice things, and help out their children. Their long-term goal was to always retire, buy a beach house in North Carolina, and live between Ohio and NC.    \n\nThe downside of her new career was that her personality shifted from being a mother/grandmother to a career driven professional. Eventually, she overstayed her welcome at her long time job and was forced out. She quickly found a similar position about 45 minutes from home. She was let go at this job roughly 6 months ago after 3 years which happened to be a few weeks after my father had retired from his job and sold off his rental business after 42 years. My father is now 60 and my mother is 58. My father managed to save $1,000,000+ in his 401k, sold his rental business for $600,000, and paid off the house they live in. My mother has managed to save $350,000 but is not eligible to retire until 60. They both will receive a pension from my fathers job that adds up to $70,000 per year.   \n\nHere is where I am torn emotionally. My mother refused to retire early cut expenses and live on $70,000 a year for 2 years before she could dig into her 401k. My father refused to cut into his 401k to make up the difference because he wants to eventually put it into a trust fund for the children much and gift us the maximum untaxable amount every Christmas much like his father and mother did for him. This financial dispute and my moms need to prove herself after failing twice has driven her to move to North Carolina for a similar job as before which has left my father and her family feeling abandoned in Ohio. This hurt that she put her career ahead of her family but we understood since it would only be until she was 60 and could retire. Over the holidays she repeatedly pressured my father into selling the family home and move to NC with her immediately and never come back to Ohio which was not their plan a few years ago. The problem is that he is the only sibling in Ohio that is taking care of his 92 year old father and he now feels torn between his responsibility to his father and marriage. In the process I feel abandoned by my mother as I am in the process of getting married and hopefully having children. Children which I had hoped would have a close relationship with their grandparents much like I did. \n\nTLDR: Am I the Asshole for feeling like my mother is being selfish by putting her career before her familial duties and feeling abandoned.

      "description": "So here’s the backstory...\nI’ve been working for this company that I absolutely love for quite some time now. My first year as an employee we got handed Christmas bonus checks the week before Christmas which was awesome and was about $500, not bad for just starting ten years ago. \n\nEvery year after it has grown and these are not mandatory by any means but this year when they came around it was $500. Keep in mind I am totally grateful for anything at all as they’re not outlined in our contract but to give some reference point my last years bonus was 12 times that amount. \n\nWhat grinds my gears a bit on it is that our staff has really put in more effort this year than any other year, the company has grown significantly and has reinvested the money back into the company but seems like they forgot to budget for the people that got the company to where they’re at. All the staff is in the same boat and I don’t know how to approach the owners as I am a manager now and everyone is looking at me for some answers. So essentially, aita for feeling shitty about shitty bonuses ? \n\nSorry for bad grammar and what not don’t crucify me. Any advice would be cool though ",

We patched things up but then this happened. I shared a meme that said \"Bisexuality doesn't exis... \n\" with Aquaman and Wonder Woman on it. She calls me an asshole over it. I tried explaining the joke but she doubled down, saying I was an asshole, I should have explained I don't actually believe what it says. I should apologize to her and delete it like a true friend. Now normally I would apologize if I offend someone unintentionally, but calling me an asshole cause you don't get the joke is not a good way to get it. I also don't take kindly to being told what I can or can't say or post. I try to explain how I've felt and how she's been distant and that her coming at me like this makes me think she wants to be offended. Well she flips out up to the point where I just say I don't even want to be friends anymore. She is specially offended cause I, who know her quite well would, share it but she's fine with not being friends. I point out her recent distant behaviors, not wanting to even consider hanging out and this make me think she wants me out of her life so I accept. I feel lousy about it all but I've actually been doing okay, I miss her cause we were pretty close and I don't have a lot of friends in town, but the lack of drama is nice. ",

I mean i'm ok with the lie of omission if they're not asking me. But recently they did and i guess they're getting suspicious. And i don't want to lie to them anymore. She even asked me to lie to her parents that I'm the one going out of town with her when she's actually going with her boyfriend who's a dealer and have a fuckfest. \n\nAnd what eventually made me want cut my ties with her is the fact that she wanted us to drink. At her parent's house. Down the basement. And be quiet so we won't get caught. \n\n\nI did my best (our other friends were telling me im not a bestfriend more like a mother at this point). \n\nThough i do feel guilty. I enjoyed my first years with her. We used to have the same humour but i guess everuthing changes with time. I'm probably her only friend by now.

      "description": "Ahh, the Holidays. The most wonderful time of the year. Spending it with family, unsettling small talk about lives and kids that no one actually listens too. BEST TIME OF THE YEAR!!!   \n\n\nMy wife and I are currently in an internal conflict whether or not to go home for Christmas weekend. After my wife and I got married 3 years ago, we decided that Michigan sucked and moved down to Tennessee.  Close enough away where we could drive, but far enough away where we can be away from everyone when we do not want too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have not been home for Christmas in a few years just because of us traveling or not having money to make it up, so this year we decided to do it and make the trip. We were SUPER excited because we have not seen our family and friends in a very long time, and our crazy little puppers have not seen snow before, it was going to be a memorable time. This was until we told our families. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my wife and I come from very similar households. Both of our parents divorced at around 12 years old (27 years of age currently.) And 15 years later, both sides can not get over their divorces. My mother in law remarried 5 years ago and  has been married to the most toxic and self deprecating person I have ever met. He is one of those guys that has to be the center of attention wherever he goes, and if he is not, he sits and pouts in a corner somewhere, (mind you, he is over 50.) Well we heard that they were FINALLY getting a divorce, they talked about it for years but it seemed like this time it was happening because he wanted it. My mother in law actually seemed happy and actually talked about coming to visit us on her own (she is the, \"I need a man or I can't survive\" types.) WELL, a few days ago, he decided to come out saying he was Bipolar and Manic Depressive and has started taking medication. Now THAT is the magic fix to their relationship. First he needed his kids out of the house, then he'd be fixed if he became a catholic, now this? No, he is just an asshole. And now that theyre back together, all of our plans are changing even though we made them a month ago. What first started off as an incredible time to see my wifes crazy big and awesome family, has turned into sounding like the most stressful thing ever.  (Her real dad is completely MIA btw.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy side of the family is kinda the only reason that we would go up. My mom and I don't really talk, but we are still nice to each other when we see one other.  My Dad and I recently have repaired our relationship and have become very close. I do miss him and he is the only reason I really have wanted to go up. That and one other:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my Grandpa has had a form of cancer for over a year, and it has started to spread slowly. My dad has been kinda saying it might be his last Christmas, so it would be a good idea for us to come up. My Grandpa is your standard, prideful 90 year old who doesn't need your young people and such. Very independent man, we are not very close cause he is not close to anyone.  But we figured we would go up this year for Christmas, and possibly see him for Christmas one last time .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat seemed like a fun trip when we planned it, has now turned into a crazy stressful and agonizing experience of dealing with people we do not want to deal with, driving EVERYWHERE. ( our families live an hour and a half a way from eachother.)  A nice, quiet Christmas at home just seems like what we REALLY wanna do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are supposed to drive up Friday night. Would we be assholes if we decided to cancel last minute?   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can answer any more questions about our families/history if anyone is interested! Figured I would try and keep it short for now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Some background info: I'm in high school so this is one of the first relationships of this sort that I've had. Also, this is a long story but there is a TL;DR at the bottom for those who want to really cut to the chase; I recommend reading through, though, because there is some important context in the main body of the story. \n\nI liked this girl for a long time (around a year or so) but never told her how I felt because I was afraid of losing her friendship in case she didn't feel the same way (we were relatively close friends for the last 2-3 years). A couple months ago, she began showing signs that she felt the same way and wanted to be something more than friends, and I happily obliged. For a while, everything was going pretty well as we got to know each other even better and spent a lot of time and had a lot of fun together. \n\nAn important note to add here: both of us share the same religion, which frowns upon dating and other relationships with the other gender outside of marriage. Because of this, both of our parents are extremely conservative and are totally against either of us dating anyone at all, not just each other. The two of us have also both had relationships with other people in the past, which were discovered by parents and resulted in punishments. Finally, just to put the cherry on top, our parents are family friends and have known each other for years as well.\n\nAfter about a month of us spending time together, I began to become extremely concerned that our parents would somehow find out about us, especially as I recalled how my parents had found out about my last relationship due to some texts that I had forgotten to delete. It got to the point where I was unable to sleep at night over being stressed about this, so I told her that we could never date because I didn't want our parents to find out about anything (her parents are especially strict about her not having any relationships or anything, and I didn't want to be the reason that her parents became angry with her or some family conflict ensued). She understood where I was coming from and had even had similar concerns (though probably was not as worried as I was), so this didn't create a huge issue between us that I could really see. \n\nWe continued to spend a LOT of time together over the next month and a half or so, getting closer and closer. Despite my promises to myself that I would try to control my feelings so that I would start to think about taking our relationship any further, I really fell for her and began to think of her as someone that I loved; it seemed that she was also beginning to feel the same way. Again, the only reason that I did not want to make our relationship official despite knowing how we felt about each other was to spare the two of us from being discovered by our parents. \n\nOver the last two weeks, we had winter break from school so I didn't see her for about ten days, although we continued to talk over text for a good portion of those ten days. When I returned to school, I began to feel like she was angry at me or that I had done something wrong because she seemed to be avoiding me, choosing to walk with her friends and talking to me as little as possible (I don't have any problems with her being with her friends, but it was out of the norm as compared to the last few weeks when we had been spending as much time with each other as possible). That day I was also very tired, having not slept very much the night before finishing schoolwork, and generally was not in a great mood. I began to think that it was because of this that she was unhappy with me, so I apologized and explained why I had been off. She waved it off, saying that I had done nothing wrong, and I thought the problem was resolved. However, later in the day, I texted her just to talk, as we had done regularly for the last few weeks, but she never responded. I assumed that she was probably just sleeping or something, but was a bit worried due to the way the day had gone. \n\nThe next day, I stayed home to make up the sleep that I had lost the night before. I didn't contact her really at all until the evening despite having been at home all day, and again she never responded. I began to worry that she might be upset that I hadn't told her why I didn't go to school or something along those lines, so the next day I explained myself. Again, she said that it was okay and told me that it was fine. However, she definitely avoided me throughout the day, to the point where she wouldn't even look at me. I then began to accept the thing that I had been thinking all week, but didn't want to believe: that she was just tired of me and/or had lost interest. \n\nI understand that I have no right to make her feel a certain way about me or to expect that she feels the way about me that I do about her. I hold no grudges or hard feelings against her solely because she is no longer interested in me, but I have been upset that she chose to communicate that her feelings had changed by ceasing to talk to or interact with me. I understand why she may have lost interest, since we'd had a relatively strange relationship and because it seemed like it wasn't going anywhere, but unknown to her I had been thinking about making us official for a long time and there was no question as to whether I liked her or not; I'd say at that point, without a question, I was really in love (which may be why this is seems more upsetting than it should be). I'm also still somewhat still afraid that I might have done something extremely wrong (although nothing stands out to me), because I cannot see any other reason why a friend of 3-4 years would suddenly cut me off without any explanation.\n\nTL;DR - A girl and I liked each other, but I never tried to make us official out of worry as to what might happen if her or my parents ever found out. She suddenly stopped talking to me, and I have been upset because of the way that our relationship ended. \n\nThank you to those who read the whole story, I know it was a lot. Please tell me what you think: AITA for being upset about the way our relationship ended, or should I be more considerate as to how she might have been feeling throughout all of this? ",

Of course being almost 18 but not quite, it can get quite dicey almost every day over small commonplace things.\n\nAnyways, tonight after arguing with my mom for the infinitieth time, she takes my phone, regular routine, but starts spewing off about how I'm a terrible child and that I don't show her enough respect.\n\nShe then asks me to drive to a weekly therapy session for us (fitting), and it is in the rain. After 5 minutes I have gotten a bit tired of my mom pelting criticism at me, and I ask for her to stop so that I can concentrate on the road and keep us safe in the rain. \n\nShe is able to do so for maybe 1 minute before going back at it again. I just keep my eyes on the road so we stay safe, and she is just getting angrier at the fact that I'm remaining emotionless. Finally we make it to the driveway, and as I'm trying to pull in, she pulls out one last criticism and I get so stuck up on it that I end up pulling into a concrete pillar at only about 1mph. \n\nAfter about 10 seconds of both of us being in shock, she just breaks down crying and i apologize 5 times as she is leaving the car.\n\nAfter that I say sorry once more, but tell her that I warned her that it would be dangerous to keep being so cold, harsh and critical toward me while trying to keep us alive.\n\nShe got pissed saying that I was shifting the blame to her and that I am an Asshole.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "Pretext: if i'm honest, the only reason I didn't push this issue is because I didn't want to end up on r/ChoosingBeggars.\n\nI ordered pizza from Papa John's the other night. They were abnormally busy and whenever that happens, I try to be extra nice to people. Totally understand it, I've worked in the service industry. Anyway, I order my pizza and wings, it takes significantly longer than they told me it would be, I remain patient. When it finally comes out, it's packed, so I don't check the pizza like I normally would, and leave.\n\nGet home and there's a topping missing. No big deal, it's one topping. I wait a little bit, knowing it's busy, and call and tell them, asking if I can just get a coupon for next time. I figure they'll give me $2 off or something, roughly the price of a topping. I don't mind a missing topping, I mind paying for something I didn't get. The employee's response was something to the extent of \"We've taken care of it.\" To which I ask, ok, are you refunding or something for the future or something? And he says \"I'm not sure, call back later.\" Ok, sure.\n\nI call back around 10pm, and remind them of the situation, specifically citing the person's name from earlier. They said apparently ***whatever*** I get next time is on the house. Ok, sweet deal! I guess being patient and nice pays off.\n\nI call today and I think \"It's probably fair for me to not order more than what I did last time, right?\" So I order the exact same pizza, with wings. I explain the situation, which this guy actually remembers from that night. I go to pick up the pizza and they ask for \\~$8. I tell them I must have misunderstood, I thought it was on the house and they tell me they can only comp the pizza. AITA for wanting what they promised even though they didn't mess up my wings? Should I just report myself to r/ChoosingBeggars?",

The reason why we went shopping is that it was pancake day (UK thing) and we'd missed it cause she wasnt feeling well, so we decided to do it the next day. I go home, leaving her with her mate in town, saying we'd make pancakes when she came back. As she came back, i get a text off a different mate telling me to get to a nearby town, as the band while she sleeps (a favourite of mine) are doing a signing and that his dad had got him two free tickets to the signing and the show. \n\nNow me, loving the band and knowing that this is an extremely rare opportunity to meet them (for free), message mate 1 and tell her that I'm so sorry but I'm gonna have to cancel cause i'm not gonna get this opp again\n\nThe only other thing is, she was going home from Thursday-monday (we're both at university) so it was the only opportunity to have these plans\n\nTl;dr I cancelled on my best mate last minute cause i was given the opportunity to meet one of my favourite bands the day before she went away",

So it’s me and me coworker doing dishes we usually have a lot of food prep but luckily we only had one left chicken. So the plan is to knock as many dishes before 8:30 and then do chicken, get our food, then finish dishes before 10:30. Well we do the first step but then it comes time to do chicken and he wants to lag ass and be slow I make our labels and he chooses to take out the trash right then in now which is a 20 minute task. I’m like bro come on let’s just finish chicken so we can leave on time he then says he doesn’t want it to pile up at the end of the night. I’m like bro do chicken first we do chicken it’s 915 he gets all the trash up from 915 to 940 it shouldn’t take that long then goes on a trash run. Leaving me with tons of dishes alone because he wants to be slow. He comes back at 10. Now I busted my ass trying to knock out dishes but it was too much and while I’m struggling he slowly sweeps the floor for 30 minutes. It’s 1030 we shoulda beeen done but no. So I leave with a drastically smaller stack and say have fun your on your own. We have kinda of a group tip everyone gets 8 dollars but one person gets three. She said the last to clock out gets the three. Not only did I leave him with that small stack I left him with the three so AITA?",

      "description": "I (27F) was invited to a bridal shower for a woman who is marrying my boyfriends cousin. My boyfriend (27M) is not close to this cousin and we are actually unsure we are even going to be able to attend the wedding (out of town trip already planned for that weekend).  My boyfriends Mom(50s) and sister(29) were also invited. \n\nThe date of the bridal shower is the day I was planning some birthday festivities for my close friend. I have met this woman only once at a party. I assume she was probably inviting everyone that’s invited to the wedding as well. I just have no desire to sit there and watch someone open presents for hours, play games, and not to mention I’d have to purchase a gift and we are currently in intense savings mode for a house. I had talked to my boyfriend about skipping and he said it was no big deal, and that it would be fine to skip. But then I talked to my Mom...and as Moms do best, she planted seeds of doubt. \n\nMy mom thinks it would be a good opportunity to get closer to my boyfriends Mom and sister and have some bonding time. (We have been dating for over 2 years so I know them pretty well I think) Whenever we see his family, we are all cordial but I just don’t see any real connections happening with his Mom and sister unfortunately. They are both deeply into Catholicism and don’t really drink or swear. I am an atheist and love me some fucking booze. We just don’t seem to have too much common ground. My boyfriend is also pretty removed from them (if given the choice he’d rather hang out with my family) So I’d say we get along with them but we don’t share a closeness. Some of you may say this may be an opportunity to open the door to closeness but I feel if closeness was going to happen it probably would have by now. If I really wanted to, I could switch around some birthday festivities to accommodate this but idk AITA for wanting to skip out on this shower?",

      "description": "Pretty much title. Overseas holiday and I kissed a girl but left the situation immediately afterward. Reconciled this by thinking I’d done the right thing by not continuing despite her wanting to do more. Returned home and nothing was spoken of it. \n\nSeveral months later, she comes to me crying and confesses to me that she had kissed her ex-boyfriend at a nightclub when we were going through a particularly rough period.  She was clearly upset and reinforced she had no feelings for him and had regretted it ever since. \n\nFollowing this I tried to be supportive, however, I found it extremely difficult to come to terms with this - especially since she had continued to put herself in social situations in which she had known he would be there. We took a little bit of time apart before I eventually told her that I couldn’t go on with the relationship knowing what I know. Adding to my decision was the fact that she had had a track record of cheating on a boyfriend before. \n\nI definitely feel guilt in the aftermath of the situation, given that she had the courage to admit it and I hadn’t. In the months since our breakup she has already found another partner which has made it tougher. At the time of finding out, I did not even consider my own cheating to be anywhere near as serious and have only realised recently how hypocritical this sounds. ",

      "description": "I’m a first time poster and on mobile so sorry about any formatting issues.\n\nBackstory/Context: I (14f) don’t really do my makeup that much despite having a lot of it. Also I hate any sort of attention to myself, especially from my family and tend to stay in my room. Another thing to note is that this happened around 30 minutes ago.\n\nSo this story starts off with me deciding to do my makeup since I got bored.  My family knows that I never really do my makeup so they would notice and pay attention, so I just put my head down whenever anyone from my family comes into my room in hopes that they wouldn’t notice.\n\nAbout 10 minutes after I was done, my aunt walked into my room to talk to my mom and must’ve noticed. When she was about to walk out, she kind of bend down  to see if I was wearing makeup and I told her something along the lines of “please don’t look at me it makes me feel weird.” I said this kind of slurring so maybe there was some mistranslation. Also I don’t think this is exactly what I said, but I know it was something similar to that and said something about feeling weird.\n\nAnyways, afterwards my mom instantly called me out and blew up on how what I said was rude and started to say things about how today I’ve been rude and that I have a really bad attitude. Also I overheard my aunt talking to her boyfriend about the incident and said she never said anything about that and that she was just looking at my makeup. My cousin actually came into my room as I was talking to her and asked if I called her mom rude, to which I denied and said that I felt weird. \n\nMy family knows that I don’t like being stared at so I don’t know why my aunt and mom act hostile towards me every time I say I don’t want to be stared at or recorded but sometimes they do make me feel as if I am the A-hole. Honestly this isn’t the first time they have gotten mad at me for something like this so maybe I am being the A-hole every time? I should probably just not wear makeup if I don’t want any attention.",

My clothes, my hair, my lack of friends, my schooling, telling me that I was faking my panic attacks and that all I wanted from my parents was attention...

      "description": "The title is misleading, but technically true.\n\nMy mother and her sister often have... rivalry. My Aunt is usually really jealous of my mother since she always seem to do the pettiest of things just to piss my family off, but I think this time I went a little overboard with revenge. Keep in mind, my mother is 45 and my aunt is 36, yet they still argue like little girls.\n\nOn my 16th birthday, my family threw me a surprise party with my extended family from my mother's side. All was well, the cake was amazing, and everyone was really calm and not arguing (Which is surprising, my mother's side is... problematic). One of my cousins, he was 14 at the time and is also my aunts son, was talking about how he was having a hard time with his grades, and my mom chipped in and said that I could perfectly help him study if needed since I'm top in class, and I also complied gladly. He was really excited and told my aunt, but my aunt took this a little... harshly. And said, out-loud, to the whole family:\n\n*\"My son doesn't need help from anyone with his grades. Especially not from this f\\*\\*\\*ot.\"*\n\nYep. She went there. My mother was about to burst, but I calmed her down, trying to not worsen the situation (Note: I'm actually Bi but I'm not out to anyone, but I've always had snide remarks from my aunt in particular.). She then proceeds to give a whole **speech** about how no-one in this family seems to care about her accomplishments and such, storms out, ruins the party and leaves everyone speechless.\n\nFast-forward a few months, my overseas uncle decides to pay us all a vacation trip to a nearby beach. Like, cool! That was an incredible gift from him and we're all planning on sending him tons of thank you gifts this Christmas. We decided to pay for a trip-bus so we can all travel together, and the first person to greets us is our aunt. Well, no, she just ignored our presence while we hopped on. We arrived at the hotel, and my aunt suddenly starts to favor my female cousin (who is not her daughter, mind you, she's the daughter of my great aunt) over my older sister (both aged 24) buying her drinks and earrings and such. My sister didn't give a fuck, until this happened.\n\nAunt: (To cousin) Did you like the necklace I got you sweetie?\n\nCousin: Yeah! It looks great with my dress.\n\nAunt: True. (Raising tone of voice) *At least you're not a tub of lard like other girls I know.*\n\nCousin: Aunt Silvia! That's rude! (She evidently knew who she was trying to offend)\n\nAunt: \\*laughs\\*\n\nMy sister came in crying. I was furious. She can talk shit about me all the fuck she wants but **no one talks shit about my siblings.** My mom was this close storming her room, but I managed to keep all of us calm and rational. I didn't want to give my aunt the satisfaction of us loosing it, but I swore I was gonna get back at her.\n\nOther minor comments she made during the trip:\n\n\"He may be a swimmer, but doesn't seem like he's gonna get girls unless he plays a mans sport.\" (Referencing me.)\n\n\"That kid seems a little dumber than the rest.\" (Referencing my little brother, infuriating me even more, mind you.)\n\n\"I wonder if that idiot finally left that other idiot.\" (Referencing my parents. They had marital problems at the time.)\n\nHow did I get these comments? My cousins (including her own son I talked about previously) let me know what she was saying, since they thought it was rude. I thank them greatly and proceed to keep quiet. But I still wanted revenge, *I honestly just wanted to get back at her, hard.*\n\nAnd then I hit a gold mine. Guess who's husband I overheard on the phone with his lover? Yep, my aunts (third) husband. This was it, I finally got something on her. And I knew he was cheating because I knew my aunt didn't have a phone at the time and he called the woman on his phone Emily. And it was an incredibly *steamy* conversation. Finally, I could get back at her...\n\nThis is where I come in, again. I commented back home, at the end of the trip, about my findings on the cheating husband. My sister and mother seemed to be surprised and disappointed I didn't spill it sooner with them, but I told them it was best to leave it for a good moment.\n\nThis backfired immediately. My mother talked to my godmother and said that I had heard the conversation too (Apparently my godmother also overheard the conversation). Word spread between the family and they started to say my mother staged everything. Godmother obviously sided with us, but everyone else even started harassing my mother. I had enough. This was ridiculous. They seriously believed that woman and not my mother, who's proved to be honest about so many other past things?\n\nI texted the whole family and exposed my aunt. I deleted the mass text later, but I seriously outed my aunt and her husband, said how he was cheating on her with this \"Emily\" (who was apparently a coworker), called her out for the bullshit she said and snapped back with comments about her appearance and the disasters she has for sons, said other random half-assed shit that was just out of anger, offended her, and left her with a warning to not mess with us again or I'll get even more dirt on her. I honestly exploded in anger.\n\nThe group chat was silent for a few hours. Got a notification later that the whole family had deleted the chat. Out of 25 extended family members, 20 sided with us. The other five just stopped speaking to us entirely (Aunts family and my grandmother.).\n\nI constantly get texts from those five people threatening me and accusing me of lying, to which I respond to screenshots of other shit my aunts done that my cousins tell me about. Now, the family members who sided with us are saying I may have taken it too far, and the day I sent that text my aunt cried for a while (Uncle who was with her said so.) and now they want me to say sorry for the holidays. Of course, she won't apologize for shit.\n\nFuck no I'm saying sorry. That idiot got what she deserved. But truly, am I being the asshole here?",

      "description": "Some backstory: I joined a film club at the beginning of this school year, and it is every Thursday from end of school for about an hour and a half. In it I learn photoshop, premiere, and eventually direct my own film, which is cool because someday I want to work in the film industry. \n\nAnyways, around late December groups were formed for films, and scripts were beginning to get written. I had been to most of the meetings, but around exam time I stopped going for obvious reasons. For about three weeks now, I haven't gone due to circumstances out of my control. I have barely done anything for he group because we haven't met in weeks. Now this is where the real story starts. \n\nSide note: I take the bus home, and it takes me roughly an hour to two hours to commute home. \n\nAll of my absences were excused by the teacher running the club, and this week the teacher told me there was no film club. Okay. Then on Thursday, my friend who is also in film club comes up to me and asks me if I brought any spare clothes for filming. I was confused until he told me the leader of the group emailed me and told me to bring spare clothes today. Now, this is verbatim the email I received on Tuesday. \n\n\"Try to bring some other clothes with you on thursday so that we won't be shooting in our uniform\"\n\nThat is it. No subject line, only an email address, and I barely knew this kid's name. So then I had a choice to either go home since I didn't bring clothes, or go to the meeting anyway. \n\nI chose to go home instead. Maybe this is a bad move, but I think it was okay. I really don't know. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for destroying multiple friendships that had lasted for 10 years?",
      "description": "This had happened quite a few years ago, but it still haunts me to this day. I've tried many things to move on, but I still experience trauma from the past and it's affecting my ability to be a functioning member of society. When I found this subreddit, I knew that I wanted to post what had occurred to hopefully reach some closure. This story is a little long and convoluted, so I'll try my best to explain the details, and I apologize in advance for the behemoth-sized post. \n\nFor starters, I'm female, about 20 years old, and I've known most of these people since I was about 9 years old. I was a very shy girl and didn't have much friends because I kept transferring schools due to the nature of my mother's work, so when we officially settled in a city as permanent residents, I was ecstatic. For the first time, I was able to build a solid foundation of relationships with people. My friend group had consisted of seven girls: Sandra, Lee, Leah, Lily, Mary, Jace, and myself included.\n\nFast-forward to the beginning of high school. We all had naturally became distant after joining different clubs and sports, but we still ate together during lunch and shared new things that was happening in our lives. I joined the dance department when I entered high school. Originally, I was supposed to join the tennis team with Lee (the closest friend I had in the group), but I was out of the country during tryouts, so I had settled with my second choice.\n\nI had zero interest in dance, and truly believed that I had no rhythmic capability. However, I soon realized that I was naturally good at ballet, even with the lack of experience. I felt more confident in myself, and as I preformed in more shows and received praise, dance became a passion of mine. There was some favoritism in the dance company, but it didn't really bother me... at the time.\n\nDance eventually became an unhealthy obsession. I would practice before school, during lunch, and right after my classes had ended. I would abandon my time with my friends in order to reach perfection in my technique. My diet was poor, and combined with a lacking sleep schedule I was always restless. I was sometimes of  dick. My eating disorder and sleep deprivation affected how I acted. I was abusing my relationships as well as myself, but unfortunately I never realized it until it was too late.  \n\nBy my third year, I had a very strong disposition and sense of self, completely different from the shy girl I once was. I had a boyfriend, good grades, the president of two clubs, and was looked up to by other dancers. Lily, Mary and Jace joined dance around this time, so we all had bonded a little more. Sandra, Lee, and Leah all enjoyed supporting us on stage. However, things got rocky from here.\n\nI had developed a big head for all these merits. I started secretly looking down on others, and it made me feel good. I know that was wrong of me, and it's something that I have accepted. I'm not going to deny that. But the problem is, there was a standard personality people had developed in the dance department. Girls who entered eventually implemented toxicity into their character. The dance company consisted of mostly female dancers, and everyone was quick to abandon their closest friend in order to reach the A-list and have a chance to join the top competitive team we had. It was common to see two girls treat each other like the best of friends, but to then immediately call each other a bitch when they're not looking. I guess I'm fortunate enough that I only grew to be narcissistic rather than becoming a full-fledged narcissistic back-stabbing snake. I still valued my friends very deeply, but seeing how everything unfolded I guess they had a different opinion on that (I'll explain later on).\n\nIn dance, you'd expect that hard work and dedication would get you to the top, but no. You could work as hard as you can but still not make the cut. While some did get the position solely based on skill, it mostly depended on two factors: favoritism and body image. My instructor was an amazing dancer with a creative mind, but had a wretched heart, and objectively, kind of stupid. As long as you had her favoritism, it didn't matter how much seniority you had or if you never performed on stage. She will put you into the team without any objections as long as she likes you. And as for body image, the team will make sure you don't qualify for tryouts just because you're not the \"shape\" that they want. I've seen a lot of amazing, talented dancers who were a bit on the heavier side get rejected, and inexperienced teacher's pets get in like it was a walk in the park. (I know that too much variety in body shape can ruin the formation of a dance if you're not too careful, but girls with a good physique and a lack of skill doesn't make it better. I'd rather have a well-seasoned performer who is a bit on the heavier side).\n\nFortunately, I had a good standing with the team and my instructor. I also had the \"look\" that they wanted, so I considered myself lucky. But as I witnessed more and more discrimination among these girls, it made me mad. I'm short-tempered, and I'm quick to point out what I don't like. So, like all petty high school girls do, I carelessly talked shit to my friends, about the ethics of the dance company, and about the top team, all while being fully aware that this could risk my position on the A-list. But at the time I didn't care. The system was too unfair for me to ignore and pretend that everything is okay just because I got the better end of the stick.\n\nThis was the start of it all. Lily, Mary, and Jace told one person, and then the next, and then the next, until everyone in the department knew, all the while twisting and changing the truth as it reaches on ear to another, Eventually everyone in the department labeled me as someone who was scum, someone that trash talks everyone, and someone that is not fit to be a role model nor a good candidate for the team. \n\nAt first, it was kind of laughable, unimaginable even. I became the scapegoat for everyone in this snake den. I became the common enemy that everyone can hate and bond over, all knowing too well that so much rubbish had left their own mouths slandering each other. I tried to confront my so-called friends, but they never gave me a straight answer, and some had a strong conviction that I was an overall terrible person. They were convinced that I didn't care about them at all. \n\nAnd just like that, I was kicked out of the dance department. There were also some other nasty rumors circulating about me being a slut and my relationship issues with my boyfriend at the time, but that didn't really matter. Damage was already done, and you can't break something that was already broken. \n\nI tried to find solace in Sandra, Leah, and especially Lee (since she was my closest friend), but the answers were all the same: *Well, at least you've learned your lesson*. It was then clear to me that no matter who I go to, even if they were my dearest friends, no one would believe me.\n\nLong story short, during my last year of high school I abandoned them. I stopped talking to them. I broke up with my boyfriend (since he believed all that trash about me), and I tried to move on. But I ended my relationships very abruptly with no explanation. I felt like there was no need to talk to them about it if they aren't open to my opinion in the first place. Obviously they weren't happy that I did that, and expected some sort of appreciation for their \"generosity\" by staying as my friend (and boyfriend). They made sure I knew that I should regret my decision every single moment of the day until I graduated by letting the entire school know of my *true colors*.\n\nLooking back at it, I think if they had just talked to me directly about the problems they about my character, all of this could have been avoided. But this entire situation that happened when I was a teenager still gives me a high deal of stress, and there are times I'd wake up in the middle of the night and have a panic-attack. It pains me that something that happened 3-4 years ago is still affecting me to this day. Kind of comical, if you look at it in a cynical way. Now that I'm older, I can't help but to think that I did something wrong. Maybe, all along, *I* was at fault for everything. I know that I also had my fair share of wrongdoings, but nobody seemed interested to see my side of things. I had always thought that no one wanted to listen to me due to everyone having that mob mentality, but maybe they didn't want to hear me out because I was completely wrong in this scenario. \n\nSo, AITA for abandoning these relationships with these people? \n\n TL;DR - I had been lifelong friends with a group of people. As we got older, we all became different people. I was acting a bit of a dick but I was never aware of my actions until fabricated rumors spread about me from my own friends. Those friends left me, and the others didn't want to believe me. So I abandoned my friendships with those who didn't want to believe me and they did not take kindly to it. So AITA for abandoning multiple friendships that had lasted for over 10 years in this seemingly one-sided dilemma?",

      "description": "I am writing this for my girlfriend who is the person asking this AMIA question. Last night her best friend came home to a surprise birthday party with 8 of her high school friends including me that involved dinner, presents, and a cake made by my girlfriend. My girlfriend had been planning this party for the past two weeks making sure everyone could come. Everything was fine and dandy with pictures, conversation, and drinks for the first half.\n\nMy girlfriend had asked what her friend wanted to do with the rest of the evening, and she said that we should watch some movies. She also said she hadn't seen the new Spiderman movie and would like to watch it. Everyone was cool with it and we moved to the living room. One of our other friends suggested a horror movie that he watched a while ago while we were debating movies and my girlfriend's best friend was totally into this, and started to play it with the lights out.\n\nMy girlfriend has struggled with lasting nightmares and psychological troubles with horror movies, and left the room because she didn't want to sit through it. I would check on her periodically and she would be cleaning up the party supplies or laying down in a different room. I asked her afterwards why she didnt say anything to her friend about a different movie selection and she didn't want to control her best friends party and that it should be up to her. \n\nShe does feel upset though that her friend didn't consider her in the movie selection since it was the only movie watched by the group, and she was the only one who wasn't able to watch. The party ended immediately after the movie so my girlfriend came back, said goodbye to everyone, and then cleaned up the glassware before going to bed.\n\nSo, is my girlfriend the asshole for feeling like her friend should have considered her in the movie choice since she also planned the party itself?",

      "description": "I haven't done it yet, notice the WIB in WIBTA.\n\nI am 21 M (not sure if it is relevant), and the friend in question is 21 F. Well, I call her a friend because everyone in our circle pretends so, but I have so so many grudges with her for bullying me plenty as I was growing up. Her dad used to bully me as well. Now obviously, I didn't know it was bullying back then as anti-bullying campaigns hadn't taken off. But i realized it in retrospect.\n\nNow, fast forward to yesterday, a friend of mine who used to date her got dumped by her and in a drunk outrage showed us some pics and videos on his phone of her injecting and inhaling illegal stuff and flexing on her stash of them as well. In a couple of them, she also yelled out some anti-semitic Nazi sympathizing and racist stuff against blacks and muslim immigrants (wasn't a surprise for those who knew her personally). There are videos of her doing the preceding things naked as well. And when we were drunk, I asked him nonchalantly if he could share them with me and now I have them as well.\n\nI am contemplating whether to send it to her dad and to the head of police department in my area. She, thanks to her dad's influence, got into a prestigious German Uni and I am contemplating sending it to them as well. In short, I now hold the key to her demise.\n\nI don't think I'd be an asshole at all, because apart from my personal grudges, for which I was never able to take revenge (thanks to our mom becoming friends), what she did was illegal. And her dad deserves to get punished for it as well because his reason for bullying other kids, including me (and he still does it) was that they were not well behaved. How dare one does that if they were never able to teach their own kids how to behave?\n\nBut my moral compass isn't flawless. Yesterday, my girlfriend asked me to ask myself a rhetorical question, since the reasons I was giving her was being a responsible guy who wanted to keep the streets clean. The question being would I have done the same if it was somebody else, perhaps a stranger? The answer is a shameful \"no\". So, I think I have a problem.\n\nThus, I would be glad if you could pass a two-fold judgement.\n\nWIBTA for going ahead with this?\n\nAITA for not even contemplating doing this if it were somebody else?",

We have implemented the social outing credit system so that if she or I wants to do social outings on our own as a mini getaway to family life and responsibilities, we can be positive with eachother to these fun events and not feel guilty. The credit system kind of allows us to make sure one of us isn't taking advantage of the social opportunities and it doesn't stray too far my way or her way. We don't actually keep close track but we are keeping track. \n\nSo now it's March and she has like almost every weekend booked with friends for weeks and weeks ahead and I kinda think it's a little much especially right now with our kids still so young (4 &amp; 7). She wants to increase her social credit by saying that her having to watch the kids during March break, summer and Xmas break is added parenting compared to me. Although I can agree to that, she is not working and I am. I'm not a teacher and don't have this amount of time off luxury so I said let's put our kids in camps during that time if you don't view that time as special time with your kids. She disagreed as she does want to spend that time with them and generally we increase our budget for fun stuff for them to do during those breaks.

      "description": "I (F22) dated my ex-boyfriend (M22) for about 2 years, and it was an intense relationship. We had a lot of chemistry, and I loved him. He has bipolar disorder which he unfortunately refuses to treat because he enjoys the manic episodes so much. These periods make him feel more creative and wonderfully happy. But the depression that always followed is horrible.\n\nTo pursue my degree, I had to move about 3 hours away, during a particularly dark period in my ex’s life. But he was living in a house with our friend group, including my BFF (F21), so he was getting support. My BFF and I were really close – we knew each other’s secrets, traveled together, and loved each other’s families – and she was a big support for me when my ex was struggling.\n\nThe ex’s depression got to a point that he was suicidal, and he quit working and going to school. I basically gave him an ultimatum; go with me to see a doctor and get back on meds or I was gone for good, because we were both so incredibly unhappy. That decision tore me apart, but I couldn’t watch him suffer any longer. I just couldn’t handle it, with the long distance, and I was at the end of my rope. He refused help, we broke up, and I didn’t hear from him again.\n\nBut my BFF told me that she was supporting him, they lived together after all, and he was doing okay. She understood why we broke up. It was just an unhealthy situation all around.\n\nA few months go by, I continue my studies, and BFF and I plan to attend a concert near her home. My ex will be gone for the weekend, so I can stay at our friend group’s house and see our fav musician. We had a great day, the concert was awesome, and we hung out at the house afterward. At the end of the night, everyone else was in bed, she told me that she was romantically involved with my ex. They had fallen in love, and “the heart wants, what it wants.” And she felt better now that I knew.\n\nI was shocked. She understood all of the pain and frustration I felt being with my ex, and she knew that I still loved him. I blew up. I felt betrayed. And I told her as much. We cried a lot, but she didn’t seem to understand why I was upset because I was no longer dating him. She offered to sleep in my ex’s bedroom that night and I could take her room, so I wouldn’t drive home at 2 a.m. I refused. She tried to hide my car keys. I demanded them back and left. I drove the 3 hours back home, crying the whole way, not sure where my relationship with BFF stood.\n\nI texted her early the next morning to let her know I was home, as promised. And I told her I needed time. I was hurt and this was a fucked up situation. I spent the next few weeks focusing on my coursework and hanging with my school friends, who are lovely.\n\nI decided to break up with my BFF. I love her but I can’t trust her, and I can’t be there for her when my ex’s depression comes around again. It would open too many old wounds. So when she emailed me to check in about a month later, I told her that I was fine, hoped she was okay as well, and that I was no longer interested in a friendship with her. She didn’t respond.\n\nI feel like I made the right decision – I’m just trying to protect myself. But it tore up our friend group. Some sided with her and him, and others with me. AITA for breaking up with my BFF?\n\nTL;DR: BFF started dating my ex, knowing all of the problems we had, and expected me to supportive of their relationship.",

      "description": "Hey. I'm 21f and she's 21f. We're both in college and I work two jobs because I'm paying my way. I've told her many times that I need to coordinate things in advance before we make plans (that means at least a week beforehand). Additionally, my gf and I took a break after 1.5 years last fall and got back together in January. Because of this, I was hesitant to make plans with her because I didn't really even know if we were going to be together for spring break. I was taking things slow.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I needed to put in my availability for one of my jobs. I asked her if she wanted to do something, and when I mentioned taking a two day trip to a nearby city, she didn't really want to spend the money for a hotel. I already had most of the week scheduled (working M/W at one job, coordinating the schedule for the other). I assumed we were discussing the weekend and thought I mentioned the weekend to her, but recently, I've learned she had no clue we were talking about the weekend. We ultimately decided to take a day trip to the town because anything else was too expensive.\n\nLast night, I mentioned that my grandparents were visiting on Thursday and Friday, something we've both known about for a while. I even asked her to take a tour of something with us on that Friday. Now, for my gf and I's plans, I took off the second Saturday of spring break, aka the day after the gparents leave. When I mentioned their visit, she got very upset and asked, \"Are we even going to do anything for spring break?!\"\n\nThis led to her getting incredibly mad at me for being busy, despite me asking her many times if she wanted to do something. She claimed that she assumed I would be sad if I didn't do anything with her, so that assumption made her cancel potential plans with someone else.\n\nI just - I feel incredibly guilty and like I ruined her spring break, but I also can't help but feel like I did as much as I could in this situation?",

      "description": "My sister has been furious with me recently about me voicechatting online with other people while she's studying. The walls between our rooms aren't well isolated so she claims she can hear every single word I say. She also says having PDD-NOS (a form of autism) on top of it makes it very hard for her to focus. I can't say much about the volume of my speech since I don't think it's loud, but she says it is. However, I'm willing to lower my voice when she's studying but that won't do. \n\nI agree that her education is more important than my entertainment, but I also think I can do things like this in my room in my free time. She refuses to get noise-cancelling headphones or earbuds (something that helps me preventing outside distractions with my ADD) and I don't have the impression she will change her mind anytime soon. What she does want is forbidding me to talk whenever she's studying every day. She does this in the middle of the day/evening which is also when I talk and she'll want me to be silent for four hours. \n\nI do have to mention that my calls are usually pretty lengthy. This is why it's inconvenient to interrupt a call only to continue it four hours later, or wait four hours with starting a call. Doing something else than talking in this time obviously is the best option and it's what she wants me to do, but this voicechatting is my only way of communication with my best friend. I can tell a whole story about it and I won't, but I don't find it reasonable to stop this daily habit for her while she refuses to do anything about it herself. \n\nSo my sister isn't the asshole here, but am I? Is it rude to talk when someone else is studying in another room?",

Although such late term abortion may not be right, that is not my burden to bear. I think it's a fucked up decision as you should know your choice long before then, but that's the mothers problem, not mine. \n\nThen she asked me, if it were my decision to have an autistic child or a late term abortion what would I choose? I, mind you, I was rather drunk, said something along the lines of \"well if human breed to natural selection the weaker child wouldnt last, so, if it were *my* decision I would say FUCK that kids life I can breed another one that ISNT retarded\"\n\nThen she asked me, what if it was *our* child, I said well then i would go along with your decision, if you wanted the autistic child I would give my 100% to raise it and give it the best life I could, having an autistic child is not the end of the world, but you just asked me, basically, if I had the choice of an autistic child or a normal one which would I choose. \n\nWell, fiance stopped talking to me for the night\n\nAm I the asshole for being so explicit about my political views?\nOr is she being rediculous by assuming I wouldnt be my own person about how I feel and then being offended by it?",

I've talked to her about it over and over again. We've been together 11 months. Was sexual from the start. But about 5 months in, I stopped. Reason being, and I've told her this, \"I'm not into it when I'm the only one who has to initiate. You have not once made a move on me, but you say you want us to do it.  Make a move on me. All you gotta do is touch it.\" To this day, she has never once groped me. I've explained to her that if I'm not in the mood and she is, she can stimulate me. I've given her permission and if I really don't want to, I'll tell her. But she still has never done it, but will still complain that we don't do it anymore. Her response to my point is, \"I don't really feel anything down there so I do it for you.\" (I've never had this problem before and don't know if this is a performance issue, or medical on her side. She had the same problem with her ex). Today she gave me this response, and I calmly told her, \"You don't do anything for me though. You complain and pressure me into sleeping with you, which consists of ME doing everything. You don't do it for me. You make me do it for me.\" That sentence made her storm off to the bedroom to mope or be angry with me. I don't know which. And I don't know if I should feel bad for it.",

      "description": "This happened to me in my early 20’s when I was a college student. My uncle was in his early 30’s at the time working as nurse. \n\nSo my uncle was making great money as nurse at the time but he had money issues. I wasn’t clear on what it was but I knew he had student loans, a car loan, and he played the slot machines. \n\nIt started small. He would go to those cheque cashing places and borrow a few hundred bucks for a cost of $20. One day he asked me if I’d rather make the $20 instead of the cheque cashing places. So I’d give him small $200-300 loans from my savings, and he’d pay me back within a week, with an extra $20. This went on for maybe months. \n\nOne day he found out I had a credit card with a $10,000 limit. He then introduced me to cash advances. Before this I had maybe ever had $500 in debt, max. So he offered me a deal: $10,000 now via cash advance in exchange for $30,000 over the next 4 years. We’d meet once a month and he’d give me about $600 to cover the loan. \n\nNow here’s where I feel at fault. Instead of using the $600 to pay off the loan, I’d instead make the minimum payment, and spend the rest. This lack of planning and responsibility completely backfired. Once my uncle paid back the original $10,000 he cut me off. \n\nOne thing I didn’t know was that he was going through bankruptcy at the time, and had a bankruptcy trustee. Sometimes he’d pay me in cash, sometimes in cheque. So basically he says “hey I’ve repaid you $10,000. We’re even. If you come after me for the rest, my bankruptcy trustee will make you pay back all of the cheques I’ve given you”. That was that. I still had roughly $10k in cash advance debt and no more payments coming in. \n\nI didn’t talk to him for years. Fast forward to 10 years later: he’s back in my life again and is doing well. He has a $50,000 car, and has a pretty good salary and lifestyle. I’m doing ok too but I’m still bitter about the whole situation. \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So for a little context:\n\nI am a (16f)  as is the person this post pertains to. The entire situation is complicated but basically I’ve been friends with this girl since we were both toddlers. As we grew up however, the friendship became more and more toxic for me to be in, especially as we both reached middle school. \n\nThis girl would constantly make snide remarks about me, indirectly but in front of me. To this day, she still does it. And it is not just me that she does it to either. She does it to all of her “friends”.  She’s just a generally toxic person to be around. Because of all this, our friendship has always been super back and forth. She’s angry at me over something at least once every few weeks, so this time didn’t seem any different. Boy was I wrong. \n\nShe recently got into a fight with some other girls, like a real physical fight. She lost the fight, and she knew it, yet when I said this, she got angry over it. She’s been angry for a few days now and she’s continuously insulting me and making stupid side comments. While annoying, it’s manageable and I can generally hold my temper about it. But more recently, the comments have started to dig a bit deeper about my weight and appearance, and this hurts because she knows how self conscious I am. \n\nShe acts like she’s untouchable but I know that I could absolutely ruin her life. The reason I am able to do so is, just this last December, I took her to a party with me. It wasn’t a big deal and I’ve took other friends to parties before but this time was different with her. She got super drunk and ended up losing her virginity to my cousin. This is common knowledge between my close circle of friends that used to include her and recently her behavior came into the topic of discussion. Someone suggested I text her mom and tell her all of what her daughter has been doing, and absolutely ruin this girl. \n\nWIBTA If i did this?\n\ntl;dr : i want to be petty and get revenge on someone by essentially tattling on them.

      "description": "I wanted to go to ross for over a month and have asked him multiple times if we could go together.  I wanted to buy household items since we live together and we can pick them out and he can help me carry. Ie more trashcans, bath towels, things we both need. He told me he hates ross, so I gave up.  I wasn't mad just a little sad I couldn't shop with him, but I understood as my dad also hated ross.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day he was hanging out with his best friend, we hung out after and saw she bought some stuff. Which I knew instantly she got from ross because she likes shopping there too.  I asked if he went with her to ross and he said yea.  I then got upset because he would always tell me no and told me to go by myself.  It just bugged me he put in the effort to go with her because she wanted to, (she had to buy new bedding because her dog peed in her old ones again) and yet he said no to me when I wanted to.  It just felt like he didn't want to put in the effort with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was hanging out with her because he was waiting for me to finish work since we carpool to and from home together.  He said he just went to kill time.  So I have this thought that since were a couple, we should understand each others wants/needs and not force him to do something.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm annoyed right now but not sure if I have the right to be annoyed.  I also could have gone to ross by myself or with his friend but I wanted to go with him to pick out stuff together.  I only got annoyed after knowing he went with her, he also went in the store instead of waiting in the car till she finished like he said he would do for me. ",

But my sister has a thing about alcohol and her mental breaks have the same reactions. She started talking about how my brothers ex is just guilt tripping him(has not happened for a while now so it's pointless to bring up) it was all on a public feed. My brother is trying to remain sober and I dont think this public drama is good for him and I tried to tell her this as politely as possible which is when she acted like an angsty teen saying I dont know or understand her(shes 34) and saying she cant stand talking to me. She is always saying how I can come to her and she loves me but this is more truthful to me. So I said she must be drunk(she has only ever acted this way intoxicated or in an overly emotional state) and to leave me alone but she kept going soni blocked her... aita..",

      "description": "Please don't mind the exposition I get into, it's just that I don't really know what to leave out without making this seem incomplete so I just left this long. Tl;dr at the end.\n\nThe friend (25f) (who I will refer to as R) and I (24f) met in University while I was living in Canada around 2013. We were in the same class and because her lab partner ended up dropping the class (which I don't blame her for, it was a fucking hard class😭) and we were both the only women in the class to wear the headscarf, I figured we would get to know each other anyway so I let her join our group.\n\nThat was a good idea on my part because she turned out to be interesting and funny and totally easy to hang out with.\n\nOur friendship blossomed real quick, we were practically sisters. \nWe were both the only girls in our families so it was as if we were filling an empty space. Even my mom, who never allowed me to have friends when I was young (and she certainly didn't allow me to have anyone to stay over) liked R. \n\nSo, fast forward to 2015, my mom decides to move back to the US, where we were originally, so I tell R I'm moving and she and I agree to keep contact.\n\n2016 rolls around and we make good on our promise. \n\n2017 comes and this is the year everything kinda falls apart. Potentially.\n\nNow, my brother is on Reddit, idk how often he uses it but he might get mad if he recognizes this story cuz it's kinda about him too. Sorry bro, but its important to me to get this question answered.\n\nAnyway, since we're Muslim, we don't date we just get married. So since I had a friend who was a young single Muslim lady, and I had 3 brothers who were also young and Muslim, my mom got some ideas.\n\nFor the most part, I thought it was a good idea to see if she was compatible with one of my brothers (namely the one who's 22, and here on Reddit) so I decided to arrange a little meeting between them and my parents. \n\nAll parties agreed.\n\nNow, my mom is kinda traditional in how she sees marriage. When she got married to my stepdad (who was in attendance) they talked like twice over the phone and then they were married.\n\nR didn't want that (shocking I know), she instead wanted to talk more to my brother and get to know what kind of person he was, in terms of religion and life goals. \n\nWhat she wanted wasn't too unreasonable, but my mom got slightly offended that she wasn't into marrying right away, so this meeting and all other protential meetings were soon called off. \n\nAfter this event, R didn't come around anymore. We talked on the phone like, once since then and my mom is convinced that this event was the reason she's avoiding me.\n\nI don't think it's that simple. \n\nSee, she was having alot of issues with her own family, in 2015 they came to Canada and they all took a trip somewhere and they forced her not to wear her headscarf. She was really upset about that. Plus, her family was giving her a hard time about other things too, so she was super stressed out.\n\nI think all these factors (her family, my family, me (I'd like to think I'm a pretty considerate person but who knows if I added to her stress)) kinda burnt her out and she needed time.\n\nSo I left her alone. I messaged her once in May to tell her happy Ramadan, and once in June to inform her that my grandmother died. I'm pretty sure I didn't even know if I told her about what else happened because 2018 was a rollercoaster for me and my family. \n\nI tried to contact her some months and months later but she never answered. I checked her Facebook to see how she's doing but there are no new posts. I even texted her once but nothing back.\n\nAt first I was like, \"she needs her space\", then my thoughts went to, \"does she hate me?\", after that they went back and forth from, \"am I a bad firiend?\" and, \"I'm such a terrible person who  never realizes how fucking stupid I am\", to, \"wtf she's not the only one going through shit! Why is she being selfish??\"\n\nNow I just think we no longer have any need to contact each other. \n\nI tried to keep contact. I tried to be considerate.\n\nNow I'm just tired.\n\nBut I still feel this guilt just eating away at me, so now I'm here to ask you internet.\n\nTl;dr I left my friend alone so she could deal with her shit but now, a long time later, she isn't answering my calls so I'm not going to bother contacting her again, AITA?\n\nPlease don't hesitate to tell me if this doesn't make sense.",

      "description": "So I live with 6 other housemates for college and we’re all dudes so sometimes it gets a bit hectic. This morning I was minding my own business and cooking myself some breakfast in the kitchen, kind of in the zone and not paying attention to what else was going on. All of a sudden, I got hit in the foot with a bottle of mostly empty orange juice, not enough to cause damage but enough to where I was pissed off in the moment. I immediately heard laughter, so I assumed it was on purpose to try and get some kind reaction out of me so I reacted and dumped what was left of the container (about a cup) down the sink. My friend is now really annoyed with me and other witnesses claimed I overreacted but in the moment I was pissed and it felt justified.\n\nFrom my friend’s perspective (we’ll call him Mike), it was a complete accident. From his perspective, he was just tossing it to our other friend (we’ll call him Rob) to put into the fridge. When Rob failed to catch it, it hit me in the foot. Of course, this was after Rob stated that if Mike were to throw the bottle (from a good 10 feet away) that he would not try to catch it. Personally, I think he could’ve just gotten up and walked to the fridge to put it away.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole? Should I buy Mike more orange juice or are we even?\n\n",

      "description": "I have been best friends with this one girl for almost 15 years. Same school. Same smallish town. Both only children.  We always used to call ourselves sisters. Our parents are very close friends, and we’ve taken vacations, spent holidays together, and know their extended family well. \n\nI went to college out of state, and have spent every summer since away interning or studying. We’ve only been able to see each other maybe four times a year. However, these catch-up times have been getting more and more off-putting. \n\nWhile I love college in a new environment and have really come out of my shell and found what I love to do, she goes to an in state college and absolutely hates it. She has no friends, hates her classes and major, hates her entire college and, according to her, is miserable all the time. The only thing in her life that she likes is her high school boyfriend who is going to college in a different state. Also, he’s a total asshole who has insulted my intelligence to my face in front of her multiple times, so it’s not really something that helps the situation. I’ve tried to be supportive and be there for her and offer advice, but she is just completely apathetic.\n\nPart of me hopes that all this misery that is going on is temporary and we’ll get back on our “sisters” vibe once she graduates, but I don’t know if I have that kind of time left. I will graduate this year and I will be moving across the country for work. In the mean time, I have been avoiding her during winter break because it is just not fun to talk to someone who says nothing except how everything is horrible and she hates her life.\n\nSo, AITA if I slowly ghost out of this friendship until I move away? \n",

      "description": "My grandmother stays with my SO and I every so often, she tries to do so monthly but it ends up being every 3 - 4 months or so. She stays a couple of nights, we have a small apartment so it means shes on our couch. It's been a few months since her last visit and me and my SO find her visits harder to deal with. She's a nice lady but we find her to be very overbearing and she is always making comments and asking the same questions and wants to know what we are doing every minute of the day. I can't use my phone without her asking me about what I'm doing on it, or watching over my shoulder. We do go out for the day when she visits, but my SO doesn't like to join us because he has a severe panic disorder. This always prompts dozens of questions, usually the same ones each time, where my SO has to explain that he is recieving treatment etc but his issues are pretty complex and are probably going to require years of rehabilitative therapy. \n\nWe're both beginning to dread her visits because it means she's in our personal space for a long period of time. I'm on the autism spectrum, so I probably find this kind of thing more overwhelming than the average person. She doesn't want to stay in a B&amp;B and the distance makes it difficult for her to only visit for one day. I can visit her, but I struggle a lot with being away from my home and my SO isn't able to join me. Am I the asshole here? She's started calling weekly trying to arrange her next visit, we've told her we're busy but she's accusing me of avoiding her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "(Writing this on mobile sorry) \n\nSo context time:\n\nMy (real) mom and dad split when I was about one. I lived with my mom up until I was about 4 and my dad met my stepmom when I was 3. They had my half sister when I was 4 and moved in together when I was 7. They got married when I was 13. Now, I am currently 18.\n\nI wouldn’t say I was really “abused” but my stepmom has basically been a pain in my ass since I started to leave my childhood innocence and blind obedience behind. I got severe depression and anxiety when I was 12. My depression honestly came out of nowhere. I sort of think it was because I hung out with some bad people and a lot of my friends were depressed but honestly I don’t know. I can’t completely blame my stepmom for this because she didn’t know I was depressed and how bad it made me feel. I would binge eat a lot during this time and would often eat leftovers in the fridge. My stepmom would yell at me that I didn’t ask, I was eating too much, or I ate her lunch. On days I felt really bad because of her yelling I wouldn’t eat anything so she would yell at me that I needed to eat something. Sometimes I would cry or talk to my dad and say I was sorry and that I didn’t mean to eat her food and such. My dad would sometimes tell her how I feel and she would come upstairs crying and telling me that I must hate her and blame her for my parents breaking up and that I make her cry and feel bad because I never talk to her, etc. She still does this to this day. She also tends to yell at me and my dad if he ever gets me anything. I used to go grocery shopping with him every weekend and I would get a couple things to hold me over for the week and she would get mad that I’m getting ‘expensive’ food. Even though I do check prices and just try to get enough food so I don’t starve as I get yelled at for eating anything at the house already. \n\nMy dad is always telling me how bad things when we talk. My dad and her both were supposed to have a plan where she pays for groceries and makes dinner and my dad pays the majority of the bills. Somehow though she spends all her money and then basically complains that she has no money to buy anything until my dad just says he’ll pay for it. He also gets angry that she basically gives my sister whatever she wants. Expensive clothes, shoes, furniture, even bought her a dog for her birthday last year that he DID NOT agree to. \n\nI have honestly tried so hard to get along with her but I literally feel like I want to die when I go home sometimes because of how she acts. I feel like an absolute asshole when I say it but I genuinely wish they would get a divorce because I love my dad so much and I just think it’s a shit show at home. \n\nSo what do you guys think? Am I the asshole? I want to hear people’s honest opinions. \nAlso let me know if you need more info! I was very sporadic when typing this and I’m sure there are many incidences I left out. ",

I will definitely get her a wedding present, but should I get her an engagement present too? \n\nShe said she doesn't care about receiving engagement presents, but my mum and partner both think I should - I don't know if my sister is just saying she doesn't care because she knows I don't have much money and she's trying to spare me the stress. As far as I know there will be no engagement party, and there will be travel + accomodation costs associated with the wedding - not sure if those details make a difference.\n\nObviously not a major conundrum, I mostly just want peace of mind regardless of whether I get an engagement present or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I live in two separate states in the US. She is currently in college, and I have a job. She will be in a nearby state for a school club activity, and I am planning on visiting there to support her. [She would be upset if I did not visit.] **She wants to split the expensive housing cost for the weekend.**\n\nSince she is in college, her meals, tuition, etc. are all paid for by her parents. She has a job on campus that pays for her housing and pays a stipend. She has more in her savings than I do, up to a factor of five. My job pays, not well, and my pay will be decreased next year. [Note: for career/personal reasons, it would be unwise to change jobs.] In the past two months, I have spent just under $1,000 in travel costs to visit her. This has, in part, led me to be in a tight financial situation until I can recover that loss back. She has spent about half of that to visit me last semester. Her busy schedule does not permit her to visit me this semester (mostly due to this club activity).\n\nIs it unreasonable for me to want her to pay for these housing costs? When I voiced my concerns about splitting the bill, she brought up her own concerns about not having enough in savings and how she hasn't been saving money recently. This feels frustrating to me, as she has far more in savings than I do, has a greater opportunity to save than I do, and has spent less on travel for us to be together than I have. \n\nThat said, it feels shitty for me to confront her with those thoughts. It seems accusatory and selfish, especially if she is already concerned about her own finances.",

I tried to help him since he actually asked in a public chat on Discord. I was going to suggest that perhaps there were too many apps or programs running at once and all that. The common stuff. Keep in mind this was a new computer which I think was an Acer Nitro 5. Apparently, it started getting slow 3 days ago. My knowledge of computers is quite scarce but I tried to suggest a few things to help and even help him with the mic when we got to that...\n\nI then asked him what he could’ve downloaded which he thought could’ve potentially been malicious. He just responded “…”. I was confused. He then told me the conversation was done and goodbye. I was extremely confused so I confronted his sudden anger. I’ve heard that he’s gotten angry before in the past over minor things. I then flipped and just told him to get fucked, that I was only trying to help. He then went on a rant about how YouTube is his only thing and how he doesn’t fit in with people. He even said he wanted to kill himself. \n\nI feel bad but I don’t know if I should at this point. I’ve thought about it a lot.

      "description": "My brother and I were getting Pizza from a local place. The most convenient parking space was directly opposite the pizza shop where some guys (maybe late teens early 20s) were chilling. I opened the door to make sure I was in the lines and noticed I wasn't. One guy pointed this out to me. I said cheers for helping and we went to get pizzas. I could already tell they were a bit pissed that I parked there (maybe the car lights were shining in their eyes or something?).\n\nWe got back in the car and I turned lights on (it was night). Some of the guys start making quite vulgar movements (pretty typical stuff like middle finger and thrusting etc). One of the guys starts shouting something through my brother's window (not sure what but pretty sure it wasn't flattering). This really annoyed me, so I opened my brother's window a little bit and said \"you lot are very sad mate\". At this point, the guy opens the door on my brother's side whilst I'm reversing out of the parking space. I then proceed to say \"wow, you opened the door. That showed us!\". Luckily, nothing further happened but reflecting on it now, I think I may have put my brother in harms way unnecessarily. I had no idea how far they would escalate the situation (admittedly I escalated it as well). Not that my brother can't take care of himself. In my mind I thought I'd just point out that their behaviour was immature, but they may have responded violently. That would have put them in the wrong but my poor judgement may mean I'm also in the wrong here. I leave it to you guys as my mind is a mess right now (I have arguments and literally shake during/after them). I have already apologised to my brother as I should probably have just left.\n\nTo clarify, if it had got violent I would obviously step in and take the beating.",

      "description": "It started awhile back at a youth group weekend me, the \"long-time\" friend (L) and the \"new\" friend (N) all attended. Before this weekend I had never met N but we basically ended up having to drive up together with how the carpooling worked out.  We ended up hitting it off really well on the ride. L and N really never interacted apart from maybe a quick sentence here and there that weekend. I didn't think much of it at the time.\n\nThe week after, N and I hung out often because we got along really well. At youth group the next week I was social with both and L realized then that an actual friendship had formed between N and me.\n\nAs such the next day L took me aside and told me that N had 'wronged' his sister, that it was a very serious thing that really 'damaged' his sister and she did seek therapy. I had only known his sister for around half a year and apparently this was all well before I met her. However, out of respect for his sister's privacy he wouldn't go into any detail about what happened. Just that N was terrible and that I shouldn't associate with him as that is supporting someone who did an 'evil' act and not the victim (the sister).\n\nI told him that I was sorry to hear that all happened but since I was a complete outsider to this incident and didn't know really any of the details that I don't feel comfortable just abandoning N especially when we get along well and I literally have no idea what is going on and would prefer to stay neutral due to that.\n\nTwo things of note is that while the sister was somewhat standoffish at times, her and N were many times friendly and would chat at group events and online with each other. I doubt L was lying to me though because I do know that his father was not happy with them interacting due to a 'past incident'. I actually heard the father say this to other adults at church. FTR I don't know the sister's actual feelings on the subject though that to this day they continue to be cordial.\n\nI did make an effort to not hang out with them together due to this. The only time we all would interact was at church or other social events anyone could attend. At those everyone was civil but because I would interact equally with both L wasn't happy. I severely doubt that L's actions were out of jealousy and I do believe that something probably did happen in the past which caused the animosity.\n\nBasically in the end due to this and some other irrelevant issues L and my friendship ended. No big fight or anything but he did feel betrayed. N and I aren't close due to distance and I never asked him what happened due to feeling it wasn't my business.\n\nStill, every now and then I get that nagging feeling that I should have had L's back and trusted him on this instead of putting his feelings aside for a new friend who I really didn't know that well. I don't know if this would have salvaged a friendship but there are times I wonder \"what if.\" So reddit AITA?",

This is the first bridal shower I've ever gone to and I actually had to google what a bridal shower even is (and I'm still not really sure?)\n\nAnyways. My bf's sister is getting married and her bridal shower is next month. Over Christmas this last year I made sugar cookies with royal icing and shared with bf's family. They enjoyed it so his other sister (not the one getting married, she's the MOH and setting up the bridal shower) asked me if I could make some sugar cookies for the bridal shower. I agreed. Now I am no professional baker/cookie decorator. The cookies I made at Christmas was actually the first time I've ever decorated cookies, so I am still pretty slow and clumsy at all of it. I estimate that the 30 cookies she asked me to make will take maybe like 6 hours total to bake and decorate?  \n\nSo my question is, WIBTA if I treated these sugar cookies as my present to the bride instead of purchasing a present off the registry? Or should I still plan on bringing a present since it wasn't the bride that asked me to bake these?",

      "description": "Note this is a throw away and the story spans a coupe of years.\n\nOne night in college my friends threw a small party in their dorm. Friend A and B live in the dorm with others, but only friend A and B matter here. Friend A's girlfriend at the time came down to visit and party with friends (were all friends from highschool). Dorm ends up pretty filled with people, everyones drinking. A's girlfriend ends up drinking too much and you can tell she's about to start crying. I don't remember where A was or what he was doing, but I decide to rush A's girlfriend off to one of the rooms to calm her down, the tears are flowin' at this point. I sit her down and give her the whole \"its fine, your just drunk\" routine but the valves are open now and the tear ducts are operating on full throttle. She starts spilling her guts. Secrets I didn't need or want to hear.\n\nAmong many unrelated things, she told me that she had cheated on A and that she was thinking of breaking up with him for various reasons. She made me promise not to tell A and said that she would tell him soon. Some time passes she stops crying and we leave the room. More time passes and I pull A into a room privately and told him that his girl was thinking of breaking up with him and I gave him the reasons why. Basically just made and broke my promise to her in the span of 10 minutes. But I withheld the part where she cheated. We talk about it and leave the room.\n\nA month later, she tells him and to the best of my knowledge, it really sucked for him. They continue to date.\n\nNow the part that matters. Fast forward two years. We are all partying at a friend B's house. A and his girl have recently split up. At some point I have told A that she had told me she cheated before she told A. Nothing had really come of it at this point. A and I have talked about their relationship many times and I feel like everything was covered. At the party I announce that I'm going to go to the driveway to smoke, friend B follows. Somehow friend A comes up as a topic of discussion. B lets slip that another friend (friend who knew everything before anybody else) isn't at the party because everyone was upset that he had not told friend A about his ex-girlfriends secrets ( the ones regarding cheating and drama) when it was all occurring (mind you he was the girls best friend). I noted that I didn't tell A about it when I knew because I was asked to keep it a secret and maybe he was doing the same. B says that A was upset with me because of it but I atleast told A that she was thinking of breaking up with him. B tells me that it was a shitty thing to do and then said in a demanding voice \"You need to apologize to him!\" (keep in mind A and B have been friends since they were kids). I didn't like the way he said that to me, so I'm now pretty insulted and say \"Okay, lets go do this right now\". I find him in the middle of the party (he's really drunk) I ask \"Are you mad at me about \\*girl\\* ?\". He replies something along the lines of \"not really mad but I was upset about it\". I think the party kinda swept him away before I could apologize, so I don't think I ever really apologized. But all the times I've seen him after that we seem to be fine. We talk like always and share more interests now then we ever did before.\n\nLater on I found out that everyone in the friend group thought that I had a thing for A's girlfriend for various reasons (I did not have a thing for her). I don't know if thats important information here.\n\nSo AITA that B seems to have made me out to be for not telling A about his girlfriend cheating?\n\nWe've all been good friends and I never intended to hurt A by withholding information. This is all water under the bridge now, nobody seems to bring it up (to the best of my knowledge), but it's been eating away at me for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "We're all 19/20 years old.\n\nMy 'friend' is/was my best friend, but I don't call her that because my girlfriend has easily surpassed that now and it feels wrong. I've been dating my girlfriend for about 7 months. She's had 2 ex boyfriends. This is my first serious relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've know my friend for 4 years. After a few months I developed a crush that was on and off for \\~1 year. She lives interstate and my crush was only apparent when I saw her which was rare, otherwise I felt nothing. The feelings were mutual but we didn't know until she admitted it \\~2 years into the friendship. At this point I was over my feelings so we talked about it and both agreed nothing would happen. This was well before I met my girlfriend. Nothing has changed and if anything it has made us better friends - it's isn't awkward at all. Our relationship has always been based on friendship, my intention was never to get in her pants or be with her, it was a harmless crush. We've never even so much as kissed or flirted with each other. Our conversations essentially just consist of general conversation or asking for advice/ranting about things, and we only talk a few times a week. She's a big part of my life, but not my day to day life.\n\nEarly into the relationship with my girlfriend I told her briefly about the situation because it was relevant to something and I thought nothing of it. In hindsight that was pretty stupid but what's done is done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's an awkward situation and I'd feel uncomfortable if it was reversed and I'm not saying her feelings are invalid, but I literally find it unfair the way she compares it. She views my friend as an ex. She said it's the same as if she was still friends with her ex, or *even a guy she hooked up with.*\n\nI just think it's bullshit because we've never had a romantic, or sexual connection and we have no romantic feelings attached to any shared memories. I can' fathom how this is the same as being friends with an ex and I'm upset she even compared it to that because I feel like she can use this as justification for getting back in contact with someone like that.\n\nI've NEVER prioritised my friend over my girlfriend and never will. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not understanding, and disagreeing heavily with, her point of view?",

      "description": "So here's a little backstory. About two months ago I made a joke to my friends about going home and crying because of how depressed I am. This is not factual and was a joke, but apparently this joke was very convincing because from that point on my friends are constantly asking how I'm doing and being hypersensitive around me. At first I shrugged it off, but as two months came and went it has gotten extremely annoying. I have told my friends that am I fine and do not have serious problems with my mental health again and again to no avail. I have class with my friends (Let's call them Mark and Jan) on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It is a pretty chill class, so we usually chat while painting, but as it is now finals week and we have two full paintings due in a week so I have been busting my ass to finish them both.  Now you're caught up here is what happened.\n\nSo I get to class early and pop in my headphones and start working. Mark and Jan show up and I say hi, Mark proceeds to analyze how I said hi and come to the conclusion that I am in a deep depression. I tell them yet again I am fine and continue to work. We chat a little here and there but I am mainly just working and listening to music. The class ends we all leave, I say bye and I'm off. Later that night, I get a text from Jan saying \"How are you.\" This is weird because I and Jan don't talk very much out of class due to the fact that we are mainly friends because we both are friends with Mark. At this point I know that the text has ulterior motives than just wanting to chat so I say \"I'm good Jan and I just want to say that I am not seriously depressed, I am not planning on commiting suicide or any other form of harm against myself or others and never will and I am tired you both you and Mark constantly asking me how I'm doing.\" She immediately texts back and says \"I know and I was just wondering.\" and never says anything else. So now I'm here wondering Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "For context, I live in America and work for a crappy little retail store.\n\nOne of my colleagues (Matt) has recently had a baby with his gf. Both the mum and the dad are in the early 20s and don't have family living nearby.\n\nLast week when Matt came to work he was pretty stressed that his gf didn't want him to leave. He said she was constantly calling him and trying to guilt him into coming home. I tried to offer him my shift the following day so we could swap but she got even more annoyed.\n\nEventually he told her he needs to work and she was okay by herself. She the proceeded to call him and tell him she had cut herself and he needed to come home.\n\nI gave him a lift home and in the car he broke down. I asked if he was going to be okay, saying I could help and he asked me to come in.\n\nWe got to the house and I told her if she wanted me to leave I would go but I wanted to see if she was okay and offer any help. The baby was crying at the time and she was ignoring him so I asked her permission to pick the baby up. She said yes so I calmed him down while they talked. Matt calmed her down and got the baby a bottle. I fed the baby. I said again to his gf if she wanted me to leave I would. She said no it was okay.\n\nI told her she was incredible for having the baby etc and kept complementing her so she felt a bit better. I stayed maybe an hour until the baby was settled and Matt had control of the situation.\n\nMatt came in to work recently, said she is doing much better but she was mad at me, for touching her baby and offering to help with the baby. (I told her if she needed anything to call me and I'll be there for them, then told her if she needed a break or anything I could help babysit).\nShe told Matt I didn't give her much of a choice which I disagree with. Matt defended me and told her he asked me to help but I feel guilty.\n\nAITA for going over? Should I have? I feel like what I did was right as we didn't know how bad she had hurt herself etc at the time but I'm really paranoid now that I've heard I upset her.",

      "description": "I live with my parents and they had no idea this was going to happen. They’re very strictly against drinking, too. I get that I shouldn’t have invited her over to drink if they’re against it, but I’m also underage and there’s nowhere else we could go. I also thought it was going to be harmless fun (I was wrong). \n\nI invited her over and we decided to get drunk. We never talked about how far we could go. She comes over, we drink a bit, I get just a bit tipsy, and she keeps cranking open new bottles. At some point, I told her I’m not comfortable with her drinking more, she kept drinking. It was at a point where I literally had to physically restrain her from drinking. \n\nNow the other thing is, she has really bad mental health issues. She takes a shitton of sleeping pills normally, like 10-15 a day, and when she does, she sometimes threatens suicide and starts talking about really horrible things in her past incoherently. Basically does things she then wakes up regretting. “Drunk” talking, I suppose. \n\nNow I’m saying this insinuate that she knows how she gets when really drunk and yet she still did it. At my house. With my mom home. Even though I clearly told her she can’t know about it. She had a full-on mental breakdown, kept crying loudly, saying “I’m worthless” over and over again. I held her until she slept. Now she’s sleeping in my room, keeps waking up every once in a while and starts saying random shit. I had to make up a lie and tell my mom that it was the pills because she heard her. I’m extremely embarrassed and couldn’t sleep (I also have to wake up tomorrow and get some shit done, which she knows about) because I’m worried she’s going to bother my mom or do something to herself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I called her out? Or shall I just pretend it’s all good because of her mental health? ",

As a general \"he has a right to know\" I let him know how I felt, but after that whenever I was around he passionately flirt with his girlfriend in front of me, including at my own house. I was fully prepared to just be friends, but that doesn't mean it hurt any less. One day he did something to provoke me, and I snapped. Between how I had been feeling and what he was doing, I walked to the train tracks and waited for a train, whether I was on or under it I didn't care. Eventually, it came forwards that his girlfriend had been cheating on him, and I was turned to by the friend group for his emotional support. Just as I was trying to leave his life he needed me, so I helped him. We became friends again, but he kept doing flirty things like trying to hold my hand and be close to me. Even when I tried to hang out *as friends* he either blew me off or tried being flirty.He tried acting like nothing happened, but I was having none of it, so I stopped contact with him. Summer break blows by and school comes again. He tries being my friend, **again acting like nothing happened**, but I am completely ignoring him. I was told his parents had a drunken falling out, and he's in a rough spot, but if I'm being honest I don't even want to acknowledge his existence. AITA?",

      "description": "My best friend of 15 years, and the best man at my wedding, \"Donny\" \\[32m\\] is super fun to hang out with, and is usually up for anything.  We've gone on countless adventures together - sailing, backpacking, camping, ATVing, lan parties (showing our age!), motorcycle trips, canoe camping, etc. \n\nThe problem is, he's never really gotten his shit together.  He hasn't held a job for longer than a year, and has lived no less than 20 places in his life.  After his girlfriend of 9 years cheated on him, got pregnant during the fling, guilted him into being the father while debating an abortion, then had a miscarriage... he decided to finally seek professional help, and end that relationship.  He's been diagnosed with depression/ADD/alcoholism/anxiety and is taking prescribed medication to work through those issues.\n\nTo make matters worse, for the past few years he's been living with his narcissistic mom. But it's okay because she's a  changed woman, and now dishes out cutting remarks with a smile and a soft voice.  Donny thinks she can be annoying, but not \"all that bad.\"\n\nI strongly disagreed, and after working though my own issues with narcissists, I wanted to help him get out of that environment and start a life of his own.  He had been making such good progress seeking help and going on medication I thought she was the last thing holding him back.  \n\nHe's never actually lived on his own.  He's always lived/been supported by other people, including his mom and me in the past.  After I lived alone in a private seasonal campground for a month to get my own head on straight about some issues I was dealing with, I thought how great of an opportunity it would be for him to live there full time.  He could buy a camper for 5-7k, and pay $1500 in rent each year for the plot.  Cost of living would be extremely low ($125 rent/month - plus food, electricity and propane).  It's filled with friendly blue-collar workers who leave their campers there year round and treat it like a vacation cabin.  They are all having a blast, drinking, socializing, telling tall tails, driving around in golf carts, etc.  It's just a fun place to be, and an upgrade from his only other realistic option - a trailer park.  The mood at a trailer park is different I'd think... most people live there out of necessity not desire, and that probably wouldn't help him with his mental health.\n\nHe thought the camper/campground was a great idea so I helped him pick out an old 26 foot camper, inspect it (surprisingly good shape), talk the seller down ($1200 to $800) and borrow a friends truck to tow it home.  He paid for it of course.  I told him he could live in it at my house as long as he paid his own electricity and didn't barge in to our house without first calling/texting.  The plan was for him to live in it, fix it up, then sell it and upgrade to a better 5-7k camper and ultimately move into a seasonal campground.  (They have restrictions on age/condition of the campers they let in.)  We set an August 1st 2019 move out deadline (about a year).\n\nDuring this time my wife and I were planning our honeymoon - sailing around the Virgin Islands.  Then Hurricane Irma hit, destroying everything on the islands.  We decided on Costa Rica for our honeymoon instead.  The charter company in the Virgin Islands could only give credit rather than a refund, so we planned to go the following year.  (Quick note, we are not rich and these two trips were very expensive for us.  We had only budgeted for one.)  I suggested that we turn it into a trip with friends since plane tickets were only $400 round trip.  Since we had already paid for the boat, it wouldn't cost any more to bring a few people along.  So we invited Donny and my wife's friend \"Sarah\".  Both single, but they didn't hit it off.  They only had to buy plane tickets, and pay their own expenses like food, taxis and souvenirs - we would cover the \\~4k boat rental.\n\nThey were invited in April, and we planned to fly there in December - 8 months later.  I kept everyone updated by email with itineraries and estimated personal costs as I planned out the trip.\n\nAt some point during all of this, Donny has moved into his camper at my house, begins reverting to old ways, stops showing up for his full time job, and gets fired.  He picks up a part time job where he has the option to work 40 hours a week, but can work as much or as little as he wants.  He of course picks the latter.  I'm beginning to suspect that he won't have enough money for the trip so I ask him about it.  He assures me he will have enough and all is good.  He already bought the plane tickets.\n\nSo we fly out of cold ass Wisconsin and into the tropics.  Everyone is in high spirits, I mean, how can you not be?  We get to our rental sailboat, a 2017 Jeanneau 349, and it's a fucking dream boat.  We set sail and go from island to island, sleeping in the boat.  It's amazing.  Dolphins, white sandy beaches, perfect weather, beach-side restaurants, 85 degree water, snorkeling, you name it.  Then it happens.  **The ambush.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDonny - waiting until my wife and Sarah are off the boat - \"I'm out of money, I didn't realize how expensive everything was going to be... is there any chance you can spot me until we get back?  I'll pay you back, I promise\".\n\nNow I'm between a rock and a hard place. If I say no, he can't get home.  If I say yes, I may not be able to pay my own bills when we return, and might never get paid back.  Nothing good can come from this conversation.  \n\nI gave in however, and asked him how much he needed.  After some hemming and hawing, he said $100 should cover everything.  Ok.  Borrowed him $100 - in cash.\n\nNot two days later he's out of money again.  I'm pissed.  I tell him tough luck and the three of us go enjoy the day while he sleeps on the boat.  Paradise gets me back into a good mood though, and I start to feel bad.  *Yeah... I know.*  If he can't pay the ferry ride back, or the taxis, he's stranded in the Virgin Islands.  *This alone would make for a good AITA post if I just left him there*... but I begrudgingly decide borrow him money for the rest of the trip.  On the bright side, Sarah is having no problem paying her own way throughout the trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we get back home I don't really talk to him much.  The trip, amazing as it was, has an underlying shitty feel to it all.  I feel taken advantage of and it bothers me that he, my best friend of so many years, was so selfish and entitled during the trip of a lifetime.  Captain obvious senses something is wrong and texts me that he will pay me back this weekend.  Weeks go by and nothing.  I confront him.  Turns out, he wasn't even keeping track of what he owed me!  Thank fuck I was - $373 just for the trip!!\n\nI pull up his electric bills for the camper.  I charge him $0.13/kWh, send him monthly emails \"bills\" with pictures of the Kill-A-Watt meter, and allow 30 days to pay.  He's 90+ days late and hasn't paid anything. $115 behind.  Reminders answered with silence.  **It's the final straw, I'm fed up and go into asshole mode.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI forward the electric bill emails, and tell him he has 5 business days (Tuesday) to pay all late bills in full, or I'll disconnect his electric service.  I also add a $20 late fee to all future bills that become late.  Weather forecast is for 20F at night.  No electricity = no heat and frozen/broken water lines.  I hear nothing back.\n\nI have a face to face with him and express my general frustration about the trip, owed money and overdue electric bills.  He does his best to act sorry and promises to make things right.  I don't mention that I'm going to disconnect the power, but it was in the emails sent days earlier.\n\nA few days later I invite him over for dinner, mostly to get the pictures he took on his phone during the trip.  He said he'd upload them, but was clearly dragging his feet with misc half-truths.  I **never** bring up that I'm killing the electric on Tuesday unless he pays just the late electric bills.  Unprompted, he says something like \"I'll pay you for the electric bills on Tuesday or Wednesday.\" \n\nHe knows he won't get paid until Wednesday.  I know he won't get paid until Wednesday, but he doesn't know that.  I still plan to pull the power Tuesday if he hasn't paid, but instead of saying that, I just say \"Ok.\"\n\nIronically, the Kill-A-Watt meter fails a few hours later, killing his power.  15A heater + fridge + computer overloaded it.  He offers to pay for a new one (about $15) and I plug him back in unmetered.\n\nTuesday rolls along, and at 5pm I text him telling him I'm disconnecting the power in an hour unless all overdue electric bills are paid in full.  The following conversation ensues over text:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Donny:** \"You couldn't have told me this yesterday?  I told you I'm gonna pay it tomorrow\" \\[Wednesday\\].\n\n**Me:** \"It was in both emails.\"\n\n**Donny:** \"That's great.  Yesterday I told you I'm paying them all off, you didn't say anything\"\n\n**Me:** \"You say a lot of things.\"\n\n**Donny:** \"What's that supposed to mean exactly?\"\n\n *- 10 minute pass -* \n\n**Donny:** \"Fine, I'll say it, my word means nothing to you.  I understand, rocky history, what do you want from me then?  An email?\"\n\n *- 5 minutes pass -* \n\n**Donny:** \"I don't think I've made an email since high school lol\"\n\n *- 30 minutes pass -* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI disconnect his power at the breaker.  He drove off 5 minutes after that without saying a word, probably to go back to his mom's house for the night, or cry to our mutual friend about how he's been wronged.\n\n24 hours later he said he'd be over at 7:30pm to pay his bill.  He showed up at 9:30pm acting like everything was all good and paid $200 - stating the extra money can go towards what he owes on the trip.  I tell him since the Kill-A-Watt meter failed, in a few days I'",

      "description": "Throwaway, for obvious reasons. Very long post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, a year ago, I escaped a really abusive (physically, sexually, emotionally, you name it) relationship and the healing process was quite long - and since I had to work at trusting people again and through my sexual trauma, I could not let anyone close to me for months. At some point during spring, I meet this guy - say, Alex - who is quite obviously interested in me and keeps on asking me out, but I never say yes. In the meantime, I tried something with another person, it crashed and burned and fucked me up some more, Alex also apparently was dating someone (he even awkwardly said it to my face in a very victorious manner while it was going on), so, okay.\n\nSince my work implies doing business trips abroad a couple of times a year, on one of these trips I really fell in love with someone else, let's call them Peter, but nothing happened even though there were hints it had been mutual, because they live on a different continent and I knew that if I'd never see this person again I'd lose it. I go back home, feel lonely as fuck (variety of reasons) and Alex suddenly pops back into the picture and I cave in and go out with the guy without doing anything other than spending time, as keep on chatting with Peter almost daily over WhatsApp and the hints continue to be there. One of those days, Alex literally asks me if I want to be his girlfriend in a very awkward way - I wasn't feeling it, so I explained to him that I had a bad relationship in the past &amp; that I still have issues I have to solve with myself, from anger issues to trust issues, so I was unprepared. Which is absolutely true, but I omitted to say that I had fallen in love with someone else - because at that point it seemed absolutely impossible and little more than a fantasy for something to happen with Peter. Bottom line, what I obsessively repeated in that conversation and in future ones was the following: that I'd rather not do anything because I was afraid that my actions would end up hurting him.\n\nAlex seemed to accept what I'd had told and we struck a deal to continue seeing each other as friends, although he wasn't fair about his side of the deal, and he continued to put pressure on me to meet up, or he would offer to run minor errands for me which I wouldn't pass up, plus, he's a really nice guy and a good conversation partner, so we kept on seeing each other, but the tension was there. One evening he asked the question again and put pressure - I started crying (in frustration over what I perceived as my inability to be happy and to accept someone's feelings) and apologized for being unable to reciprocate, yet I told him that I would be really fucked up if I spend the night alone, so I invited him to my apartment. We just slept, but a few evenings later the whole thing happened again, and since I felt extremely lonely and vulnerable, I caved in to his insistence and we slept together. In the meantime, Peter had stopped answering my messages for a couple of days, so I was all the more inclined to do this. Alex and I spent the next day and night together having a lot of (well, mediocre) sex, and I was supposed to leave the country again for business. Before departing, Alex and I convened that any serious discussion about what was happening between us would take place after my 2-week trip. Anyway, there were certain things that were strange about him - such as his describing one night stands (and relationships) as a means to \"fill the void\", wtf.\n\nWhen I arrived at the city, Peter unexpectedly wrote to me and apologized, saying that he had been on a different trip and that his phone had been stolen. He told me that was also going to attend the event I was at - and, in short, after he arrived we hit it off after we recognized that both had fallen in love with each other before even touching. We had an amazing week together and we decided to stay together because we truly feel that we have a very powerful connection, and that we'll overcome the distance, in time. So, I had to call Alex  (who had sent me very awkward messages throughout the week with boring details about his routine)  once it was clear that I and Peter were an item, so I broke it to him. Alex reacted in a pretty self-entitled way and asking for a lot of explanations, implying that I was lying, or asking me if I was now to move to a different country, etc. I sort of felt that his reaction was like that because I was supposed to \"fill the void\" after he had done so many \"Niceguy TM\" things. I began to cry and was only able to tell him that I was sorry, that we hadn't had a conversation and that I'd warned him that there was a chance I'd hurt him, and that it pained me to know that I had done that. \n\nThat was it. Alex and I haven't spoken since. AITA for doing any of these things to Alex, from the omission part to the sleeping with him part? At the same time, I'm blissfully happy with Peter, even considering the difficulties, and I think he really loves me for who I am - not what purpose I could serve to him. And it's 100% reciprocal. Help me out with this, I feel remorseful every day.",

      "description": "My husband and I are both mid 50’s and have taken an early retirement (long story but both basically forced to take early retirement.)  Shortly after doing so, we moved to property we had in the country and started a homestead. I grew up on a farm and tried to tell my husband how hard farm life was but he either didn’t understood how serious I was or underestimated the workload.  My husband is not a “manual labor” type of person. That is left for me to do, which I am fine with.\n\nWhat I was not prepared for was the increase in price for just about everything in the country. Electricity, internet, heating, trash service, gasoline (we live far from everywhere so we spend $300 a month easily in gasoline) is so much more expensive here than in the suburbs.  We also have a son getting married (paying for a small part of this) and another on his last semester of college that we are paying for. \n\nMy husband is a retired police officer. Last year he went back to work because we could no longer afford our retiree insurance.  (It was $1900 a month for me, my husband and our college-age son.)  His new job is a $10 an hour position as a courier for a large medical group. It’s boring, the hours suck, it’s a 1 hour commute each way, he’s miserable and he hates it.  The only benefit is the extra $1100 a month he brings home and all 3 of us have paid insurance coverage included in his benefits package. \n\nRecently he went to a job interview as a security guard. When he got there they told him it was a part time position instead of full time. It is a much closer work place so we would save some money on gas, and it starts at $15 an hour but only 2 nights a week. And no health insurance, which means we will have to go back to paying $1900 a month for insurance.\n\nI pay the bills. I know there is no way we can make ends meet by losing $500 a month in income and paying an additional $1900 for insurance.  I’m fine with going to work myself but as I said earlier, my husband isn’t a manual labor type person.  That’s all i do here.  I wake up, feed all the livestock, clean out barns, take care of 12 dogs (10 of them dumped on us since we’ve been here), work in the garden, purchase and haul all feed, take care of the livestock, repair barns / buildings, laundry, dishes, clean house, and most recently try to get our cabin updated (included some building, reroofing and repainted) so it can be listed on Airbnb.  If I’m not here, no one will do these jobs.  I know he won’t because the few times I’ve left overnight, he complains constantly about having to fill in for me. I told my husband that if he took this job, i was no longer paying the bills. I’m tired of getting anxiety every month over trying to pay the bills we have.  He says I’m being unsupportive of him and only see him as a paycheck.  Am I being the jerk?  I don’t know what else to do!!",

I just got a call from my grandpa asking me to come help and while I wasn't rude I was audibly frustrated because that means I have to push back an x-ray for a possible fractured heel I've been limping on due to an injury I suffered at work. I just called my mom to complain to her and she seemed to not be on my side, and told me that she gave her day off yesterday to help and that they really need it.

      "description": "(Moible) So for a year I've  been going to the gym in my high school trying to lose all the weight I've gained over the 18 years of my life. There I met my friend C. C was very nice to me and we got to know each other a lot over the time we worked out together to becoming friends outside of the gym. She is one of my best friends and we have known each other now for about a year.\n\nSo enough backstory to the problem, when C and I use to work out together she would always jokingly say if she ever were to gain weight rapidly i should slap her and wake her up to work out again as she has regressed before. Which always made no sense to me as C always had such a great body I mean athlete good. So I couldn't imagine her in any other way however over the past few weeks she has stopped going to the gym at all. I didn't think anything of it at first but as time went on she kept on eating more and more. She is now to the point of having a double chin is she looks down. And her figure is all but gone she always took pride in her health and I just dont understand what's happening.\n\nI dont believe it's anything serious such as depression as I am with her nearly all the time and we talk constantly either on phone or at each other's houses, so I would like to think I would know if anything that serious is happening in her life. I have gotten very close to her and I dont want to do anything offensive such as remark on her weight (you know that whole never talk about a women's body thing) and as a guy I would feel to awkward to do it myself. But what if she was serious and she is regressing and needs a wake up call from someone. I feel if she realizes it herself she might get mad at me for not saying anything.\n\nI dont know if this important but I don't make friends easily and only have about 5 friends total so even if this is the right thing to do I would rather not lose a friend in the process if that accounts for anything. Would I be an asshole for mentioning her rapid weight growth.\n\nTLDR: C my friend is gaining weight rapidly and told me before to tell her and wake her up if that happens should I say something or would that make me an asshole.",

      "description": "This has been on my mind for a while now and I need some input on it. This happened about three weeks ago now, my boyfriend of a little over a year has been wanting to get a nose ring for a while now and he asked me what I thought about it. I told him the honest truth that I didn’t really find them that attractive, and that I would prefer if he didn’t get one. I could tell that what I said hurt him a little because he was really looking forward to it, but he told me if I didn’t like it he wouldn’t get one.\n\nThe next day I told him I felt bad about it and that if he wanted to get one it was his own decision, but he kept replying that he didn’t want to do anything to his body that I would find unattractive. I still feel horrible about it like I was too controlling over what he wants to do, but the thing that makes me feel worse about all of this is that I’m so relieved that he is not getting one. I just want him to be happy though and I feel like I really messed things up by telling him that. ",

      "description": "Using a throwaway for this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been working for about 4 years now, as an adult. I've maintained 3 retail jobs, and in each one of them I've had trouble with the authority. I just never seem to get along with management. My first job I'm willing to let slide as me being stupidly inexperienced and new to the working world, but I'm not sure what to think of the latest 2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI worked at a large retail store, and had issues with one of my direct supervisors (below department manager). She never really went out of line, seemed to be pretty decent at her job. There was one incident where I needed painkillers for a headache, as I worked out in the sun in a very, very hot town during the summer, for 8 hours a day. I made a trip to the break room to get some from my bag, but before I could get there she stopped me. Asked what I was doing, I replied. She insisted that I simply ignore the headache and get back out on the parking lot and do my job. Ultimately, that headache got worse and I ended up leaving early.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI held a grudge against her ever since that day, and never got along with her. Partially by choice. I flat out refused to forgive her and constantly talked shit about her with my coworkers, told a number of people how much I didn't like her, and was obstinate and stubborn about any instruction given from her. I did my job, but I was an asshole about it if instructions came from her. Just from one issue that I never let go of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I quit that job and found another one, different retailer, I had a similar problem right off the bat. Job was unloading a truck at 4AM, until noon. I made an effort to get along with every member of management and every supervisor, but it became clear that most of them had no respect for the lower employees. Or at least, none for me. It felt like it was just me. One of them was respectful and pleasant with teaching me the job and the way things worked, but he left for somewhere else shortly after I was hired. His replacement was, in my opinion, a royal bitch. According to the rest of management she was good at the job and did it well. But it seemed to me, that all she ever did was belittle us, tell us to hurry up, that we're too slow, that we're wasting time, that I wasn't learning. She singled me out a few times. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver a couple of weeks 2 other new guys started in the same job. I worked alongside them, but evidently, I wasn't doing the job very well. I wasn't pushing heavy boxes fast enough, I wasn't listening to instructions. I did my best, which I can honestly say. I worked quickly, I made effort to memorize where boxes went and how things were displayed so I could get stuff off the truck and into the back of the store ASAP. I genuinely tried. But it was never enough. Eventually she singled me out and yelled at me in front of all the other workers, telling me I didn't listen and she had to repeat herself and she was pissed off. I wasn't having it. I defended myself, with some temper. She wrote me up for insubordination. The guy who hired me talked to me about it, said she was the authority and I had to listen to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had enough of that. Wanted out, but needed the job until something else came along. I didn't speak to her unless I had to, didn't look at her, didn't make eye contact. Made every effort to avoid her. Unfortunately, she's the supervisor for the truck crew, and eventually she had more beef with me, even though I only got better and faster at the job. Constant complaining about how slow I am. Every time she made some snarky comment to me, I continued on with my job and said nothing. I figured, if I don't talk to her, if I say nothing, she can't call me insubordinate.  After a bit of this she said she was talking to a brick wall and I needed to communicate with her. So, immediately following this instruction, I asked for clarification on something. It was something obvious, but she was insistent about how I needed to communicate. She flipped.  Made some comments about how \"Oh, so that's how it's gonna be\" and asked two coworkers if they heard me say what I said. Just because I asked a question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI very recently quit that job, because I'd rather quit while I had dignity left than be fired for repeat insubordination. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my question is, am I the asshole because i struggle to work beneath someone else? Are my expectations too high for retail work? Am I supposed to just duck my head and take the heat, do my job, and shutup? I'm genuinely asking, because until I finish up my degree I'm stuck with retail work. I think I'm doing something wrong, and I, at the very least, want to not hate my job. Should I blindly accept authority and keep opinions to myself, even if I'm right? Am I being too stubborn and just being a hard-to-work-with employee? Should I just accept that life isn't fair, retail jobs aren't fair, and it sucks? I don't know if I included enough detail for an accurate judgment, but I at least want some honesty from someone.",

      "description": "This could be slightly sad, but I do need reassurance I'm not a wuss for this. Also I'm sorry if there is any punctuation or slight spelling errors, it's 2:30 am and I'm kinda lazy sometimes. \n\n     So my grandpa's mother (my great grandma, and my mom's grandma) fell and broke her hip, and is now in a nursing home. She's, in short, going into dementia and having all the signs and symptoms (taking off her clothes, wandering hands, random anger, etc) and I live 19 hours away from her now. I call my grandparents pretty often to just talk since they were like other parents to me and they often start talking about how grandma is and what's going on.\n\n     Usually I wouldn't mind but it's not a usual \"oh her pains not bad\" or \"she says hi\", it's almost disgusting details of her \"wandering hands\" and her trying to take her clothes off and almost back handing my grandma (she was an extremely kind woman) and events that set my anxiety wild. I recently lost my other great grandmother and I still haven't fully recovered from that, and hearing this hurts my heart worse than a heart attack. I've asked them multiple times to spare the details and yet they don't listen. I love hearing the progress she has made, her new friends, and all that. Not her episodes. Even when I've asked them several times, they always slowly slide into the story, regardless of if I wanna hear or not. Half the time I just hold the phone away and wait until it's over. \n\n     This isn't the only issue I've had with them. We call my grandma (not my great grandma)  Facebook for a reason: everyone has to hear what's going on in her and other people's lives (\"hi this is my granddaughter- she's diabetic\" when it's irrelevant) and one popular topic is my great grandmothers finances. \n\n     I don't have the right nor the wish to hear how far she is behind on bills, or her gambling, or whatnot. And hearing that people who have met her maybe twice and aren't even related to her know about it almost sickens me. \n\n     I've had my mother get involved to help explain why it bothers me, I don't want that to be my memory of her, but I'm called literally a TATTLE TAIL and this is just the hard facts of Life, or get smartass remarks like, \"oh don't tell her that it makes her sad\" in a sarcastic tone.\n\n     Am I the asshole for not wanting my last memories of my grandmother to be mental images of her going insane and lose the memories of her being the sweetest kindest old lady? Would I be an asshole if I was to go off on them and tell them to stop because I've had enough? I hope there's enough info here and if there's a question you have please let me know and I'll post an edit or answer directly to you. ",

      "description": "Originally my friend group and I wanted to go on a holiday as a small group with a few of our classmates to celebrate our graduation. This friend group includes me and 3 other friends, let's call them A,B and C. So a close friend of A and B, who is from a different school, was also graduating at the same time, so we invited her as well, let's call her D. So somehow this holiday evolved into a graduation trip with almost everyone in our class joining. They never knew, that we originally only wanted to go as a small group and it was always labeled as a holiday for our class. A and B didn't want to uninvite D, so we just continued our plans with her. No one ever told them that we're bringing someone else.\nFriend A ended up not being able to come to this holiday and B voluntarily took up booking the trip, so she didn't have to tell anyone that D was coming as well. We are renting 2 apartments and would have had a spare bed anyways. Most of us are 19-20 and because we're flying to a different country it's quite expensive to most of us. D didn't know that this was a class trip and felt a little akward.\nAll of this happened about half a year before our supposed trip and I tried to convince B and C multiple times to tell the rest of the class, that D is coming, but they didn't think it was necessary. I talked to a few friends and family and they all agreed that it is kind of shitty to just bring someone on a class holiday without asking. B and C originally planned to have them find out while on the plane. I considered telling our class myself but didn't know how to go about it. I decided I didn't want to take the blame because I didn't invite D and I wanted to tell them all along. Because I didn't want to cause stress in my friend group, especially in our last few weeks, I decided to not tell anyone. I tried to convince them to tell our class a couple times after that and they finally told everyone who will be in our apartment. They didn't think it was a big deal but we're also friends with them. In the other apartment on the other hand there are a few people who will have a bigger reaction.\nI feel bad for not telling them and having them find out when we arrive will most likely end in a few arguments. B and C say they won't have to deal with anyone in our class after we graduate and don't really care if they're going to be mad. By now I have given up trying to convince them and just let them deal with the consequences.\nAITA? Tldr: my friend is bringing someone on our class holiday. I knew all along but never told anyone. Half of my class still doesn't know.\n\n",

      "description": "Let me start by saying we’re now on good terms now, but about 4 years ago he ghosted me just as we were starting college after leaving high school where we met, so we were about 16 (We've been friends for about 4 years at this point). I’m not a social person and I didn’t have many friends, so starting college knowing no one was scary, he was the only true friend I had.\nIt really hurt and upset me that he could just cut all contact with me, made me feel like I was unlikable. After he started ghosting me, I got really depressed and didn’t socialise with anyone, even going on anti-depressants to help keep me sane (I didn't want to exist for a brief period). I’ll admit I went crazy, became an arsehole and messaged him a lot to try and get him to speak to me. He did respond to somethings, but it was short, and he went straight back to ghosting after.\nAfter a few months (felt like half a year, but I can’t be certain) I just went straight to his house to confront him directly, I just wanted my friend back and said something like “Let’s just forget everything which happened and play games”. It somewhat worked, and he started speaking to me a bit, more and more. Fast forward a few years and we’re back together, much better friends than before. We speak to each other for hours playing online games almost every time we are both at home.\nOne day (Like 9 months ago now) I asked him why he ghosted me those years back, and it turns out that it was because he was depressed because a guy in his college friend group called him weird and asked why he was even hanging out with them. So, he didn’t even ghost me because he didn’t like me, but because he was depressed about friends as well.\nBut it still bothers me every day. It really screwed me up, even after he stopped ghosting me. It really crushed my self-worth and social skills. Even now, I feel like he could just as easily drop contact with me and it wouldn’t affect him at all. He’s pretty much over it (or at least doesn’t show it anymore), as he found his group of people and started going to parties and drinking, I’m still depressed (much less so than before though) and anti-social.\nHe’s honestly a really good person and I love him to bits, so I haven’t said anything, or showed anything about still being mad, as I don’t want to cause a divide between us, and I can’t exactly suddenly appear to be mad about something which happened so long ago out of nowhere. (Recently he took a 30 minute bus journey to my house to drop off his controller I asked to borrow, during his 2 hour break from work when it was raining, without me even asking him to do so).\nAITA for still being mad about it? His depression caused him to ignore me, which made me depressed. I can’t be mad at someone for not being social while being depressed, but it still upsets me. AITA for holding him partly responsible for my depression? AITA for still being mad at best friend who ghosted me 4 years ago?\n\nIn case anyone is wondering why I'm posting this now, after being mad for so long, he recently done something which triggered memories of how I felt before (He didn't do anything bad or wrong, just something which reminded me).\n",

      "description": "So, let me get a few facts straight - I'm female, in my twenties and I am introverted and cannot handle social situations at times, because they get very exhausting and scary.\n\nI have a best friend that I've known for a decade and longer and we always get around really well. We love each other dearly and we enjoy being around the other, because she helps me deal with stuff and I help her. Whenever we would argue, IF it happens, we would come to a conclusion rather quickly, dealing with things rather well. \n\nNow, how come I start resenting her? Because I do; I noticed that I get annoyed whenever she would speak or interact with others, the way she phrases her sentences, the topics she talks about, anything. It's not that I don't love her anymore because I do, but, goddamn, I get so irritated about her behaviour, her acting, etc. She's not doing anything out of the ordinary for me to be feeling like that, either. \n\nAnd it makes me feel real dickish, because I don't want to feel like this about my best friend, but at the same time - I just do. So, I have been distancing myself a bit, responding rather sluggishly whenever she would talk and just overall be a little unenthusiastic about things with her. And I've been feeling conflicted as of lately because I feel like I'm not supposed to feel like this about my best friend, so I thought about bringing it up to her.\n\nWould I be the asshole for mentioning that she annoys me? \n",

      "description": "I know this is a lot of background but it's relevant:\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been long distance since I moved 3 hours away from his home town to a college in my home town almost a year ago. We've only been seeing each other during breaks and our relationship was as strong as ever but we obviously missed each other a whole lot. He did his two years in community college and he just got his acceptance letter and is transferring to my university this fall. \n\nSo the plan was always for him to move out of his moms to live with my family for a year and then get our own place but today he said he was leaning more towards living in the dorms on campus. \"Because I want the experience\" he said. Another mutual friend also got his acceptance letter to go here and I'm upset that he would rather pay to live with his friend on campus than with me for free. Another thing is that he is really cheap and is always talking about not wasting money but he will gladly burn some instead of living here. We wouldn't charge him rent, our house is really nice and we live in a big city with tons to do. The only thing is the commute which is about an hour. Am I wrong for being mad at him?? It's also really hurtful cause I got him a new nintendo switch for valentines/our 2 and a half years together and he got me a stuffed animal. I wasn't mad or anything at the time. I don't care about gifts, I was just happy that for once he was the one that made the trip here. It bothers me now because he's so frugal he won't bother to get me roses but he's fine with wasting money to live in a dorm for the fun. I'll admit I've been bitching at him since he told me this, and he keeps telling me it's something he's always wanted to do. I've calmed down now since the initial rage and I'm second guessing my point of view. So AITA?",

      "description": "Hey team. This just happened and I am not entirely sure what to think.\n\nWith the recent NZ shooting still running strong through the heads of my country everyone is talking of it.\n\nI was talking to a friend of mine and we were discussing the comments made my Australian senator Fraser Anning. \nSee: https://i.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/111327946/australian-pm-labels-senator-disgusting-over-christchurch-terror-attack-comments\n\nNow, there was an online petition that the premise of was to get Anning to go to vote to keep his job. Anning, being a Australian senator of course, and my friend and my self being Kiwi’s.\n\nMy argument was that I would not sign the online petition as the senator was not a political representative of my country and therefore I should not get a say on wether or not he is fired.\nJust for the record, I think he should but I don’t think I should get an official vote in it.\n\nMy friend thinks people from my country should. She thinks that, despite the fact I openly disagree with Annings’ comments and told her my position on wether Anning is a fitting representative for Australia’s government, I am a racist and I am enabling racism by saying that I don’t agree with her and that I don’t think it’s my place to sign the petition. \n\nI then used the example of: “I don’t deserve a say in Australian politics. I don’t get a vote because the implications of his actions don’t effect me. I don’t want Australians voting to raise my tax rate same as I don’t deserve to vote to remove an Australian senator.“\nShe is saying that I am a racist because I care more about my tax rate than the tragedy when I only used that as an example of the reasons I shouldn’t get a say on Australian politics.\n\nReddit, Am I The Asshole?",

      "description": "So, quick backstory: \n\nI live with my Mom, who is a total sweetheart, but can be a bit cranky. My sister has 3 children, 2 6yo boys, and a little 1 year old little girl (adorable). I love my family very very much, I wanna make this clear. I would do anything for them, in fact, I've changed my entire life for the better because of them, and they inspire me to continue bettering myself. \n\nThat being said, they demand a lot of attention. I recently moved in with my mom to be closer to them. I don't necessarily like children.. they kind of annoy me lol. Especially somewhat misbehaved ones, like my nephews. I know they're just kids, and they don't really know any better, but yeah. Now my Mom and Sister's idea of hanging out is going shopping/window shopping at department stores and stuff, it's their thing. It's that, or sitting in my sister's living room while her kids go nuts.\n\nSo I consistently shoot them down. Not to mention, I'm very much an introvert, and want to focus on school and work. I prefer to relax by myself on my off time.. but, my family tries to take up a considerable amount of my time. Most of my life I felt kind of disconnected from them, I've been very much a \"Black Sheep\" in my views and life choices. So it's hard to get along with them.\n\nI'll finalize this by saying, I don't always shoot them down, I do visit them, quite often actually. But lately the guilt trips have been getting worse whenever I say no, and my sister uses her kids against me sometimes. My mom gets completely upset with me and doesn't speak to me.\n\nI feel like they either don't respect or don't understand my need of my space, and I don't know how to communicate it without being TA.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I have had the same group of 6 close friends since I was a freshman in high school. (I’m 24 now) We would hang out almost every day of the week while we were all living in the same town, even if we had nothing to do, we would want to do nothing together.  As we got older and a couple people went to college out of town and a few of us got married, it made it more difficult to all see each other. We still try to make time for seeing each other once a week and definitely all get together when everyone is in town. All of us except one.  We will call him “John”.  \n\nAbout 2 and a half years ago “John” got into his first real relationship with a girl. We were super happy for him and quietly relieved that he found someone because it had always been something that he was worried would never happen. The first few months of them dating we hardly heard from him, which is ok and we expected it to happen since he had never had to balance time with a girlfriend and friends. We would still invite both of them to come watch a movie or grab some dinner, to which he would politely decline for various reasons which was completely fine with us. Until he kept doing it. \n\nFrom the time they started dating until the day they got married, which was one and a half years later, we had seen him and his girlfriend a total of 5 times. We sent him and her countless invitations to come hang out and they were almost always unable to come.  Even after they got married we would still send a few invites every now and then, to which he would say his usual response of him being unable to or he would just flat out ignore them. He even stopped showing up when the guys from out of town would come home for a couple days out of the year. Eventually we stopped talking to him all together. \n\n2 months ago, out-of-the-blue, he started showing interest in his relationship with us again. (which was two years after he started dating her/stopped seeing us) He would invite us over to grill out or ask to go on double dates and it really caught us all off guard. He went from zero communication to wanting to see us multiple times a week. We hung out a couple times and things were definitely not the same between him and the rest of our group. He had really hurt us all by not making any effort previously and we all were pretty upset with him for it. \n\nA couple weeks after he started up communication again he found out he was going to be moving to a different state for a job. He sent out a text asking if any of us could help him pack and load their stuff into a trailer, which for some reason really got under my skin. I felt like he was using us and really felt like he didn’t deserve our help. After talking with the other guys we all kinda felt the same way. We all told him we couldn’t help to which he got upset at all of us for. They moved away and every now and then will send a letter to us guys/relatives in town, updating us on what’s new with them. I haven’t responded to anything he’s sent. I saw on social media that he came in town last week and didn’t acknowledge it. I know it’s nice of him to kind of try to keep our friendship alive but he never even tried apologizing for anything and I feel like to much damage has been done.  Am i the asshole for ignoring him now?\n\nI hope this is fluid and makes sense. I kept adding things in different spots to make it more cohesive but I may have made it more confusing",

      "description": "A couple of weeks ago I made a post about being in an open relationship with a horrid lack of communication. Judgement was that I was indeed the asshole, which I think I owned up to pretty well to.\n\nTL;DR was there was not much sex. I slept with a problematic ex and didn't tell my SO. Despite our relationship being very emotionally stable (or so I thought) and my trying to initiate intimacy, SO would seek out sex with others but not me. I was upset about it.\n\nIt ended up that we broke up. It was amicable, but still really hard since there wasn't any real animosity between us. Just a lack of understanding of how one another works and a major incompatibility in how we view sex.\n\nAnyways, we hadn't really talked about our problems to any of our friends or family since we didn't want to make it a big deal and the holidays came and went. I worked on being by myself as much as I could, trying to figure out how to be better. It's hard because I've got some pretty bad trauma and resulting depression. I do my best not to ever excuse myself because of it though.\n\nLately it's gotten a lot worse with the breakup and various other factors. My ex has been very supportive since they know the most about my past and has been trying really hard to help. Recently, he's been bringing up the idea of trying to make it work between us and wants a closed relationship again. They are willing to sit down and talk more often and work on the intimacy. They didn't even really care about me sleeping with the problematic ex. But I said no.\n\nI feel awful and desperately would like to get back together, but I keep letting them know I'm not their problem anymore and, as much as I appreciate their concern and efforts, they need to give me space for both of our sakes. They have a really good job, a nice car, and is good with their finances. I've got a minimum wage job with no car and I could be more frugal considering my status. I just don't think we're as compatible as we thought. Mainly I don't think I'mgood enough. I stopped replying to their messages as often as a result.\n\nI'm being told that I'm not being fair to how they feel and that by ignoring them, I'm just continuing the initial problem we had of not communicating, even though they're trying. But I figure I'm sparing them.\n\nTL;DR: Really good person of an ex wants to make it work, but I think I'm too much of a mess for them so I'm not for it. Now I'm not talking to them in an effort to distance myself.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for texting my female neighbor \"You're a fucking cunt.\"",
      "description": " Immediately it sounds like I'm the asshole, I know, and to some extent I know I am but not how much. For context, I moved into my new place in April and within 2 months became close friends with 2 of the neighbors. An older guy and a younger woman close to my age (27). The older guy is a 40-something, unemployed, on disability. The younger woman worked at a nearby casino and recently got fired. For the purposes of the story the older guy will be Y and the younger woman E. I'll just list the things from E that has led me up to the \"fucking cunt\". Let me also say that for the first month I had a crush on E, and we were both single, she's a free spirit and fun to be around but the crush faded as I found out more about her and I found someone else for awhile and she did too. That adds a certain tinge to the story I guess. But I've also been helping Y out too, but he's grateful and hasn't really done anything majorly shitty to me.\n\n1. When I first moved in we were hanging out a lot and I was buying a lot of beer for these two, the guy Y always tried to get me back on them, didn't quite always. E never did and would always bum cigarettes. I was being nice, I let this last a couple months before I stopped it. I was never offered either afterwards, but sometimes I would ask for a cig and reluctantly get one, I guess I was being passive aggressive, didn't really need one.\n2. She begged me to take her boyfriend to a nearby town once because her car wasn't working. I reluctantly complied and got pulled over, my first speeding ticket. My fault, and this is kinda shitty on my part: I kinda blamed him though at the time. But the clincher is as I was getting pulled over he tells me he snuck an illegal shotgun in my trunk and to \"be cool\". Haha, nice display of respect there, didn't bother to tell me that. He told me he'd help pay for it since it was because I was helping him out, of course never did. This is more on him than her, but still, she didn't give a shit about any of it and new about the shotgun and didn't tell me. Lucky that situation didn't turn out a lot worse.\n3. Ever since she broke up with the guy, she's had a few homeless people stay with her, not all at once but spaced out, now I don't wanna sound like a dick here, but there's 4 of us here and she does it without telling anyone. We don't know what the deal is with these people and I've pieced together that the reason our shared back door's lock is broken is because one of them tried to break back in.\n4. Her cat comes down to my door and meows constantly at mine because I have a cat too. I've asked her to make sure her front door is closed because the cat is loud and it wakes me up sometimes. She doesn't.\n5. She blared her music often for awhile before I angrily texted her to turn the damn music down, I live right below her. Now she's gone back to it, judging from yesterday, more about this coming later.\n6. This one is the single most hurtful, it's the most hurtful thing someone has said to me this last year and she did it so thoughtlessly because she's \"lol quirky and randum xD\". We were getting high and drunk, which I don't do often (well the former) and she turns to me and goes \"I wish you were strong\". Not \"stronger\" even, just \"strong\". Implying I'm weak. Needless to say this killed my high. The past year has been rough for me, after a demotion due to downsizing (worked my ass off at that job) and a series of panic attacks I quit my job abruptly in January. Got kicked out of home by my mom that I'd been living with for awhile. Lived in my car for over a month, got my shit together, got a job, got this place, got promoted to part-time manager, quit that job because I found a better one that I actually kinda like for once. I felt legitimately weak at the start of the year and have been feeling better about myself. Stopped hanging out with her like that after that. Still have talked to her and had her over for a smoke a few times, but yeah that was over.\n7. This was just the other day and really pissed me off. She desperately texted me for clean piss since she's getting an interview and is a stoner. I haven't smoked in a few months. I was going out for a date with my girlfriend and told her I would give her a cupful at 11 tomorrow (I usually sleep 3-11 due to my schedule) a few hours before her interview. I get texts all night asking about the piss, even when I'm sleeping and texts always wake me up. Then she comes down and knocks at 9, asks if I have the piss I angrily say \"no, I don't piss until I wake up at 11\", and then idk why but this is the fucking clincher, she asks to bum a cigarette. Bitch, I'm already fucking helping you get a job, no. I gave her the piss at 11, never received even a thank you.\n8. This is more about my neighbor Y than me. He was getting high speed internet and E and I were using it too. Difference was I was paying him 25 a month and E was paying 0 (because Y has a soft spot for her pretty sure). Y has to cancel his internet due to financial issues. He leaves for a week to visit family. When he gets back I ask about his time and then I say no problem and thanks for providing this for us so far. E says first thing, I was there in the stairwell, in a real entitled tone: \"Hey, what's the deal with the internet?\". Not \"how was your week or anything\". Then later on when I got internet she asked for my internet and in a round about way I said no.\n9. Her new boyfriend and some of her friends have parked in MY FUCKING PARKING SPOT a few times. She had to have pointed them there, knowing I'm a pushover or weak or something, because there's other spots. I nipped that in the bud like the 4th time.\n10. In general there's just been so many more times I've helped her out than vice versa. And there's a few entitled things things she's said about it. I won't list all those.\n\nSo on to yesterday and the text. I come home at 11 after stopping by my girlfriend's place. Earlier in the day Y said he was turning his internet back on. I got my own in the meantime so I said thanks but I'm good. I come home and of course he's given her access and of course she's playing her music really fucking loud again and it's getting late, (it's a small apartment complex, whole place could hear her songs). I feel so sorry for the kind older lady who moved in recently. So I play my music loud for once out of spite (real petty I know), and then text her all friendly kinda fishing for a simple thank you for the piss I gave her, just a simple joke response. So I get drunk and finally text her something like \"You're a fucking cunt. You're so entitled and disrespectful\" and then I angrily list some of the things I've been mad about. I wish I'd kept the texts but deleted them and blocked her after today. She texted back something about \"Wtf, I've had it with your random drunk behavior... I have a dude over right now...\" don't know if that was a veiled threat or what. And then earlier today I texted back something like \"Sorry about calling you cunt but I stand by everything else, maybe you should stick to your business and I'll stick to mine. Btw, I'm buying a baseball bat after work if that was a veiled threat and you send anyone to try to fuck with me.\" Which might have been overreacting\n\nIn her defense now and things I'm feeling bad about:\n\n1. I've been ridiculous with my drinking, I might have a borderline problem that I'm trying to work on. I don't make an ass of myself too much but sometimes I get angry drunk and I have rarely confronted her (only through texts, never yelling) about one of these problems except when I am angry drunk, something like \"Turn your fucking music down I live right fucking below you and you do this all the time\" instead of politely asking her to turn her music down. I apologize for my tone later.\n2. She's always been a good listener when we've talked and I have problems.\n3. She's made a few meals and randomly bought me Sonic once (well her friend did) but I've done more vice versa just sayin.\n4. She was pretty fun sometimes before we stopped hanging out.\n5. edit: And the other day she came down for some reason, idk what didn't find out, I was drunk and immediately asked \"So what the fuck did you want from me now.\" And she said \"Nothing! Nevermind!\"\n\nIdk, I hate cutting people off in my life. Who's the asshole, now that I've written it out I'm leaning towards both of us, but maybe one of us was a bigger one idk. And should I reconcile this or not? If so how? Thanks for reading this fucking novel.",

      "description": "I work in sales in Southern California and as a result a large portion of our customer base is either Spanish speaking or bilingual. Regularly there are people who genuinely do not speak English (or enough of it to carry a conversation, let alone negotiate a transaction) and we have bilingual associates who can help them better. \n\nOften enough though, customers will walk in and ask for a Spanish speaker, even though they obviously speak perfect English. I’ve even had customers ask me questions directly in english, and then once they have the answer they ask for a Spanish speaker to help them out. \n\nFor example I just had a woman walk in speaking English to her children, her children were speaking english, and she asked me a series of questions regarding our product. We had a 5 minute conversation (perfect English). Right after she asks me if there is a Spanish speaker available to help her, and I could tell it was even awkward for her seeing as I had basically set up her purchase. After she had left I asked the associate who had helped her if she was speaking Spanish, and the associate told me that almost all of their conversation was in English. \n\nI understand that one could be more comfortable if they were shaky or uncertain of their English, and that’s not what I’m talking about. I’m referring to the people who hold English speaking jobs, their children speak English, etc. \n\nAITA for feeling like these people are unreasonable or even a little prejudiced?(not sure if that’s the right word, but it’s close)\n\nI feel like the asshole, but I’d like to see how other people would interpret this. I’m sure his happens in other countries, how do you feel about this behavior? \n\n",

      "description": "My friend and I are high school and my brother is in college, but he lives at home. My brother is kind of an ass at times. He’ll tell me off for eating “his” food or wearing his clothes or other little things. I generally try to avoid him.\n\nMy buddy is over a lot and we stay out of my brothers way mostly. We were eating lunch and my brother came in and my buddy started chatting with him about his love life.\n\nMy friend was dating this one girl and broke up with her for another. He was just telling my brother about it but my brother called him a douche and accused him of disrespecting his last girlfriend. It was way overboard. I feel that my brother should have kept those feelings to himself and taken himself down a few notches.\n\nMy buddy was pretty mad about how my brother spoke to him. I didn’t know at the time, but he took my brothers phone and sent his girlfriend a few texts breaking up with her. He knew it wouldn’t actually end in a break up because my brother was just about to head over to her place. It was just a joke. I get it was mean, but the confusion would have only lasted for half an hour, tops.\n\nFirst my brother came at me when he got home because he thought I wrote it. When I corrected him, he told me he doesn’t want me to be friends with this guy anymore. He said a lot of terrible things about him that aren’t true at all. My mom took my brothers side and said my friend isn’t allowed over anymore. I’m pretty mad about the whole situation because it wasn’t that big of a deal and everyone’s fine at the end of the day. I’m going to stay friends with my friend, and we’re just going to have to go to his and my mom will have to deal with me being around less. Am I the asshole for not wanting to dump my friend over a stupid prank?",

      "title": "AITA for not paying contractors for a fence that isn't tall enough",
      "description": "I had contractors (a small local business) in to remove an old fence that wasn't tall enough set up a fence. There was little communication up front but since they're friends of my father-in-law I wasn't too worried. There was also no written contract, basically just a conversation while they were at my house, we agreed on a concrete post and wooden panel fence, 2m tall (maximum height we can get without needing planning permission) and agreed on a price. I got a text a week later to tell me what day they were coming.\n\nYesterday they arrived, took out the old fence and starting setting up the new one. After they put in the first panel I expressed concern about how tall they were but they said it was taller than it looks and I'd see if was fine when they were done. I though alright then, it'll probably be fine. I don't know much about fences and it's their job so they know what they're doing.\n\nTo give you an idea of why we needed as much height as we could get, our neighbours have a conservatory that sits quite high so when they're in there they can see over our old fence and straight into our bedrooms. So it was important that the new fence be taller than the old one. The neighbours conservatory is to the left side of that fence and the contractors starting installing the new fence from the right side so we weren't able to see how much of a difference it made until they had put in 75% of the fence at the end of the day yesterday.\n\nThis morning we got up and immediately noticed that our neighbour was in their conservatory and we could see her more than we could before, so the new fence was lower than the old one. I went out to measure it to make sure we weren't imaging it and where the old fence was 1m86, this one was 1m73.\n\nWhen the contractors got back today I immediately brought it up with them and they said we agreed on 6ft tall (which is \\~1m80). They said they can't make it taller without removing it and starting over with new materials and we debated about what could be done for over an hour and a half. He said that I asked for a 1m80 fence, I remember saying that the panels had to be 1m80 tall (which with 20cm gravel boards underneath would be 2m).\n\nUltimately they're sure we asked for 1m80, we're sure we asked for 2m because any shorter than that wouldn't make any sense for us, we would've just kept the old fence. I said that we weren't paying for a fence that isn't what we agreed. They said we should at least pay them for the materials. I told them I could see why they think that would be fair but arguably they got the wrong materials and we can't use them for the fence we need so we're not going to pay for the materials either. They got angry, packed up their stuff and left.  \n\n\nAITA for not paying them when everyone involved thinks that they are personally in the right? I'm not assertive and avoid confrontation so while I think I'm right I worry that maybe I'm not.",

      "description": "My boyfriend is balding, **bad**. \n \n \nIts like how thin [this guy’s hair](https://goo.gl/images/hqsPW6) is on the top tuft but following [this pattern](https://goo.gl/images/PYasQ1).\n \n\nHe started balding in his 20s and has fully accepted that he going bald. He knows his “best” look is shaving it all off.  \n \nThe thing is he’s lazy. I try to remind him to shave, or offer to do it for him, but he puts it off. He lets his hair grow out until it looks awful. Like an inch or two all around. Usually takes about 2 weeks. \n \n When hair is grown out he goes from a rustic handsome man to a crazy scientist.   \n \nWhile I find him a little less attractive when his hair is grown out, my main concern is how professional he is seen.\n \nHis job doesn’t “require” him to look professional, but it’s a job he needed to get a degree to work in. (I don’t want to be too specific). He has also been involving himself more in the company so the higher ups are taking notice of him.  \n \n\n \nI don’t get frustrated or nag when his hair gets bad. I might bring shaving up twice a week and I wait until we’re at the house doing nothing before I say something. \n \nThat being said, he has the right to keep his hair however he wants it. \n \n He doesn’t pressure me to shave (legs, armpits, pubic area, etc). He has even said he wouldn’t care if I stopped shaving all together. \n \n I don’t want to make a double standard here. It’s just that head hair is so much more present that my body hair. How a persons head hair looks is seen as a representation of how professional they are. (Wether it’s an accurate representation or not) \n \nI’m not sure if him not shaving his head would be akin to me not shaving my legs, or like me not brushing my hair. \n \nIf it’s more like no brushing my hair WIBTA for asking him to shave more?",

      "description": "I work at a decent sized company and have to respond to two superiors - one being the actual president of the company, and another being a team lead. We were transferred an individual (we’ll call Janet) from another department for cross training. This individual was taken a liking too and was kept in our department. \n\nThe problem is, Janet underperforms in multiple aspects and has been given extensive reminders on how to do things. The majority of the times when I and my senior coworker try to give Janet advice &amp; reminders, Janet just walks away. This is reflected in their work, and thus causes issues and more work for our department as a whole.\n\nI and my coworker have brought this up multiple times and our team lead doesn’t seem to mind, whilst keeps us accountable for the Janet’s actions/underperformance. It’s gotten to a point where it’s become a problem in both worker morale, and work communication; I’ve even pitched in to help overtime with Janet’s workload but. was then made an example on a mistake I had made.  The example being “Don’t pick on Janet, you yourself make mistakes”\n\nI recently saw the individual had their FB messenger open, and saw their spouse’s private messages and felt really bad for Janet. Full disclosure: I had to retrieve a file from Janet’s PC, and it’ll the window was wide open - not to mention I’m only human.\n\nThe weirdest part from all of this is there’s a work rumor that Janet is sleeping with the team lead. \n\nAm I the asshole for not tolerating Janet and not taking on her work responsibility?\n\nI question this, because I don’t know if she’s underperforming because of her home life, but the fact that there’s such a leniency with Janet from the supervisor (mind you Janet fucks up the most basic things, as well - so it’s just an overall lack of attention and interest) And she’s constantly just casually talking in the team lead’s office is what irks me.\n\nEssentially: Why am I being held accountable when it was your decision to keep Janet? She obviously sucks at her job. ",
