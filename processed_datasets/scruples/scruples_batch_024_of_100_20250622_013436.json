I have my suspicions on the culprit but am going to be looking at camera footage soon. If who I suspect did it I’m gonna corner him into confessing on tape (and try to get him to return the money). Doesn’t matter if money gets returned or not I’m gonna do everything in my power to have him kicked out of the school. (Our school takes stealing very seriously.) if my suspicions are right is this too far to go for only 60$ (he also owes me 30 I did a project for him) or would what I do make me a total asshole too??",

      "description": "I am in graduate school. I was discussing the testing accommodations process with my professor. He sent me an email asking me to meet him after class to talk about it. When I got to class today, he said: “you were supposed to come before class” and sounded mad. I told him I must have misunderstood because I thought he said after. His response was, “No. Before.” I double checked his email to make sure I didn’t get it wrong, and sure enough, he said after.\n\nNow at this point I could have just let it go and let him accuse me of missing my appointment, or I could defend myself. I chose the latter and I am wondering if I AITA for doing so. After class, I said that I really looked at his email and he did tell me to come after class. He said, “ah, so you want to argue with me?” I said, “I’m not trying to argue, I just don’t want to be accused of something I didn’t do (not showing up to a meeting with him.) At that, he picked up his stuff and stormed out of the room.\n\nI am feeling really shitty about this. I feel like I shouldn’t have said anything since professors should have respect from their students, but I also felt it wasn’t fair that he was accusing me of missing a meeting with him before class when he clearly told me after class in the email. I don’t want to be blamed for something I didn’t do. So did I do the right thing not letting it go or AITA? ",

      "title": "AITA for using the school newspaper to promote my politics?",
      "description": "So recently a spot opened up for the politics section in my school's newspaper section. I'm a freshman, so when I joined newspaper at the beginning of the year, I was banished to the *food* section, where I was probably supposed to languish for 2 or 3 years. But one of the writers for the politics section moved schools, so I did everything in my power to be assigned her former position. My maneuvers worked, and I was assigned the position. \n\nNow, you have to understand the 2 other writers for the politics section are pretty liberal, and their opinion pieces reflect that. I'm a libertarian with centrist views when it comes to social issues, so of course, my views will shine through in the opinion pieces I'm assigned. \n\nI got assigned a few, nothing major, but strangely enough, my articles got an interesting reaction. I'll divide the reactions up into 3 categories:\n\n1. The majority of people didn't care\n\n2. Kids who are interested in politics read it, and people in those kind if groups started knowing who I am. I'd like to say it's because I'm a great writer, and incredibly convincing. But I think a big part of the attention is simple: the politics section has been all liberal for as long as anyone can remember, so something *more* conservative (although I wouldn't consider myself conservative per se) is a shock. So for better or worse, a lot of kids know my name. And at least most of them, even those who disagree, seem interested in discussing.\n\n3. The two other writers got pissed at me and called me out for my views. Personally, I think it's less political and more personal: I was the new writer, I got in as a freshman, and I'm getting attention for my pieces, which didn't sit well with them. When they confronted me, I brought that up, but they swore up and down they just didn't like my political ideas. I just told them, the point of an opinion piece is an opinion, so what's your problem? They just kept asking me- including multiple times after the first incident- to stop writing my opinions. \n\nAita for refusing?",

I'd say we are pretty close.\n\nx and i go out to smoke (x has been smoking me out because I'm pretty broke). We smoked two bowls and came back in. When we came back, my roommate was in bed, lights are off, but he's on his laptop watching videos. X and I jump on my bed and start watching videos on youtube. A lil time goes by and x says he has to go to the bathroom. X leaves to go to the bathroom and I rest my hand where he was sitting. It's soaking wet. I say, \"Why the fuck is my bed wet\". I go to turn on the light and there's a huge circle of wet right where x was sitting. I notice x has a water bottle and check to see if the bottle had leaked. I tilted it over and nothing comes out. I even shook it and no water came out. I then said out loud to, \"I think x pee'd my bed\". At this point, my roommate and i are laughing really hard. X came back from the bathroom and we told him why we were laughing so much. He got defensive and objected, saying it was the bottle that had leaked. I pressed him and asked why he didn't say anything and he said that he didn't notice.\n\nAm I the asshole for accusing him of peeing my bed without asking him first or should he have just been honest?",

      "description": "There’s a lot more context to fit into that question though.\n\nLet’s call the bestfriend C, new GF, L, and the ex J. C and L used to hook up and currently go to the same university. C and J had been hooking up for a while as well and eventually it became a relationship, albeit an open one where they could hook up with other people but had to be mindful of feelings out of respect for the other.\n\nThis relationship, in a matter of months, turned pretty quickly into a neglectful one from C’s side, ignoring J and not giving them the time of day for days or weeks even. J tried to approach everything the healthy way, advocating for communication, growth, to fix this before it was too far gone, unfortunately though, it already was. \n\nPrior to that, I ended up meeting L, thought L was cute and asked C what the situation was there, having known they used to hook up but with no clue about anything beyond that. C told me they just used to hook up and now they’re friends, I asked C if it was okay if I pursued L and to resounding yes (I asked twice just to be certain I wasn’t crossing any boundaries). Great! Off to pursue L I go.\n\nL and I eventually develop feelings for eachother, overlapping with the timeline of C being neglectful to J and evidently coming more and more to terms with their true feelings for L. It eventually comes to light from C telling me that they actually not only have feelings for L but that they’re in love with them. This threw me a curveball, didn’t see it coming, and it became an over-the-phone fight for about 3 hours between C and I where they detailed that they only originally said it was fine because they’ve felt as though I don’t respect them and I wouldn’t have listened to them even if they said it wasn’t fine to pursue L.\n\nThat call resulted in me basically saying “Forget all your friends, forget L, they’re blacklisted in my mind as far as our friendship goes because our friendship is more important than all of this” and we’d been fine since then.\n\nFast forward to this December, C and J have since broken up at long last while L and I have been speaking with more frequency again. Unbeknownst to me, so has C throughout this entire time that their relationship with J was on the decline. L spoke to me about everything implying that they had feelings for me, no longer C. After hanging out with J (we ARE friends after all) just yesterday, I decided to text L and ask exactly what the situation between them and C was. J and I put our timelines together and realized where all the deceit seemed to be. Lo and behold they’re in a relationship! I was telling a story to J as I read that text and I was very clearly shocked, J was curious, so I showed them that text message. J and I ended up essentially on opposite sides of the same fence.\n\nA few more texts between L and I but we kept it cordial only to wake up this morning to a very angry text calling me a scumbag for telling J that C and L were now dating mere weeks after C and J ended. So I ask you, Reddit, AITA?\n",

My friend asked me to come and I told him it's not my party and I shouldn't bring people if they aren't invited.He started begging me to come to the party and I told him if he wants to come ask [PARTY HOST] and not me. He started blaming for not being able to attend the party etc.I would consider myself popular and this party was only about 12-15 people that were close friends and I didn't want to be to ruin that and since he knew a few of them I told him again to asked the [PARTY HOST] but he refused saying it is too embarrassing to ask for an invite and started swearing at me and I got pissed off and I told him to fuck off.

      "description": "\n\nMy dad died drom Glioblastoma when I was 14, it was a tough time for me and my brother. During this time we learned a lot about his childhood and how his father was abusive. He would regularly hit his mother, cheat on her, he was an alcoholic, he'd hit him and his sister, lock them in rooms, scream at them for no reason, ignore them all day, tell them they would be nothing in life. He left when my dad was young, leaving them financially crippled to the point of needing to steal toilet paper from gas stations. When he was still alive and we'd ask about his father he'd tell us he was a bad man, and he never wanted us to meet him, and never wanted him to meet us.\n\nFlash forward to when I was 17, we're told my father's father has reappeared, with a new family, and has terminal cancer, and has requested to meet me and my brother. Part of us wanted to meet him and let him know how successful our dad was without him and wanted to let him know how fucked he made everything by being the way he was, and that he was never a part of this family and wouldn't be welcome now, another part of us didn't want to give him the chance to meet us before he died, we both felt like he didn't deserve that, and our dad wouldn't have wanted that. He died a few days after our decision. We didn't go to the funeral after being invited either.\n\nFlash forward to me being 20 now, we had been told several times after that, that it would have been more fulfilling to meet him and let him know that our father didn't need him, or telling him how we felt about him to his face, and now we'd never get the chance and we probably missed out on a once in a lifetime opportunity and certain family members would have jumped on the opportunity. We feel like we made the right choice but I'm curious about an unbiased opinion? \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So as a back story, I met a girl whilst I was on a holiday, and we hit it off, I'll refer to her as \"P\" \nShe was on holiday with her mum (I'm six years older than P, who finished school two years earlier) and to put it simply, her Mum just wasn't a good person. First, her mum tried to make a move on me, I kindly turned her away and took it as a compliment, so she got with the next available guy. Shortly after, I found out the mother is engaged.\nSo, I used every opportunity I could to spend time with P, who was lovely, and very empathetic which I find intriguing because I generally struggle with empathy and sympathy.\nP tells me that she's about to move interstate with her mum, and her mums fiance. \nNow, at this point we are hitting it off, and the more time I spend with P, the more protective I get of her. By the end of the holiday, I suggest that if she's moving anyway, I'll pay for her flights and she can move in with me, because I feel her family is toxic and she deserves better.\nThis girl is SUPER in to me, and fast forward two weeks later, she's living with me.\nThe problem is, now she's showing traits I saw in her mother, like always needing attention, especially from 'sickness'\nEvery night, it's a headache, or 'throwing up' or even \"tripped up on the way home, hit my head and now I'm so dizzy\"\nIt's been two weeks straight of a new issue every night, and I cannot even pretend I care anymore.\nShe said she liked gaming, so I bought her a switch and set up a gaming PC (she barely touched them) I got her a casual job, but because she only works short hours, so she gets upset when I don't want to \"attention her\" after work because I want to play a game or two but she's been \"Waiting all day for me to get home\"\nAnyway, now I feel like I have to try and make things work, because I don't want her to go home to her selfish mother, but I don't think I can keep up the relationship much longer.\nTL;DR Spent a week with a girl and convinced her to move in with me, now I don't think It's working out\nAdvice is also welcomed",

My brother (23) brought a slingshot with us on our morning outing in case he got bored. sure enough about an hour into fishing he starts grabbing rocks and firing at the trees behind us, aiming at anything interesting, pinecones, leaves whatever. Until he sees a lizard on the tree. He calls me over (19) and says he can hit it. I tell him not only could he not hit it,(it was kinda small maybe 6 or 7 inches?) but he shouldn't hit it and start to walk back to my pole. as I walk away I hear a thunk behind me and my brother says he hit! I turn around thinking hes lying but sure enough there's a lizard on the ground with a mangled leg twitching. I stare at it in kinda disbelief before I see another rock hit it, this time right on the head. The lizards body is twitching and  I yell what the hell's a matter with you and I see him aiming again. In my head this lizard is just in misery at this point and rather than giving my brother any more satisfaction I grab my pocket knife, flick it open and cut the lizards head off to end his pain. My brother looks at me like why did I have to ruin it and goes back to his pole. ",

      "description": "They never got along, which was weird since all my other partners and friends loved my mother. Their personalities never clicked and it lend to passive aggression, neither could give a good reason. I sat both down a year in and told them if they both loved me they didn't have to like eachother but did need to be civil for my sake so I'm not torn. They agreed.\n\nFor the most part only my mother followed through. I know mom didn't change her opinion, but since then she never expressed it to me and was always respectful towards my ex in conversation, invited her over for family events with the rest of the family, got her a small thing at Christmas, all the above.\n\nMy ex never really made any attempt to be that civil with my mother, and would usually find reasons to make shitty comments now and again and stuff of that nature. I've repeatedly asked why she disliked her so much and it's always been vague reasons like \"her attitude\" and whatnot. I've always thought it was jealousy that my mother and I are close as she's like that with other women in my life in general, but she certainly isn't invasive in the relationship and I also have healthy boundaries and couldn't be called a momma's boy or anything. I've never neglected my ex while propping up my mom.\n\nMy ex and I had some petty disagreement and she was in a bad mood, and my mom had stopped by to drop off my younger brother's bike I was going to work on. She was there maybe 30 seconds and didn't even come inside, but didn't say hello to my ex as my ex didn't come outside with me and mom was in a rush.\n\nWhen I went back in my ex started flipping out, calling my mother all sorts of names, saying she was a leech which makes no sense as mom never asks for or takes anything from me, calling her a cunt, saying she was sick of the bitch and other awful stuff. I left to call a friend to see if I could stay with him and asked him to come help me pack and came back and told her I no longer wanted to be with her.\n\nShe was distraught and kept asking why and how I could leave after 7 years after one issue. I told her I've had to listen to her disparage my mother for years and while mom made an effort to be civil she never did, and how if she cared about me she wouldn't take out her anger by speaking about my mom like that. She was begging me to stay apologizing and I told her she had 7 years to tell me properly what her issue was or work on it. She asked if I was picking my mother and I told her again I tried for years to not pick anyone but after her refusing to make an effort that yes, I was picking mom.\n\nI recently got my own apartment. My ex messages me on social media on alternate accounts or via friends almost daily begging me to come back. I'm not, I don't want to be with someone who speaks that way about my mom. But am I the asshole for how I left or for leaving in the first place instead of trying to be more understanding? I just decided on the spot I was done.",

A typical situation for most I think, but I live in a house with 6 people including myself.  \n\nWhen I buy things for the house: TP, food, garbage bags, etc. I put them in the places they go and everyone in the house uses them as they would. But when any of the other 5 buy anything, its kept in their rooms and nobody else is allowed to use it. Apparently, this was a silent agreement amongst 4/5 of them..1/5 of them just kinda went along with it but they agree with me that since were all sharing a living space, we should all pitch in for house supplies together, this way not all of our money is being spent, and nobody is left up shitcreek without a paddle.  \n\nHowever, everytime I bring attention to this, I'm told that I'm just gonna cause an issue, that I'm an asshole and I'm being confrontational. Granted, I'm on meds that have been making me act as such but in this situation I feel like I'm right.  \n\nWe'll argue about this every couple of days and their \"winning point\" is that if we all share, stuff disappears so quickly, and people dont mind being wasteful because they didnt buy it.  \n\n**A:** No shit. 6 people in a house, stuff goes fast.  \n**B:** If we all pool the money to buy things, people wont have that mentality because they spent money on it too.  \n\nSo am I making a big deal over something stupid, or am I right in thinking it should be different.",

This halibut and I have gotten pretty close; we play chess together, garden, they’re teaching me sign and generally have a pretty good repor. One of my roomies - iguana - has been all over halibut for a couple of months and shared with me that she’s crushing on the romantico/sensual sense, you get the picture. \nOne of our mutual friends told me that iguana told them that halibut has a crush on my a couple of weeks ago. I was like yeah obv I’m beautiful hilarious humble (this isn’t the part where I’m an asshole yet) but I didn’t think much of it. \nOn an unrelated yet related note there’s been a demon or evil spirit haunting me for some time now and lately I’ve been having real intense night terrors whenever I sleep in my room. I ended up crashing on the couch when halibut was and we snuggled our way right into fuckery. \nContext: I like to sleep around quite a bit  so going into I was like whatevskies but as it turns out halibut is suuuper sadist and ended up being a phenomenal lay. We’re a pretty good match in the biblical sense and have been fuckin with the occasional Gatorade break since Monday (this is a bit of an exaggeration) . \nThis morning I told iguana and she seemed really sad :( she said she was grumpy at halibut for other reasons but wasn’t surprised. \nAm I the asshole?!? Since these two are both poly it seems like we should be cool but we are roommates so I’m not sure if that changes anything. On the flip side I’m really enjoying exploring this aspect of my sexuality with someone I know and trust. \nDiscuss \nPs: if anyone from the house is reading this apologies for airing our biz we can talk about it next house meeting and it was me not the cat making those noises.

      "description": "It's worth mentioning I'm a 23 year old male and my mother is medicated bipolar with borderline personality disorder. \n\nIn August I was living at home and everything was seemingly fine. All until my mom stopped smoking weed (which she has been for 15 years  straight). My guess is her medication that she ended up with was adjusted to account for that, because she went manic and started getting EXTREMELY irritable. She started to \"clean\" my already very clean room without my permission (that has never happened before). But I soon found out how bad she actually was.\n\nShe was just searching through my things every day, because she was convinced I was doing heroin. Her main evidence was a small black chunk of something, that I never got the chance to see and an set of sewing needles. Now I've literally never done anything close to heroin but I'm pretty sure you can't use sewing needles for that. I came home one night to her in my room going through everything that belonged to me. She accused me of \"cooking\" and doing drugs. Needless to say I was highly offended and argues til the bitter end. Even my dad wouldn't get my back because he didn't want to deal with her insanity.\n\nThat all happened the first week of September. And that night, I left home and didn't go back. I stayed on friends couches for a month until I could afford my own apartment. In the time between when I left and now, she's been hospitalized twice (and is still acting insane) and forced my dad out the house that he pays the mortgage on (she doesn't have a job). The only one left living with her is my brother because he feels bad for her.\n\nShe texts me all the time and I never respond. I think that she still believes I'm on heroin, but I really just would rather not deal with her at all. Anytime I need to tell her something I call my dad and make him do it. She recently showed up where I work to try and talk to me. I wasn't at the office at the time but my coworker had to deal with her for over half an hour, I think she was waiting for me. I told my dad I would call the police if she does that again, for stalking and harassment. Things are actually going good for me, I've got a decent job, a girlfriend, and my own place. Idon't care about her well being anymore, I just want to focus on my own life without her in it. AITA for that?\n\nTLDR; My mother has been crazy for months and nobody in my family can take it. AITA for completely giving up on her?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my in laws to quit shaming my three year old or are they the assholes for ignoring me afterward?",
      "description": "\n I had an amicable relationship with my in laws of 5 years then I saw them discipline my then 3-year-old in a way I did not like. While they were watching my two daughters (3 and 1), the older girl threatened to hit her little sister with a block when she knocked her tower down. My in laws response was to say they didn't play with \"mean\" \"bad\" girls and leave the room, ignoring her. When i came back from work, my daughter was crying and confused, sitting on the floor quietly. I asked what happened and my mother in law relayed the story nonchalantly--Oh we just told her we don't play with bad mean girls.\" \n\nI told my in laws I did not like that discipline tactic. She acted taken aback. I left to go back to work, and decided to explain my reasoning via text. I said: \n\n\n\"Thanks for everything. I appreciate you being with the girls. I always know they're safe. If M hits with anything, take it away. Tell her it's not OK. Try to validate and label her feelings. You're mad. That is frustrating, but we don't hit.\" I want her to feel understood and accepted while also knowing the behavior is not OK. She is OK. She is loved. But the behavior is NOT allowed.\" She responded by saying, \"I've always done what you say, just like I've always done what Christy (my ex sister in law) says.\" \n\nThis is where I might have taken it to far. I had just talked to my other ex sister in law (My husband has two brothers, and both of their wives have left them because they say they are narcisisstically abusive, but that's another post.). My ex sister in law had told me that my in laws talked bad about me on the regular, saying I had \"issues,\" and \"ways\" with the girls that were annoying. So I said: \n\n\"I know you have, but I also know that you can be put out by it. I talked to Rachel O last week and she said you always said how I \"have my ways\" in a deprecating tone. I understand we have different methods. I'm sorry if I've ever made you feel judged by your style. I think you guys are great. But I also don't think withholding affection and love for bad behavior is a good parenting tactic. Shame-based discipline can have toxic affects.\" Then I linked her to an article. \n\nThis post is not about whether you agree with my discipline method. It's what I choose to do and what Id like anyone who watches my kids to try. It works. \nThis is about whether I was too harsh with my wording, and whether their response was appropriate. After relaying my preferences and stating my boundary, my in laws responded by saying they would never be able to live up to my standards, that i wanted them to watch the kids with their hands tied behind their backs and that they no longer feel comfortable watching my kids since I think they dont love them.....\n\nThey said they would not be alone with the girls again. However, a week later, my MIL said she would still watch my girls while I finished my internship even though my FIL wouldnt like it (it was his idea to refuse to watch the girls).\nSince this happened, my FIL has called my husband griping about me, saying I have them all walking on eggshells and that he isnt going to smile and pretend to his granddaughters that \"mommas always right when she's not.\" He also listed a bunch of minor grievances that he had said nothing to me about (I let my three-year-old walk on the handicap ramp, the baby played by and on the bottom of the stairs one day, and he thinks I'm underfeeding the kids, etc.)  I tried to both call him and talk to him in person. When I called, and texted he rejected and ignored me, then told my husband to tell me to write a letter, and he would write a letter back--that he didn't want me to \"twist his words,\" and he wasn't going to pretend I was right in front of my daughters anymore. \n\nI then tried to talk to him in person, but when I enter the room and greet him, he gets up and leaves without acknowledging me at all. When i pick up the girls after a visit, my FIL stays in the room until I arrive then when I say hi to him, he looks away and walks into another room.\n\nI am pretty stunned and annoyed at his behavior because I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but I feel oddly punished. i asked my SO to stick up for me and he says it's not his business and he thinks his dad is trying to avoid conflict in the best way he knows how. I disagree completely. I think he is being immature and is intentionally creating conflict in order to be judged as a victim and right.  He also called his other son, my husband's older brother and told him how I overreacted about their discipline strategies, and that brother text me, griping me out about it and telling me I dont know what it's like to have a healthy family because I come from a broken home. \n\nIm temped to not bring my kids over there anymore, so they don't have to see their mother being actively ignored for what I see as no reason, but I'm not sure if that is too extreme.\n\nI had liked my FIL OK before, or at least tolerated him, but now i think he has problems with strong women. He has called my former sister in law a slut and a bitch behind her back before. Id found it repugnant and pathetic at the time, and now his word choice seems targeted more at women in general than that one specific woman. My FIL, MIL and their sons all say my ex sister in laws are \"crazy\" and \"bitches,\" and that the boys treated them wonderfully, but they \"used\" them... The SILs have different stories, of course. \n\nAnyway, who is the asshole here? Me for stating my boundaries? Them for making a giant stink about it and ignoring me?\n\n",

This trip is going to take place in the late summer. I told my girlfriend about this and of course I invited her. And yes, my sister was ok with her coming along as well.\nWhen I told my girlfriend about this she wasn't happy for me that I finally get to go and do something that I have dreamed about for a long time. She got upset because I didn't run it by her first and make sure she could get the time off. I told her that I would love for her to try to get the time off and come with but if she couldn't make it I was still going to go. It isn't easy for her to get time off where she works, but this is also the only time I can go because my sister will be on vacation then as well. Now my girlfriend is just getting pissed about it and is saying I can't go if she can't go. I told her that if I was in the same position as her I would be upset if I couldn't go too but I wouldn't stop her from doing something she wants to do.\nAm I the asshole here for going even if she can't?",

      "description": "My girlfriend of about a year sleeps pretty much most of the time I go to see her. She has thyroid disease and I’m pretty sure that makes her sleep more, but it just kinda irks me whenever I go over and she sleeps. I haven’t said anything to her about it, I haven’t called her out on it because that would be really insensitive and it’d be an asshole move. But internally it just kinda makes me demotivated to see her and kinda annoys me. Especially, ill get home after she slept the whole time and I’ll usually hop on my computer to relax and play some games with some buddies (we talk on discord) and she’ll want to FaceTime which makes me have to end the call with my buddies. Again, I haven’t verbally said anything to her, I wouldn’t want to be insensitive to her medical condition, it’s just something that annoys me. AITA for feeling this way?",

      "description": "A couple of weeks ago, a few of my friends and I went to see the Lego Movie 2 in theaters. Almost as soon as the movie started, a row or two in front of me a young child, maybe 3 years old judging by his voice, began screaming. His Parents shushed him and calmed him down, which was a relief.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later he started screaming again. Same thing, his parents calmed him down again.\n\nThis repeats over and over, every few minutes throughout the movie. Each time I get angrier, but I keep it together. I look to my friend next to me each time this happens, and see that he is annoyed as well.\n\nAbout two thirds of the way through the movie the kid starts screaming again and I can't take it anymore.\n\nI yell \"YOU'RE RUINING THE MOVIE\" in hopes that one of the parents would finally remove the child from the theater.\n\nThis was the first and only time I have yelled at anyone in a movie theater. In the past, any time I experienced a noisy child in a movie theater, their parents were quick to take them outside to keep them from ruining everyone else's enjoyment. \n\nDuring the rest of the movie, they try to quiet their kid down by playing a movie on their phone at FULL BRIGHTNESS AND FULL VOLUME. To be fair, it did keep the kid quiet. But it still completely ruined the experience for me.\n\nAs soon as the movie ended and we began to leave, the mother glared at my friends and I (I assume she didn't know which of us yelled at her). \n\nOutside the theater, my friends are all mad at me. They say that the kid was a minor inconvenience but not a big deal, and my visceral reaction ruined the end of the movie for them.\n\nI get that it's a kids' movie, but I still don't think it's acceptable to ruin the movie for everyone else because you don't want to take your kid outside. Everyone else payed $14+ for the movie and it seems really self centered and rude to think that your kid being in the movie theater is more important than other people's enjoyment.\n\nI know I didn't handle it in the most mature or effective way, but I still believe that I was justified in yelling at them. Am I the asshole?",

I agree, i never really minded paying.\n\nLittle bit of an awkward hiccup but the rest of the meeting is pretty okay, we promise to stay in touch and continue the conversation when we go home.\n\nSkip to a couple weeks later, shes routinely ignoring my messages and given poor responses so i decide to get her attention by sending  my account details along with a joke, i receive one of these \" 🙄 \" and that was the last message i ever got from her, been about 5 months since.\n\nI've asked multiple people about this and so far the responses are pretty mixed. So am i the asshole?\n\nTLDR; hung out with a friend, asked her to pay, still paid and am now being ignore by said friend",

My boyfriend persists we should only cut it out and eat the rest still, but toasted. I feel uncomfortable doing that because I've been taught differently, so I usually say \"If you like it, you can eat it, but I will get a new loaf.\"\n\nThat often makes him quite mad, he's telling me that I get to eat all the fresh foods while he has to eat the stale, half mouldy stuff.

Furthermore, one of us asked him before we started planning if he'd be against us going, cause we felt bad going without his permission. He, without a doubt said we should go and not worry about this. \n\nNow we did go, and that friend is pissed at us. I'm a very good friend of his, so I obviously care. But, I'm not sure if we really did wrong by going? I told him before his exams started that if he needed help I'd love to help, to which he said thanks and that he'll manage, and I said I'm here to support. But I don't think that or anything else makes me morally obliged to stay. I was willing to stay and help had he needed my help, but I felt me staying 3 hour drive away from him while he takes the tests is... Kinda useless, and only makes us, the friends, bored.\n\nI'm truly asking for feedback to ask if I'm in the wrong here, and I've let him down as a friend or if he's being pissed over something he shouldn't be. Thanks guys, don't be too harsh just honest and suggest tips to help mend the situation! &lt;3",

She always feels the need to sleep without pants, shes usually without pants in general, but not just pantsless, no, full commando. When shes on her period, she doesn't wear a pad, because how could she? She just pops a tampon in and hopes for the best. Surely enough, every time, my sheets look like a scene out of a murder mystery because it overflowed the tampon. Now, this wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact she works mornings, meaning she wakes up 30 minutes before she has to leave and just leaves it there. She says she'll take care of it when she gets home, but its blood, it'll be completely soaked in by then. I admittedly haven't asked her about wearing a pad to bed, but frankly, I'm tired of having to wake up at 7 am to clean blood out of the sheets and having to run to the store for more bleach. \n\nI just can't stand sleeping in a pool of shredded uterus juice and then having to clean it because she can't recognize that she should wear better prevention.

In fact, I’ve even participated in a few of her practices, like visiting a spiritual leader. Other times I’m not interested, or think what she’s doing is bogus, but I’ve never attacked her beliefs. More recently though she’s started seeing a woman who has been assisting her through life and I’m honestly happy she’s improving herself every day. However recently she was given a couple motivational tapes to listen to and she’s been pressuring me to listen to them as well. I tried telling her I’m not interested, and I don’t feel lost in anyway that would entice me to look for advice. She told me the people who need to listen are those who think they aren’t lost but actually are. After continuing to push me I begrudgingly accepted but when she noticed I wasn’t really paying attention she turned it off and angrily walked away.\n\nAm I the asshole? I understand they’ve helped her a lot but I don’t think this format of self improvement works for me.",

I had a 55 minute flight on one of those little planes that you take a ramp and stairs to get into. The seats are small and my legs don’t fit as it is, plane is full, and 5 minutes into takeoff, the person in front of me (male, mid 30s,5’8) reclines his chair all the way back ruining any hopes of a comfortable flight. \n\nI politely asked him if he could move his seat back up since it’s less than an hour flight and he started giving me attitude telling me it wasn’t his issue and he finds the seats more comfortable arched back. I told him I was 6’5 and didn’t have leg space as it was. These arguments went back and forward for about a minute until a flight attendant had to come in and ask him to move it back. He finally moved his seat back up but he seemed genuinely mad that I had asked him to for more space and a flight attendant ended up siding with me. It’s been bothering me all day, so now I want to know, \n\nTLDR; AITA for asking a random person to move their seat up on a 55 minute plane ride because I didn’t have leg space?",

My neighbor who we'll call Serena confessed that she had feelings for me and that she thought I was cute. One day, a few days before my 21st birthday she knocked on my door and said she was going out and asked if I wanted anything. I said no. Later that night when she came home I found a box of chocolate and a card inviting me up to her apartment for coffee the next day. So I go up to her apartment for coffee and we chat for a little bit and the she asks if she can kiss me. I said yes and then she orders us lunch. At like 8 pm it's getting late but she wants to have sex with me. I said yes, only because I was getting over a really bad break up. A few days later I tell a few of my \"friends\" in confidence about the encounter and it gets out so an investigation is launched and she's almost fired. AITA for almost getting her fired? ",

      "description": "Ok so me and my friend became friends when I was in 10th grade and he was in 9th grade. We had gotten along quite well and grew close, but I have graduated recently and moved away 2 and a half hours away. Well we had planned for me to pick him up, and him come down and our mutual friends would come later and we'd go to the beach. \n\n  Well we get here, and he's alright we shoot the shit and get along. A few day passes and everyone else shows up to my house, and we go to the beach. We have a party there for 12 hours during the last 5 hours sober up and come home. At the beach he started to punch himself hard \\*he's slightly bipolar\\* and he's doing this in front of kids who then scream and run away. I go to help him, but I'm kind of fucked up, so when I approached I was going to be friendly. But when I got to him I was just like this is ridiculous. I know he has slight problems, but I knew him and couldn't seem to justify that self harm and making a scene in front of kids.\n\n  Things are now tense and we go home. I try to lighten the mood, but we would just start arguing. We are now home, and I lie in the bath to chill. While I'm chilling he comes in the bathroom without knocking and goes \"hey I'm going to mcdonald's you want anything?\" This causes my ears to perk up because he is broke. His dad gave him 40 for money to give me for gas and to buy him food over the week. At that time I was like \"where did you find the money?\" to which he informs me my wallet. He then ask if it's his. At the time I was like no it's my money for bringing you here and taking care of you. I'll need the money for gas to take him back. It wasn't till afterwards I realized that that meant he went through my wallet and took money on the hunch it was his.\n\nThis annoys me, but he's a bit of a airhead so I roll my eyes and try to carry on. Later in the night he makes himself a mixed drink by himself. I was sure that day to make sure no one got too messed up, so I saw he had one drink and thought that was ok. No after 10 mins he couldn't even stand up without falling almost knocking over the tv. He must have added 6 shots to his mixed drink. I smelt what was left, and it was bad. Then the rest of the night he was throwing his body around, talking in whispers saying how he should kill himself, and being really touchy feely with other people at the party who were uncomfortable about him. Me and my girlfriend try to get him to go to sleep because he was knocking shit over at our apartment and breaking shit.\n\n   After getting him in the room he would come out every 5 mins almost knock something down be anxious, and say that me and everyone else was over reacting. We finally get him to go to sleep, and we end the bad day. Things got worse the next day once people lead me on what they had to deal with.\n\nOne of my friends go hey you know how we didn't want to share a room with him it was because he seemed rapey. All the girls said they got that vibe which I did too, but then I was informed by one of them that at the start of the day he was hoping once one of these girls got drunk they would finally sleep with him. He had been trying to get with this girl, but every time she had given him a hard hard hard no. But he was hoping that she would get drunk then he would try really hard to sleep with her. This didn't feel right with me especially after the night where he tried to get close to any girl at the party. \n\n I was then informed that they walked into on him just hitting her vape and hide it. This is after she hit this one guys vape because he saw it on the ground, and he said that that's not cool because it's expensive. To which once he said that he took one more hit and tried to hit it as hard and as long as he could. This made this guy made, but he ignored it. \n\n  Everyone wants him to leave early , but no one wanted to have him in the car. No one really wanted to do anything for him. Me and my girlfriend were the only one who would. Now that we aren't friends I see that he's just a moocher. He would try to drink any booze you have, try to get all of my unmentionables. All this without a thank you. I put up with him, and he stays the rest of the time there's still fighting he tries to drink more alcohol to which I said no because he said he didn't even remember anything from the last time he got drunk. We take him home, and I informed him he'll be welcome back if he gets help and stops being dependent on drugs and alcohol to stay happy and actually go get help for his bipolarity. \n\nToday he messages our group chat barging about how he has a job and such. Then he starts to say he's got some freshmen hoes to which he tells me are 13 14, and he's 17 and a half. He basically goes hey want to smoke weed in hopes of them sleeping him. He then brags about how the 13 year old then gave him a blow job. I inform him that in this state that is statutory rape and said \"she's too young to know what she wants and only wants to do that so you keep giving her drugs.\" He shrugs it off going he doesn't know that that was considered rape, so \"It's whatever.\". I bring up about the basic rape claim at the party to which he said he wouldn't consider that as rape if he got her drunk enough and got her to say yes. He was just being very scummy. I refuse to let him make me drop it, and he gets mad I say that's kinda what a rapist would say because he said he just wants to get laid doesn't matter how. He leaves the group chat and tells me that \"I'm just going to be on my own now.\" I then go oh fine then go ahead. He then says \"wow you're going to throw our friendship away like that.\" Then he blocked me and here we are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short I had a greedy friend who did some creepy rapey things. I confront him he gets mad. Says \"I'm just going to be on my own now.\" I say ok he accuses that as throwing away our friendship. AITA",

      "description": "For context, I am in an open relationship with my partner.\n\nA few months back I was looking into hooking up with someone I met off tinder, we can call him Tyler. I gave him my phone number. We chatted a bit and he said that he would be okay with a friendship or a FWB situation. Okay, cool. I start making plans to meet up with him to have sex. Then I get into a car accident and I didn't really speak to him for a good month or so while dealing with the aftermath until he contacted me again. We spoke maybe once every few weeks after that, just mundane stuff, but it began to become clear that he was not in a very good place mentally. He still seemed like an okay person who had some of the same interests that I do, so I was open to the idea of a friendship.\n\nEarlier this week, I hooked up with a completely unrelated dude off tinder. I then decided that I probably would just stick to sleeping with my partner. \n\nTyler messages me today asking if we can meet up. I tell him that I am no longer interested in a FWB situation, but if he would like to get to know me as a friend I would be cool with that. He said that he was \"antisocial and would not be at all comfortable being friends without benefits\" because he was uncomfortable around people in general.\n\nNow I was a bit tipsy at the time and this sort of raised some flags, and normally I would have just not responded. I told him that what he basically said was that he would refuse to associate with me unless we had sex, which is kind of a dick move considering that he said that he was open to a friendship prior, and that I wasn't sure that I wanted to associate with him anymore regardless. \n\nHe went on to say \"come back and talk to me when everyone in your life has abandoned you. Don't even pretend to know my situation\". I told him that I hoped that he would seek professional help and that his circumstances did not change the fact that he was being kind of a dick. He then said \"I said that we could be friends before, and you're taking it personally that I changed my mind and calling me a dick without trying to understand my situation\" to which I said \"I have every right to take it personally. Like I said, I hope you seek professional help. Please don't try to contact me again\" and then blocked his number.\n\nI feel like he legitimately does not understand the consequences of his actions, but is a legitimately toxic person. Was I an asshole in the way I handled this situation?\n\n(I'm still not fully sober so if some of that didn't make sense I do apologize)\n",

He would name one, then I would name one. It was intense to say the least. We were getting into the nitty gritty, some countries I'm sure many of you have never heard of. I needed this bad, so bad. He always beats me in this game, but not today. Not today. He said  \"Kyrgyzstan\" and then gave me a smug smile, because he knows he got me. I was out of countries to name, I was trapped. So I pulled out the Taiwan card. It was all I had left. Normally I try not to talk about politics with my roommate, especially when it comes to things like Chinese-Taiwan relations. But I was a desperate man, and desperate times call for desperate measures. As soon as I said it I could see his face turn red in anger. Now, I knew he would be a little upset, but honestly all I thought he would do is say, \"shut up\" or something and then end the game. But no, he got furious. He dumped water on me and started yelling at the top of his lungs. \"Calm down\" I said, but he would have none of it. He kept yelling and pushing me. This made me quite upset, because I don't see why someone should care so much over a stupid little thing like that. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Long story short, I needed to take time off work because of my depression, anxiety, and a bit of a breakdown stemming from death in the family and a miscarriage. It's been a few months, but I can comfortably do so because I have about $35k in savings. My boyfriend is mad at me for taking time off work, \"sleeping all day\" (according to him), and \"not doing anything\"- calling me lazy.\n\nI have been paying my half of rent, utilities, bills, and insurance in addition to continuing buying all the food (even to feed him). Plus I don't have any other insane expenses to worry about. I have CONTINUED to cook, clean, do all the dishes each night, laundry and take care of HIS daughter (whether he is home or not) just as I have done for the past three years. The only thing I have slacked on is folding laundry. That's just because he tries on typically 3 outfits each day, trying to decide what to wear, and then throws them on the ground- so it's just a tiring, excessive cycle.\n\nI sleep until his daughter gets home from school due to 1) because of insomnia, it takes me about 2 hours to fall asleep ANY time I get woke up and 2) he absolutely has no respect if I'm sleeping (day or night) and will wake me up by flipping the light on, not even bother to leave the room to make phone calls, etc and wakes me up atleast 3 times per day 3) he gets me up at 5am to cook him breakfast, and then I need to get his daughter up for school at 7:45.\n\nI don't ask for money. I pay well over my half. I do all the chores. Aita for not working at the moment and needing to sleep in to 2pm like he makes me seem?",

The waitress didn’t offer a gift card, so I told her this and she seemed really sad and the manager was walking by and she seemed disappointed as well. I asked our waitress if she would get dinged for not offering us a gift card and she didn’t say no, she just said it’s her fault for not offering one. I feel like most people probably don’t use the offer on that piece of paper and now I feel bad for even asking for the free tacos, I feel scummy. I don’t know, I just hope I didn’t ruin her night. After typing this out it feels more trivial than it did in the moment but I still feel bad and I’m wondering if it’s an asshole thing to do to take advantage of these types of offers and makes the servers look bad.

      "description": "My SO isn't calling me TA for this but decided to discuss my mom with me.\n\n\nMy mom turns 52 this year. My whole life my mom has been obese, if not morbidly. Her diet is soda, sweet tea, chips, candy, and fast food. She lives in a dirty house where her dogs all pee and poop everywhere. Smokes at least half a pack a day.\n\n\nIn the past I tried to talk to her. Let's exercise together, let's eat better together, and I used to talk to her about smoking as well. Her reasons are her knee keeps going out so she can't exercise, she doesn't like rabbit food, and she'll gain more weight if she stops smoking.\n\n\nSince I moved out I had a son. My SO and I briefly moved in with her while i was pregnant but moved out again after I realized how hopeless it was trying to exist with her. I was drowning in housework trying to make it a livable condition. I was even afraid of the day my unborn child would inevitably get pissed on by a dog or crawl towards a hidden pile of poop and try to teeth on it.\n\n\nI've even guilted her asking if she wanted to go with him to the zoo but mobility is such an issue. She wouldn't want to rent a wheelchair nor does she want one to own. I talk about cooking with her but she exclaims she hates it. Her brother is dead after a long battle with diabetes from their similar lifestyles. He dropped the weight but it still got him in the end. She sees the consequences. She sees that she can't do fun things with her grandchildren unless it's a grocery trip to Wal-Mart where she uses a scooter.\n\n\nI've accepted the inevitable. She even jokes with me that I better hope she drops before she's retired because she has life insurance through both her job and an independent company. I wouldn't be surprised if she had a major mental illness that is helping to promote her struggles. As far as I know, I can't do anything aside from somehow convincing her to move in with me so that I can cook for her, but it's more likely she would reject the food and go buy something instead.\n\n\nI feel like I've done as much as I can, and will continue to discuss her habits when relevant but she is a grown woman who can make her own choices.

      "description": "We have been together for 1 year in total, and half of which we are in long distance relationship between Europe and Asia, from July 2018 until now.\n\nWe met in university but I (23F) have graduated to work back home in Asia and he (20M)’s still studying. I have visited him once in December during Christmas and we have been talking about him coming to my city during summer in June after his exams. We’ve been discussing who would fund his tickets since he doesn’t have savings and he only works part-time once a week for a few hours. He said it’d be his parents but I kinda knew that they wouldn’t be happy because it’s not cheap to fly him all the way from Europe to Asia.\n\nAnd up til now, he’s told me that his parents can’t sponsor his travel at all because:\n\n1. They are not comfortable with him flying to see me (either the danger of being in a long haul flight or a foreign continent) \n\n2. The flights are too expensive that they can’t afford them,\n\nso meaning he can’t come to see me in the summer, and we aren’t sure when are we seeing each other.\n\nI’m more shocked and angry than sad because I know his family is financial comfortable and even if they can’t spare a whole £500 for a return flight, they can perhaps chip in and give him incentives to earn money for this trip, instead of shooting the whole idea down. \n\nMy boyfriend consulted me to see if I or my family can fund him. Out of rage and shock, I said no, not because I cannot afford it but because I think it’s his financial responsibility to save up for this trip, the same way as I traveled to see him. And that it wouldn’t be fair for me or my family to bear 100% of the cost, including his expenses for me hosting him in the first place, as I am saving up for my master studies too. \n\nAITA for not paying for his flights though I can afford it?

      "description": "I've been friends on and off with someone , let's call him Mike for 10 years or so. We have a shared interest in gaming and often get together with other friends. \n\nMike unfortunately has a tendency to have outburst when he loses games or someone plays a game a way he doesn't approve of. One time I invited a new friend over only for him to yell at him when he lost a game. When I confronted him over this, he admitted to having a form of autism which causes him to have fits of anger and other issues. \n\nFor awhile I tried to be more understanding but I constantly had to deal with the fact that often he would just act out and make things super awkward for everyone else there. I didn't want to not be his friend anymore because we would often get along well when he wasn't having his fits and I would feel like a dick cutting someone off with a behavioral disorder.\n\nOne thing that sort of irked me is that when I would bring things up that he did, he would always blame the autism, rarely apologize, and not really change much.\n\nRecently he lashed out at me over a very small arguement to the point of questioning if I am even a good friend to him.  That really bothered me because I have always been there for him , through his various medical, relationship and financial problems. I sort of lost it and told him I'm done dealing with his constant triggers and that he makes me feel like I'm walking on eggshells when I have him over. \n\nWe haven't spoken since and it's been over a month.  I know I should have brought up these issues before doing this but what's done is done. I definitely feel more relaxed having other friends over knowing I don't have to worry about him getting angry over something random. I do know that he doesn't have many other friends and I feel somewhat guilty over the whole thing . \n\nSorry for the possible formatting issues , I'm on mobile. \n\nTLDR: Autistic friend that often loses his temper finally pushed me over the edge and I have cut him off from my life. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm keeping this short.\nWe dated for alittle over a year and in that time I developed deep feelings for her. A year ago we broke up because I found out she was cheating on me. I admit it took a toll on me but we decided to stay \"friends\" mostly because we work together.\n   She ended up staying with the other guy and got pregnant. Our relationship after the breakup was mostly random text here and there and the occasional greeting when we saw each other at work. In the last few months she has been texting me more saying she made a mistake. That she hated her life and she regretted getting pregnant because she know her relationship isn't going to last.\n   At this point I don't have feelings for her. I just tolerate her because of work. A few days ago she had the baby early, it was only alittle over 1lbs. I recieved a bunch of messages from her saying how upset she was and how she wish things were different. I said congratulations and haven't messaged her since. I think she has been looking at me for support but honestly I don't remotely care about her or her newborn. In my mind she got herself in this situation, so its karma.\n   I do like kids and hope the best for her and the kid. I just dont care how she ends up or have any compassion for her or the kid.

      "description": "Some time ago, during the recent Counter-Strike GO major tournament, my girlfriend and I thought it would be fun to place a few bets on the games. We talked about sharing the wager 50/50. I said to her, that we shouldn't bet more than we could afford to lose, and she agreed. We agreed upon betting 10$ each, so 20$ total.\nFast forward to the day of the games. None of us actually placed the bets, and we only rembered at the last moment. She made an account on a betting site and placed the 20$ wager from her credit card. I told her I already had an account, but she wanted her own. Fair enough, I thought. Take note, I didn't reimburse her for my half.\nWe ended up doubling the money and had a lot of fun during the games. She controlled the account and live betting during the games, but we discussed the bets and best strategies together.\nFast forward again, to today. After dinner,  she mensioned she should remember to cash out the winnings. I told her she could just subtract the 10$ I owed her, and transfer the rest of my half to me. She looked at me, visibly confused and said something along the lines of: \"Your half? I made the bet on my own, so I should keep all the winnings.\". I disagreed and said that I thought we had a deal to make the bet together and share the winnings. She said that I wasnt a part of it because I didn't pay her back (I know I should have, but I honestly forgot about it). And that the initial deal was off, because I didn't take initiative to make the bet from my account before the games. Even though we didn't talk about the deal being off, she thinks it is obvious that it was.\nI don't care about the small amount of money and told her to keep it, but I feel like she broke a verbal agreement.\nAITA for feeling entitled to half the money?

Until he sat me down and told me that he was dumping me. I was so shocked and the last thing I wanted to do, was let him know I was hurt. So I acted relieved. That confused him, so I told him that I was glad he was ending things. I didn't think I ever loved him, but now I won't hurt him and we can still be friends. No worries.\n\nHe got so fucking mad, and said that NOW there's no way, we could EVER be friends. He wanted to be friends, until I said I never loved him.\n\nI didn't understand how he could be mad that I didn't love him, if he didn't love me? **Did he expect me to cry and beg for him to take me back?**\n\nThis was a couple weeks ago and we haven't talked since. I ran into his friend at a coffee shop and he paged the fuck out me. He said that what I told my ex \"seriously fucked him\". He doesn't sleep, or eat properly. He's behind in all his classes, and missed practices because of me. But I think it was probably more than just one comment I made. He called me an \"evil bitch\". I was in shock so I didn't say anything back. \n\nWhat I said wasn't true, but I needed to seem so unbothered by being dumped. He broke my heart, but I didn't want to show it. I don't understand it (because he, dumped me), but it doesn't change the fact that I hate he's feeling this way. I did want to hurt him a little, at the time, I won't lie. But I would never want him to be seriously hurt, for this long. There are probably other things going on I don't know about. I don't think he'd get this upset for a comment, especially if he dumped ME\n\nI don't even know why he broke up with me. \n\nSo AITA? Is it an asshole move if he wasn't sad over it?",

I thought we were just gonna hang out and go home the next morning, so I brought pajamas to wear and nothing else. Something to know about me, I have really bad social anxiety and I'm incredibly insecure, but I'm trying to work on it. My friends know this about me. \n\n     In the morning we woke up and they decided to run into the grocery store, I was really anxious because it was a Sunday and super busy but I sucked it up because they needed to go in. Normally I try to dress nice and keep up with my appearance so I was already uncomfortable when friend 1 said \"No offence but you look the least ready I've ever seen you\" and friend 2 laughed and agreed.\n\n     I know she was just joking but it really hurt my feelings, so after a minute of tailing behind them and trying not to cry I just walked out of the store and stood outside without telling them. When they realized I was gone friend 1 texted me asking where I was, I responded saying I went to the bathroom and to tell me when they're done. Friend 2 called me but I didn't answer, eventually friend 1 texted me saying they're in the car and where am I. \n\n     I walked back to the car, got in and asked if I could be drove home. Friend 2 asked me if I was okay and I just said no. I completely killed the mood at that point and the drive home was silent. When we finally got to my house, friend 2 said she was sorry if she did anything to upset me. I said it's okay, thank you for the ride.\n\n     I haven't heard from either of them since, I want to text them but idk what to say. I'm upset because I feel they don't take my anxiety seriously, but I feel like an asshole for handling it the way I did. They're my only friends and I don't want to fuck this up. ",

      "description": "Over the last few months, I’ve been crawling out of a bad episode of depression with overwhelming anxiety. Recently diagnosed with bipolar and have started new medication. On top of that, I have had a bunch of health problems that have landed me in the hospital, urgent care, and weekly visits to my primary doctor. It’s been a whirlwind of a winter and I’ve been going through a difficult time. \n\nMy best friend has two weeks off from work and planned a last-minute, cross-country trip. She’s planning to stop at a bunch of landmarks and parks that have been on my bucket list forever. With how hard this winter has been, I feel that it would be immensely helpful for my mental health and emotional well-being, and an opportunity to reignite my recently-lost passion for travel and adventure. \n\nMy boyfriend has also been going through a hard time. His dad was diagnosed with cancer, and though they removed the tumor and he’s now in remission, they’re doing radiation to make extra sure it doesn’t return. He’ll be starting that in a week. \n\nI’d also be missing my bf’s 30th bday while on the trip, but I was thinking of gathering cool keepsakes and presents while on the road and sending him a package that would arrive on his actual bday, and throwing him a big party when I return. \n\nWe’ve talked about it in depth and he has expressed that it would hurt his feelings, which I get. My mom thinks I’m being super selfish - and maybe I am, but I’m torn between taking care of myself and taking care of my BF. \n\nTL;DR: Working out of a major depressive episode and have been invited on an amazing 2-week trip with my best friend. Will miss BF’s 30th bday and his dad’s first days of radiation (though he is now in remission.) AITA?",

And I'm 24.\n\nWhen we were walking at night, there was a van driving with a huge menorah on it, and I was kinda amazed by that as I had never seen that before. This is what it looked like, except the menorah was at least two times bigger with lamps on each branch : [https://pittsburghorbit.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/menorah-mobile-man-with-van.jpg](https://pittsburghorbit.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/menorah-mobile-man-with-van.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I pointed it out, I said 'look! there's a jewish item on that truck, I think that's to celebrate hanukkah', as I didn't remember the exact term for the menorah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo my surprise she fucking death stared me and asked me 'why are you saying that?', I quickly responded with 'well that's the first time I'm seeing that, so it's kinda amazing!' and quickly changed the subject.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas I in the wrong here? I knew she had jewish origins, but I really didn't mind that at all and subsequently almost forgot about it, and it rushed to me after the incident. I felt really fucking bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Alright guys, I keep wavering back and forth between feeling in the right about this one and feeling like an asshole.\n\nBasic info: we’ve only been dating 5 months, he’s been friends with this girl for years. She currently lives in a different state than us.\n\nSo I’d like to think I’m the type of person who’s okay with my SO having opposite-sex relationships. But this particular friendship has made me uncomfortable.\n\nFrom what my bf has told me, this girl has had a crush on him since their high school days. She’s flirted with him heavily before we started dating (all his profile pics have at least one comment from her calling him attractive), and he’s told me himself that she sent him at least one nude a day right up until me and him started talking to each other.  When I asked him why she did that, he said “that’s just how she is.” Ok, whatever. They’ve had sex a couple of times in the past, but never dated. She’s asked him, more than once, to have a baby with her (from what I understand, this request was probably serious). He says he has no romantic feelings towards her, and I believe him. But this girl lives out of state now and still messages him daily. I guess they have a lot in common, but if she was sending him daily nudes and flirting with him within a month of us dating, surely there’s still feelings on her end?\n\nWhich brings me to my potentially asshole conversation with my bf. I told him their friendship made me uncomfortable and listed all the reasons above for why. He said he doesn’t really understand and that their relationship is platonic at the moment, and she lives in a different state anyway, so it’s not like he can physically cheat. We left the conversation without really resolving anything, and I still feel a type of way about it.\n\nSo... am I the asshole for feeling this way?",

We planned to hang out and unpack her stuff together, she then told me I didn't need to worry. A few weeks go by no contact and I'm at my bfs place about to go to dinner;\n\nHer: \"hey do you want to go clubbing tonight\"\n\nMe: \"sorry I already have plans with bf maybe another day\"\n\nAnyway another week goes by, again with my boyfriend and same thing happens. \n\nA week later, same thing. \n\nThe next day she messages me and has a go at me for \"spending too much time with bf\" and \"I've put no effort into seeing her since she moved\" so I explained that she can't continue to message me last minute because I need to make plans in advance and I'm not going to drop everything for her, it's rude to the people I make plans with. She even tried to throw our HEAVILY PREGNANT friend into it as well to make me feel guilty. So begrudgingly we organize the next weekend, I start planning a late surprise welcome back dinner and 2 DAYS BEFORE she pulls out because \"she's sick\"\n\nThe night before and I'm still hosting dinner anyway, I get a message from her low and behold\n\n9:45pm, \"do you want to go clubbing?\"\n\nIgnored her message and got a sob story the next day about how she had dumped her bf and \"wanted to feel wanted\" (ie \"come babysit me while I makeout with a stranger and go home with him while you find your own way home\")\n\nI've continued to ignore her messages from now on requesting to hang out because even after I said I needed her to plan in advance she still messages me at ungodly hours of the night wanting to go out. I don't want to spend time with her if she's not going to respect that I'm allowed to have other people in my life. \n\nI tried, you screwed it up, why should I have to give in if you won't learn?\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTldr: best friend messages me at ungodly hours to go clubbing last minute when I have plans, goes off at me because I haven't seen her since she moved and when I try she bails only to ask me again 2 days later, but I thought you were sick?

Everything was perfectly fine until he wanted go go home. \n\nHe had smoked a bit of weed and though he wasn't baked outside of his mind, he was a little high. I insisted he eat some grilled salmon and roasted asparagus I had cooked earlier and drink lots of water before heading home. \n\nAfter eating the aforementioned food, he was good to drive but he still insisted I follow him home to guide his way and make sure he was okay. \n\nAs I followed him, he began to accelerate far too fast and rolled through stop signs and lights, I began to honk at him to get his attention. He ignored all of these warnings. \n\nWhen we arrived at his house, I was furious. I jumped out of my car and began yelling at him in the empty parking lot by his apartment about how pissed I was that he insisted I follow him home and still ignored my warnings to pull over or slow down. He kept giving me platitudes of \"I'm sorry man.\"\"I won't do it again.\" \n\nWhen I tried to explain that this platitude was unacceptable, he kept interrupting me which caused me to say \"SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!\" He then tried to punch me and told me to never say that to him again. \n\nI got over the argument the next day, but he still refuses to talk to me.

Last time, the manger told us we had hit our limit but we informed him that the agreement is “all you can eat.”\n\nI was on my 9th plate when he came up to me, we had probably been there for about three hours. He was nice at first and goes on the spill about how they have the right to limit quantity in the TOS and that we have already went far over what the computer would give him credit for. He told us that most people “only eat 2-3 plates and they are stuffed.” He said he thanked us for our business but we could not have anymore food that night unless we paid for a second buffet, otherwise we needed to leave. \n\nSo I got up after he left the area and fixed another plate.  (At this point, I was pretty pissed off. Who is this mindless meathead trying to tell me what to do?) When he came back around and saw it, he told us we had to leave immediately and that if we came back and done it again then we would be banned from his location. \n\nAm I the asshole? I mean it’s an all you can eat buffet. It’s $65 for my family to eat there with drinks and dinner buffet. We always pay and tip the waitress. I plan on going back Friday night to put my foot down.

Even though I've only had 5 sessions. I'm not sure if I'll be going back, it's up to her.\n\n\nI mention the mental health issues because it's really hard for me to find work. I have social anxiey and haven't developed much socially (I was homeschooled), so finding work is hard. I'm suspecting other things but I didn't  rly get into it with my doctor.

      "description": "To preface I'm a 21M student and he's 19. Further background: my brother is the nicest guy in the world, but that's a double edged sword because hes a humongous fucking pushover.My brother has lived in an apartment for the better part of this year with his two bum ass friends, neither of whom work much or pay really any sort of bills at this apartment. These kids rely on my brother to work his ass off overtime so they can sit at home and eat junk food and play video games all day. One of them is the registered tenant with my brother and is consistently either late on rent/utilities and/or just doesnt pay and lets it Fall on my brother. Because he knows my brother is a pushover and will pay. These kids will go out to eat and MY BROTHER WILL SOMETIMES PAY. The other friend literally just crashes on their couch and lives rent free. The WIBTA is about this: my brother bought the couch-sleeper a fucking car. A $1600 car. And didnt tell our parents. His justification, due to his nice nature, was that \"couch-sleeper is a delivery driver, he NEEDS a car.\" Ok first of all, that doesn't fall to you. Second of all, he can FIND A NEW FUCKING JOB. Panera can find a new delivery driver this job isn't fucking curing cancer. Third and worst of all, my brothers car dies a week or two after he buys bum ass here a car, and now relies on him (and my parents, who live acrosstown from him) to get to and from work. I feel like i need to tell my parents about this situation but he told me about buying this car in confidence, trusting in me to not tell our parents. I don't want to betray his confidence, but I'm also angry at him for this outrageous expenditure on his buddies. Perhaps it's not my place but the dudes 19 and really hasnt seen or experienced much of the world yet and as his older brother i feel a duty to help him. I know it is ultimately his money, but as i said, the kid is 19. So, WIBTA for teling my parents/AITA for being mad about this in the first place?",

      "description": "Let me start by saying, I feel very strongly that it is my job as a parent to make sure I am helping my children become a positive contribution to society. \n\nBack story. My son is 16 when he decides he’s ready to start his driving course. Most of you know, this can be a lengthy process.  But, I was sensing some procrastination.  So, to make sure he was serious, I laid out a plan. Once he had found a part time job, I would help him start and pay for the drivers ed course.  \n\nNow, at this time, I had already found him a job as a farm hand working 8 hrs a month. This was great, but my point was for him to start saving.  This job was literally pocket change. \n\nIn my mind, having the responsibly of a vehicle came with many hidden costs. We gladly pay their insurance, but gas is all them and we split repairs. \n\nThis is where I became the AH... he was so mad at me. He has Aspergers and hates having to interact with strangers. He fought me on this daily, always coming up with an excuse as to why he “couldn’t” work. His big sis helped draft a fantastic resume and we started taking him around town to drop them off. We didn’t have much luck until one night when I was picking up dinner at one of our spots and I hit the owner up. She told me to send my son in and hired him on the spot the next day.   \n\nI was true to my word, and we started the drivers ed process immediately. But, he still brings it up regularly!? How ridiculous it was for me to set such expectations for him. The truth is, he’s not my last, and It will be the standard from now on.  ",

      "description": "I know the title makes it sound obvious but please read all this mess. All of this lasted a time frame of 10 years, I think that's probably important\n\nWhen I was in 4th grade I \"dated\" this guy. It was really more like we were friends, but I didn't like how he tried making me go to parties and tried getting me to kiss him, so we went back to being friends and then I moved away. In total I maybe knew him for a few months and we were kids so I didn't think much of it.\n\nBut he obviously did and when I was in 8th or 9th grade he started talking to my family members and friends trying to get in contact with me and I asked them to decline and it was alright for a while. I eventually caved after he asked another friend. I figured it was the only way it could end.\n\nBut the texts were just weird. It was really clear he had me on a pedastel. He kept talking about how smart and amazing I was even though he barely knew me back then and flat out didn't now. He also started comparing himself to my long term boyfriend. When I mentioned my boyfriend worked in the restaurant industry and loved it, he was all \"that's cool, I'm going to be getting a big internship at this big company this summer\". \n\nI stopped responding at that point, and after a few weeks of him messaging me \"I hope you're having a good week\" and \"I miss you\" I blocked his number.\n\nA month or so later I was creating a new Facebook. He sent me a request that night. My boyfriend had enough and messaged him. The guy said my profile just popped up in \"people you might not know\", which I just can't believe since we had no mutual friends, weren't in the same area, nothing. BF then said I was uncomfortable by everything, and Guy called me a child and said I should have said something myself sooner.\n\nEveryone has said he was a creep and should have gotten the hint years ago. But I'm just not sure after that final dig at me. AITA?",

      "description": "For context, my new wife and I have been dating for 8+ years. We just got married this past weekend. Her mom was super helpful during the wedding planning, including taking over a bunch of things that neither my wife nor I were willing to handle/plan. She was also a little overbearing, a sentiment my wife shares, and very insistent that she pay for a lot of things. I have no issue with her paying for anything, but I wanted to avoid a quid pro quo whereby she used her payment for things to leverage an unwanted opinion about the day. I wanted to make it clear it was our day and not her mom’s. In a few instances for the wedding, her mom tried to “get her way” by cornering me or calling me and asking me to give her permission to do something, and when I’d respond by telling her I’d have to clear it with my partner, she’d keep asking and asking and asking to wear me down. I heard her do the same thing with my wife-to-be at the time, and she would generally give in and let her MIL “win” so to speak.\n\nAnyways, after the wedding her mom was prying about how much money we made from the wedding to both of us and I shut that shit down quick. I politely told her we didn’t know and hoped she’d drop it. She didn’t drop it, instead she just kept asking and asking and asking and asking my wife until she relented, and told her mom she’d give her the information about how much money people gave us. I told my wife I wasn’t willing to share personal information from our wedding with anyone, and that included her mom. There’s no good reason in the world for her to need it, and she found out I wasn’t willing to share the information so she “divided and conquered” and made my wife agree to do it without me. AITA?",

      "description": "Here is the background of the situation, me and my mom never had a good relationship to start off. Around the age of 14, my mom and dad had a nasty divorce that ultimately split the family in half. I have 4 sisters, 2 older and 2 younger and I am the only son. My sisters left with my mom and I decided to stay with my dad. \n\nThe reason I decided to stay with my father was because one night he came into my room just crying. Telling me he has no one else left in this world except me. That night I promised to be by his side no matter what and always be there for him. I can see that my mom hated me for choosing to stay with my father. \n\nSkip a few years later and I’m 17 and living with my father still. Over the years my father slowly started drinking his pain away and it took a toll on him and me. He became an abusive father telling me that I remind him of “Her” which is my mom but I stayed because I loved my dad and I promised to be with him no matter what.\n\nI tried to keep in touch with my sisters however my mom hated that idea. I felt like my mom brainwashed my sisters to hate me for choosing my dad over her but I didn’t care. I tried to talk to my sisters over the phone, drive to their place and hang out with them because they were still my family. Except one day I went over to my moms house to see my sisters and my mom, however she pulled me aside privately telling me its best to stay away from them because I would bring my dads influence and I won’t be a good role model to my younger sisters. She told me that she doesn’t want to see me around ever and to stop hanging around my sisters and that broke my heart. \n\nA year later I turned 18, and things just got worse, my dad became more angrier with the world and I was scared everyday locking my room, sometimes I’ll just spend nights in my car just to get away because I was afraid of what he becomes when he drinks. One day I just couldn’t take it anymore, I decided to pack my things and just leave because I don’t have a family anymore. I asked one my online video game buddy who lived 4 states away from me, if he would take a stranger into his home. He told me that I am family and he welcomed me into his family. \n\nThe day I decided to leave I told my dad that I’m leaving and I’m never coming back. The look he gave me, I could tell his soul just dropped out of his body. He just looked dead. I packed what little I had and went into my car. Lastly, I went to my moms house and she was there alone and my younger siblings were at school. I told her that I’m leaving and I’m not coming back to this f#cked up family. That day she asked me if I finally got tired of my dads shit and just told me to she doesn’t want to see me either. I just felt disgusted and just depressed. I tried to a be a son to my mother and father, I tried to be a brother but I just couldn’t do it anymore.  That day I left to my friends home driving 21 hours straight, just crying. I arrived at my friends house and a week later I get a call from my uncle that my father committed suicide. I was devastated and blamed myself for his death because I promised to never leave his side.\n\nYears later I’m 23, it’s been 5 years and not once I received a call from my mom or my sisters about my whereabouts or how I’m doing.  They didn’t bother come looking for me, nothing. Except one day my younger sister found me on social media and texted me through Facebook. She told me mom had developed pancreatic cancer and doesn’t have much time left. I kept in contact with my younger sister because I still gave a damn about my family deep inside me. I would text her about how everyone is doing, especially how was mom doing. We exchange numbers and we would call each other here and there. \n\nOne day I get a call from my younger sister and it happens to be my own mother. She tells me that she isn’t doing so good, she doesn’t know how much time she has left and apologizes for being a bad mother towards me. She told me she wishes she could see me one last time before she passes away and in that moment, what she said just destroyed me. I responded by telling her No, I won’t come see you and that this is what she wanted and I just hung up the phone.  Days later i get a call from my younger sister telling me that mom passed away and was crying a lot and I’m an asshole for not being there for my own mom, I told her that she doesn’t understand what I’ve been put through and I haven’t talked to my younger sister ever since then. \n\nTL: DR: My mom’s dying wish was for me to come see her before she passes away, I told her no because of our past differences and my younger sisters tells me I’m an asshole and haven’t spoke to me since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Maybe I'm in the wrong place, I don't post to Reddit often. Sorry for any formatting issues and all that.\n\nBack story: years ago I had an account with Verizon wireless. At one point I called them to cancel the account which, as far as I was aware, was not under contract. They cancelled the account for me and then sent me a bill for around $900 in early termination fees and what not. The account went to collections as I argued with Verizon and then eventually they just stopped contacting me and it just sat on my credit report. \n\nFast forward to today when I received a letter from the collection agency they sold my debt to. The letter basically said I could pay $300 to settle the account and have it removed from my report. Since I'm hoping to buy a house in the near future I figured I'd finally bite the bullet and just pay it and be done. \n\nI went to their website and entered the information provided to access my account and in reviewing it they have a place holder phone number and a birthday that is definitely not mine. The birthday they have listed would have made me 12 years old at the time the account was closed. Considering I had the account for 2-3 years that would mean I was 9 or 10 upon opening it. \n\nIt definitely has my name on it and to access it I had to verify my social. In order to fix their mistake they want me to mail them a copy of my social security card, drivers license, AND birth certificate.\n\nAITA if I dispute the account even though I know it was mine?\n\nTL;DR: account went to collections during contract dispute, now the collection agency has incorrect personal information and Im considering disputing it to see if they'll remove it instead of paying.",

      "description": "I’ve been friends with him for 15 years—let’s call him “T.” Well, T was the first friend I made when I moved to NC from NY and he proposed to his girlfriend a few months ago.\n\nOf course I’m excited for him and, naturally, he asked me to be one of the groomsman in his wedding. I said yes, but I’m having hesitations and here is why: I’m one of those people that likes pretty much everyone I come into contact with, I’m easy to talk to and love people in general. But I absolutely cannot **STAND** his fiancé.\n\nIf you’ve ever seen the movie Dirty Grandpa, she is the literal embodiment of Julianne Hough’s character; bossy, two-faced, immensely selfish, materialistic, controlling. Basically your run-of-the-mill haughty taughty bridezilla.\n\nAn example of this was yesterday. I went over to their apartment to drop off a tool T had left in my car. So after about 15 minutes of me being there, here comes his fiancé. She walks in with this attitude, barely says two words to me or him, then leaves to go to class. So I ask T what’s wrong and apparently she’s all pissy at him because he said he didn’t want to go out to dinner. Now, they go out to eat a few times a week, but he’s a welder who is (currently) on his 13th day straight of working. Of course he doesn’t want to fucking go out to eat. The man was about to pass out next to me because he’s so exhausted. She even started to bitch and complain when I brought my Xbox over to show him Red Dead.\n\nOn top of that, I can’t even invite T out for a drink with one of the other groomsman in the wedding because she would have something to say about it. It’s a constant feeling of walking on eggshells and I hate it. I feel like I’ve lost my best-friend because she’s striped him down into something he isn’t and I feel like he’s settling.\n\nI haven’t spoken to him about this yet because I don’t know how he will react. I want to be there for him on his wedding day but I wouldn’t feel right handing my best friend over to someone like her. With that said, how should I approach this and WIBTA if I did?",

I like meeting my new friends (being 30-ish finding new friends outside work is hard), however my wife is furious. She is a strong defender of women's rights and thinks that if they (=the club) continue with their all-men-policy, I should quit the club in order to have her back on this topic. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to leave this circle of friends? I also support gender equality, and although this club is men only, I'm sure there are similar groups for women. \n\nMy wife's point of view is that simply by participating in this club, I am working against her beliefs and what she is fighting for.

      "description": "So last July, I lived in China in Shanghai. Browsing tinder I found a canadian born chinese and we started talking, she was travelling china with her family. After a few weeks chit chatting, more as friends, she was a city away so I decided to meet her. She was alone as her friends went to Beijing so we had the time to ourselves and she had a hotel.\n\nThe plan was to just be friends and I didn't see the problem, I wasn't really looking for anything I made it clear, she was the same. Well I felt we didn't click, she would say how much jokes aren't funny, be angry if I spoke chinese because she was unable to speak chinese and it just felt dull.\n\nShe left and I stayed and we talked for a few weeks, she asked if we could date or something, I said sure since I expected she wanted just someone to talk to, big mistake. Things got really busy for me so I couldn't reply to her for the day and I found 11 missed calls and many audio messages, she then stalked my social media asking who my ex was etc. She said it's normal, middle school gossip etc. and \"instinct\".\n\nWell I didn't find it amusing so basically told her I can't do this, I have a lot of stress in my life and this isn't something I need, I have a lot of family issues in Europe as well as working two jobs. I explained and she basically ignored what I said. Continuing to message and stalk my instagram. I ended up blocking her when it was 2am tehre and by the time I made a coffee she messaged me saying how dare I block her.\n\nIt continued so I blocked her on all social media, except wechat (chinese facebook) I have no idea why but when she says how upset she was I felt bad but I never replied to her.\n\nWell this continued and I met someone recently, she found out by using an alt account to stalk my instagram and messaged her. We had a pregnancy scare together and I told the stalker \"look I'm having this, please just stop\". Well she told her how I dont want the kid and google translating stuff in her native language.\n\nWell now she's got a flight from toronto to the UK. She is now in London, I'm an hour away and she's begging me to meet for \"closure\". I explained how it was one date, how can you need closure. She said she was so stressed etc she skipped her period and says she needs it.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nTL:DR My transatlantic stalker took an 8 hour flight for me. What should I do",

      "description": "My (24 yo) girlfriend has been having stomach issues for the past year. I have begged her to go see some kind of medical help, but didnt push because she's afraid of needles and the issue only came around once a month or so. This is prior to us dating. Now that we are dating, her stomach issues have become several times a day and daily. The issues are debilitating pain and the only relief she gets is from taking a hot shower. This means we are limited to just staying home and watching TV, because any attempt to go out means risking not being able to get her in a shower immediately. On Tuesday her parents convinced her to go to a hospital. They ran a few tests but she was incredibly sick and the only answer they could come up with was esophagitis (no shit. She had been throwing up for 2 days!). Any way, the nurse said they need her to eat and show that she can keep down a meal and she will be discharged in the morning. Her mom comes over and she tells her mom she cant eat and asks her mom to eat her food for her. She herself eats 1 bite of jello and her mom ate the rest. She was discharged the next morning and is still sick. I chastised her for lying to the staff and that she isn't trying to get better and it's not fair to expect me to be content with staying at her parents house with her every time I want to see her. That we cant have a date night. Hell even our sex life is diminished because she's always sick. ",

Now here we at 1 year later. \n\nNow this doggo was my mother’s fiancés dog. My mother kicked the dog out after she got sick and starting puking and pooping everywhere so me and my husband took her. When we got her she was skin and bone. She was so depressed she would never come out of her kennel. \n\nAfter a couple months and getting her on a meal plan that didn’t make her sick. She started to gain weight (she was 80ish pounds when we got her and she should be about 125). We later found out she was Mel nourished as a puppy. After all this of course I fell in love with this dog. I know she is the dog for me. She protects me. Even when I passed out in the bathroom she was trying to wake me up and keep me awake until I could call ambulance. \n\nEvery morning we cuddle after my husband goes off to work and she never leaves my side.\n\nHere’s my problem. \n\nI’ve poured 500-1000$ into the dog over a year w my husband. Including the pet deposit at our new house the previous “owner” didn’t pay. \n\nNow he wants her back now that he has a new house away from my mom.

Absolutely beautiful, smart, driven. Things have been great despite being a several hour plane ride away from each other. \n\nShe came to town, and I was so pumped to introduce her to my friends. They threw a party, and while on the way, GF randomly asked “are there any girls I should be worried about” This is probably where I fucked up,  but I explained that a girl I used to see will likely be there. Explained that we were supportive of each other during our respective divorces, and we hadn’t seen each other since well before I met GF. I was asked if we ever slept together. I said yes, because...we had. Also important to say that we never told out mutual friends about our fling, it wasn’t a big deal. \n\nEverything started out great. Everyone was so welcoming to gf, including ex who was there with a new guy. \n\nGF gets drunk and made a comment about single moms dating being weird, almost directly have ex mentioned  her children. She randomly asked why she divorced ex husband...in front of everyone, and then asked, again in front of everyone, where we had gone one dates. I was honestly so surprised. So was everyone else. \n\nI apologized to ex and her guy as they were leaving, and she said “no worries. Play 23 year old games, win 23 year old prizes” (were all in our 30s) and gf heard this and sobbed in the bathroom for the rest of the night. She was so devastated that I did tell her that was out of line; however, I feel like nearly everything gf said to her was out of line. \n\nWe got into the biggest argument about how I didn’t have the decency to stand up for her. I told her honestly, I should have stood up to ex when gf relentlessly tried to embarrass her, and she can’t be surprised at a little passive aggressiveness after the way she acted. \n\nShe’s now back on a plane, and we will discuss further once she clears her head.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My sister is visiting for the holidays and we went on a trip to see some extended family, which included kids. She works in a sterile environment with adults so her immune system is pretty weak. She came down with a pretty bad nasal something from interacting with the kids and now that we're back home, she's basically spent the whole time curled up around my game consoles trying to recover.\n\nThe only problem is that she leaves piles of used tissues, empty food wrappers (everything from fruit snacks to actual burger wrappers), and dead cans and cups behind when she goes to bed. I keep gently reminding her to take her stuff when she leaves the room and she'll explain that she doesn't feel good. Then she follows up by asking if she can take my handheld consoles with her so she can play before falling asleep. My answer varies depending on what I feel like doing that night (if I feel like using it or not, basically) but it's been no more than yes, especially as I've gotten more annoyed with the mess.\n\nShe has all the energy in the world when she's playing games or doing something fun for her, but if I ask her to clean up all her symptoms suddenly come to the surface and she's too weak and tired to do anything. It has led to me either leaving the trash where it is and it just not getting cleaned up, or me picking it up and her leaving a new and impressive pile of trash. She has not once cleaned after herself.\n\nFinally I told her that she needs to clean her stuff up or she's not touching mine anymore. She started crying and kept explaining that she was sick and she couldn't help it and she didn't mean to make me upset. I don't feel like I was particularly mean about it but I was pretty fed up. She's only going to be here a few more days but it's honestly getting to me. I'm not her maid and she's older than me. AITA for coming down on her while she's feeling sick?",

      "description": "(The calling part: I have this friend who I’ll call Carl for now. Me and Carl met years ago and became best friends after finding out we were interested in a lot of the same things. Ever since we’ve met we would talk about how we would want to sleep over each others house when we eventually were able to sleep over each others house one day I’d sleep at his the next he’d sleep at mine. After we slept over Carl got my number and we called each other the day after he slept over my house and we talked for a bit. At first I was fine with it until two weeks after. One day I didn’t feel like answering his call so I let it rang and ignored it (which is a douche move I know). What I didn’t realize is that he would keep calling me over and over and over and eventually answered. Day after day he would call me, in the car, at dinner or lunch, at the store, and almost any other time. I told him the fifth day it started that i didn’t wanna call all the time and it was kinda annoying, to which he replied it was ok that he knew he could be annoying at times. I was glad we didn’t get into a fight. The next day, call after call after call after call sometimes he’d call 37 times before he gave up I was getting more and more annoyed especially waking up to see 10 missed calls from Carl an hour before I woke up. After another week went by I told him again and he said the same thing as last time. After two weeks with it continuing I snapped and answered the call and yelled at him “STOP CALLING ME!” And hang up to some it might feel like a shit post but I feel guilty for doing that to someone who I have been friends with for a while.\n\n\n\n(The grudge part: I had a friend (who I’ll call mar) since 1st grade. The day I met Carl I went to introduce him to mar and found out the two knew each other and we became a trio. During the year we had a spelling test and mar failed and he was very angry. Me and Carl didn’t think he would be at recess so we sang a part of a song me and Carl liked but mar didn’t (as weird as it sounds we were kids and did weird things like singing at recess) what we didn’t know was mar was coming and he heard us and what I assume got more angry he cane down to me and Carl and gave me the death stare I joked around saying are you gonna kill me he said yes and I thought he was joking and ran next thing I know he darts after me grabs my hood on my coat turns me around and chokes me.  A week later I wasn’t talking to mar and every time I saw him I’d give a death stare. Carl constantly asked for us to be friends again and eventually we did after we did everything was fine until 6th grade which was hell. Mar kissed me on the cheek in two occasions (keep in mind I’m male and he is too and I’m 0% gay) one occasion was us winning dodge ball and he said “sorry I got excited!” After doing so and I told the teacher. The second time was when we were lined up after recess when mar wrapped his arms around my neck and kissed me I told the teacher and we got ready to go and wait for busses. While we walked to where we waited mar told me “people like you are why I have depression” I instantly got mad and me and him hated each other ever since Carl constantly again asked for me to be friends with mar again and I said no. Ever since mar made school a living hell for me. Constantly going near me and one time pretending to stab and shoot me even contacting me online. I have a grudge at Carl because he constantly begged for me to be friends with mar again while it’s partially my fault if Carl didn’t I most likely wouldn’t have been his friend again and I wouldn’t have been tortured by mar.\n\nSo aita?\nTo make it shorter: my friend calls me once the proceeds to constantly call me day after day even after telling him I didn’t want to call every day.\n\nMy friend begs me to be friends with a person who use to be my friend and I caved in and went through a year of hell and now have a grudge against him for it.",

      "description": "I've been with my SO for about 6 months, started dating shortly after she broke up with her ex of 3 years (he cheated on her countless times). Me and her are currently long distance for school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we first began dating she informed me that they were still friends, and are both in the same friends group. I said that was fine, as long as both parties are over things I'm cool with that. But lately there's been some signs that were worrisome for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer ex is in a different town right now, and lately he has been constantly hitting her up to make conversation, with little excuses -- like asking where food places are, or sending her memes, or just straight up asking her if she's free. I think one time she posted a photo of us eating at a restaurant and he responded with an angry jealous emoji. On top of that he's constantly snapchatting her; every time I'm with her her phone will light up with a new snap from him. She tells me she usually doesn't respond or just responds out of politeness (I completely believe her), and that he snaps the same thing to all his friends (I don't believe this because most of the snaps are very personalized) but so far her lack of response has not shown to deter him in the least. I figure he of all people should know she's not one to chat online (she has a reputation for not texting back), so I'm not sure why he keeps trying to start conversations all the time. Also, since she's barely even entertaining these efforts, it's also strange to me that he hasn't \"gotten the hint\" and stopped trying. I should also mention that he is by far hitting her up more than any other person on her contacts list.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis had gone on for a few months now but I'd never brought it up to her. But I couldn't help but feel more and more uncomfortable about it as I'm picking up these things as signs that he's not really over it. I understand that they're supposed to be on good terms and all, but I feel like his actions suggest something more than just friendliness -- not even her closest friends pester her to this extent. In a few weeks he'll be back in town permanently, going to the same school and same program as her, and I can't help but feel like he's going to be even more badgering in person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it would be ridiculous to ask that she avoid him given that they're in the same friend circle and go to the same school and events, and that he hasn't shown any incredible obvious signs of pushing boundaries yet. But I did ask my SO if she could stop acknowledging his online efforts at starting conversation. I just feel like her current approach is not doing enough to dissuade him and his persistence is making me uncomfortable. I trust my GF not to do anything, but I absolutely don't trust him at all given his questionable morals. He should also know better than anyone that she's wayyy too trusting of a person and I fear that he can take advantage of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Am I reading too much into things?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My close friend (we'll call him S) asked if her daughter (we'll call her M), who doesn't go out that often, could have a sleepover with my teenage daughter (we'll call her J), who also doesn't go out that often. Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

      "title": "AITA Moving in with my girlfriend and not working despite living here for several weeks?",
      "description": "To elaborate, I am 17 years old but am turning 18 this month and I’ve already graduated high school so my mother decided since I’m about to be 18 and my girlfriend and I already have a house she’d let me move.\n\n The original plan was for me to get a job right away and so that’s what I did. The problem is the restaurant  I applied for (and others) needs proof of a vaccine that I haven’t received yet in order for them to start me. I also didn’t have an ID prior to applying  so I knew I would have to get one after. \n\nI would also like to make it clear that I’ve contributed over $500 from my savings since I’ve moved so it’s not like I’m not helping out financially. \n\nMy mother lives 2 hours away from us and I can’t drive because nobody ever had time to teach me or take me to the DMV while I was in school. I needed to get my birth certificate from my mother to get my ID. After a nearly a week of my mother saying she was looking we finally decided she’d lost it and we asked my grandfather if he had it. Luckily he did so we picked it up and went to get my ID later that day. The courthouse said they needed proof of residence such as a piece of mail before they could print the ID so I went and opened a bank account and got a piece of mail from the bank (which took around 4-5 days because the mail didn’t run on weekends). After I finally got the mail and got my ID printed the last step was to get my shot records. At this point my future employer said they’re tired of waiting so they’ll give me until the end of the week and if I can’t get it then they won’t hire me. So I went and called several pediatricians that I went to as a baby to see if I’ve gotten the shot and all of them had said I haven’t yet. I tried to schedule an appointment at the health department and rite-aid but they both said that I would have to have a parent or guardian present in order for them to give me the shot so I’m probably better off waiting until I’m 18 or driving to go to a doctor where my mother can be there. My mother is busy all the time plus we can’t afford to keep driving back and forth all the time so we decided it’s best that I try to get a job somewhere else or wait until I’m 18 (which is only a little over a week away). \n\nNow my girlfriends mother is complaining that I haven’t got a job yet and is talking shit to her about me and saying I need to do more chores if I’m not working (even though I definitely do my share, and my girlfriend sees all that I do)\n\nHer mother lives with us and is also incredibly rude with both of us sometimes and smokes in the house despite us telling her not to. \n\nTLDR; am I the asshole for not starting work yet because the work needs proof of a shot that I can’t get.

      "description": "So the title pretty much sums it up but let me give you some context.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo lets call this guys Kevin.  Kevin was just a general jerk but most of the time he wasn't that bad but he could choose when he wanted to be a major asshole.  He would always find something to make fun of about me whether it was my hair, something I said, or even just my face, it totally just destroyed my confidence (generic high school kid btw).\n\nRecently he has been trying to be nicer to people and I applaud him for that.  But I still do not forgive him, I believe he needs to earn my respect back by actions instead of saying \"I'm being nicer to you\".  \n\nOne example that has happened recently was during lunch.  Kevin had wanted me to move in so he could sit with me but I refused because I did not want to be near him.  He argued for a while but in the end he ended up walking away after calling me petty.  \n\nI feel like he has changed but he does still make fun of me occasionally and sometimes he actually makes some good jokes even if they are at my expense.  So Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to forgive him or even be in his presence?",

      "description": "Throwaway. Some background on me: I grew up in a very strict household and I am very motivated by being good and staying away from people's anger. As a result, I do have some codependent traits, loads of anxiety and self-worth issues, and somewhat more difficulty than normal with setting boundaries. I've been working on all this with a therapist, but it takes practice and is hard.  \n\n\nI started hanging out with an acquaintance a few months ago after she reached out to me repeatedly. I knew she had a history of being overbearing and was also an addict in recovery, but I figured people deserve second chances, so I took her up on it.  \n\n\nAfter a few hangs, things started to seem kind of off. She told me that she was no longer sober and was trying to practice moderation. I know harm reduction looks different for different people, so, again, benefit of the doubt. Around this time, she also started going through A LOT of personal issues (deaths, breakups, relapse, job stuff, etc). I referred her to a therapist, who at one point called me and asked me to take her to the ER for a psych eval (which I did, because I was scared and in shock). She told me she was discharged, but later I learned that she left against medical advice. After that incident, she started referring to me as her best friend.   \n\n\nShe developed a habit of texting me very urgently, in a manner that made me feel very pressured to call her or text her. Sometimes I would ask her for space and she would chill for a day or so, but then use high-stakes-sounding texts to draw me back in (either making it sound like an emergency, or like she was mad at me).  \n\n\nOn top of all this, she wanted to start a collaborative creative project. I told her \"maybe,\" which she took as an immediate yes. Anytime I told her I wasn't comfortable with an activity or an idea, she would say, \"Why?\" and when I wouldn't have a real answer outside of just my gut, she would just move along as if I hadn't said anything. On the other hand, anytime I *would* agree to push forward with part of the project, she would not do her part. I encouraged her to make her own art and do her own thing, but I have yet to see any of that.  \nOver the last couple weeks, she started to make less and less sense. When I took a social media break for a week, she texted me to show me a public note she wrote for me. It was nonthreatening, but it weirded me the fuck out, and after that I spoke to a mutual friend about my concern for her and desire for distance. That friend encouraged me to keep setting boundaries, and that that was something she was used to. Later that weekend, I got some weird texts about her from a random number, asking if I could come pick her up. I didn't respond, but texted her in the morning to ask if she was safe. She \"jokingly\" called me a name and sent a bunch of nonsense. Later that night she texted me threatening suicide, I told mutual friend, and we agreed to call paramedics. Mutual friend shared a bunch of information my friend never shared with me; particularly severe psychiatric conditions/mood disorders that my friend has that may or may not have been reactivated by a drug relapse. My friend talked her way out of that hospitalization, too. I contacted the therapist I'd referred her to, he said that she had terminated services the day before.  \n\n\nThe next morning, I called her and told her that I was not in a place to be in regular contact with her until both of us were more stable. I also told her that she could do whatever she wanted with our project but that I couldn't do it. She flipped out a little, insisting she was stable, but I stood my ground and she said she had no hard feelings. As soon as I hung up, she started texting me and direct messaging me as if nothing had happened. She continued texting me into the next day. I reiterated to her two more times that I needed space before blocking her number.   \n\n\nNow I have her number blocked and I've temporarily deactivated my social media. We have many mutual acquaintances and I know she'll be able to figure out that I blocked her and I'm scared of escalation or retaliation. I feel like I must owe her something, or that I didn't use the right words in my final phone call.  But I also feel very drained with this friendship and like I have nothing more to offer here. Texts and phone calls make me jump/get nervous. AITA if I block her on everything and move on?  \n\n\nTL;DR: A friend with a lot of issues became very attached to me and I feel drained and scared; AITA if I block her everywhere?",

I had some money and lent it to him, making it obvious that I wanted it back soon because we don’t get very much money often. \n\nAnyway we all just got $20, and he refused to pay me back and spent it all so we couldn’t even argue or debate about wether I get the money. When I learned about this I got livid. I yelled at him, making just points like, ‘you owed me that money for half a fucking year, now you’ve got it, what’s the problem here?’ And ‘you owe me 20$, you have $20, why won’t you pay me?’\n\nAnyway that brings us to now. My mom got pretty upset from our arguing and practically threw $20 in my face. I would not feel good accepting this money because it’s not okay. I plan to give it to her soon though, and try to calm the situation. I am livid at my brother right now, and he is livid at me.’\n\nPS I am 14yr old ",

      "description": "I'm gonna be totally transparent here. I work in retail, surprise.  And yesterday a man came in with his daughter who was probably 4-6, I'm not entirely sure.  \n\nNow the reason our restrooms aren't public.  We have two restrooms in our building.  One for employees, one for customers.  The customer one has been infamously shoddy.  Most notably during this time the chain was broken and the toilet couldn't be flushed. So my upper management decided it's best to just have no public restrooms any longer.  We still have the employee one, but inside there is our bank information and spare change and bills.  Customers cannot go in there. It's not meant for them.  Is it usable by them? Are both restrooms technically usable by them? Yes, they are but.... I think you get what I mean.\n\nAlright now back to yesterday, man comes in, bolts straight back to the bathrooms.  \n\n\nMe: \"Sir, I'm sorry my restrooms are out of order.\"\n\n\nHim:\"Oh come on dude, she's 6 years old.\"\n\n\nMe:\"yikes, like I say, I'm super sorry, our restrooms are out of order\" \n\n\nGonna paraphrase the rest here.  The guy basically lost his mind on me.  I've been in retail for 5 years but never had anyone unhinge the way he did.   It was only about 20-30 seconds but he told me to fuck myself about 7 times.   A number of other things, went outside, yelled to the other businesses next door that I am refusing to let his daughter use the restroom.  All the while I am trying to explain:\n\n\nMe: \"Sir I'm so sorry, the toilet will not flush, it is out of order, it doesn't work. I would if I could, but if she used the restroom in there it won't flush.\"\n\n\nHim: \" No FUCK you you peice of shit, FUCK YOU.\" \n\n\nBasically says fuck you about 6 more times while screaming his head off. I can't honestly remember.\n\n\nHe eventually leaves and his wife comes in.  She's super nice, apologizes for her husband, and I end up giving them their items free and some store credit for the next time they are here, because I'm still kinda shaking that they went totally off on me.  Now I know I presented it like this guy is the bad guy, and in my mind he is, but am I the asshole for not just letting his daughter use the employee restroom?  Is this my fault?  Id like to think if I was a 43 year old dad I wouldn't just flip out.  There were other restrooms to use. AITA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "tl;dr Friend is on a self-destructive path. I threaten to not be there if he doesn’t go get help.\n\nI have a friend, and I’m one of his best friends if not his best friend.\n\nRecently, he has been talking to me about his issues and feelings because his LDR ex-girlfriend and him broke up over communication issues. Without getting too much into it, this seemed to have triggered some underlying problems my friend already had with a traumatic childhood. He told me he cuts himself, and I have been trying to help him as best as I can with talking. I go to college in another city, so I conferred with another friend who lives near him.\n\nAnyways, a few days ago, I received a Snapchat of cuts on his hand. After freaking out and texting him a lot, I decided to text his dad. It turns out that his dad already knew because someone had called the police on my friend. He sent that snap to a lot of people apparently. Fast forward, we pick him up from the hospital with his dad, and his dad leaves him with my friends and me to talk.\n\nWe tried to get him to go see someone at his college, but he thinks that he can handle this himself. Obviously, we don’t really trust him, but we can’t really do anything but try to reason with him. It doesn’t go anywhere. He told us “maybe but probably not.”\n\nSo, he wanted to go home, and I drove him home alone. This is where this post comes in. I was upset and frustrated and stressed. I told him that I was considering not being friends with him because he was refusing to get some help. He told me that he doesn’t need it, and he really didn’t like that everyone reacted and wasted his time. I then told him how I couldn’t deal with this, and I really can’t stand to see him go through this alone. I’m not going to say I know what’s best for him because I have no experience in any of this. But I really can’t. He finished with “ok so leave me like everyone else in my life did,” and that made me feel really guilty.\n\nI texted him after saying that I wouldn’t leave him. I’d support him, but I’d highly prefer if he’d get some help. He finally decided to compromise, and he said he’d get help not because he needed it but for his friends.\n\nSo, AITA for considering not talking to him because he won’t get help? We’re on good terms now, but this haunts me when I go to sleep.",

      "description": "So a friend of mine used to date this guy a few years ago. Since the breakup they've had their grievance have since seemingly made up and even hang out together as friends (note: she even said this explicitly in the past). Even when she asks me to go out for dinner or whatever she'll say \"I invited [ex]\" and I dont think twice. \n\nI've known the guy for a few years as well and since she brought him back into the picture him and I have gotten a little more friendly so I decided to extend an invitation to an upcoming party, along with my friend.\n\nLast night I got a message from my friend asking why I invited [ex] and I explained using the reasoning above. She's upset because 1. She cant bring a date she planned on bringing and 2. That I \"should have asked her\" and i'm not respecting her point of view. Of course I disagree.\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "Not the most thrilling AITA story, but I am kind of feeling conflicted.\n\nLate last year my Mother in law wanted to sell her car, so we posted it for sale on Facebook. We had a lot of people enquire, and wanting to look, but not until the next day.\nAnyway, it was around 9pm and this woman asked if she paid in cash, would we sell to her for a grand less than asking price, putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that she had \"cash waiting\". I asked MiL and she said yes as the car had no battery (which was in the ad). The woman then said she could come that same night, around 10pm and pick it up, with cash. Again, MiL said yes, although not super impressed about her coming that late, but she wanted the car gone. So, we started to make sure everything was in order with the car, double checking there was nothing left inside, my husband even went to charge the battery to see if it still worked so she could test drive. Etc.\n\nIt was around 10pm by now, and this woman messages me saying that she can't come now. But that she will be there at 8am in the morning, that way she could bring a battery with her. I say, sure, but is she sure about 8am as others are interested (which is true). She says definitely 8am.\n\nThe next moring comes, and not too long before 8am, woman messages saying she will be a little late. I say okay, thinking like 10-15 minutes.\n\nWe ended up waiting an hour, and we decided after messing around the previous night, and with other potential buyers waiting, that we wouldn't be selling to her.\nI messaged the woman and politely explained this, and that's where it went down hill.\n\nDirectly after this message the woman states that she is on her way, and that she just had to get the money out at the bank (although she apparently had cash waiting last night?).\nI say again that we are going with another buyer, and she doesn't seem happy, saying she's just near our street, and she had to get money out, got stuck in traffic, that I'm rude, and accuses me of being offered more, and that's the only reason why I am no longer selling to her (genuinely not why, we just didn't want to wait any longer).\nI calmly explain again why we went with another buyer, due to the wait, etc. and say goodluck in finding a vehicle.\n\nLooking back, I do feel bad, as I am not usually the type to say no, or change my mind. I'm usually a complete push over, and I do what I can to be helpful. But, I was already running late for things I had planned that morning, time is valuable, and I was not in the mood for people and their shit. Others were genuinely interested like I said, too. \nI also had a gut feeling that she was going to try to get the price down even more, or that she was going to cancel again and wasn't even on her way. She just had that vibe.\nI told her not to contact me anymore after she said what she needed to, and she thankfully didn't.\n\nWe ended up selling the car to a nice lady who paid only $500 less than asking price, and we bought a battery and installed it for her. So, it worked out in the end.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nWoman organized 2 different times to come and buy a car with cash, canceled the first time, then left us waiting an hour the second time. \nI explain we're no longer selling to her due to this, and she makes up excuses and calls me rude.\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA For Being Mad At My Best Friend For Dating My Ex?",
      "description": "Hello guys! There’s a lot to unpack here, I’ll leave a TL;DR at the bottom. Before I start, I’d like to say I really don’t believe in having “dibs” or like, owning people, but it’s a complicated situation \n\nI have been friends with this girl for a few years, and while she’s younger than me, she’s my closest girl friend and we get along really well. She’s been with me through a lot of hard things, such as a breakup with someone I dated for two years. \n\nSpeaking of that relationship- it was with someone I’ll probably consider to be my highschool sweetheart(let’s call him Brody) , and was a tumultuous 2 years. I really loved him, but ultimately we fell out of love and he broke up with me May of last year, in a rather inconsiderate way (over text when he had plenty of opportunities to do it in person). I was pretty okay with it eventually, started seeing other people and so on. \n\nMy best friend had been in a relationship with this guy we’ll call Adam for about a year. Adam is kind of a douche who doesn’t care about anyone but himself, up until he met my best friend. They were head over heels, but broke up that same summer.  My best friend was absolutely devistated. She hung out with Brody a lot as they had been friends for a while, almost as long as he and I dated. It made me uncomfortable, because I still harbored some ill will with Brody, but I kept my mouth shut. \n\nThis fall, they got closer and closer, and my best friend one day while talking to me confessed that she had a feeling Brody liked her. I was hurt, and told her I didn’t really want to talk about it, that I was sorry but it was a sore subject. She agreed, said they’d never even be a thing, and dropped it. \n\nShe denied being with him up until I caught him kissing her cheek once, where she fessed up. I got emotional (unfair, I know. I’m a teenage girl and sometimes cannot help it). She kept insisting “I don’t want to hurt you” and that if I told her not to pursue the relationship because it made me uncomfortable, she wouldn’t. I think it’s kind of bullshit, because what kind of friend would I be to tell her not to date someone?\n\nSo they date. They show up to my events, even cuddled in my bed at one point while I was STILL IN IT, and I get really upset about it. She knows the whole thing makes me upset. \n\nI’m still trying to get over it, and have come to the realization that I’m not fully over Brody.  Talking to my best friend yesterday, she confided in me that she doesn’t really feel the same way about him, that she was just lonely and hurting.  \n\nAm I valid for being pissed that she pursued a relationship she didn’t even really care about despite knowing it hurt her friend? Or should I man up with my feelings and stop being a bitch? I’m worried I’m inserting myself into a story that doesn’t even involve me, but I just can’t even hear about Brody without hurting, a lot. \n\nTL;DR My best friend dates my long term ex despite knowing it upsets me, reveals she doesn’t even like him that much. Are my feelings valid?",

      "description": "So I've had a turbulent friendship with a girl that shares some of my mental health diagnoses for a couple of years. She doesn't work due to illness (+her parents are loaded and she inherited a lot of money ) and spends a lot of her time partying and doing drugs like k and Molly. I used to do both very occasionally and strongly believe mdma should not be used at the frequency she has been bc of the impact on serotonin. She's got severe borderline and bipolar along with a GI condition.\n\nShe had a couple rough days last week, and she had done Molly at least 2-3 days that week. She was bummed by minor external triggers so I tried to encourage her to make her next day better by getting outside and enjoying herself since she's getting surgery this week and will be in bed. She told me she was too depressed physically and mentally; I pointed out that using Molly so much had probably put her in a physically depressed state that made her more susceptible to reacting to triggers, explaining s bit what it does to the brain. She flipped on me saying it was all caused by events/external factors and that it was my job to validate her and not \"give her advice\". Pretty much her only other friends are people she parties with, so no one else is gonna point it out.\n\nI've honestly been ready for this friendship to end, but AITA for telling her i wasn't going to blindly validate her feelings and that she needed to take more responsibility for her suffering by not f'ing with her brain chemistry so much?",

      "description": "My girlfriend of about a year has crippling social anxiety. If we go out, it would not be uncommon for her to nervously shake or to shutdown completely. It breaks my heart to see her struggle with it. She is sometimes incapable of completing the simplest everyday tasks if it requires her leaving the house on her own. \n\nI love her and because of this I will join her on running various errands, meeting appointments, etc. While I’m happy to do that for her sometimes, lately I have been insistent on setting boundaries. Somedays, if I have prior obligations or, frankly, am not feeling up for it, I will decline to help with whatever it is she needs companionship for. This never goes well.\n\nAs was the case yesterday when she was hungry and wanted brunch. I offered to make brunch for the both of us because I was also hungry but she said she would rather grab some food down the street. I did not agree to go with her there and instead started on brunch.\nWhile cooking, she left in a fury and texted me how I upset her and put my desires before hers. \n\nShe explained that she feels like a burden and that she cannot have gotten food on her own and needed me. I essentially accused her of having an entitlement issue that is completely separate from the anxiety issue. I stressed that she could not fault me for what I did and that I should feel free in a relationship to say “no”.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "My girlfriend of just over a year and I just moved in together, yesterday we were sitting on the couch when one of those Facebook memory notifications popped up, it was a photo of me, my college friends and my ex on a spring break trip we took like 6 years ago.\n\nMe and this ex dated for two years of college and three years after, were pretty serious to the point of discussing marriage and kids and our differences of opinion on those things was what ultimately led to our break up. My current girlfriend gets incredibly insecure whenever Ex is mentioned, not that she's mentioned a lot but when you date someone for five years they're bound to come up sometimes.\n\nAny way I say something like \"Wow I can't believe how long ago this was\"\nI shared it along with typing \"When did we get old?\" And tagging my college friends (But not my ex) \n\nMy girlfriend flips out that \"I've just shared a photo of me and my ex to everyone we know\" and how it's obvious that \"I'm not over her and she's a consolation prize!\"\n\nI try to tell her she's overreacting and she's who I want to be with,  But at this point she's completely lost it and is going through my Facebook photos sobbing and screaming.\nNow when this ex and I broke up, I did a pretty low effort job of removing her from my Facebook page, I changed my cover photo and removed a couple of recent photos, but I wasn't going to go through 5+ years of photos just to be petty, so there were plenty of photos for her to find.\nShe tells me why don't I just \"go be with my ex as that's who I want!\" And runs off to her best friends place leaving me standing there like an idiot.\n\nTonight she comes back ready to talk and the gist of what she said is she wants me to delete everything, Every photo and video in existence of me and my ex she wants it destroyed.\nNow I'm willing to take everything off of Facebook, But I'm not willing to delete everything, if I delete every photo of me and my ex I'll essentially be deleting five years of my life, Not just my ex but the trips we went on, my first apartment, first day of work at a real job, I don't necessarily wants these photos now, But when I'm 80 I want to have them to show to my grandkids *our grandkids hopefully.\nWhen I said this my girlfriend called me an asshole and stormed out.\n\nSo AITA for wanting to keep a copy of these photos?",

      "description": "Alright so we had a change in ownership last year and basically nobody likes these owners. They came in and changed everything, arguably for the worst. A rumor popped up that they were subtly trying to push the older employees out (ones who were there before the ownership change) by messing with their hours, ignoring or otherwise not taking any action on complaints. I was talking about it with a coworker when the supervisor overheard. She asked where we had heard this and we didn't have any specific names. She then said if people were going to be forced to leave or fired, that they'd tell her. I asked why. I made sure to not say it with any sass or anything like that. I tried to ask as politely as possible. She glared at me and just said \"What?\" So I asked \"If they wanted people to leave, why would they tell you?\" I meant that as what law or whatever is there that requires them to tell her. So, am I the asshole for asking this?",

I recently got promoted to management ( I haven’t been sent to my training yet however so am still technically not a manager in the store I work for) \n\nI work with a woman, let’s call her Lily. Lily and I have worked at the same restaurant for 3 years. Over the course of those 3 years we have become friends and text each other often. \n\nBecause I have gotten this promotion, my management team asks that I “act as a manager” and set a tone. Which makes sense to me. Lately things have been rough at work, new employees don’t know everything they should do and honestly just a lot of people are lazy. Lily and I complain about the lazy people. However I’ve noticed lately that Lily isn’t doing any better than the lazy people. She’s always on her phone. Always ONLY running her food and not caring about the greater good of the restaurant. I told her “you have to be the change you want to see”\n\nThis past Monday I was helping out the bartender make drinks for the restaurant, Lily walked up and asked if she could just pour her beer (her ticket for the drink was 3rd down the line) so I said “ no but you can run these drinks to the other tables” she got mad and walked away. \n\n\nSince then she hasn’t spoken to me. So am I the asshole for telling her to do her job? Being in the restaurant industry means you have to be a team, I can’t just let her do whatever because we are friends and furthermore from a management standpoint that’s not the kind of employee I want.

      "description": "So I absolutely love boxing and it's the only thing that got me out of a depressional bind I was in before I met my wife. \n\nI've been boxing for ~4-5 years now, and am only an amateur. Not really any plans on going pro as its just my favorite sport and hobby. \n\nSo before I got into boxing I got my drivers license suspended (it still is but I'm not going to get into why it still is as that's more personal). Anyway, I got into a depressional episode and there was nothing that could really get me going, then I turned to boxing. It worked out great cause I could get to work, walk to the gym then have a friend that trained with me take me home, and for the first time in a while I felt alive. I was training for about 6 months and even had 4 amateur fights, and then I met my wife. \n\nWhile we were dating I was still training and fighting. And then we got married and I moved about 30 minutes from the gym. Going through a canyon that I cant even take a bus to get to the city where my gym is at. This really got to me because I couldn't get the chance to train because my wife had to take me to work and take me back home and she wouldn't wait for me to go to the gym. I understood that sometimes she was stressed from college and work so I never pushed her to take me, and then I just ended up not going anymore. Which resulted in depression again and weight gain. \n\nAbout mid last year I decided screw it I'm getting back into shape to take fights somehow. I started jogging, I bought a jumprope, and whatever other exercises there were that i could do on my own, i did. I even found out the theres a Sherrif half way house down the street from my home with a weight gym that is open to the public and started going there. \n\nNow, here's where my wife comes in. I havent had proper boxing training in about 2 1/2 years, but I have still managed to get back into shape, and muscle memory is a thing so I'm rust but not horribly rusty. I took a fight last November and it showed how much out of shape I was but I still won thanks to previous training. My wife noticed this and she did NOT like it. Over the holiday I've been talking to my old boxing coach and he thinks I'm able to do a tournament in Reno in March but he wants me to take some single fight before I do. So my plan is, workout like I usually do now and take the fights when they come up, simple, right? Not so simple. My wife is fighting with me telling me that I'm not ready to take any fights at all because I havent exactly been training for boxing. But shes also not willing to help me by taking me to my old gym, not even once a week. I tell her I'll get by as long as I keep working out I'll be fine but she just wont budge. And I'm pretty much thinking now that I dont care what she has to say cause this is what I love to do and if she wants to not support me then that's on her.\n\nI do feel a bit guilty about all this but I dont think it's fair for my wife of all people to be holding me back... am I the asshole here?

      "description": "This is my first post ever here so I don’t know if this is kinda a weak one or not\n\nA little backstory to understand everything: I’m a kid still going to school. My parents got divorced in 2013. Both my mom and my dad have found new lovers. I hate my dads girlfriend and I like my moms boyfriend. I always go home to my mom on friday to be there for the weekend.\n\nRoles:\nMom= mom\nDad= dad \nMy dads girlfriend = dg\nMe = me\n\n\nSo this happened yesterday. I had been sick for a few days and was feeling dissy and and had a real bad headache. I had just been sleeping all day when I woke up at around 2:00 pm feeling very hungry so I went out to the kitchen and made myself some soup after I had eaten it I just put the bowl of the left over soup in the kitchen (I was feeling super tired at this point I just wanted to sleep) I went back to bed and woke up at around 4:30 pm to my dad coming home. Dg was home all day but was just laying in bed watching anime (yes, anime). My dad went out to go do the dishes when suddenly dg sees it and rushes out there and starts shouting at my dad saying that I should do the dishes and my dad is all confused over what happens I then come out in to the kitchen when I see dg rushing towards me looking like she’s about to hit me in the face. She doesn’t hit me but she was mad. Luckily I had to leave because I had to get home to my mom because I had this event at my school (which went really well and I’m also feeling way better) so I had to get some stuff at my moms. I luckily also had to stay at my moms house until Monday.\n\nTl-dr \nI’m sick and hungry I then go and make myself some food after I eat I leave the dishes out and fall back asleep. I wake up when my dad comes home. My dad goes and does the dishes when my dads girlfriend goes insane on him and me for me not doing the dishes even though I’m clearly very sick",

      "description": "A couple of my roomates/best friends from college live in a nearby city. I'm in medical school, so I'm quite stingy with cash. One of my old roomates is also in medical school, but with a substantial scholarship and the other roommate has a nice paying job (like 60-70k). Earlier this month they asked me to come up and visit and hang out with them on a Friday night. They told me they were gonna get wine and cheese and we were just gonna hang out. I wasn't sure if I would be able to make it, and they checked back multiple time to see if I could come (which I really appreciated). When I got there, I drank one glass of wine but brought the rest of the alcohol I drank with me. I had a good amount of (nice) cheese and crackers as well that they bought. We had a great time and it was awesome to see them for the first time over a month. \n\nHowever, at no point leading up to that night did anyone ask me to buy in or mention what it would cost. I even talked with them while driving to their place and they didn't mention it. The day after, I got a venmo request for over $16 by my friend with the job. I was caught off guard, because I thought they had invited me as a guest and weren't expecting me to pay. I really don't mind paying my fair share, but since they didn't mention so much as a price beforehand I thought they were just being nice. I figured my friend would be aware that I would need to know this beforehand since he knows I am super poor right now. I haven't talked to my other friend who is also in medical school about it, so I don't know how he feels about it or if he even knows the other one requested payment. I paid the request, but politely mentioned that in the future he needs to let me know if he wants me to buy in as well as what it costs, but he brushed it off. I'm not like angry or anything, just annoyed. I feel like when you invite a guest to something you were already planning, the norm is to not expect payment, especially without warning?\n\nAITA? I honestly don't know and I feel like I'm being petty about it (this post feels ridiculously long). Thanks for the feedback.",

We wanted to see a movie, which we would originally see at 15:30, but I thought it would be better to see it at 18:45, so we could still have a free day, instead of this over 2-hour movie taking up a big chunk of our afternoon.\n\nSo my mom says that she doesn't like that, and I explain my reasoning and she says she'll think about it. I explained it to my friend, and he's all okay with seeing it at 18:45. My mom asks him about this (If he's okay with it) and he tells her that he doesn't care how late he sees it.\n\nSo here's the thing. My mom now says she feels like she's been put under pressure, because we both want it moved and she can't really say no, which I could understand, if she wasn't being so childish about it, saying that she feels manipulated, and when I say that my friend feels really uncomfortable, she says:\"well who's fault is that then?\" It's not like she has to bring us to the movies, or that she wants to go with us.\n\nTL;DR\nI wanted to see a movie at a different time, my friend was okay with it, mom ain't like that shit because she wants us to be home when it's evening (not what she said but she didn't give a reason so that's probably it), and now she feels manipulated.",

      "description": "Alright hear me out. Due to my previous posts/comments, I'm sure I already know the answer, but this is different. Well, different-ish. \n\nMy wife asked me to run to the store to get diapers and wipes. She told me earlier, but I forgot. We still had a few left, but we don't like gambling like that. When she brought it up again, I instantly got my pants on and started out the door. But I forgot my jacket, so I walked back in, and i hear my wife telling her sister \"I just made him go..\" \nAnd that's when I jumped in. \"You just made me what? What did you make me do?\" \nAll joking around of course. That's how we tease each other. Then I kept it going. \"You didn't make me do nothing. I'll make you bark like a dog right now if you wanna make each other do things.\"\n So then she got ready to wrestle/ tickle fight, but we just laughed it off, as it was late and we didn't want to wake up the kids with our shenanigans.  Well, apparently her sister didn't like that, and told her afterwards that she was worried I might actually abuse her. \n\nI should add that her sister and I have our differences. I don't want to go to deep into it here,  but her sister didn't like the fact that I am adamant in the way I want things done in our relationship. I swear it has always been in the best interest of our kids and ourselves. But she hates that I am stubborn. So now my wife says I should tone it down. In my house. That her sister is currently a guest in. My wife knows how I am. There are times I do take a joke too far, and I'll own up to that. But I don't believe this is one of those times. \n\nSo am I in the wrong here?",

      "description": "So I went on a date with my girlfriend to the movies. We sat next to this family of 4 (wife, 2 daughters, and husband). During the movie we occasionally laughed at the funny scenes and kissed a bit during the romantic scenes. After the movie ended we were about to leave, then the husband of the family gets up and approaches us. He says \"You guys need to shut the f*** up\". Mind you his daughters were there too maybe 9-12 yrs old. And literally walks away. My girlfriend and I were shocked and didn't say a word. During the movie this man did not even ask us to be quiet. Later we walked into the lobby and the man is just staring at us. The wife later makes a comment and says \"my daughters behavior was better than yours\". We both just walked away and did not want to escalate the situation. Later me and my gf just talked about it for a bit. Although she didn't seem too bothered I thought that it kinda ruined the mood the rest of the date. AITA in this situation?",

      "description": "There's a lot of family drama history but the background is that I left my mom (parent's divorced) to live with my father and it created a lot of problems for her and my step brother. He had some issues before, but it created some more problems for him and it created issues for her. I came back several years ago because my father is a sociopath and I genuinely feared for my personal safety being physically near him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I first came back, my brother was obnoxious and extraordinarily selfish. Due to the issues with my father and whatnot, I suffered from SEVERE depression for a really long time. He was younger, like 13-14 at the time, so I understand that's a factor, but he would do things like make so much noise at night that he could be heard from anywhere in the house. Parents worked shift work and every 2 weeks they would work afternoons and not be home until after 11. So it was just me and him in the house and he'd be so loud and I'd be so desperate to sleep that it'd give me massive anxiety attacks. There's other stuff, but that's the major thing he did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's gotten a lot better since, but I don't think he's still overall a great person. He isn't loud at night any more, but he's just generally a self-absorbed person. He doesn't think about the consequences of his actions towards everyone else is still quite lazy. I can't remember the last time he has helped clean up after dinner, has to be told to put away his dishes or he'll just leave them and walk away. I get that he has problems and that things can he harder for him, but my parents enable him, too. My mom is the reason he gets a job because he did nothing for months and she did all the work for him. The job before the one he has now, mom filled out his application for him and submitted it for him and when he had an interview she coached him on what to say based on what she put in his application.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's still things that he does that's frustrating. The other week he shaved and left his beard hair all over the sink in our shared bathroom until it was cleaned up by someone else. He didn't think that he should have to clean it up. He's still really, really rude to my parents sometimes. My car was blocking his in, we weren't home and he had to go to work. 3 cars in the driveway, only 2 rows, so someone is blocked in at any given time. There's been times where I've had to move his truck to get out, it's no big deal. Everyone keeps a spare set of keys by the door and we just move the car and put the keys back. It's literally never been an issue before. He couldn't find my spare set of keys (where they've always been) and drove over our lawn to get out of the driveway. Calling my mom every 5 minutes and saying how awful she was and swearing at her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, before I ramble on too much. He's improved a lot and I recognize that, but he's still a really incredibly difficult person to live with. Am I being butt hurt and not giving him the credit he deserves or is his behaviour not good enough to warrant me liking him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. - He's my brother, still. Even if I'm not a fan of him, I'm still there if he needed me. If he called me at 4 am and said he was stuck in the middle of no where or whatever, I wouldn't hesitate to go and get him. My mom has always taught me that family is very important and I try to hold that value.",

      "description": "Ok, so, we're both 20 and in college. Starting last May we moved in the together and it was basically established that we'd be roommates for the next 2 years (we'd just started our 3rd year in uni). We are also really good friends.\n\n\nFor some context, they (I'll call them M) started dating someone (call them A) around January of this year. As soon as that started, M &amp; I's relationship pretty much sank in terms of time we spent together. I would literally never see them for weeks and they would hang out with their partner 24/7. Everything is now a We for M. and for the record, I don't like A at all. I think they are awful for M and is taking advantage of the fact that M is desperate for a good relationship with someone who isn't transphobic. \n\n\nSo the situation is that M told me that they (M &amp; A) are planning on moving to a different state (think Midwest to West Coast) this summer with A's best friend. Although the plan is dependent on if A will graduate this spring. I am annoyed by this because 1) we had agreed to these roommate plans before they started that relationship, and if I won't know if I have to move until my lease is up (next May) that's going to be shitty as fuck 2) we adopted cats together. they're supposed to be our collective responsibility (although tbh M barely spends any time with them because like I said they spend all their time with A. I'm the one who feeds them, makes sure they get playtime in, and cleans the litter boxes most of the time). and 3) I think moving halfway across the country with a partner you've been dating for barely a year in your twenties is a fucking AWFUL idea. \n\n\nWe have a pretty direct relationship so I have told M point 1 and 2 straight up although not 3 - because i always tell them problems I have with A and I can tell they just get annoyed by it and don't really take it seriously. But I have just been feeling bitter about this whole thing along with A and also wondering if I'm the asshole because apparently M's relationship to A is more important to them. M said they still would want to be friends with me if this happens but honestly I think I might be too resentful. And I really do respect the seriousness of romantic relationships but...M &amp; A are barely compatible roommates and all \"compromise\" in that direction is composed of M having to deal with something A does that M doesn't like. \n\n\nAlso A is basically moved in to our apartment and sleeps over every night even though they aren't on the lease.

      "description": "I moved into a brand new house at the same time as our neighbors did, about 8 months ago. They own 3 large dogs that are rarely on a leash when they are let outside. Our lots are pretty small, less than a 1/4 acre. I've seen them in my yard and our surrounding neighbor's yards multiple times. Because of this, they've peed on my bushes and I've had to clean up the their crap from my yard on a few occasions. My son is even afraid to go outside and play because he doesn't want the dogs to jump on him. I'm a very introverted person and I have problems confronting people. I've timidly called them out twice on their dogs, but it hasn't seem to help. On top of this, their back yard is filled with dog crap. I think they last time they've cleaned it up is back in October. It makes for a great view out of my back window. I just gave up and wrote a letter to our HOA to see if they would take care of this. I would hate to start a feud with a neighbor that last for years. I'm not a dog person, but as long as a person takes care of their dogs and it doesn't affect my property or me in anyway, I don't care. Am I being the asshole here?

      "description": "My husband and I have a friend we'll call Joe. Joe has been my husband's best friend since they were 12 (they are in their mid 30's now), and he has been my good friend since I met my husband over a decade ago.\n\n5 years ago, Joe met a woman we'll call Jane. Jane seemed nice enough at first. We of course welcomed her into our lives and Joe was happy and things were fine.\n\nAbout 6 months into the relationship, we noticed that Jane was kind of awful to Joe. Anytime they were around us, Jane would make really snide, emasculating comments; \"You're so stupid.\" \"Hurry up, moron.\" \"You couldn't even change the oil in my car, I had to find a real man to do it.\" Things like that. Joe would stand up for himself at first, but as time went on, she got nastier and he got quieter. We stopped spending as much time with them together as before, because it was very uncomfortable to be around.\n\nWe voiced our concerns to Joe that we believed he was in an abusive relationship, but he would brush it off. I wanted to ban Jane from my house way back then, but my husband said we should support Joe and that Joe might not feel like he could come to us with his problems if we did that. I obliged at that time.\n\nThen Jane got pregnant with Joe's child. She actually seemed to mellow out a bit, and for the first few months after the baby was born, they acted really happy again. But of course babies = stress and stress = fights for even the healthiest of relationships, so it wasn't too surprising when they started fighting on the daily again.\n\nAfter the kid was born, they moved into an apartment together (they'd been maintaining separate households). Jane made Joe give her all of his paycheck (she even bragged about this on social media, like it's so cool to take all of your boyfriend's money that he works 45 + hours a week for and not leave him with anything), and Joe wasn't allowed to sleep in the bed with Jane because \"his snoring kept her awake and she needed her sleep.\" He was made to sleep on the small loveseat. We ended up giving him our sleeper sofa when we upgraded to a new sectional, and we found out later that Jane threw a fit when he pulled the hide-a-bed out of it at night because \"beds in the living room look trashy,\" according to her. At least, though, he was able to stretch out on a full size couch.\n\nThings escalated, as they always do in abusive relationships, and before long Joe was miserable all the time. Jane stopped coming around us altogether and she would call and berate Joe on the phone every time he tried to visit - which wasn't often because they were caring for a child. We finally flat-out told Joe to leave her, but he didn't want to hurt his kid. We explained that raising a child in an abusive, toxic environment was way worse than growing up with mommy and daddy in separate homes, but he wouldn't listen.\n\nFinally, one day about 2 months ago, Joe came to our home and his face was red and swollen with a huge welt in the shape of a hand across his cheek. He said she had smacked him across the face because she came home from work and he was napping after also working a 10 hour shift that day. He admitted that it wasn't the first time she'd smacked him, and that she had also spit on him several times, torn up his work clothes on a number of occasions, hid his keys when he tried to leave, told their daughter that he wasn't her real daddy so she didn't have to listen to him, and would take food from his hands and throw it across the room if she was angry and he wouldn't engage. He finally decided enough was enough, and he left her that evening.\n\nThings seemed to be looking up, but 2 weeks ago we found out that they were seeing each other again. Joe is now about the break the lease on his apartment to move back in with Jane. I'm disgusted and angry at Joe but I also understand abusive relationships and how they affect you, so I will always be there for him.\n\nHowever, I told my husband that Jane is not welcome in our home under any circumstances. My husband is angry because he feels like that will only hurt Joe, and it might drive Joe away from us when he needs us most. Joe doesn't really have any family to speak of, just his grandma, so he doesn't have much of a support system. He refuses to tell Joe that Jane can't come to our house. I don't mind telling Joe and Jane both that Jane isn't welcome here; she is an abusive pile of garbage. I hate her and she makes me sick. I believe it's asinine to enable a friend to continue in an abusive relationship, and honestly, it's the opposite of what friends should do for each other.\n\nTo be clear, Joe is always welcome and his daughter is always welcome in my home. Am I in the wrong to say that Jane can't step foot on my property?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

(Stupid I know, but harmless right?) The school posted it on Facebook and the most that happened for a while is people noticed the sign, maybe did the breathe-through-nose thing and went on with their lives. The only reason that anyone cared is someone, I still don’t know who, called the school and said it meant white power. (I didn’t know about this, some cops got suspended for it once too) This, however, isn’t the main point of the post. My parents are treating me like demon spawn, not because they think it means white power, but because I would dare to make a joke in a picture. I would also like to point out that nobody who doesn’t think it means white power thinks it’s a big deal, including both drama club teachers, all of the students in drama club, many outside students, and even an outside teacher who I asked.\n\nSorry if this isn’t the right sub to post this, but I want to know your opinion.",

She talked to me, and this might be important later. \n    Last night, I finished a book report on a project in school about school shootings. Today was my day back from winter break. Last night, I started crying again about  how I didn't feel good, and that I was thinking about life and my friends and family, and that I had a bad feeling about 2019. I told her I didn't feel good this morning, and she got mad. She said something about my brother, and about how I'll be a high-school dropout and that I'll be riding along with strangers in a car. She then said she's taking my Xbox, and that it's gone for good. She said because some of my games have guns in it, and that my grades got lower than what I was getting before, which was high honors and honors. I started studying, and my grades got high again. I don't know if I'm in the wrong, maybe I am, and if I am, how can I say sorry to my mom?",

      "title": "AITA if I insist that my SO learn basic cooking techniques, instead of grabbing takeout? To be fair, we agreed cooking would mainly be MY chore...",
      "description": "I am 31F, SO is 30M, together 2 years, living together 1, planning engagement and family in next year or so. We split chores roughly evenly. I have no complaints here—we both do our fair share overall. Part of our split is that food is mainly my chore, since I enjoy cooking and he’s always been up-front that he doesn’t know how.\n\nI always try to use fresh, from-scratch ingredients. My cooking style is very simple. Dinner always includes a protein, a carb, and a veggie, and usually a fruit-based dessert. I only cook complicated stuff for special occasions, guests, etc. I try to cook mindfully of our general health, balanced nutrition, fresh food, etc., but I’m not being a “foodie” or expecting anything exotic or difficult.\n\nIf, for some reason, I don’t have time or energy to cook, SO’s idea of handling dinner is picking up fast food for both of us. He’ll pay for both our meals and if I say I’m not in the mood for fast food, he’ll suggest a different (nicer) restaurant. He’s not exactly being cheap or unfair because he will let me pick the restaurant and he’ll always offer to pay (though we usually split). And he never gives me a hard time about occasionally not cooking even though we agreed that would be primarily my chore. But I hate that if I don’t cook, it'll always be more expensive and less healthy, because SO can’t be bothered to learn anything.\n\nI’ve tried engaging him while I cook, to show him some basics, but he’s just not interested. It’s a mindset issue, like he just doesn’t think cooking is a thing that applies to him because he can always get fast food. I’ve asked him if he could just learn a couple of basic meals, for the odd occasion that I’m sick, working late, etc., but he doesn’t see the point because he can just grab takeout and “if you want to be healthy just get a salad!”\n\nIt kinda stresses me out because we’re talking about having kids in the next year or two. Things are going to get a lot more hectic and I might not have time/energy to cook every night. Or I could get injured or die and he’d be in charge of feeding the kids. (Unlikely, but it could happen.) He thinks me asking him to learn some basic skills is unnecessary because he can always just pay for takeout and “they have salads if you’re trying to be healthy”. He supports his argument by reminding me that he before we met, he only ever ate fast food (literally), and he’s never been overweight or had a health issue. I mean, he’s not wrong, but I still think: Just because you CAN in your teens and 20s, doesn’t mean you SHOULD forever—and I think you definitely shouldn’t raise kids on a 100% fast food diet. I’m bothered by his refusal to cook, but to his credit, if I don’t cook he is always willing to let me pick the restaurant and he always offers to pay. And we did decide that cooking would be mainly my chore. AITA?",

      "description": "First time poster, fairly new to Redit and I’m on my phone. I apologize in advance for any formatting mistakes or lack of things most posts include. \nI had my son 11 years ago. I continued that pregnancy knowing I would be a single mom from the start. It has been the most difficult, rewarding thing I’ve ever done. Ive always wanted another child but wanted to do it the “right way”. I told myself I’d never do that again without a partner to experience pregnancy and our child with. \nI waited till I became a wife then the hubby and I spent a year and 10 months trying to conceive before we finally did.  We were both over the moon excited to be creating this new life together. \nPerhaps, at almost 8.5 months pregnant now, I am over reacting. Perhaps I expect too much from my hard working husband. I’m coming here to get some outside perspectives. \nMy husband seems very uninterested in our growing child. I expected him to talk to the baby belly and touch it somewhat often. To get excited to feel baby move and be patient enough to experience that. Sometimes you have to hold your hand there for a while to get a good feel of what’s going on inside my baby making factory, but he often removes his hand and goes back to whatever he was doing, watching tv, playing with dog or on his phone before he really gets a good feel.  He rarely puts his hand there without me placing it there for him. \nToday, I had a cup on my bump, hubby was on the couch opposite of me, playing games on his phone. I giggled to him to look at the cup, baby was making it dance around like crazy!! He hardly glanced at it for a 2 second count before going back to his phone as he makes a “huh” comment with a laugh back at me. I asked him if he actually seen it, he said without looking up, “not really”. \nTyping it out makes me feel a little silly but it’s upsetting to me. It’s as if he cares not to experience whats going on with our baby in my belly. I feel just as alone, if not more so during this pregnancy then I did 11 years ago when I actually WAS alone sharing those moments with just myself.\nAnyway, after he stayed glued to his phone, I snapped at him. I said something along the lines of “I wish you cared to actually take the time to experience this with me, it will be over very soon and you’ll no longer have the chance”. He was clearly upset by my remark but said nothing. After snapping at him I got up off the couch to go lay in bed, frustrated. Now I’m here. \nSo, Redit, lay it on me.... Am I the asshole for feeling like he should want to be more involved and for getting pissed off that he’s not?? ",

      "description": "It was her birthday yesterday. I am an artist so I was planning on making something special for her, and buying something small. I also made her Brownies and cupcakes yesterday.\n\nToday she said \"I know the perfect gift! A charger for my laptop, which broke down a couple days ago, it's about 20 to 30€.\"\n\nI said \"cool, you wanna split it?\"\n\nShe got mad, and said \"wow, are you serious? I bought you a 30€ gift 2 years ago and you only gave me a painting which costed 0€. You spend your money on (...) but don't wanna spend it on your best friend? I know enough 🖐🏻\" (sassy emoticon included)\n\nI replied, and explained, that she IS worth more than 20€ to me, and that if I saw a gift I thought suited her I wouldn't look at the price. But straight out buying her something she needs, completely taking the idea of a gift away, for 30€, I find that expensive. Cause it's a need, like groceries and rent.\n\nIt just felt like \"buy this for me cause you have to because you're my best friend\". Also the fact that she didn't appreciate the painting I made for her because it didn't cost any money, that hurt. And Im only hearing this now. I spent a lot of time and effort on that painting, I put my love into it.\n\nBesides this all my mother is dying right now and I am not happy at all. She knows this. But she got mad at me for not spending x amount of money on her. I was in class, got her text, I had to leave. I was so sad instantly because I don't want to dissapoint nor lose her as a friend, but I feel like she has her priorities somewhere else.\n\nI told her this, that I understand her view but the way she said it made me hurt, and she has not replied yet. Knowing her she's probably pissed off and I'll get a long paragraph on what I did wrong later today. I don't stop thinking about things like this. \n\nAm I in the wrong? I do think she deserves the money, I would give it to her if I knew it meant so so much to her, but I personally don't think I Have to in order to be a good friend. I would not care at all if she told me 20€ is her max for a gift for me. I mean, she didn't even give me a gift for my birthday this year.\n\nSorry for the rant, I really hope to get some opinions so I can clarify to her what I meant exactly without using the wrong words, and understanding this from someone else's perspective. Because she is special to me and I want to solve this problem. ",

I did put make up on to go to one interview, then afterwards I went to one of my girl friends house to debrief with wine.\n\nI realized I was more comfortable with my friend (She is lending me sweats and spotting me on pizza). I called him and said I didn’t want to go to the show but I would come to his house after at around 10-11pm.\n\nHe seemed to calm down when I mentioned coming by later, but then he had to end the conversation with “i just think your acting like a bitch I’m offering to pay”.\n\nLike yes I am broke thank you for offering to pay, But I also just don’t have the energy or want to go! \n\nI called my mom and she said She could understand why he was mad if he was excited to see his friends play whilst hanging with his girlfriend.

      "description": "Long story short, Tom and I had a pretty toxic relationship for over three years that I’m pretty emotionally scarred about. Im currently in therapy, paying attention to my physical health and have made some other positive changes in my life. Tom and I decided it was best to go no contact (we have tried doing this many times before but this time I think I was truly ready to do it) and we haven’t spoken in months. I don’t harbor any resentment towards him but I recognize that he’s bad for my mental health and I don’t want him in my space. \n\nMy friend Mary is well aware of this. Last night was Mary’s birthday and she invited me to a bar to celebrate. My friend Anna was there too. And who should walk in but Anna’s ex. She was a bit taken aback since she didn’t know he would be there but ultimately ignored him and had a good time. \n\nAbout a half hour later, Tom walks in. I’m taken aback as well. He comes over and tries to hug me and I say no thank you. He leaves and spends the rest of the night with some other people on the other side of the room. I have a good time with my friends. \n\nIn the morning, I message Mary and say that if she’s inviting Tom anywhere, I’d rather if she let me know ahead of time because I don’t really want to be around him. She’s now upset with me. Her take is that we’re “grown people” and it shouldn’t be a problem to be in the same space for a few hours. \n\nMy take is that I’m grown enough to know who I will and will not surround myself with and I don’t want to be around this person so I’d rather choose to not involve myself anywhere that he will be. Anna said the same thing to her and she’s also upset with Anna. \n\nAITA? ",

My husband typically drives over to her house every day to help her with this but this time she came to our house to do it.  I found out later that they did the physio on our bed.  We have a spare bed in the basement but she doesn't do too well with stairs and we have no railing.  I don't know why but I felt sort of annoyed and grossed out by the thought of her laying on our bed.  I feel that our bed room is private and if she needs help with the physio it needs to be either done on the bed down stairs or on the couch.  Am I being a jerk?  My husband says he understands and it won't happen again but maybe I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill? It also annoys me that he has to add 20-30 minutes to his day every day to help with the physio but that's a separate issue.  ",

The problem is Dave always just invites strangers into the discord server and make it a bit awkward. \n\nAbout 3 months ago Dave invited two boys he had been playing with called mello and roofson. Every time we all go into a voice channel they join and it's awkward. We don't want to talk to the 1. Because they're quite a bit younger than us and 2 because they only ever talk about fortnite. It's also a bit awkward because there are usually a lot of photos of all of us when we're goofing around and things like that. \n\nSince they joined the discord everyone has abandoned it.

      "description": "I would like to preface this by saying I am an extremely picky eater. Everyone knows this, including my partner of 4 years. He LOVES to cook and I have a lot of hang ups about food and it definitely causes conflict. \n\nFor a very long time, I wouldn’t eat anything except pasta and chicken. Since dating him, I’ve massively expanded my pallet. However, there are some things (especially vegetables) that freak me out on an existential level. It gives me a lot of anxiety and it makes me feel out of control. My solution is I just avoid those foods. My boyfriend and I set down together and created a list of red flag foods that I will not eat, period, and he does his best to cook around that. However, I recognize that my eating stuff is weird and I’m willing to fend for myself if need be and I /try/ not to limit the things he eats himself based on me.\n\nToday, he made chicken fajitas which in general are an okay food for me. Bell peppers and onions don’t freak me out as much but I still eat around them even at restaurants. He had nicely plated some food for me which contained a lot of veggies. I (politely?) declined his premade plate and made my own with just chicken. I happily ate that. He was very emotional that I refused his cooking, while I feel like I ate exactly what he could expect of me. He made a very big deal that I ignored the plate in front of me to make my own. He said that it is just common courtesy to eat what is made for me as made, and I was being a jerk about it by refusing especially since he’d followed my list.\n\nI tried to explain to him that I view eating as an extension of my bodily autonomy and I will not make myself uncomfortable to be polite. This is not just directed towards him, I do the same thing at any event that eating is expected. I could tell this really upset him as he puts a lot of work into his cooking and was very proud of it. This has happened several times before. He claims that not eating the food is a slap in the face, while I feel like I behaved appropriately and as expected.\n\nAm I the asshole for not eating my SOs food?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Ok so I’m at college, not really a college so much as a prep school for college, and I live in the dorms. I have gotten along with my roommate fairly good until recently. \nLately she has had a habit of staying up in the middle of the night, which by itself I would have no problem with, as long as she’s quiet and respectful when I’m trying to sleep. \nThe problem is that she isn’t. I have woken up several times in the past few weeks to her having the light at the sink on, which might as well be like having the room light itself on in the middle of the night, since it’s so bright.\nWhat makes me madder is that the reason why she is up in the middle of the night most of the time is bc she and a friend of ours, C, are sitting on her bed talking. Not whispering. Talking, loud enough to wake me up.\nI don’t mind my roommate talking to C, as long as she did it where it doesn’t disturb me trying to sleep. There is a student lounge that is open all night in the dorms where she could talk to C and not disturb anyone.\nOne of the reasons i am as mad as I am is bc I have driving as my first class in the morning, and I always try to go to bed early to make sure i have plenty of sleep to focus, but I’m always woken up by my roommate.\nI’m extremely considerate to her when she’s sleeping. I’m quiet and only turn on just enough light that I need to get ready by in the morning while she’s still asleep, and I point the lamp in my direction, as far away from her as possible. But she does not show the same consideration to me. So, AITA for being mad at her?",

I asked the cashier if there were any cheaper ones and he said no, they (corporate, not him, he was really great!) expect people like me to be forced to pay a premium since I'm in a bind without any other options.\n\nI asked him what the returns policy is and he told me as long as I had the packaging and receipt, they will issue full refunds. So after 3 days of using the charger, I returned it for a full refund!\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Mobile + Throwaway account. \n\nRecently, I joined a small, tight-knit community with people from all places and situations. \n\nOne of these guys is a pretty active member of the group, he’s going to college and understandably, there is some financial strain on his family, and they’re already not the most well-off. At this time his house turned out to have some pretty serious issues with the roof. They’ve been having leaks and need over ten thousand dollars to have it entirely redone. This, on top of supporting a kid in college, is tough.\n\nHe voiced his concerns in the group, and those who could pitched in. I had some money left over, so I donated 40 bucks. A pittance, but I’m not officially employed, and when I do make money, it’s far below minimum wage because it’s not an actual job. All of us working together barely got over 100$, but we apologized for not being able to help out more. \n\nNot even a few days later, he’s in the group chat bragging about a new gaming laptop his grandparents just gave him. The thing costed over a thousand dollars, brand new, and he wasn’t shy on showing it off and telling everyone about what it could run. I was a little hurt and confused when I heard this. Turns out his grandparents aren’t on the best terms with his parents, and so they didn’t chip in for the house redos. I understood that.\n\nBut what I didn’t get at all is why he didn’t sell the laptop and buy a cheaper work one, adding perhaps 700-800$ to the family funds to pay for the roof so that they wouldn’t have to go online to ask for donations. The grandparents would understand because they adore him, and why not use this as an opportunity to convince them to help them as a favor to their grandson, who has to live in the house?\n\nHe also has both PS and Xbox gaming consoles, alongside a dedicated gaming pc and now this new gaming laptop, as I later found out, which just adds to my confusion. He currently, to my knowledge, does not hold a job, not even part-time or on campus jobs.\n\nI will NOT be asking for my money back. They still need that tiny bit of money I can give, and I won’t shame them for choosing to do what they do. I just involuntarily get a sour taste whenever I see that guy again, knowing that my money may have served as a justification by him to keep his expensive new gaming laptop. \n\nI voiced my concerns once, but he dismissed it as “it wouldn’t sell for as much because it’s used now,” which is very true, but you’re still looking at something that could fetch over 800$ (at that time, he had it for less than a week.)\n\nAITA for not wanting to talk to him and for thinking he’s not doing the right thing and being selfish and shortsighted? I would never say these to his face, but I feel guilty for thinking these thoughts.\n\n\nTL;DR Guy who needs money got my donation, has expensive gaming equipment lying around, isn’t contributing to family funds. AITA for thinking he’s selfish and lazy?",

      "description": "First a little back story:\n\nMy husband and I first started dating 10 years ago. \n\nWhen we first me, he was in the process of divorcing his ex-wife for the 2nd time. I told him that I never wanted to be the \"2nd\" woman in a relationship, so I refused to date until his divorce was finalized. He came into work that day, dropped the completed divorce papers and asked if we could go out for wings and beer.\n\nHe was the first guy I ever dated (22 and **very** sheltered life), and things were going along pretty well. However, issues started happening when I went out to the west coast to help him get the last of his items from his former life out of storage. After we got the moving truck home and unpacked it, her stuff was every where....To the point that the first thing I would see when I walked through the door was a box with her framed picture on the top of it. \n\nHe refused to get rid of any of her stuff, insisting that he was going to send it to her. After dealing with it for a year (and a year of seeing her face every day when I would come home), I'd had enough. Called the fam, packed up my stuff, and moved out.\n\nAfter a few months and a bad rebound bf, we ran into each other attending a gig of a mutual friend. Sparks re-kindled, and much to my family's dismay, we got back together. When we got back together, he made some serious promises, such as minimizing contact with his ex unless absolutely needed (they ran a business together and had unresolved tax issues from the dissolution of the business). Fast forward a few years and we're married and moving out to the west coast, while she's remarried with kids on the east coast.\n\nOver the years, he's kept minimal contact, but over the last year they've become full blown best friends again. FB posts, chats, emails back and forth, and while I've tolerated it, we've been fighting over it more and more. To the point that during one argument I told him he broke his promise to me when we got back together. \n\nNow, he's significantly older than me and is turning 50 this year. It's going to be a huge birthday bash for him, but he wants to invite his ex-wife. The one who I really do not ever want to meet face to face, and have told him so on multiple occasions. His reply is that it is his birthday and even though he expects me to organize it, he wants her to attend. \n\nAITA for absolutely refusing to invite her and giving an ultimatum that if he wants her there then I will go visit my family instead?",

      "description": "My fiance and I specifically pushed our wedding back two years to save up for it, and now his refusal to actually part with the money we saved is driving me crazy.\n\nI have been making compromises from the start based on what I think are very unreasonable expectations from his side. We *both* want our friends and family to be there for our special day and neither of us are willing to cut down the guest list any further than we already have (75 person wedding between two very large families. That sounds like a lot but you have to trust me that *many* difficult cuts were made.) BUT he expects us to be able to have that 75 person wedding for $1000-2000. Me, having actually researched wedding costs in our area, understood that was basically impossible without making things absolutely suck for our guests, so I wanted a budget of $15,000. The compromise budget was $10,000.\n\nI know it seems expensive, but I have done *all* the work and made *all* the compromises while managing all kinds of contradictory expectations. \"If you spend over $100 on a wedding you're a vain whore!\" oh but \"If you don't have an open bar at your wedding you are a cheap, tacky host!\" Well guess what people, *you can't do both.* So I am trying my damn best to keep costs down and still have a nice event that I will be proud of:\n\n- I have hand-made/DIY'd as much as I possibly could. I have watched dozens of Pinterest/Youtube tutorials and spent *hours* folding paper flowers and making other decorations.\n- My wedding dress is a white prom dress with no veil.\n- I am going to be making 150 cake pops myself a day before the wedding.\n- I specifically selected a venue that would allow us to choose our own caterer and spent hours researching budget-friendly options.\n- Doing my own hair and makeup and doing the makeup for two of my bridesmaids who can't do it for themselves.\n- Probably going to end up going with a photography student from the local community college for half the price of a professional.\n- No wedding favors.\n- DIY invitations from Vistaprint.\n- A good friend who is ordained graciously offered to be the officiant for free.\n\nThe few things I have chosen to spend the majority of the budget on are the things I think are most important: A beautiful venue that is (most importantly) well-rated and tested with plenty of weddings under their belt, a Day Of Coordinator so I don't have to spend the actual day worrying about planning and pulling it off, and a semi-open bar (beer and wine free + signature cocktail ticket, cash bar for mixed drinks and liquor) and good food for our guests.\n\nMeanwhile my fiance, who has done *nothing*, is fighting me over every damn dollar. Literally the only contribution he has made to wedding planning has been to tell me not to spend so much money on X, Y, Z and whining that \"we could do this all for 2k\" having done zero actual research or budgeting.\n\nI feel like it would be one thing if he was just wanting a courthouse ceremony with two friends to witness and I insisted on dragging him through this whole rigmarole, but he is absolutely rigid on the one thing that basically makes everything cost more money: the guest count.\n\nI have honestly never felt unequal in our relationship before all this, but for this whole process I have felt like a project manager doing all of the work to make a collective vision happen while my fiance is the stoner employee who doesn't even show up half the time. I feel like I have to suffer a guilt trip for every single dollar spent even though I'm the only one actually *working* to make it cheaper. He has no ideas for how to pull off his 2k wedding vision, he's just upset it isn't happening.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting a 10k wedding? I know the marriage is ultimately more important, but it's still important to me to share the biggest day of my life with my friends and family. And to be honest, this experience has me worried about his ability to compromise and to step up when things aren't going exactly how he wants. I almost want to ask if I would be the asshole for taking the loss on half the deposits and backing out...or if I am an asshole/bridezilla for even thinking of throwing out the whole relationship over a wedding.",

I have done it all, and was the treasurer for two years. As treasurer I never stole or misplaced a penny. I am a very trustworthy person and all the guys know that. I am in my last year of college and no longer hold any positions, just to be clear.\n\n  \nThis past weekend, a group of around 10 of us are at the bar. This bar is cash only, and it is around 2 A.M. and our current President pulls out the fraternity's debit card and tries to buy a round of shots for everyone. Clearly, being cash only this did not work. He then goes on to ask if anyone has cash, and the fraternity will pay them back the next day. I had cash on me, so I agreed to pay for the $50 of shots, as I was promised to be paid back almost immediately. The next day, I sent over a Venmo request for the money. Our president refused to pay me back for the $50 because \"he was wasted\" and told me to figure out who was all there and request the money for them. Well, I did not want to have -$50 in my account as I have bills to pay. I told him to pay me the money and then he can figure out who has to pay him and request it from them, seeing that it was his idea to order the shots. He was refusing to do this as well. Seeing as how I was previously the treasurer, I still have a debit card in my name so I went to an ATM and took out the $50 that was owed to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter doing this, the fraternity is acting like I am sort of a thief. I even told the president that I took the money out and he can worry about chasing after people to get what is owed to the account back. So, AITA here?",

      "description": "Hello guys! I'm new here, so just bare with me, ok? And English is not my first language, so this text will probably have some grammatical errors. Oh, I'm also 16, so prepare for some high school drama.\n\nThis all started in the end of 2017, I was in this group of friends that were really nice to me. We had the same type of interests (videogames, anime, music, etc) and I was having a blast of a time. But, one day they started doing a hobby that I wasn't very interested in, and slowly I was distancing myself from the group. Everyday they would talk about the hobby, leaving me out of conversations and stuff. I tried to like the activity so that I could talk something about it, but just found it that it wasn't for me.\n\nWhen I realized that I was distancing myself from the group, I tried to be more \"socially active\". I would try to include myself in conversations, throw BBQ parties and do some other crazy stuff, so that I could be able to talk about anything at all, and at a certain time, I realized I was getting desperate for attention. I just wanted to be able to talk to them like it was before.\n\nI admit I did some stupid stuff, like for example, I throwed a pencil in my friend's face because he was talking too much in class , and because I thought that it would be a funny joke (I later apologised). I tried a lot of things to keep our friendship going.\n\nI did that until the start of 2019 (long time, I know) when a friend told me that he was sick of my attention-seeking behavior and wanted me out of his life. He said that he tried to have a friendship with me, but he couldn't because was too much of a pain in the ass for him. 3/4 of my friends agreed with him and I was left shocked. So then I started to vent out every single problem I had with them (I told one of my friends that his relationship was rotten and disgusting to see, for example). \n\nI lost around 8 friends that day, except for my best friend. So, basically I lost my friends because I was craving for attention. Am I the asshole? \n\n\n\n",

I took it to a local repair shop and it has been working fine until last week. \n\nSo yesterday I went to the same shop. They've checked it. I mentioned , that I've been here with it before. He checked and said it will be repaired under warranty, which was over 6 months ago. I even asked him if it would really be free and under warranty , he said yes without checking  I'm a broke college student so avoiding a hefty repair cost would be awesome. \n\nSo WIBTA if I just stayed quiet?",

      "description": "Background:  I have two close friends, A and B.  A is a pretty timid and shy guy, who has only been in a few relationships.  His last relationship ended in disaster when his ex cheated on him with another guy and when he found out, she left him.  It was an incredibly nasty situation that left him with serious trust issues, and he didn't start dating until a solid year after the incident.  Anyways, he met my other close friend, B, at a party an they hit it off, and about a week later they officially started dating.  FF three months later to the present, and B and I are together talking about life, work, etc, when she casually mentions she's cheating on A.  I make sure she isn't joking but it turns out she's been seeing someone else on the side since only a couple weeks after she started dating A.  She told me not to tell A and that he would be fine, but I knew this was not true.  I told her she should come clean and tell A, especially given his past relationships, but she refused and said it was \"no big deal.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter having my discussion with B, I waited a while to decide what to do.  Because of A's previous relationship and how it ended, I knew he would be devastated and likely have even more trust issues if he found out B was cheating on him, and it seemed like B genuinely cared about A, she just had the other guy as someone to fool around with.  However, I eventually decided to tell A in person when we talked a couple days ago, as if he found out directly, I think the shock would have been even worse.  Needless to say, he was hurt and distressed, but what I did not expect was him to go on a full-blown rant over social media, essentially exposing B as a cheater, as well as throwing in ad-hominem and personal secrets.  The entire thing spread quickly, and soon most of the larger social group that we are all a part of knew about the breakup and the cheating.  Because A's previous breakup was well-known, and people pitied him, many people immediately took A's side.  Apparently the guy B was cheating with left her too because he thought he was the only one as well.  Many people also started to harass B over social media, using the secrets A had exposed on his social media rant to personally target her to the point where she had to quit all social media for the time being,  B's closest friends were the only ones who took her side, and they quickly isolated themselves from our larger social group.  They also bombarded me with messages, calling me untrustworthy and a fake friend.  B has not contacted me directly.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel really bad for causing such a giant rift in our group, but I also think that it would have been worse if I had not told A, and let the issue fester until eventually A found out in another, more confrontational way.  So anyways, AITA for telling A that B is cheating, leading to a massive feud and eventually costing B most of her friendships and becoming a social outcast? ",

      "description": "I’m currently at uni, and I’ve managed to get a pretty good roommate. He’s really nice and chill, but of course we don’t live in perfect harmony. One thing that can kind of bother me sometimes is how he eats. It feels like he drags out his bites, and he makes it so you can hear *everything*, even the long, comical swallow. He also makes this soft moaning sound and breathes heavily when he eats. It seriously sounds like he’s pleasuring himself with food sometimes. It can be really distracting.\n\nI feel like I shouldn’t ask him about it though, as it could be embarrassing. I know I have habits or ticks that I either don’t notice or I would be embarrassed to be told about. I also feel like he’s a lot better of a roommate anyway. I’m messier for sure, and a lot of times I can be up late on my computer (brightness down of course), which he assures is fine. I could always just go to the library too, but sometimes I just wanna study in my room. What do you think?",

      "description": "Help me Reddit. Me (31f) and my husband (24m) have been married 5 years and have a 1 yr old. At the beginning of our relationship he had a few 'indiscretions ' with some other women that did not amount to cheating but were painful for me. About 6 months ago, I caught him texting and visiting a girl at her workplace. His brother was involved in hiding this from me. I do not believe it went farther and we have since been working on our relationship. I have repeatedly suggested we go spend the night in a hotel to get away a bit, and he has promised to do so once finances stabilize. \nSeveral nights ago he asked if I would be ok with him spending the night at his brother's as a guys night and I agreed. Our relationship has been doing great and trusted him to do that. Today he says they want to go to an indoor waterpark that happens to be in a hotel. It is my understanding they will still be staying at his brother's. I am more hesitant, but I agree. I find out after he leaves the resort requires a room purchase to use the waterpark. He knew this beforehand, and it is his position he thought I realized this. I am very hurt he took his brother for a night at a resort rather than me, (petty I know) and am upset because them staying the night at a hotel was more trust than I was ready for. I feel he worded what the plans were intentionally to leave me with the impression they would be staying at his brother's. This may not be true. Regardless, I called him and we had a giant fight, and part of me wants to take a few days apart to cool off. Reddit, AITA here? Was calling him and possibly ruining his night an overreaction?",

      "description": "So essentially here’s the situation:\n\nOn Mon/Wed/Fri for school days, the school’s gym is used by whatever sports team needs it. However, anybody can come in and do what they want providing they are safe and don’t interfere with the team sports. \n\nI’ve been going to weight rooms by myself and lifting alone now for awhile and have had no issues  whatsoever from any coach, as for the most part, I know what I’m doing and know correct form and lifting procedures.\n\nHowever, today, I was doing overhead press alone, like usual, and in the middle of my set, the track coach comes up to me and tells me to rack the weight, right when I’m lifting the weight up. (I’ll come back to this detail later). He tells me that I have to either do something at the free weights area or leave because he needs his players to do deadlift. I then got into a bit of an argument with him as I felt that was ridiculous what he did. In the end, I ended up going to the free weight area and finishing up my workout. \n\nNow I would totally be fine with this if it wasn’t for four reasons:\n\n1. Some football players were doing the EXACT same thing I was independently, in their own power racks, alone, without a spotter.\n\n2. The players that came into my old spot had no clue what they were doing and were fooling around, potentially causing injuries.\n\n3. He wouldn’t let me finish another two or three sets which would’ve taken 5 minutes, simply forced me out immediately.\n\n4. He yelled at me in the middle of my set which is incredibly dangerous for the lifter and anyone near them as it could cause them to drop the weight out of surprise.\n\nNow granted for his viewpoint, he didn’t want me getting injured, and I was struggling on my last rep, which he saw. So that could’ve caused him to perhaps panic a bit. And he also needed to get his players lifting so that they could get out on time. \n\nI’m not sure how to feel about this. Most of me is really pissed off at getting treated like this, but the other small part feels that I maybe should’ve gone easier on him.\n",

      "description": "We broke up suddenly on the 11th of this month after I just recovered from a virus. I found out he was lying and when he was truthful he point blank told me after 5ish years that he hasn't loved me in a year. That was in response to me asking him why tinder was on his phone (for the 3rd time).  Like 0-100. \n\nSo I took time went to work and then we went to dinner where I calmly told him he needed to leave my house at the end of the month which is coming soon. He hasn't packed he plans to travel and come back after trash day  so I won't be able to throw away anything he leaves for a week. And personally the lack of effort or care is maddening. So I've been texting all my friends to distract me and get food and junk and reaching out to one older lady friend had her ask me to do her hair the day he comes back (2 days from now.) \n\nSo I told him \"hey heads up i may not be here doing someone's hair\" that can take up to 10 hours depending on the style. I asked him to re work his plans a bit since I don't know what he's doing in terms of when he will be back or when I need to open the door for him. \n\nSo he replied I should just leave the door open. I said no it's not safe. \n\nHe said I should tell my neighbor to open the door for him. I said no she just went through another jaw surgery I know she's not feeling well (we both get body pains due to blood conditions or medical procedures so we talk and share do some salts sometimes) and it's really better to just re plan this. So I said why don't you pick up your stuff on Friday. \n\nTo which he responded with \"so I'm just supposed to be here in the cold with out my stuff until Friday.\" \n\nI don't know why but this made me snap. In my mind I'm thinking what?? Your coming back from a work trip you have a suitcase with clothes, and you have ample time to ask to crash somewhere. Not only that but you weren't going to stay after packing so you're not just in the cold. \n\nSo I responded with this\n\n\"Are you trying to guilt me or something? Am I not giving you notice to my plans? Figure your self out! I'm not leaving my door open it's dangerous.  I'm not bothering Jackie she just got surgery. It's not my fault you fucked up and have no place to live, you've been in that position long enough you would think you would be used to the cold already.  I'm telling you my plans if you can't do the same because you don't want to that's on you. \"\n\nAnd now I'm being told by some friends that I should just let him leave it'll be quick do hair another day it's not a big deal. The basic complaint is just let him in on that day so he s out of your life and we can forget about each other. \n\nI quoted this woman a base of 150.00 and she always tips well. I don't feel like catering to him. Does that make me an asshole? maybe im taking out my anger by saying yes to those plans?\n",

      "description": "So I work in a small business doing something that is very specialized. Because of that, I'm going to go light on the details of what I do. \n\n\nMy boss is much older than me. Two generations older than me. He harbours a lot of negative opinions towards modern technology and instead sticks to old fashioned ways of doing things. \n\n\nMy boss isn't interested in any kinds of radio or TV ads and absolutely abhors the idea of advertising online. Instead, he has me do things like go and visit other businesses that are in the same industry to tell them about what we do and hand out flyers, and stick leaflets in mailboxes and on doorsteps when I am working in a nice neighborhood. \n\n\nHe usually has me devote 2 entire work days a month to doing 'visits', and because I am the second highest paid person in the building, it isn't cheap for me to spend 2 entire days doing these things. He has me specifically do them because I present well to people. \n\n\nI personally believe that these visits are not only a waste my time, but they actually hurt the image of the business. Typically when I go into another business I just get the receptionist and she very clearly isn't interested so I try my best to be polite and use the least amount of her time as possible, but I cant help but feel that I am bothering her and making her have negative opinions toward us, which she will inevitably voice to her coworkers, making them feel the same way. I feel as though I'm some sort of door-to-door solicitor when in reality we have a great little business and are extremely reputable. I've been asked many times to stop coming back, and I always oblige and be as polite as possible, and then wince when I get to the work truck because I feel as though I just tarnished the reputation of the business I'm working so hard to build up.\n\n\nI think that this type of advertising maybe could have worked about 50 years ago, but it just isn't up to date. The amount of online advertising he could do for two days of wages for me would make way more sense in my opinion. I've told my boss three times how I feel about doing these visits but he still insists I do them; however, I usually spend the majority of the day in a coffee shop or visiting friends instead of actually going around and doing the visits. I maybe visit 2 or 3, instead of the 14 to 18 I'm supposed to go to.\n\n\nTo be honest, I feel like I'm an asshole for not doing what I'm being paid to do, but on the other hand, I feel like I'm saving our reputation by not making us look like solicitors. Am I the asshole? ",

I snapped, told her to fuck off, and I was unable to sleep that night\n\nThese few days she has been trying to act supportive, saying she's sorry and I deserve better.

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom\n\nA little bit of context: \n\nI (29M) live with a 51-year old man. We met 10 years ago when he coached me in acrobatics and since he didn't have kids and since my family situation was not the greatest, he became sort of like a father or a brother to me. We've been living together for a long time (though we sometimes spend a few months apart when he goes on vacation in his hometown during summer &amp; Christmas). Over the last year, I've fallen into a rather severe depression with anxiety issues. My roommate has been super understanding and supportive, but sometimes he acts in a rather immature and unreasonable way, at least in my perspective. \n\nBecause of my depression/anxiety, last night I couldn't sleep at all. I had an anxiety attack and was generally super stressed out. I decided to stay up and try to take my mind off of it by playing video games on my PC in the kitchen until I couldn't keep my eyes open. \n\nUsually, my roommate is very respectful and tries to keep somewhat quiet. Not that it would matter because when I sleep, I'm usually deeply asleep that him doing chores around the house don't bother me in the slightest. And it's good too, because not having a girlfriend or kids, he's often bored. But a week ago he decided to order a drill on Amazon to start a new project, he just likes building stuff. Unfortunately for me, he received it yesterday. \n\nYou can guess what happened. Since I went to sleep at around 10 AM (he was still asleep by then, I couldn't tell him about my anxiety attack), obviously I was still sleeping at 12:30 PM, when he decided to use his drill. I can sleep through a lot but that one was a little too much. When he came close to my room to pick some stuff, I asked him if he could wait until I was up to use his drill. He sounded upset and said, \"It's 12:30!\" \n\nI had a doctor's appointment at 2:30 so I got up at 1:30 anyway. He stopped using his drill but he was pretty upset. I've known him for so long I can tell when he's in a bad mood. So when I came back I immediately felt the tension. I wasn't personally mad at him, right now I'm mostly just tired as hell but his attitude when I asked him about it really bothers me. I feel like he's putting all the blame on me. His argument is, he can't stop himself from doing stuff just because I'm asleep. And I partially agree, it sucks for him if he has to keep quiet while I sleep, but I've had a lot of sleep issues for some time now and when *he* decides to stay in bed until 1 PM and I'm up at 6 am, I stay as quiet as I can. Or whenever he has to get up early in the morning and then comes back and take a nap in the afternoon because he's tired. \n\nFrom my perspective, he just got a little too excited that he got his drill yesterday and really wanted to use it. He got angry because he knew the right thing to do was to wait, but he didn't want to. And now he's guilting me into going to bed so late, taking a one-hour nap yesterday in the afternoon, and having anxiety in general. \n\nI don't want to argue with him and I'm staying calm even though he isn't, but it's still irritating to me. I come from a house where people would make noise on purpose at 8 AM just because *they* were forced to get up early for work (while I worked in the afternoon), and it feels just about the same. He works for a whole 3 hours tonight, so I guess he thought he wouldn't have time to use his drill at all today and would have to just wait and be bored until I decided to get up. I think he's in the wrong, but I'm not looking to *win* an argument, but rather understand it. AITA here? Is there something I have missed, or do I not have perspective because this is affecting me directly? \n\nTL;DR: Had an anxiety attack last night, didn't go to bed until early in the morning, roommate decided to say fuck it and make a lot of noise at 12:30 PM because he didn't want for me to wake up.

      "description": " I admit the topic frustrates me because I use two bath towels in the time he uses 6+ and just leaves them on the floor. I still often just gather them and do a load when mine are used enough times.  I also will jokingly say \"another fucking towel\" dramatically when I find one in the bed when I lay down.  I almost always laugh it off. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days ago I asked John to wash a load of towels as we had a small pile of kitchen ones. I'm pretty sure that I heard his eyes roll but he obliged.  Two days ago I see that once dry he just pulled them out onto the floor (on top of another pile of his previously dried clothes). I dug my towels out to shower and groaned audibly.  Because inside I'm screeching. Last night I had to do a load because I'm out of socks and I \"ask\" in an admittedly annoyed tone that he please put the towels away.  He says \"can you?\". I breathe because I'm irrationally angry at this point about this simple laundry.  And just say \"can you just do it it won't take much time. \" to which his reply is \"if it won't take much time then you just do it\". I just wanted him to clean up the pile before I need to dry my socks ffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm absolutely pissed at this point because we both have an issue with seeing the other's housework efforts for some reason. It's something we have fought about and it continues to come up. Either he's gotten better about picking up or I've gotten better at acknowledging it. Maybe both.  Regardless this is pretty much the pain point of the relationship which I feel lucky to say. I often struggle knowing if I'm being rational. For me it felt balancing for him to do the towels possibly for the first time on 6+ months and I feel like he just decides he's done enough and often refuses to do more.  Sometimes he's working and sometimes he is watching YouTube. \n\n\n\n\nAn important note is that neither of us are the cleanest but we both usually do a mass cleanup of our laziness at least once a week. I did suggest a trello board or something (it's a project management thing with an app) so we can track our tasks and prove to each other what we do but he said he will not do it because it's too micro.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAm I an asshole here? Should I just swallow my irritation and fold the damn towels and stop complaining? I'm trying to avoid unnecessary background so hopefully I didn't exclude anything that's relevant.  We're talking about it tonight because last night I just calmed down and told him i found what he said to be rude and disrespectful. I was winding down for bed and knew I wouldn't sleep much otherwise.  \n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So I haven't spoken to my oldest brother since April. Long story, but I got sick of his manipulation of my mom and told him he was a disappointment and to not talk to us anymore. \nThat was also his 30th birthday. \n\nAnyway, he's always been into drugs and is always either selling them or doing them or in a gang or in jail. Ever since he was around 15. And since then he has fought my mom, fought my dad, fought my other brother and just in general tortured me. \n\nIf he would spend time in jail, and then get out, he would be good. And he was a good brother when he was clean and sober, but the alcohol and drugs messed him up and made him a horrible person to everyone around...he would never stay clean long and always go back to drugs and alcohol and fighting. \n\n\nSo on to the letter, \n\nHe recently got put in prison (hes only ever been in jail before) in another state and he wrote everyone in my family a letter. \n\nMine was really nice, he apologized for being a jerk to me growing up and everything. And it was nice, but afterwards my mom said that he needs us to all write him really nice recommendation letters to get him paroled. \n\nHe does not get to go in front of the parole board, just his lawyer and if you write a nice letter, that goes too. \n\nSo, hes facing five years and if he gets paroled he will only have served 1 year. \n\nI dont want to do it. I think he just apologized to get me to write a letter, and I dont want to do it. \n\nEvery time he goes to jail he gets out early, he never learns and he thinks hes bullet proof. \n\nI want him to stay in. To show him that he has to pay for his actions. He needs to stop getting out early because I feel like it teaches him that'll he'll just be able to get off if he does it again. \n\nI'm over it. He needs to figure his life out. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for not wanting to write this letter or recommendation and for encouraging my family not to either?",

      "description": "Alright my girlfriend and I just recently rented an apartment. I work in construction and one day on the job my buddy that works longside and I were messing around demolishing this old house, an old lady lived there and died and my buddy and i were lucky enough to find some pretty decent jewelry to take home. So we are tearing down walls, removing furniture and we thought it was funny to play with the sledgehammer, we were smashing vases, plates, picture frames, it was a blast, not to lie but we were a little high on drugs at the time. so he ended up accidentally smashing my ankle, so I ended up having a fucked ankle that i couldnt walk on. There was no way I could  afford the medical bill so I just went with toughing out the pain. So come along my girlfriend and I are drinking with one of my buddy's one night in the living room getting drunk, when I go to the bathroom i take a moment to put my ear to the door to hear my girlfriend say \"you want it?\" And then I hear a sound simmilar to a buckle unbelting and 10 secs later I hear my buddy groan. I am too drunk to process what was going on at the time so i take my piss, flush the toilet, and when i come out of the bathroom I see him lying on his belly with his face in vomit on the carpet. So i pat him on the back, help him up, and tell him to get home. So next morning I had a huge hangover, and I remember last night and put the pieces together, and it hit me over the head, I realized my girl was giving my friend top last night. So then I'm thinking of a way to confront her about it. And i had the perfect plan. So later that night when she comes home from work she seems drunk, not drunk but absolutley piss drunk. she lays on the couch and throws her purse on the ground, i see her wallet fall out and i see her needles, pictures of us, lighter, checkbooks, and what i saw in her wallet caught my eye, it was a condom, now i know this may sound weird but me and my girl never use condoms, like ever. Not once have we used them, and I see that this condom wrapper was already opened, so it meant she used it on some other man. Which was almost definitley my buddy. So I let her rest and when she wakes up its 10am, she goes to the fridge to get a bud light, and then we have our routine oral. So she's giving me top and it's amazing, then i remember that she cheated on me. So im about to tell her, then she tells me \"it isnt as hard as it always is, whats the matter?\" So I get angry and i push her and yell \"thats why you givinf my homeboy top on the side! Damn hoe! How could you do this?\" So she gets all angry at me and smacks my cock, and it hurt a lot, so then i punched her jaw and it was lights out for her, then she falls down and immediately throws up. So then I immediatley regret it and i hug her and kiss her and tell her im sorry i didnt mean to do it. I didnt mean to punch her. Am I the asshole for punching her?",

      "description": "I'm writing on mobile so sorry for any issues\n\nI (14F) usually have quite good grades and is seen as the smart person/ nerd of the class.\n\nBecause I usually do good on tests/ get good grades I get a bit \"down\" (a bit annoyed at myself is probably the best way to explain it) if I get a lesser grade than I had hoped for. This really isn't a problem to me cause I usually get motivated to study harder next test.  The whole problem really stems from the fact that I'm apparently not allowed to feel this way cause other people would still see the grades I got as \"good\" grades. I've never said the grade I've gotten is shit or anything like that, they usually just call me the asshole when I'm not happy/ staying quite when they talk about how happy they are with their grade etc. I have some friends with worse grades than me (they aren't failing or anything) that get extremely annoyed and offended when I for say am not happy with a B and they got a C and saying I'm an asshole cause I \"think they're bad\" (which I don't). \nThis in general isn't horrible and I can live with it but I kinda just want to know if I'm actually TA and should be happy about the grade.\n\nSorry for shit grammar english isn't my first language.\n\nSo AITA?

      "description": "I went in to my favorite ramen restaurant today. Just like any other day, i went for a late lunch and sat at the bar top while the rest of the place was practically empty. My server and one of the cooks preceded to have a conversation about who was fucking up the most out of the two of them and the cook kept telling him that he’s the worst employee of the bunch and it’s his (the cooks) job to make sure my server stays in line. My server smarted off to this guy and the cook got very hostile and went on an offensive and said “I’m about thirty seconds from putting your ass on the floor.” My server responded back with a bit of force and volume “Is like to see you fucking try.”\n\nNow, this is all happening literally 5-7 feet away from me, in a small ramen shop that is nearly empty except the staff, myself and 1 maybe 2 other customers. \n\nAs soon as the cook said that I chimed calmly, yet firmly in with... “ The two of you need to shut the hell up or go in the back. I’m here trying to enjoy a peaceful lunch and you two are just fighting over petty shit and I honestly don’t care to hear any of it. So either shut the hell up or leave” \n\nI honestly was as only audible enough for them to hear and likely the other customer heard. But we are all in a quiet place about 20 feet wide. Both employees just stopped and stood in a sort of shock for a few moments. Very uncomfortable the cook began to try and justify his side to me and I shut him down again with a “I don’t care. This is some petty shit.” I feel like a really did just break up an impending fight between these two. Although, my server was honestly not very much on the offensive in this convo and I sort of felt like he was maybe a new person. I was otherwise in my typical cheery, polite and grateful mood as usual. I’m pretty sure word got around to the other employees of what happened because ever single person in that place stopped by my seat to see if I had everything I needed. \n\nAte my food, pre stacked dishes, tipped 20+% and left. \n\nAm I really the asshole?

      "description": "First time posting here. The title sounds awful but let me explain.\n\nA little detail about me, from time to time, I like picking up or dropping off people (that I know) on my way to or back from school since I think that It's a nice thing to do, you know, save em a mile of walking or even money (bus rides). I drive a van at the time so, plenty of room. The girl that I picked up is someone I knew since elementary and middle school. My then girlfriend, NOW ex, and I were dating for about a months so I was in that phase where I wanted to impress her by showing her, or in this case, telling her how caring I can be.\n\nThe day before this all went down, I asked my girlfriend If she was down to go on a movie date with me, to which she replied with a happy \"yes\". Fast forward a day and It's around 4pm. I got out of work and was on my way to Walmart. While driving I saw a girl that I knew from Elementary and her family, 3 younger siblings, one looked like she was about 15 years of age, the other two looked no older than 7-8, along with her mother and what I assume to be her bf/brother, walking out of Walmart with heavy baggage. Thought nothing of it, went into Walmart got what I needed and left. Drove back from Walmart, I saw the same girl and her family. Still carrying heavy looking groceries. The kids year old were carrying 2 bag each, looking a little too heavy. The bf/bro had a bag of coals on a should and bunch bags with on the other. Everyone had something to carry. Feeling sorry, I pulled over, waited for the family to reach my van, which I then got out of the van and asked if they'd like a ride home and that I wouldn't mind. They reluctantly agreed. I helped loading their groceries onto my van and asked for their address We were off. The family thanked me after I dropped them off at their house and apologized for the inconvenience, which I didn't mind. I was happy to help.\n\nLater that day, 5:45pm, movie starts at 6:10, I picked up my girlfriend and we were off to the theaters. Wanting to brag to her about how caring of a boyfriend I am. Told her that I saw an old friend from elementary, who happens to be a female, and her family, walking with a heavy load. Offered to give them a ride home. My girlfriend goes silent throughout the whole ride to the theater. Half way through the movie, she silently blew up at me for, and I quote, \"Picking up a slutty bitch in the streets and having the balls to tell her about it\" That REALLY took me by surprise. Baffled, I said \"Wait what? That's what you took from my story? I picked up a FAMILY not just A girl\" Kid you not, she replied \"Her family's not the problem here. You don't talk to your girlfriend about picking up sluts\" I didn't want cause a scene and left with her. I tried explaining to her once more on the way out but she just kept saying the same thing over and over. Eventually I gave up and apologized for picking up a girl, dropped her off at her place and didn't message her that night. AITA here?",

      "description": "Hi guys, just to preface this: my girlfriend doesn't think I'm the asshole, but she thinks I'm overreacting. Most of the people I talked to agreed with me, but some thought I was being controlling and I wanted to get more opinions.  \n  \nMy girlfriend is quitting her job and recently found a new one (part-time). The store hasn't opened yet, so everyone needs to be trained. The boss demanded she put in her two weeks at her current job in order to train for the new job. Her new boss didn't send a training schedule, or even a message about it. Grand opening was 2 weeks away at the time she put in her 2 weeks. A week passed, and her boss texted her back after she asked about training saying Grand Opening was pushed back. Training would start soon.    \n\nAt this point, I figured it was just a case of bad management. But today, her boss texted her asking to meet for coffee to 'discuss training'. I don't understand this. He asked ONLY her (she confirmed with her coworkers). He had already told her she wouldn't be a shift lead, so why does he have to talk with ONLY her? Even if he changed her mind, why would he only promote her? It's a team of 10-15 people, more than 1 shift lead is required (especially since she is only working 2-3 days/week).   \n\nI'm not sure of his exact age, but I believe he is at least 30 years old. She's 18. I don't understand what he can have to discuss with her about training. If he did want to promote her to be a shift lead, why does he have to meet her for coffee outside of work? How can he know if she is competent? Why can't he text her or call her?   \n  \nAfter so much thinking and talking, I decided to go with her (she invited me because she thought I was being paranoid). Am I really being paranoid? Isn't it creepy for a 30+ man to meet an 18 year old girl for coffee to discuss work, when there's really not much to discuss?  \n  \nThe reason why I'm so persistent about this is because I'm a manager at my current job (I work full-time though). I've hired and trained people, participated in grand openings multiple times, etc. I've never heard of this happening. I've never had to meet anyone outside of work to 'discuss training' either. Am I the asshole for going? For thinking this is creepy and she shouldn't be alone? ",

She said that all she wanted was to pick me up quickly and go home. I explained what had happened but she insisted that she had work in the morning so this was hugely inconvenient. We ignored each other for the rest of the car ride. I did apologize when we got home, saying that I couldn’t help when I got off work but I could’ve chosen to not get my bonus check. She still stormed off to her room in a huff and hasn’t said a word to me. AITA?",

      "description": "I’m graduating from college this summer, and I’m already trying to come up with party ideas since most of my family lives out of state. Our schedules are pretty different, and it was disappointing for everyone when they couldn’t have enough heads up to see me graduate from high school. I also meticulously overplan EVERYTHING. \n\nMy grandpa is my dad’s father, who was not a present or consistent part of his life. When he was in it, he treated my dad and uncle terribly. It’s something that still affects them in their 50’s. However, they still love my grandpa and try to include him when they can. I don’t like him, and neither do my mom and cousins. Not only do I dislike him for how he’s treated my dad, but he also makes me uncomfortable because it’s so obvious he sees me as a way to overcompensate not being there for my dad. And even then, he’s done nothing for me, and doesn’t really make an effort to be in my life. Our relationship isn’t necessarily a bad one, but I’ve kept my distance for personal reasons. Full disclosure, nobody in my family really knows how I feel about him. \n\nMy cousin is three years older than me, and graduated a while ago. He explicitly did not want my grandfather to attend, for reasons similar to mine, but he has more of a “relationship” with him than I do because they live closer together. This caused a huge shitstorm in my family. My cousin got shit for it for several months and still does. My dad and uncle AND paternal grandma (divorced from my grandpa when my dad and uncle were kids, has had limited contact since) kept demanding to know why he wasn’t invited, and went so far as to blame my aunt for manipulating him since my aunt doesn’t like him either. This obviously wasn’t true, my cousin just really hates him and didn’t want him to ruin his graduation, but nobody would listen. Even now, years later, I hear about it from my dad. \n\nMy question is, WIBTA if I didn’t invite him to my graduation? My older cousin is like a brother to me and I know he would be upset and betrayed if I invited my grandpa, but if I don’t invite him, my entire family will give me shit. It’ll be ruined either way, honestly. But I don’t want the stress of knowing my grandpa and cousin will face each other to hang over my head. \n",

      "description": "So to set the background, after 4 decades of having jacked teeth and being that guy who only does closed lipped smiles, I decided to get InvisAlign this year (for those who don’t know what that is, it’s clear “plates” that are put over your teeth and switched out every few weeks - They do the work of braces but are nearly invisible).  I’m paying for this out of pocket, as my dental insurance won’t cover it, but I have an opportunity to do so, and luckily I have the means this year to get it done.\n\nI went in last week for my initial appointment, where they use this giant pen device to take a 3D model of your teeth for creating the plates. The first hygienist (we’ll call her H1) takes your typical oral x-rays, before leading me into a chair where I’ll get this scan done.\n\nHygienist 2 (H2), is in there and starts going doing my scan, with H1 looking over her shoulder. During this scan (which takes a while as they’re going through each tooth, H2 is asking a lot of questions of H1, such as “How do you get the angle for that tooth?” And “So, when the color is green, what does that mean? And what about red?”.  In the meantime, I’m just laying back and listening with my mouth wide open.\n\nNext, H1 asks H2 “Yeah, I’m really supposed to learn how to do this.  Hey, do you mind if I do the upper quadrants?” H2 proceeds to say “Sure!” and continues work on the bottom row. Now, during this whole exchange, no one has said a damn word to me to ask if I’m OK being the guinea pig, or if there’s any risk the plates might come out wrong, etc either costing me time, money, pain, or all three.\n\nSo we get to the upper set and H2 is ready to pass the baton, at which point I mention I’m not so sure I’m comfortable with it. Again, it seemed from my layman’s position in the chair listening in, that H1 (who seems extremely nice, mind you), may not even know how to turn the damn thing on from her questions never mind operate it properly.\n\nH2 tells me not to worry about and continues, as does H1 but she seems a bit pissed and mentions she’s been a hygienist for decades. Now I’m starting to feel a bit guilty - Is this brain dead simple and foolproof and I’m being overly cautious? I mentioned (trying to help) that if someone explained how it couldn’t “mess up” and/ or asked me first I probably would have been OK, but that didn’t seem to matter.\n\nI’m torn in being a bit pissed that I’m paying (a lot of) cash and that’s not to provide on-the-job training, but I wonder also if I was simply nervous and being overly cautious.  Am I the asshole here?",

I am not really a cat guy and I give her dog much more love which can be seen I admit. My whole family is severely allergic to cats, and I might be too. I've bee letting her main cat John that she's had forever. Sleep on me while I spend the night I've started to wake up with my eyes itchy and puffy. Her mother has actually considered this a problem in our relationship because I don't care for her cats. I've tried recently but I don't really to touch them. I find them disgusting honestly. My girlfriend keeps bringing it up so I believe it is honestly becoming a problem.  \n\nRecently she has started to come over less because her cats throw a fit whenever she spends the night at my place. I can't bring her cats because my parents will have a severe allergic reaction. I also feel like that she loves her cats more than shell ever love me. I've started to come over to her less because of her cats. \n\nAITA? For not wanting to be near her cats?\n\nTl;dr. My girlfriend hates how I don't pet her cats and I'm beginning to dislike her cats because she puts them above me where I'm starting to avoid her house",

I have to be up at 7am and I worked all day today so I’m exhausted. From what I heard they were arguing about something extremely stupid that then sparked a bigger argument. They legitimately fight ALL the time over the stupidest things. I’ve never known a couple that argues as much as they do. My point here is that they weren’t arguing about something major if that makes sense. \n\nAnyway, my friend kept screaming and crying as if there was no one in the apartment and it really annoyed me so I literally told her to be quiet. She seemed a bit annoyed that I said this but I honestly don’t see how it’s too much to ask of her to be quiet when it’s so late and she’s just screaming. And yes she is still arguing and I can’t sleep because she’s so loud so that is why I’m taking the time to post this.",

      "description": "Further, AITA for wanting to weaponize it?\n\nBut first a little explanation.\n\nLets call my friend simply 'J' and his JSO will simply be JSO.\n\nNow as for J. We're both at the start of our 20's now, but i met him sophomore year at highschool. Became my best friend (granted it was my first year at the school so kind of ONLY friend at that point.) \n\nWent through high school together, and I noticed a trend in him. He was a cheater. I'm talking two sim cards two phones at one point while dating. I've told him time and time again its gonna bite him. \n\nFast forward. End of high school. We're both broke and depressed kids; Who both just hit 18. Shit live. So what other to do than smoke weed? Fast forward 1 year. I come over often to smoke with him. One night he brings this woman along with him. Except hes 18 and shes.. Well, 48. Odd but not my business. Within a few months, sick of his grandparents house he moves in with her.\n\n I had a female friend (FF) at the time (not my SO already had one) who one night i brought with me to his house. On a night where JSO wasn't home. I had to work in the morning and had to take an Uber home that night. She however stayed there. He said he would bring her home later. (Im paraphrasing this alot my memory is awful and this was a couple years ago) \n\nSo, If you could make any sense of my ramblings, you can probably guess what happened. That night J cheated on JSO with FF.\n\nNow I was friends with SO, such a nice woman in every way, I talked to her a lot while over there. Got to know her.\n\nDespite this remember *at the time* he *was* my best friend. (More on that later.). So when he told me to hush about it I swallowed my pride and did. I regretted it. Still do. Its been a couple years.\n\nBut as for the weaponization part. He started to show his true colors. Ever increasingly louder in his spouting of all things homophobic, in a group(a chat with 6 or so people) where 2 are LGBT. Instead of being subtle with his bullying he was not being a blatant asshole. Bullying on his childhood best friend for no reason, treating everyone including JSO like shit.\n\nTurned into a scumlord. At this point I've about had it with him. However the power I hold will result in a vendetta against me if he finds out it was me. I was the sworn secret holder and still am. Using this will likely result in him being forcefully kicked out and subsequently homeless. But there's just a deep itch in me to line my sights at him and the scum he has become, and pull the trigger on the whole thing. Take him down a few pegs that he proudly sits so high on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Background:\n\n+ Mom\n- Had surgery, can't drive until she recovers\n- Travels 40 miles /wk MAX when she was healthy. Less now that she has retired\n- Lives with me + wife\n- Temp staying w/ my brother b/c he lives in a ranch and it's easier to walk\n- After she heals, will move back in w/ us\n- I alone pay ALL her expenses except car pmt &amp; car/health insurance which she pays for (mom, wife, &amp; my cars all on my policy)\n- Mom's car: 2013 Honda ~34,000 miles\n- My car: 2015 Sports car ~45,000 miles\n- I typically pay for maintenance on her car\n\nPrior to surgery, mom had been in a lot of pain for a month+ so she had not been driving her car much at all. After surgery, my wife &amp; I entered a major life event &amp; I decided it was a good idea to sell my car b/c I wanted to reduce expenses. As such, I posted my car for sale, parked it in the garage, but drove it 1 day /wk over 3 wks so it sells close to stated mileage. I decided to use mom’s car since it was in the driveway and not getting use. It needed to be driven to stay properly maintained. Not only that but she needed maintenance on her car &amp; I wanted it to get it to the proper mileage before I spent $250 to do it.\n\nFlash fwd 3 weeks - my brother begins interrogating me about using my mom's car and how I'm putting miles on it (I put ~40 – 50 mi on it /day Mon-Fri) and if I get into an accident it will decrease her value instead of mine (implying I’d rather sacrifice her stuff instead of mine). I have 2 accidents on record in my car - 1 @ fault, the other not. No citations on record. My track record is pretty good and I'm a defensive driver. He's getting his panties in a bunch over me using my mom's car &amp; I don't see the issue b/c as I see it, if I need to use my mom's car, I will. Just like if he or sis needed it, they would use it, too. We see cars as \"family\" assets &amp; share whenever anyone is in need. He goes on about how I \"feel\" about my car &amp; honestly, yea I LIKE my car but not in love with it. If anyone in the family needed to use it, I'd give it to them but it's a sports car &amp; has no real-world utility so nobody has asked. I don't ever talk or brag about my car but he, on multiple occasions, has taken it upon himself to brag about it to company visiting my house &amp; will walk people down to the garage to show it off. I'm not a fan of this behavior AT ALL &amp; find it very awkward &amp; uncomfortable. Pretty sure he feels some type of way about me having the car.\n\nI argue back with him stating he's making a lot of assumptions and making it seem like I'm stealing from mom. Yes, I'm using her car &amp; I'm keeping miles off mine so I can sell it to get a more practical one. She isn't using it &amp; he's being overly sensitive. This is my own opinion but I suspect he wants to \"keep the miles off\" so he can try to influence my mom into selling her car to him so his wife has a car as she currently doesn't.\n\nAm I the asshole for using my mom's car while she heals?",

The parking spots on one side has a row of probably around 30-40 spaces and after every 10 spots or so there is an emergency driveway to get into the college that spaces out the spots even more. One day I turn into this road and see a spot about to be open in the front (space #3) and parked. The car coming out and me swooping in was a matter of seconds but as I was coming in I noticed a car down the road (around space #10ish) picking up speed coming towards the spot. After I parked the lady was apparently waiting at the end of the row got all crazy and said I stole her parking spot. Before I even responded she sped off made a U turn and found a parking spot on the other side. I was thinking well at least she got a spot so I didn't feel bad but then I thought why did I even feel bad? I did notice her for a split second but she should have been behind the car that was leaving with her blinker. At the end when we got out of our cars I just said \"well you got a spot\" and just left it at that. AITA? ",

She understands people around her but that's it.  \n\nEveryone in my family is trying to say positive things to keep her happy as she passes. I took the time, when I was watching her (alone), to apologize for everything that's made her disappointed in me. \n\n\nI chose to date someone for years, not a part of my culture.  Something she was strongly against it.  And she told me she hated it. She never met her because of how much she hated the fact that she was different.  And that her family would not like me either, because they would hate me like how my mom hates my girlfriend. This is true, her family does not want to meet me because I am not of their culture. I said I was sorry for making the choice to stick with it.\n\nI was under a lot of pressure one day, my mom brought up my marriage life and told me to break it off with my girlfriend. I screamed in her face.  Called her evil.  Said it over and over again. I ran outside the house to cool off.  My mom thought I hated her for cancer (which is not something I said and I did clarify that I didn't think cancer makes her evil).  I apologized for calling her evil.  \n\nI told her I loved her and I wish I was better.  She started breathing faster.  I was selfish and I made the choice to apologize in a situation where she can't speak back with me.  \n\nI know I would have hit a stone wall if I tried to apologize in better times, because I've approached her multiple times and she has shot me down about my girlfriend.\n\n\nI feel...a little better.  But I know my mom doesn't.  She feels sad that I cried.  She feels sad that she can't speak to say anything.  If she could she would say to break it off and make dad happy.\n\n\nOn her deathbed I took the selfish choice.  And made apologies that she couldn't say anything too.  She's dying.

      "description": "So I'll try to make this short but basically in a few months I'm going with a class across country for the first time. The teachers said that the best thing to do is to get good shoes and one hiking pack, both of which my parents got me (I'll explain this in a bit). \n\nA few weeks ago my brother was the victim of a hit and run and now that I'm on spring break I am going to visit him. I'm using this trip as a sort of test run for the class trip later. \n\nMy parent didn't want me to drive the 10+ hours to my brothers so I got train tickets and they are going to pay me back (this is where them paying for my shoes and backpack come in). \n\nMy mom wanted me to take a package up with me. I told her a few times that I wanted it to fit inside the bookbag since I need to practice taking on the essentials but it seems she kept adding more things.\n\nShe kept saying I could just carry it but I wasnt really paying attention because I told her it needed to fit in the bookbag. Today I \"put my foot down\" and told her I didnt want to carry some big box and have to worry about it for 10+ hours on the train and through my brothers city. \nShe got really mad and hung on me. Now she's home and won't talk about it. \n\n*side note, she tends to buy rather useless things that no one needs/asked for. All I know that was going in the package was a small teapot and some dvds, I dont know what else it could be. I tried to tell her I could take some of the stuff but she said that since I made it clear I wasn't going to help her then she would just mail it. ",

      "description": "Little background for context.\n\nI made a huge mistake in my childhood and never made much of an attempt to learn how to cook when my mom would offer to teach. Then I was in the army and got fed 3 times a day for free so I've never moved past eating microwaved stuff. My ex-wife claimed she could cook but I later found out she couldn't cook much of anything and we settled on simple cheap meals. I got divorced about a year and a half ago. Since then, I've been eating the same simple cheap meals (such as taking a box of macaroni then throwing some cheese and skyline chili into it) and it doesn't bother me much. But stuff like that is all I really eat since I can't cook for shit. I've been trying to learn how to cook more from my mom but being single really kills my drive to make better meals so I'm not getting much better at it.\n\nSo recently I've been warming up to the idea of trying to date again (despite this subs best attempts to cool me right the fuck back down from it) and have been asking my friends for a bit of advice on what to include on my dating profile. I mentioned that I would prefer finding someone who can cook so that I don't feel like I'm dragging them down to my simple meal lifestyle. I also genuinely enjoy learning how to cook and would think it would be a fun thing to do together.\n\nMy friends all unanimously agreed that I am a misogynistic asshole for apparently expecting women to know how to cook. Even though I said I'd gladly cook with her since I want to learn too and if she doesn't feel like cooking that night then we'd go out or order something. But that didn't dissuade my friends and now I'm the misogynist of the group.\n\nWIBTA for having that preference?",

      "description": "I'm sorry if this is more suited to /r/relationships but I more want to know if I'm being an asshole than asking for advice so I thought I'd post here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess the place to start is that I will be graduating college in May, the plan has always been for me and my BF to move in together once I do. My parents own a house that due to a long story involving asshole neighbors we had to move away from when I was 11. The house never sold so for a long time they've been renting it out. Basically, around when I graduate the current tenants plan to move out so my parents have offered to put the mortgage (which has about 10 years left) in my name. I'd pay less than what the current rent is to own a home in the nearish future and really want to take advantage of this. My BF currently lives in a friends home, paying about $100 less than what \"rent\" and utilities would be at this house.   \n\n\nWe've been having an argument repeatedly about moving in to this house once I graduate. On my end, I see it as an opportunity that most people my age will never have and that I should for sure take. It will be cheaper than pretty much any other place we could possibly find to rent. This is on top of the fact that I simply don't want to live where he is living now. His room has barely enough space for a queen bed and no closet of any kind, I would have no space for my things as there's barely enough for his. This is on top of the fact that I just feel awkward in the home. The friend who lives there I am also close with, however it's his dad that owns the house and also lives there. The dad is nice, it just feels like I'm a guest who frequently overstays their welcome. I also am not a huge fan of the level of cleanliness in the house, but I don't really think I should be deep cleaning their kitchen  or throwing away clutter for them. Essentially, I don't believe it would ever feel like a home to me. Even if I don't end up living in the house available to me forever, if I owned it I could sell and have something towards buying another place of my own. I also feel that if I own it, even though we aren't married, my BF would basically own it too. It would be ours.   \n\n\nMy BF believes that it would be too expensive (for reference, it would be about $240 + utilities). His other reasons are 1) the \\~30 min. commute to work 2) his friends live where he currently is (around 45 min away from this house) 3) the road and driveway are shitty. 4) the last time he moved out on his own he felt incredibly unprepared and was hemorrhaging money. The last time I tried to talk to him about this ongoing argument he said that \"it's your thing anyway\" and that I'm not considering that he's satisfied where he is. \n\nAm I the asshole for saying that I won't be satisfied there and that he should consider that too?

      "description": "\nSo I work as a systems engineer and my job consists of my flying every Monday to a certain project site and flying back every Friday, all of which my company pays for. And because I fly so often I have status with Southwest and I am usually first 30 to get on the airplane. \n\nOn my flight to Kansas city this eventful day I walked into the plane as I usually do and looked for an emergency exit seat because I'm 6'4, have long legs and can't really fit in the regular seats. So I reach the emergency exit row and I see there's a backpack sitting in the aisle seat, and a man in the window seat and an open middle seat. Me not wanting to sit in the middle seat grab this unknown persons backpack and move it to the middle seat and basically take their aisle seat, all this knowing Southwest has an open seating policy where you can't claim seats. I know this person hasn't really sat in the seat because I was with A group and we all entered the plane at nearly the same time. \n\nAbout 2-3 minutes later a woman shows up coming from the direction of the bathroom on the plane, I'm assuming she had just put her backpack down to claim her seat and went to bathroom. She looks at me (I'm a young guy only 24) and doesn't even attempt to talk to me, just goes straight to the flight attendant saying I took her seat which I technically did. So the flight attendant comes and questions me about why I can't sit in all the other open seats. I'm a very confrontational type of person not someone who backs down easy, so I start arguing with the flight attendant that I am too tall to fit in a regular seat and don't want to sit in the middle seat. I tell her it's open seating and people can't claim seats and continue arguing with this flight attendent. At this point a scene has been caused and people are getting jammed up in the aisle, a second flight attendent who was listening in the line makes her way through and says \"Sir if you don't move out of that seat we will have to escort you off the plane\"\n\nAfter hearing this I momentarily thought about standing my ground and actually getting kicked off the plane but thought it wasn't worth it so I moved to the middle seat. As soon as I start moving the man in the window seat was so fed up and annoyed of me that he said you can have my seat and grabbed his stuff angrily and moved to a different row. I ended up sitting in his window seat and it made for a very awkward plane ride the rest of the flight. \n\nAm I in the wrong for taking someones seat, or do you think I'm justified in using the open seating policy and not allowing someone to claim a seat that they never sat in? \n\nTL:DR Southwest has open seating policy, you can't claim seats. I move someone's backpack and take their seat. Flight attendent threatens to kick me of the plane. ",

      "description": "My parents have announced to my sister and I they are selling the family house to go into early retirement. It's something I'm a bit upset about, my sister kind of is but won't directly say it as she's worried she'll appear ungrateful. I haven't said anything to my parents about being upset and probably won't as I doubt I'll be able to change their mind and don't want to ruin our relationship.\n\nFor ages, I'm 30, my sister is 26 and my parents are 60.\n\nSome background as to why I'm upset. My parents are reasonably well off, solid middle class, not upper or lower. They bought their house when they were a couple of years younger than me and got significant support from my grandparents on my mom's side to do it. They didn't really need that support and used the money they saved to do a bunch of traveling around the world. My Grandparent's told me if I went through university (which I did) they would do the same for me and help my buy a house, my mom knew about this and mentioned it as an incentive to do uni. My cousins were also told the same thing. \n\nUnfortunately my grandparents passed away while I was studying and my mom and her sister got all the inheritence, my grandparents didn't leave a will. My Aunt used that to support my cousins in buying their houses, my parents used it to renovate their house. When I asked whether I would get the same support as my cousins my mom shut it down and said it was her inheritance and she could choose what she wants to do with it.\n\nMy parents didn't support myself or my sister in purchasing a house at all, and unfortunately house prices in my country have exploded so my current house is significantly worse than what my parents bought 35 years ago at 20x the price, same for my sister. \n\nOur family home was in a town that become a resort town so property prices boomed, both my sister and I had to move away. We were hoping one day we would inherit the house like my parents inherited their grandparents and use it as a family holiday house that my sister and I could take our children to.\n\nInstead my parents are selling so they can move into one of those pricey retirement resorts, they'll likely burn through their money and leave nothing to my sister and I. Having researched the place it's even likely that once they run out of money they'll be evicted and my sister and I will have to pay for an actual retirement home in their old age.\n\nI guess I'm upset because they aren't giving my sister and I the same advantages they got from their parents, it feels like they are taking for granted what they got and think we don't need it.\n\nTLDR; Parents are selling their house to retire early to a fancy retirement resort, got a load of money from their parents/my grandparents that got them to this in the first place and aren't passing anything along to my sister and I.",

      "description": "A year ago a family (parents and 8-12 yo. Ish children) moved in above me. They have been making loud noise for the whole year. At 8am and 4pm about 3-4x a week, it sounds like they are running loudly, jumping up and down, and dropping heavy objects. It is audible in every room of my apartment, including when I wear headphones. \n\nRelevant background, I live in a city with very expensive housing, and I live in one of the most expensive apartment complexes here. There is also a middle/high school nearby. I have written them about 3 letters in the past asking them politely to stop making noise/ask their children to stop making noise as per our strict noise code. I have talked to them in person once about the noise. \n\nRight now, they are thumping around again and I am very close to just making a formal complaint, which I have been avoiding because it will pretty much instantly get them evicted (because I have a lot of evidence in terms of their noise, efforts I’ve made to talk to them civilly, etc). I feel that I’ve given them enough warning and leeway, and that at this point if the parents can’t control the kids they shouldn’t be living in a top floor apartment. I’m also just annoyed because I pay a fortune to live here, and now can’t really work at home. I think they can just get a basement suite somewhere if they’re going to be so loud. \n\nHowever, my roommate is saying I am a huge asshole and very lacking in empathy because she feels that I am kicking out a family in a terrible housing market, and the kids probably attend the school next to my complex. She says at the end of the day they are young kids. She thinks that we should just keep reminding them to be quiet, since that does make the noise stop for a week or so. She also is home a fair bit, so I can’t just say she doesn’t experience the noise and this doesn’t care. \n\nSince I can see where she is coming from, it got me thinking whether she is right and I need to be more patient, or whether I’ve been lenient enough already. \n\nReddit, please tell me whether I am the asshole. Thanks! ",

      "description": "So I talk to my friends a lot on discord, and one day they invited me to play on a Minecraft server with them and a few other people I never met before. As we were talking and introducing ourselves, one of them said\n “oh yeah I’m from Chili” to which I responded\n“Can I have some?”. Right afterwards my friends told me that it wasn’t cool and what I said was mean and making fun of her country. I argued that it was a play on words and not meant seriously, but more I was just playing dumb. The original person in question didn’t mind and we just kept playing. I was never sure if what I said was rude, so that’s why I’ve brought it to Reddit. \n",

      "description": "*names have been changed\n\nI recently left my job at a company I had been at for a number of years but stayed very close with my team. Last week my former boss, Susan, asked me to have lunch with her. We spent time chatting about different things, my new role, office drama pretty normal stuff. Then at the very end of the lunch she says to me “Did you know Rachel is getting married?”. I told her no, that I did not know &amp; she proceeded to tell me that she was getting married to a girl &amp; asks again if I knew she was a lesbian? Again, I told her no (I had suspected but never gave it much thought bc it’s not my business). Now, for context the reason I think she asked me was bc Rachel &amp; I were extremely close &amp; are still friends. To define close, we worked together frequently on projects &amp; interacted daily from both a work &amp; personal perspective. We would chat daily &amp; spend our lunch breaks walking around the city for at least an hour 3 or 4 times a week if not every day. During these walks we talked about everything both work &amp; our personal lives. I’d met her one sister multiple times &amp; knew her whole family by name.  She knew everything about my personal life &amp; so on. Anyway, I would talk to her about my love life but she never mentioned hers much &amp; I never asked because anytime other people with bring it up she would just brush it off. No problem, it’s really not my place to ask anyway. Flash forward back to lunch with Susan, I was pretty surprised to hear this news, again, an engagement, wedding planning would be something I guessed we would have talked about. (When her sister got married I knew every detail!) Selfishly, of course I was a bit upset to hear since I would have LOVED to share in her joy, congratulate her &amp; celebrate with her. Susan proceeds to tell me that that Rachel’s boss had “figured it out” by seeing a comment on her Instagram referencing a wedding. Well a quick google search of her name &amp; the wedding website comes right up. So now, Susan &amp; her “crew” including Rachel’s boss &amp; others who Rachel absolutely despises know about her sexual orientation without her reviling that information.  The company is extremely progressive &amp; none of these people have any issues with her being gay but it’s obviously been her choice over the 6 years working there not to share that information. Now, I feel terrible knowing people who she dislikes so greatly all know &amp; are talking about her without her knowledge. It’s terrible &amp; she’s my friend, I just know that one of these days someone is going to say something to her &amp; I think she will be really upset &amp; caught off guard. Should I let her know? Would she become angry with ME? I respect her &amp; her decision not to share this information but now that its “out” I wonder if she would just be better deciding how she wants to handle it on her own terms.\n\nTLDR: Coworker is gay, her boss &amp; others found out via Instagram &amp; now are all talking about it. Should I give her a heads up? ",

I went thru a very awful time in my life about three years ago and turned to drugs ,unfortunately. My best friend never turned his back on me and helped me tremendously during that time in my life. I have been sober for years now... My friend has had a drinking problem the entire duration of this friendship but within the past year its become increasingly bad. \nFor about six months now its been a cycle of me offering to take him to meetings... Offering to find him beds at detox etc... He will not take the help although his life is literally in shambles. Every conversation we have had in the past 6-8 months has revolved around his drinking and how absolutely miserable he is. \nOur last conversation i told him i couldnt continue to stand by as he drinks his life away. I said i thought the reason hes continued to drink was because he hasnt really had any consequences and was not going to talk to him until he got help.\nI do feel like an ass because he was always there for me but i can't help him if he doesn't want to help himself...

      "description": "Here’s a little bit of a back story. It’s a little on the long side so I’ll put a TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nMy girlfriend of three months and I have been extremely close friends for about a year now. Up until we started dating, we would hang out almost every day, as we both have odd schedules, but they worked well together. \n\nWe both still live at home, and as a result, I had met her parents long before we started dating. The problem is, we would always spend time at her house, but never at mine. \n\nBecause she was one of my best friends, I often vented to her about my verbally abusive step mother who finds any reason she can to start screaming and fighting about anything. My dad isn’t much better as he is the only person she will listen to, and he won’t stand up for me because then she starts yelling at him. \n\nThis is the main reason we don’t spend time at my house unless we have the house to ourselves. My girlfriend was predisposed to not liking my parents because she knows my past history with them, and how they treat me, so she doesn’t even want to meet them because she is very protective and has told me that she won’t tolerate the way my step mom treats me. \n\nSince I’ve been dating her for some time, my prents keep pressuring me to have her come over for dinner so they can meet her. I have been giving them excuses, some legitimate, some not so much about why she can’t come over, because she doesn’t want to meet them, and I really don’t want her to either because I know that it’ll put my girlfriend in an uncomfortable situation. \n\nTL;DR: Am I the asshole for giving my abusive parents excuses as to why my girlfriend can’t come meet them, even though neither her nor I want her to meet them?

Today on the chorus concert when I try to listen to my playlist, messages from my brother's parents keep pouring in about them complaining how their sons don't want to go to a school semi and called them lame and antisocial and discussed forcing them to go. I was shocked and screenshotted them, showed them to my friends, and sent them to my mom and myself. She said I had no business going through her phone and said that parents could make their kids do whatever, and I said they shouldn't make fun of their kids like that and forcing them to a social event will only make the kids dislike the parents. Plus, they can be stressful: after last year's semi, one of my friends was diagnosed with Anorexia because she thought she looked fat in her dress and ended up being hospitalized.

TLDR at the bottom. \n\n\nThe company I work for is contracted by a rather large company (site) in my area, but also does contract work for other sites. I work only at this specific site, while Harry, to my knowledge, works multiple sites. At the site I work at, contract employees work both in small offices as well as in company vehicles. All employees work in shifts and relieve each other.\n\n\nOne day last week, I arrive and speak with my coworker Robert and ask if there's any information that needs to be passed on to my shift. He passes on some information to me, as well as mentions that Harry (who had just finished a shift in the vehicle I was about to begin a shift in) had complained to Robert about a bedbug problem he was dealing with, and had bites clearly visible on him. Bed bugs are notoriously difficult and expensive to deal with, and not something I'd be comfortable risking exposure to. I called my site manager and explained to them that I wasn't exactly comfortable getting into the vehicle and risking bringing home bedbugs to my family. My site manager thanked me for bringing the issue to his attention and advised me to stay put for the time being. A different vehicle was brought, and an exterminator was called, who treated each vehicle, each office, and my uniform. I was very pleasantly surprised with how well and how quickly my site dealt with the issue.\n\n\nSince that day, though, Harry has not been back to work at this site, and is not on the schedule for the foreseeable future. My site manager yesterday took me aside and thanked me again for bringing the issue to light, when he confirmed that he \"doubts Harry will be back, but can't say much more\". I haven't heard from Harry, nor have I heard anything else from management about the situation, but there have been plenty of rumors. (Rumors like he was suspended only until he could prove that his bedbug problem was dealt with, rumors that my site was forcing him to cover the costs of the exterminator, rumors that he quit afyer an argument with a site manager, etc.) but neither I nor anyone I work with is able to confirm any of these rumors. \n\n\nTL;DR\nReported a coworkers problem with bedbugs to magagment and said coworker presubamly lost his job. AITA?",

We've got a fairly active sex life, except for one thing. He rarely gives head. Keep in mind I give him head almost everytime we're in bed. Meanwhile I haven't had him go down on me since around Thanksgiving last year. I've asked him about it and he usually just says there's too much hair (even if I just shaved) or he gets too tired after I finish him off. Sometimes it kinda hurts and I feel really self-conscious about it when I really think into it. \n\nOther than that everything between us is great and this obviously isn't something worth breaking up over, and I love him more than anything and the sex isn't a huge deal breaker. I just wanna make sure I'm not overreacting or anything about this. ",

We have been able to navigate a lot of the common issues that arise when two people start living together for the first time (cleanliness, cooking, bills, etc).However, we seem to have hit a roadblock when it comes to leaving candles burning when we both leave the house for work. She is very spiritual at times and believes that it helps to cleanse the aura of the house. It’s not that I’m against this kind of thinking at all, in fact I really enjoy being with someone who has her mindfulness. It’s just that my anxiety levels immediately go through the roof when I start thinking about all the bad things that could happen if one of these candles flicks off an errant flame into the curtains and we ultimately end up not having a roof. So I’ve taken to blowing out her candle(s) when I leave(she leaves before me) and then saying they must’ve accidentally blown out whenever she asks about it later on in the day. ",

      "title": "AITA for not letting my housemate break her lease?",
      "description": "I live in a house with five other people. We all pay rent to a landlord, so none of us actually own the house—we just rent it. The last housemate to join was “Beth,” who signed a one year lease with us late last year. Before Beth moved in, we were desperate for a renter and since Beth and I work in the same office along with another one of our housemates, we thought it was a good idea. We don’t hang out often or anything but we talk at work and joke around—normal coworker stuff. Anyway, Beth signed a year-long lease that stated no subleases were allowed. A couple months ago, Beth told me that she was actively looking for jobs back in her hometown. The place we work doesn’t pay us much so she’s looking to move back home and save up some money at a better job. When she told me this, I just said it sucks but she signed a lease. She said that one of our other coworkers, “Anne,” was interested in taking over her lease but I was against it. Anne later talked to me and it didn’t sound like a bad idea so I told her it sounded good. However, Anne has already found a place by now and she won’t be the one taking over Beth’s lease. I think Beth also told one of our other housemates, “Rick.” Rick didn’t mention the lease when Beth told him and he just sounded like he was okay with it. Maybe important to note but Rick is our point of contact with the landlord.\n\nBeth ended up landing a job in her hometown. She was excited and told me the news last week. I was confused because like I said last time, she had signed a one-year lease with us and no subleases were allowed. I just told her, “Sucks. You signed a lease.” Might’ve been harsh of me to say that, but it was the truth. She was trying to justify and talk about how she was giving a month notice and was planning on paying rent next month even when she wasn’t gonna live here. She also pointed out that the last person who lived in her room didn’t give us a one month notice and just left but that’s different, so I wasn’t having it. She signed a lease. So all I said to her responses were, “sucks, you signed a lease.” I could tell she was about to cry so she just left and that was that.\n\nLater, I received a text from Rick, who told me that Beth had told him the news about her job. Rick basically told her the same thing and that she had signed a lease.\n\nAITA for not letting her out of the lease even if she’s guaranteeing that she’ll find a sublease? Rick told her that subleasing the room wouldn’t make the landlord feel comfortable because that would be inviting someone new into the house. Beth argued that the landlord hasn’t even met her, so she’s still a stranger to him too. I know she doesn’t like living with us because of our rules (minimal guests over, no loud noises even on the weekends, etc.), but she signed a lease. The other housemates don’t care what she does but Rick and I do because it was part of the agreement.",

      "description": "I've been kinda seeing this girl lately, I'm 27M and she's 21F, and for the most part things have been going fine, although there is still a little bit of immaturity on her side.  Anyways, I was driving her back to her house and cutting through some back roads and we see some people walking up the street.  I live in the Northeast and it's very cold outside right now.  She sees them and gets this huge smile on her face and tells me to \"watch this.\"  She starts rolling her window down and starts opening up her water bottle.  At this point I'm pretty sure she's going to douse them with water in frigid temperatures.  I tell her not to do it, but as we drive by them she flings the water out of her water bottle all over them and laughs and gives me the biggest shit eating grin.\n\nI was fucking pissed, because I'm pretty sure what she just did could be considered assault and if they got my liscense plate I could be liable.  So I pulled over about 100 yards past her victims (they could still see us) and told her to get the fuck out of my car.  She looked at me shocked like she did nothing wrong and refused.  I reached across and opened the car door, and then unbuckled her seatbelt and told her to get the fuck out of my car again.  Again she wouldn't and told me to just drive her home.  So I pushed her out of the car, drove forward a little bit so she couldn't scramble back in, and tossed her purse out a little further up.  And then I drove off and left her on the side of the road.\n\nObviously she blew up my phone calling me an asshole, and its needless to say that whatever this relationship was it's over at this point.  I dont think I was out of line, but she did only have a sweatshirt which is not the best in freezing weather.  She claimed she had to run away because the people she flung water at started coming at her.  And I know she's broke ass, so it's not like she could call an Uber or Lyft, she would have had to get a friend or family give her a ride if she could find someone (she had her phone), otherwise it was probably a 6-7 mile walk home.\n\nI dont feel bad for kicking her out of my car, what has me doubting myself is the conditions I left her in (potentially violent situation, no heavy winter clothing, and broke).

      "description": "My neighbor and I share a backyard since we both rent half of a duplex. She installed a doggy door and her two dogs have full access to the backyard 24/7. My dog is only out under supervision and all poop is picked up as soon as she’s done. My neighbor does not pick up after her dogs and currently has about 20+ piles of dog poop all over the backyard. NOT an over exaggeration. \n\nThis is the letter my boyfriend and I wrote to her. We included a peanut putter bar pastry as a peace offer buffer. \n\nWe are only writing this letter due to everyone’s work schedule being so different from one another and I hate to be “that neighbor” but could you please be mindful and pick up after your dogs in the backyard? Since we got Eevee, we have been using the backyard on a daily basis. There have been multiple incidents where we, including Eevee, have stepped in your dog’s poop and it has been tracked inside and onto our carpet. We are happy to share the backyard, as Eevee enjoys running around, however, since your dogs have free access to the backyard, it is difficult to catch where they have gone so if you could please keep up with your pups so this does not continue to happen that would be greatly appreciated. If supervising them when they go out is not an option for you, I hope you will consider sectioning off an area for them to go while they are unsupervised so they can still do their business with causing further issue.\nThank you in advance.\n\nKind regards.\n\nAnyways, I’m here because my anxiety is acting up. I don’t want to start problems but I’m also very fed up with stepping in dog poop and bringing it inside the house when I’m in a hurry to get to work. We left the note out yesterday so we haven’t heard from her. Yet. ",

      "description": "As a preface, I’m not sure if this would even qualify, since I’m pretty sure I already am an asshole. I’m looking for an objective set of eyes on the situation. Also, sorry for the formatting, I’m on mobile. \n\nWe’ll refer to this person as Sam to keep genders/identities as hidden as possible. \n\nSo, I’ve had a problem with Sam, but I can’t remove him/her from my life because he/she is my SO’s cousin, and they’ve been close since birth. \n\nThe story begins here: when my SO and I began our relationship, Sam was jealous that SO was in a relationship and he/she wasn’t, so he/she badmouthed me to my SO all of the time. Sam turned out to be so effective at turning my SO against me that we ended up breaking up for about a year. \n\nThen, during junior year prom (I’m a whiny teen, as it turns out), Sam was again jealous because the person that he/she wanted to go with went with someone else, and was in a general bad mood. My SO and I were talking again, and as I tried to make my way over to SO to dance, Sam got in my way over and over so I couldn’t. Then, another person went and danced with my SO. I was upset the rest of the night. \n\nHowever, since then, I’ve reconnected with my SO and we have been dating for a while, and Sam has found him/herself a SO. Thus, I’ve had to spend most of this year of school around Sam+SO. \n\nThis exposure has lead to nothing but constant roast sessions between myself and Sam; Sam will call me scrawny while I will rip on Sam for the stupid things that he/she says. \n\nThis all culminates in the study session in the library today. Sam had been laughing at me for something that he/she wouldn’t even tell me about, and I was quite annoyed about it. So, my asshole move reared its head. I took a book about fitness off of the shelf and told Sam that he/she should read through it. Keep in mind, Sam certainly isn’t a fat or anything like that, Sam is just slightly on the larger side. Major dick move, I get it. \n\nThen, as I was trying to fall asleep Sam’s SO decides to text me, demonstrating how upset he/she is, lambasting my morals, threatening to kick my ass, and demanding an apology. \n\nI apologized for what I said, but the entire conversation was tinged by the impression that Sam’s SO believes that he/she did nothing wrong and I was the criminal, which I couldn’t take. I believe that if Sam would insult me about my body (being scrawny), Sam should be able to take an insult about his/hers. \n\n\nI get it, Sam is probably self-conscious about his/her body, but I just can’t understand how someone could think that my insult was completely unprompted and “over the line”. Sam has no right at all to assume that it’s okay to make fun of my scrawniness, and shouldn’t be surprised when he/she gets a taste of his/her own medicine. \n\nSo the question is, am I the only asshole in this situation, are we both, or are we just a bunch of whiny teenagers still trying to figure out life?",

      "description": "So I run a small business. My info is on Google. I have 31 ratings all 5 star. So some would say I'm kinda good at what I do. I have a business phone which is a cheap cell phone that forwards calls to my nice cell phone and it's always hooked up to its charger behind my desk. Mostly telemarketers will text me. But on occasion a real customer will text me looking for a quote. I always ignore these because if you want to hire me at least have the decency of calling a bid request in. I check my phone and the same number has sent me 3 text wanting a bid. So I finally give up and I pick up the phone and reply \"Call us to set up an appointment\". It's a cheap flip phone so text are hard to do. So they reply \"let's do it now, here is the adress (*********) this is what I want. Thanks for the communication and I will meet you if it's called for\". At this point it's already past my regular business hours listed on all websites I'm on. Instead of leaving this person hanging. I reply \"Sorry we only set up appointments over the phone. If you like to you can call us between 8-5:30 to set up an appointment. This person replies \"Perfect, so the customer is always wrong\".\n\n\nWtf? I just like making sure I meet an actual person on-site and talking to someone over the phone. It gives me a good idea of who I'm working with. ",

      "description": "I've been married for 8 years and my husband has always smoked pot. I'm talking about a lot of it. I don't have an issue with pot in general, but He spends hundreds of dollars a month on it. We now have two young kids and he smokes it in front of them. Besides being expensive, the whole thing makes me nervous as it's not legal in our state. Previously, he had told me if I didn't smoke, he'd leave me. For whatever reason, recently I quit caring about that and told him I was going to quit and he threw a temper tantrum. After much thought, it dawned on me that the pot is the cause of a lot of our problems. At least in my mind. And now I want him to quit. His only compromise is to suggest that he ONLY spends $100 a week, which I still think is way too much. AITA for thinking he should quit for me and our kids?",

I reminded her almost every single day that she should call the office and get it fixed, but she just kept putting in off. This morning was the last day the office is open before classes start, and I told her to call in the morning. Fast forward to tonight, and it turns out she didn’t call and now is freaking out cause she has not all her credits complete and might not graduate on time. She has to wait until Tuesday and try to fix this mess. I told her that she should’ve called this morning like I said, but then she got mad and told me I’m an asshole for telling her to be more proactive and I’m making her feel bad. I’m simply trying to help and get her to get her stuff together. \n\nAITA here? ",

      "description": "Some Background: I'm in a discord(for those that don't know, discord is a communication and socializing tool for pc gamers) that utilizes a server currency system.  Let's call them coins.  You get coins for being active in voice chat.  For every hour you are in voice chat you get coins.  You also get coins for participating in events, like karaoke night. The server IT guys have created their own bot to gamble these coins with coin flips and virtual slots, etc.  But the main issue stems from the prizes you can purchase with these 'coins.'  More on the simple side, you can buy private voice channels and your own colored name in the discord, or even your own shareable role.  You can give and share these coins to others, which is where the main issue that we are having lies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm trying to buy the most sought after prize: League of legends gift cards.  For a VERY large amount of coins, you can buy $10 and $25 gift cards for League of Legends.  The massive 'coin' costs of these gift cards pretty much exclude all but the people who are on this discord server except for moderators and the users who are on every day.   Which makes sense, they are spending their money on a discord server that they have 0 income from(apart from donations.)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, my friend and I pooled our money together over several weeks of being active in the server, to buy one of these gift cards, he gifted me all of his coins and I have enough to buy this gift card at last.  However, the admins of the server told us that while we can share coins to buy other things from the coin shop, you cannot share coins to buy the gift cards.  I got very upset and told them that this is not fair, and that we worked hard on getting these coins and it's only fair to let us buy it by combining our efforts.  Either way, it ends up being the same x amount of server activity that equals a gift card.\n\nAITA for being upset about this?",

      "description": "I (f18) started living with my best friend (f18) in September. I wasn't looking for a place at the time (was living with my parents) but my best friends older sister was looking for tenants, since she had moved in with her boyfriend and did not want to sell her house. We thought it would be a fun experience and because I'm currently working full time during my gap year I could afford it. Neither of us signed a contract and we gave her the rent money in cash each months, so there's really no record of me living there. We also did not make an agreement on when we were going to move out, but thought it would probably be during Summer, before I would go back to school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast month I decided I wanted to move back in with my parents. Me and my friend got along fine while living together, but we weren't really having as much fun as we anticipated. I was feeling really insecure about my gap year because I'm working really hard at a job I don't even like, and a lot of that money was paying off my rent while I could be saving up for next year. I missed my parents too. So I told my friend. We talked for about 2 hours and I cried, telling her I just didn't know what to do. She told me she would support no matter what I decide. We agreed to try and live together for a little longer. But the next day I did not feel any different. So I texted her sister, explaining the situation and saying I wanted to move out in March. She pretty much told me no immediately. I texted her back saying this is my decision and I'm willing to pay rent for two more months. Then her texts didnt stop. She texted me from 10am to 6pm. Saying I betrayed their family, that I cant treat people like this. Finally she stopped and her last message was 'You have to pay rent until April, it's only fair because you would live her until July and that way we both pay half'. She says I promised her I would stay till July. What actually happened was: my friend said one week before that she was leaving in July and they asked me if I would be okay with leaving in July too. I said 'I think that would be a good idea cause school starts in September.' Thats all I said. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I was pretty upset about all that. When I got home from work that night, my friend had left a written letter telling me she felt like she needed to choose between me and her sister, and that she did not want to do that. Therefore she was staying with her parents for a little while. It made me so sad that she didnt talk to me first. That night I packed my stuff and left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still willing to pay rent until March, which seems generous to me since we have no contract whatsoever and I don't even live there anymore. My friend texted me about a week later, saying she was angry and sad and did not understand me.  We talked and said we would agree to disagree but we havent spoken since. I really miss her and Im starting to doubt myself. Was I wrong for leaving? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I (23f) have a long history with athletic injuries from high school.\n\nThe problem starts with us sitting in bed after a long morning of running errands. After we had already gotten settled, I started a movie and she asks if I can get her wheelchair for her which is downstairs and across the house. I apologise and tell her that the morning out made my body extremely tired and don't think I can get the 50lb chair up a flight of stairs. She then tells me \"no it's ok, I'll be fine\"\n\nI instantly feel bad and ask her if it's ok if I return to my movie and to please answer honestly and she says that yes, I would be mad.\n\nI tried to explain things again and she asks if I will get our younger brother to help. At this point she's crying and I feel like a complete asshole, but I'm also in a lot of pain and genuinely don't think I can help. \n\nStill feeling bad, I tell her that I can't make the trip downstairs to ask him, that it's the stairs that are the problem. She tells me that I'm obviously not sorry and gets out of bed slowly. At first I wasn't sure what she was going to do, then I realise that she intends to bum-scoot downstairs to get the chair herself.\n\nAfter she gets maybe 3 meters away I get out if bed and head for the bedroom door. She insists that she can do it, but I do it anyway.\n\nI couldn't get my brother's help because he and everyone else were out and it hurt a lot getting that chair upstairs.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\nTL;DR my girlfriend has a chronic illness, I have old sports injuries and refused to get her wheelchair for her, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Let me start this by saying, I am not a grammar nazi. I'm a writer and editor, so I know the ins and outs, but I don't correct other people in conversation (\"I did good on a test!\"), or really ever, unless asked. \n\nThat said, my work is planning an event right now that we do every year, and one of my coworkers got an email from a music licensing company about getting rights to music for our show. She thought this was a little strange, and forwarded me the email to take a look. It was peppered with spelling errors--including the spelling of our company name--and was addressed to someone who doesn't even work here and hasn't for years. This is in addition to random commas and punctuation in some strange places. \n\nI regularly peruse r/scams and this poorly-written email and \"contract\" set off a few warning bells for me. I call the licensing company (Googled, not the number from the email) to ask them if the email was legitimate. The customer service person was perfectly polite and let me know that yes, they do occasionally reach out to encourage events and organizations to license their music instead of (illegally) using it without asking. \n\nI hesitated, but after I thanked her I told her that they should let their people know to edit emails before sending them, because the reason I was suspicious of the email I got was because of all the errors. Her tone immediately changed. What she said was, \"Right. Thanks, we'll look into it,\" but it sounded a lot more like, \"Thanks for the tip, bitch.\" \n\nSometimes I'm bad at interacting with other people. AITA, here?",

More of less, she has a lot of weight entirely on her stomach. She wore lots of large baggy sweaters and loose flannels and with the rest of her body being oddly slim, she looked like a slim girl with a slight bust.\n\nI was infatuated, and we found ourselves really connecting. Personality wise she almost couldn't be a better match.\n\n...Then I got a few images that were in something a little more tight fitting and suddenly had to reconsider. And I feel awful about it, because suddenly I just can't get as enthusiastic to talk to her romantically and despite how lonely I am the specific way her body carries her weight just has me very not attracted. Basically, she just carries all her weight on her stomach, and she's kind of flat chested. Her torso is just kind of... round. It's unfortunate. We were long distance, so i'd have no way of knowing if this body type would make me feel so turned off in person.\n\nI feel really guilty, because I know this one flaw is the only thing that made me go from complete infatuation to now wanting to just distance myself from things. But also i'm frustrated because her personality really did click in a way few do.\n\nAm I an asshole for letting something so physical, and so singular, kind of ruin the appeal of this girl for me?",

      "description": "So some background info, I live in a student home consisting of about 5 people. Last year I bought a game console with the primary intention of using it myself. Naturally being in a shared housing the other guys want to use it too. They play shared screen games while I pretty much play only singleplayer games but I had no problem sharing since we're all friends and they pay for any extra controllers. One month the electricity bill came in and it was noticeably higher than normal, the other guys starts to point fingers at me because I play singleplayer games for long intervals (i.e how they're meant to be played). They all collectively agreed that I should pay the difference in the electricity bill compared to last month, so $25. I thought it was bullshit that they automatically pinned the blame on me playing using the console and disregarded any other possibility (i.e leaving the dryer on for too long).   \n\n\nAlso I thought there's no way a full-time student is going to have enough time to use it enough for the $25 increase in the bill. So I dug out manufacturer instructions/specifications and did the math, even applying worst conditions (peak hours, maximum brightness, etc) the total comes to about $10 a month (again, under worst conditions) which I would gladly pay. I brought this up to them later and they pretty much ignored it, but oh lucky me they agreed to split it evenly as a \"courtesy\". This made me mad because apparently I'm still the bad guy that don't care about other people he's sharing a house with despite going out of my way to come up with a better solution.  \n\n\nFast forward a few months and the tension kinda alleviated a bit on the matter. I brought this up again and apparently the new \"solution\" is pay $2 to use (despite me being the owner of the console) which I find is exorbitant. To make matters worse? The other guys get to use it without paying because they're \"sharing\" between 4 people. I thought it was ridiculous that I'm the only one who has to pay to use the console that I bought with my own pocket money and they don't. So I tell them that I won't pay for using the console if that's the solution they're sticking with. AITA?",

      "description": "WIBTA? \nBackground: So I have a bit of a messy mental state around sex. I have a history of just giving partners whatever they want sexually so they won't be sad and some of them have definitely taken advantage of that fact. But I'm working on it and I need an outside perspective on this one. \n\nAnyway I have been trying to explain to my current boyfriend that when he's upset and wants sex (to feel better about something unrelated, he isn't upset he's not getting sex) it makes me feel a lot of pressure to do it. We've talked about how it makes me worried that I shouldn't say no and that I'd like him to masturbate if he thinks he needs sexual release when I'm feeling depressed.\n\nWell tonight he refused to masturbate. He refused to talk out the issues he was having, I really tried to help but he was having an anxiety filled day so wouldn't listen. I said we could have sex, we did, I just lay there but he just wanted to get off and I am fine with that sometimes. But after I just felt upset. He rolled off me and said he felt guilty because it felt like he 'used me' and I just didn't want to deny it. I said 'I mean you did, what does it matter anyway'. Then he said 'I can't believe you're doing this to me' and we had a fight about it, I got angry he cried and I just felt pressured to say sorry (I haven't yet). \n\n I don't care that I wasn't into the sex. I only care that I felt pressured again to make him feel better through sex. He didn't stamp his feet at me, but he was freaking out and not talking to me and I know sex fixes it. He knows that messes with my head but I don't think it's on purpose? When he does that I panic... But now I'm wondering is this just my problem?

      "description": "For some background, I absolutely despise my ex, and that is not an understatement in any way, shape, or form. Our relationship culminated in us both hitting rock bottom mentally, and despite my best efforts and it being nearly 2 years since we broke up, I still haven't found a way to move on from everything that transpired. I've mentioned her in previous Reddit posts as well. \n\nNow to the main point of contention. About say... October/November last year, my ex won a manager's position at a somewhat well known store franchise in our small town. This store was known for having pretty shady managers in the past (the one before my ex literally just up and left town without telling anyone).\n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago and I find out the franchise has gone into voluntary administration. Essentially, the company is bankrupt and they're now in the process of shutting down all their stores, effectively putting everyone working at those stores out of a job (fellow Australian dwellers may remember this happening to Dick Smith a few years ago).\n\nAnyway, so the second I found this out, I tell everyone in our friends group chat and remark that I think it's hilarious my ex is going to lose her job. Turns out, one of my friends in that chat had recently applied and won a casual job there just before the franchise announced it was shutting down. The second he said that, I quickly apologised, then messaged him privately to impress I had no idea about him applying. He said it was fine.\n\nLater that night, he'd gotten a bit drunk and the topic got brought up again. He told me it was pathetic that I could laugh about a situation where thousands of people have lost their jobs. I strongly disagree with this as I don't think the situation as a whole is funny. It's terrible that a company has had to screw this many people over for whatever reason caused them to shut. But for my ex, this particular person who I feel nothing but contempt for, all I could do is laugh.\n\nI don't believe this has affected my relationship with this friend in any significant way, but I am nonetheless curious to see what other people think about it.

We were on section together today and she arrived 20 mins later than me (yet on time) I had already got several jobs going( 2 soups for 150 covers each chicken and mushroom pie for 200 mash in the steamer for 200 etc etc) when she arrived on section I briefed her of where we were at and she was happy stating \"nice ! Easy day then\" which is fine by me.. what wasnt fine is she then proceeded to make herself a sandwich and a coffee and continue to walk around chatting and eating  for 30 mins. I called her over and said \"I know it's an easy day but we've still got stuff to do\" which pulled her back into work mode.. there was 2 items left to start working a vegan cannoli  180 covers ( which the mix had been made the previous day for) and some hotdogs in buns for 100. It took her 3 hours to get these ready and it was literally about 30 mins work. \n\nWhen service came around I helped her set up backing up everything and then it was my job to move onto prep for the next day whilst she handled the servery passing food across to the waiter station, within 15 minutes she was asking me to bring her this and that then found herself in a flumox, I assisted in getting her back on track then went back to my prep... another 10 mins passed and she slipped back again so I assisted once more. This time she just stopped working the service and stood there writing labels  . Then came over to me and told me I didn't prepare enough pie and we were going to run out ( which we didn't) . I became annoyed and said to her quite firmly and loudly so that the others heard that she wasnt performing and I've carried her service and she has the gall to try and tell me I'm not doing my job. I then said to the chef in charge \" if i'm doing her job and mine am I getting double the pay?\" . \n\n Later I saw her talking with the sous chef clearly upset. \n\nIt wasnt my intention to upset anyone nor is it my intention to carry someone's workload all day and It was very frustrating. Could I have gone about this another way? \n\nShould I apologise tomorrow or just leave it? \n\nAm I an asshole ?\n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway account cause I don't feel comfortabke posting this on my own account.\n\nI'm 110% sure that I'm gonna marry my boyfriend. We're extremely compatible and we both never felt so in love before. But the one thing we don't exactly click is the sex. I have quite a high sex drive. 6 times per week would be the good life but I understand that's not that realistic so I settle for 3 or 4 times a week. My boyfriend, on the other hand, is just fine having it twice or less a week.\n\nI always tease him and straight up say some dirty as* sh*t but usually I just get a laugh from him as he continues to scroll through his phone or just \"I just feel like hugging it right now\". I always stop and respect his decision, lately I've been saying some things jokingly about us not having sex often to see if he notices but he just ignores it.\n\nIt's now been 5 days since the last time we had sex. I was feeling pretty frustrated as I was getting my period soon – we have sex in my period but I don't like how messy it gets so I usually prefer doing it towards the end (should mention that I have 7-12 days long periods). So for the past five days I was trying to get him to do something multiple times on the day but he would just dismiss me.\n\nToday I got my period, and was feeling really really really frustrated, and told him that now we gotta wait for a week or so. He responded \"I don't mind having sex with you on your period, I actually like it\", so I took it as kind of a sign that he might want to do something later. Well, we got high, I tried again, he rejected me, I started complaining and all of the sudden he was crying.\n\nI don't exactly know what happened, as I said, I was and still kinda am high but I think I did something like stare at him and just turn my back on him, showing that I was upset. All I know is that he started being really offended by all that and his voice started shaking (I didn't look up at him to check for tears but I know he was crying a little), saying that it's not healthy to have sex so often (I said back that we were having sex for like 2 times a week but he ignored) and that chinese doctors say so. He said he didn't want to make that an excuse, and asked me to respect it and that sometimes he just doesn't feel like it, he just wants to cuddle.\n\nI felt really bad about it but as I am very prideful I just stopped talking and started scrolling through reddit (that's when I had the idea to post this here). I don't want to force him to do anything and I don't want him to feel bad or feel like I think sex is more important than other aspects of our relationship. But at the same time, sex is an important factor for me and I didn't think it was such a big deal for him.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "A little bit of backstory; My mother kicked me out at 14 &amp; I had to move in with my nan. I was a very troubled teen due to the ( sexual ) abuse I got from my stepdad, It was too the point that I wanted to be as many miles away as possible and I ended up leaving my nans at 16 and moved 40 mins away. At 19 I got pregnant and due to previous social service involvement, I had to disclose some information and a whole case was opened up.\n\nI endured over a year of a police investigation and my son was put on a protection plan before I even knew the gender (Thankfully I worked my ass off and got him off and now me, my partner and son live a very loving life)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER; The whole way through my pregnancy, investigation, social workers etc my Mother would make sly comments, Accuse me of being a liar and an attention seeker etc, The few that stand out the most are -\n\n\\- \"I don't see why -Partners name- mum gets to see the baby once he's born first they're not your family\" We live with my partners family! and they have done nothing but support me and given me so much love.\n\n\\- \"It doesn't matter you're an adult now I don't have to worry about what you say happened\" This reduced me to tears.\n\n\\- And when I asked her if she would get back with my stepdad since the charges were dropped she replied with \"maybe\" I then found out a week later that she was already back with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to this, she has only seen my son 3 or 4 times and Only held him a couple times. I don't want to see her and I am just civil due to not wanting drama.\n\nMy partner popped the question on our 2 year anniversary and we get married in July, Sorting the invites for his family was so easy!!! I want everyone there to celebrate and I can't wait to join their family. However, whenever I think of inviting anyone in my family my heart drops and I just get a headache ! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my family what happened with my stepdad but they either believe me and don't care or don't believe me and think I am a liar.\n\nThey tell me to drop it/get over it, They won't let me vent my anxiety and they tell me to just make up with my mother.\n\nThey're all mad I won't invite my mum to the wedding but I am dead set on not inviting her.\n\nI don't like dwelling on the past but I can't move past this, I've had years of therapy, counselling, psychology and I just can't cope with her, The more I try to get over it the More I resent her &amp; Now that I am a mother I see even more how much of an awful person she is.\n\nShe sends me money on special occasions which I just put into a savings account for my son and tell my family that I gave it to my in-laws.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have obviously invited close family members of mine like my nan, grandad and aunts but even just those make me stressed but they can be civil and I respect that and appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want a stress free day and I just can't stand the idea of my mother being there actually makes my skin crawl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what do you think, AITA for not wanting her there?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "\nI live in an apartment building a block away from a busy street. Our building is pet friendly or at least when we moved in two years ago it was. A few nights ago around 10pm my boyfriend found a friendly black cat in the parking lot who was meowing and it actually followed him in the building. Neither of us had ever seen this cat before, we thought it might have an owner but we figured it was lost, he had matts in his fur and he was meowing loudly and acting anxious once he was in the apartment.\n\nAfter about an hour and a half the cat continued to be loud any anxious so we realized we couldn't house him for the night, figuring our neighbour's would complain and we wouldn't get any sleep. We considered just putting him back out but we didn't want to feel guilty not knowing what happened to him. We found a 24 hour vet that would house him for the night before going to the local (no kill) shelter in the morning.\n\nI had some posters printed describing the cat and letting them know to call the shelter if they are the owners or know who the owners could be. I did this although I figured it was overkill since any concerned animal parent would naturally call local shelters. I put these poster up in my building and around the neighborhood.\n\nI was surprised to later see a response to my note by the poster I put up in the laundry room. Saying that the cat is theirs, he's an indoor/outdoor cat, they didn't see him for 1.5 days because he was taken to a shelter \"without [their] knowledge\" they cautioned others not to pick him up etc and then took a whole other page to talk about how he has always been very vocal and they have no way to deal with it because they don't want to \"snip his vocal chords. \"\n\nI understand them being worried not seeing their cat for a couple days, but it's late at night, the cat is meowing and trying to go inside. Plus we never saw this cat in the two years that we've lived there.\n\nI don't want to start a debate about appropriate pet care. I'm not a big fan of cats being indoor/outdoor in the city. I understand why people don't like to collar their cats. They can do what they like.\n\nBut should I have just left the cat be? We did suspect he had an owner in the area. I'm a little puzzled how these people are going to avoid situations like this in the future. And how they even manage an indoor/outdoor cat in an apartment. Is it better to just leave a loud animal at night to its own devices?\n\nWe know some of the other neighborhood cats, they aren't the only ones who have outdoor cats in the neighborhood.",

Friend 1 begins saying \"well what do you have to offer?\", to which Friend 2 begins repeating her question and calling Friend 1 an asshole. I chime in, calling the entire situation retarded, and that's that (keep this in mind, and also note Friend 2 uses the word \"retard\" much more offensively than I do). I admit, I personally thought that Friend 2 was beginning to get quite childish at this point, but I was simply joking with my \"retarded\" comment.\nSo later on, when I'm afk, Friend 1 sneaks over and gives me one of the items. Friend 1 mentions it, and Friend 2 instantly calls us both assholes and asks me for the item. I then say \"Well what do you have to offer?\", because I honestly have no use for the item and I'm curious as to what she even has in equal value. Friend 2 repeats her question with no response to my original response, and I say \"I deny your offer.\" \nFriend 2 instantly gets off the call and off the game, calling us cunts in the discord chat.\nI admit, Friend 1 was being a bit of a dick by the end of it, but Friend 2 imo was being very childish over the whole thing.\nAfter a bit, Friend 2 and I are talking via the chat. Friend 2 claims that BOTH Friend 1 and I were trolling and mocking her, that Friend 1 never said no to her, that she DID infact offer things for the item (nothing of which was of equal value from what she listed off), and finally, to top it all off, she claimed that I called HER retarded MULTIPLE TIMES. And that she asked me to stop multiple times.\nby the end she said \"you think i care about a video game NPC lol\"\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA? I sincerely want to know if I'm just overreacting or not.",

      "description": "I started my new job the beginning of January.  I was shown a lot rather quickly - how to certify things, receive goods in, write folders, make travelers, print drawings, get information off customer websites, and do shipment paperwork.\n\nLast week on Tuesday I was very overwhelmed.  I almost quit on the spot.  Supplies (ink and printer paper) were running low and person C told me to order supplies since “the torch has been passed to you”.  I didn’t know what to do and I also had a lot of assignments already so I didn’t have time to order anything.  I asked person C for help and she told me to check my email then went into HR to complain about me and the situation.  I overheard what she was saying.  I went into HR afterwards to explain that I’m overwhelmed and got nowhere - HR and person C are friends.  So I went to the people the hired me, the owners daughters.\n\nI told them I was very overwhelmed.  I also told them that person C weeks ago had said to me “that’s a good way to get fired” when I needed to leave and asked if person K could finish up the last 3 or 4 shipments for me.  I was told “you were never meant to do all the shipments.  We told C this and for some reason you’re still doing all of them”.  So... office meeting called.  End result?  Person C is now doing all the shipments and I’m doing the work the daughters give me with a shipment here and there if I have time.\n\nSince then person C and HR and not been nice to me.  If I talk to them they will respond.  And even then they’re not friendly.  With me doing the shipments C was able to help HR with their work so I guess I ruined their plan to swap work assignments.\n\nI haven’t eaten in the company kitchen since Monday of last week because it’s uncomfortable around those 2.  I’m not happy here anymore because I’m trying to be cordial and professional and they’re making things uncomfortable and petty.\n\nAm I The Asshole for talking to the owners daughters when I was overwhelmed which lead to their work assignments going back to them?  My goal wasn’t to get anyone in trouble, only reduce some of my stress.",

      "description": "I've been pining over this situation for about a month now. I've made a decision, but wanted outside input before I do anything rash.\n\n My friend, let's call him Matt, of 6 years is transitioning from female to male. His testosterone shots have been making him more and more belligerent and explosive. \n\nSo, on February 8th, my lady and I were invited to a mutual friend's apartment, that Matt happened to be at, to hang out and drink a bit. The only reasons that we went was because Matt was there and cats. Then, flash forward to a couple days later, and he sends me a series of angry messages accusing me of trying to hold a \"passive aggressive intervention.\" Along with many other false accusations. He tried to claim that my better half had a thing for him and also claimed that they had never been friends, and I was the only reason they dealt with each other. After talking to him for a bit via text, it became clear that this was a case of misplaced anger. Matt said he didn't like the mutual friend (which is completely fair. Frankly, I hate him too.) \n\nNow, by this point, I was absolutely livid. But he said that he wanted to apologize, so I went around to our group of friends to explain the situation and see what they think. Only to find out that Matt had blown up on everyone in our group over the most trivial, meaningless issues. Along with this, he has blown up on the family that took him in when he was about to be homeless. Its even gotten to the point where he grabbed the back of one of our friend's neck after seeing a Facebook post. Now the entire group has gotten on the same page that we are done with him. \n\nMatt has said that he intends to apologize, but this is recurring. Every couple of months, he blows up on someone. The last time was on Christmas. He just never learns lessons, and we feel like we can't keep him around. \n\nOf course, I'm the one tasked with laying out the information to him and telling him that he's become a danger to himself and others. It's been the same song and dance since early in highschool and we're leaving college now. It feels like he's never grown up. \n\nTL:DR Friend has gotten aggressive to the point of bordering physical violence. This has been recurring for years now. I want to be sure we aren't in the wrong for dropping him.",

      "title": "AITA For being cold towards my friends given the circumstances which they started dating each other under?",
      "description": "I have this group of online friends which are around my age (17~18) who I met around November of last year. We all live in the same country. Recently, two of the members of the group, R and T, started dating each other. R is a very shy and insecure boy. He's never been in a relationship before. T is a troubled girl who has had family problems in the past which have 'messed with' her emotional side. She has been in multiple relationships (6 IIRC) in the past 2 years, which have all been LDRs. The last relationship she was in, was with an American boy and lasted roughly a year (let's call him K).  \n  \nRight before December ended I got invited to spend New Years with them. I accepted this invitation. Nothing strange happened during New Year's, other than the fact that out of nowhere when we were going for a walk, R and T started talking to each other (they weren't close before, so it was kinda strange). When we got to one of their homes to just chill out, there were a solid 5 minutes where I just remember they were laying down on top of each other cuddling. Anyway, fast forward to after New Years, they all of a sudden get really close. Close to the point where they started hanging out in private Discord calls instead of joining the voice channels on our server. They started seeing each other quite often in real life, as well as he would pick her up from school and walk her home every day. This was really strange considering he NEVER left his house before. They started napping together, and she even left a hickey on his neck.  \n  \nSo here's my problem with this. While all of this was happening, she was still dating K. Even worse K had no clue that T and R were doing things with each other. T and K still considered each other significant others during this time. In my eyes, I see what she did as cheating and I'm not okay with it. I did not like the way that either R or T handled the situation, because, at the end of the day, K is a human being and no one deserves to be cheated on. T broke up with K, but only after she had been doing stuff with R for about 2 months.  \n  \nWhen I confronted her about this, right after their breakup, she told me that her and K \"weren't really together and we're just together for the sake of not being alone\". Tbh this sounds like a really lousy excuse, and also, K was really devastated. Taking into consideration all of these details, I don't know what happened inside of me, but I just couldn't take it anymore. I lashed out against them and started acting really cold to both. I don't agree with their relationship especially how it started. The whole \"pushing all of their friends to the side\" and \"cheating on her boyfriend\" was just too much. I would understand if it were only me thinking this way, but most of the people in the friend's group were disappointed in both of them as well. So I would like to know, am I an asshole for feeling this way/being cold to them because of it?",

      "description": "**TL;DR: I've historically bent over backwards to help my best friend succeed at college, she asks me to help her cheat on an open note test by means of her disability accommodations, I refuse, she gets angry AITA?**\n\nSorry for the length, not really sure if this much background is necessary, but it does help paint a picture of why she might feel like I might be an asshole for refusing.\n\n**Background:** \n\nMy best friend of about 2 years and I have started a masters program together a few months ago. She has narcolepsy and therefore gets accommodations in the form of taking tests alone, flexible assignment due dates, and double time for tests. We went to another university last spring semester to get two prerequisite courses for the masters program done and she did a semester before that to finish off her bachelors. I've spent literally hundreds of hours tutoring her with her homework/studying in all of these classes, a lot of the time literally dictating to her what to write for homework assignments. I have told her in the past that it has been a constant source of frustration that she will look at homework assignments, give up immediately, and wait until I'm helping her to even start. If a test was coming up I would spend almost all my free time with her to study for an entire week before tests (~30-35 hours for the week). She 100% would not have passed these prerequisite courses without me helping her. All this tutoring was ostensibly in exchange for free dinners, but let's be honest, 5 hours of in-home tutoring is not even close to the cost of one dinner. \n\n**More (probably pertinent?) background:** \n\nFurthermore, I've also helped her quite a bit in the past by carpooling to work, I drove both of us every time for about 20 times and she didn't pay for gas. Also I did move in and live with her and her boyfriend for 4 months with the expectation that it would be easier for me to help her study throughout the masters program and in exchange I get really cheap rent. I had budgeted enough money to pay for rent and bills for the duration of the masters program so I quit my job with the expectation of relaxing for a month before classes start up (which I told her about months in advance). After about 3 weeks she told me I was impacting her and her boyfriend's sex life and she was tired of me hanging around the house all the time and asked me to leave. Since the masters program has started she will usually drive me home (about 5 minutes) from class 3 out of 5 days and I spend way less time helping her with homework.\n\n**Anyways, back to the point:** \n\nIn the prerequisite courses to the masters program, she got to take tests alone and had a **very** flexible disability coordinator, he allowed her to take her iPad in to the test and have every test open note (without the professors' knowledge). She started taking pictures of the test questions and would send them to me so that I could answer the questions for her (without the disability coordinator's knowledge). I now think this was a mistake and I really should have shut this behavior down right then, but I just went along with it since it was just prerequisites that I didn't really think were specifically useful to the masters program and I didn't really want to risk getting into the masters program without her.\n\nSo were in the masters program now and she has to get the professors to sign off on disability paperwork in order for it to be official and take her tests in the testing center where she is timed and proctored. One of the professors forgets to sign and send off the paperwork and she doesn't bother him about it until months later a day or two before the test. So since the professor didn't fill out the paperwork he gives her the 90 minute open note test to take home and an entire day to finish it. \n\nShe asks me to help her on it (she does give me an out, \"Idk if you're comfortable helping me with any of this but if you are plz do.\"), I say no, she texts me \"haha ya dick\". Then about 30 minutes later she starts asking specific questions anyways and I start guiding her to specific slides where she can find the information thinking that it was open note anyways and guiding her to the specific slides to find answers isn't *really* cheating. 45 minutes of this goes by and it's getting to the point that I'm googling stuff for her, highlighting specific text in the slides, and writing out examples so I put an end to it and tell her, \n\n\"Anyways I didn't want to help you, and now I'm helping you. It's not mean-spirited or anything, but since we're in the masters program now I don't want to help you with tests.\" \n\nShe responds with, \n\n\"Dude it's taken me over 4 hours to do this test and it even took you and the rest of the class extra time. If you don't want to help me fine, whatever but I don't understand what being in the masters program has to do with it. I'm at a huge disadvantage with all this stuff and it's not like we're competitors. Also you know I would do the same for you but I guess that's just because I'm nice and actually care about your success. :| :| :| :| :| :| :|\"\n\nPretty much the entire class stayed and extra ~20 minutes to finish the test, so time was an issue for this test. Also in addition to her disability her dad died a couple months ago and her family is having a hard time with that so that's probably what she's referring to with \"all this stuff\".\n\nSo two days pass with no communication. We get our tests back and I get 99% and she gets 98%. I tell her, \"see, you didn't need my help anyways\" to which she tells me that she's angry with me and she had to go to the professor to get even more time and he held her hand for two hours through all the questions on the test that she couldn't do (which, from seeing what she accomplishes while working independently, was probably all of them). From what I understand she turned the test in the day we got the tests back (she had a total of ~40 hours to complete the test).\n\nI then tell her my reasoning that literally nobody wins by helping her cheat on tests. I have to spend my time, she doesn't learn anything, it's unfair to all the other students, and any future employer will have a false perception of her capabilities. To which she responds: who cares?, nobody's going to find out; we'll have to learn all of this again on the job anyways; I have a disability and need this help to succeed (basically her argument seemed to be that she's entitled to cheat because any accommodation she received isn't going to make up for her disability); you have a misguided moral aversion to helping me cheat; accused me of thinking that she isn't worthy of being in this program (since she would not be there without my help); she spends time driving me home, I can spend time helping her with a test. We pretty much left it at agreeing to disagree but she still thinks I'm being an asshole.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAm I the asshole here? I admit maybe I've been enabling this kind of behavior from her by helping her so much with schoolwork and setting a precedent by helping her on previous tests, but I've since changed my mind and now feel like cheating on tests is going too far. I did genuinely try to teach her, but it just grinds me down after hours of trying and failing to get her to understand a topic and we get to the point where she just goes: 'look, this needs to get done and we have like 30 minutes left, can you just tell me what to do?' and at that point I'm just too tired to bother arguing about it.\n\n**It gets a bit ranty down here:**\n\nI admit I may be a bit bitter still about being kicked out after she seemed so enthusiastic about me living at her place long term and kicking me out under such stupid circumstances too. It also doesn't help that she has been constantly complaining about how little time she has to study or do homework despite the fact she has no job and her boyfriend does all the housework and pays all the bills. Meanwhile I have to get a part time job (~12 hours/week) to pay the bills because she kicked me out and live by myself and still have so much time to waste I've picked up a time-consuming hobby since starting this masters program just to keep from getting bored.\n\nIt kind of does bother me that I have never once held any of the massive amount of work I do for her against her in order to get her to do stuff for me, but then she offers to drives me 5 minutes home in the direction she was going anyways (which I've told her I appreciate, but I am far from needing) and now she's taken whatever that's worth and implying that kind of stuff is in exchange for helping her on the test.\n\nI feel like I'm almost at my wit's end with her. I've told her a couple times before the masters program started that I cannot and will not carry her through the masters program. I sincerely didn't mind so much when it was simpler courses but now that we're in some pretty difficult courses it has gotten extremely stressful for me when I have to do her homework for her and she ***clearly*** does not understand almost anything from the classes and no matter how I try to explain things or how many times I tell her things she just does not understand or remember. And I get this is part of her disability, **I get it**, but I feel like she really needs to do some soul searching because after ~6 years of college and ~24 years in the education system she should have figured out how to effectively learn with her disability by this point. Furthermore, this masters program is basically tailored to a specific career and what we learn in this program is very similar to on-the-job duties and as such I feel like if she graduates she will be vastly unqualified for any employment she finds in this career.\n\nAlso: I'm aware that it does seem that I'm being taken advantage of, but she's pretty much my only RL frie",

Yay! We made a rule that anyone who wants to join in has to split the cost with us.\n\nSo my mom only watches one show, so she asked us for our Hulu password.

I didn't really want to give her the password, so here's the arguments she used\n\n\"I feel like it's a good way of giving back for all the trips and food and clothes and Netflix we pay for.

      "description": "This story needs a little backstory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast month a very close friend of mine messaged me asking if he could borrow money since he was moving out of his parents home and had to pay some college fees. Since this was a very good friend, I lended him around 250 euros (Which is a lot for me since I'm just a student). He told me numerous times he would give it back to my by the 11th. Days pass and on the 11th I messaged him asking if he could return the money. No reaction... Two days later he messaged me saying he was busy with school and that he would send it over right away. 2 days later, still no money. I send him an angry message saying he should return the money as I need it back. He messaged me a day later saying sorry and that he send it over. I check my bank account the next day to find out he only send over 100 euros. I'm fuming at this point because I feel like I'm being fucked over. I call and message him multiple times but don't get a reaction. After a while of messaging he tells me that he was sorry but he just couldn't get the money in time and that he promises that he should have it by next week. I tell him if it isn't in my bank account by monday I'm getting other people involved. By tuesday the rest of the money finally showed up in my bank account, 2 weeks after the original day he was supposed to return it. I had my own bills to pay which I needed the money from.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't spoken to him since. Now he messaged saying he is back in town and wants to hang out (When he still lived close to my house we hung out multiple times a week). I ignored his first 5 messages and heard from our mutual friends that I shouldn't be that angry because 'That's just his personality'. Am I the asshole for not wanting to hang out with him anymore? My friends told me that I shouldn't throw away this friendship just because of this but I feel like he disrespected my after I helped him out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nFriend borrowed money, didnt give it back for 2 weeks now I dont wanna hang out anymore but my friends told me that I shouldn't blame him cause it's just 'his personality' ",

      "description": "This happened on Valentine day's but I only found out about the reaction this morning. We all go to school in a fairly large college town. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went out with some friends to a couple bars late at night, and my roommate/friend invited some of his friends to tag along with us. One of them is this girl that I guess has issues with me since the moment she met me. There was 8 of us in total, myself included, 4 guys and 4 girls. We had been barhopping since 10 and it was already around 12. The guys had pregamed pretty hard before we headed downtown and most of the girls are not 21 yet so they couldn't drink. I hadn't drank at all up until that point so I made sure to keep track of everyone in our little group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were moving in between bars, and I'm not going to lie, the area is pretty sketchy late at night. To give the area context, its where all the bars and clubs are, so everyone from my university and the town itself go to party. There's alot of crime in this place, alot of homeless people and other sketchy individual live in this area, this area is famous for fights, robberies, and assaults. There's a large police presence in the area because of this. We even saw a hit and run happen just as we were about to cross the street. (The car escaped)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere we are, about to hit up the last bar for the night, and the group was getting separated. The guys and I were in our own little group walking ahead of the girls, while the girls were behind us with last two helping each other walk because one of them could barely stand up to walk. Since I was sober, I made sure that everyone was accounted for and were just about to cross the street and we were about half a block away, I realize we picked up an extra person. This random dude I hadn't seen at all, was talking to the last 2 girls, trying to pull them away. No one else noticed what was going on, I tapped my buddy on the shoulder to come with me to talk to the guy but he didn't realize there was a random guy following us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I approached the guy, I could hear him say they should go with him to this other bar and he was getting real close to them. One of the girls could barely stand up straight to walk, so the other girl couldn't walk away fast enough to move away from him so I got in between them by sticking my arm out and wrapping around the girl in kinda a half hug and turning toward the guy and telling him they were good and that they were with our group of friends. It worked for a moment because he backed up immediately but then one of the girls (the one that doesn't like me) says that they didn't need me and that I didn't have to touch her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat shit left me stumped and I suddenly felt really awkward so I immediately let go and I walked away back to my friends. By that point, the rest of the guys figured out what was happening and were like \"who dafuq is this guy?\" while pointing at this guy. And since I walked away from the girls, the guy used the opportunity to come back up to the girls and talk to them. He followed us the whole way to the bar. The atmosphere was awkward after that, we all got quiet after that with the guy being the only one talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole time time we were walking, he was trying to talk to the girls saying \"We should go to this bar\", \"Where is that bar located\" and \"Why don't we wanna go to that bar.\" When we finally reached the bar and it became clear we were not going everywhere else, the guy dipped and disappeared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe went inside, the guys and I went into our little group and did our own thing, while the girls went into their own, before dipping out early.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was a couple of days ago, and my roommate told me this morning that his friend (the annoying one) that she is upset with me, that the girls could have handled it and they didn't need my help, I didn't have to touch her, and that they didn't need man to defend themselves, and I need to tone it down with my machismo. (I think she said the last part because she knows I'm Latino). I talked my roommate and my friends about it if I did a bad thing and we laughed about it. But I honestly feel a little hurt now and like I did something wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm wasn't trying to be a knight in shining armor, I wasn't rescuing a damsel in distress. I didn't expect anything  owed to me. I just saw someone that was in need of help and I reacted because I felt like I was doing the right thing but I guess not. In hindsight, I realize what I did was very stupid and dangerous. The guy could have reacted very negatively to what I did, he could have had a knife or a gun. I could have gotten into a fight or worse. Like violent crime is a common occurrence. (The Bojangles in front of my apartment was robbed this week with an AK47 style weapon and they got away from the police.) I get kicked out of my program with only a year and half left before I graduated for a career I worked so hard to achieve, or my parents lose their only child. \n\nNot worth it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLesson learned, No good deed goes unpunished.

      "description": "I haven't talked to my BF for a couple of days now and keep rethinking this situation, thus decided to ask y'all AITA.\n\nBack story: this past Saturday I was having a beer with my close friend at a bar next to both our homes. My BF of two years was out working on a project with his colleagues till around 11 PM that night. My friend and I were still at the bar when my BF called me and asked whether we're still there and should he join us as he had finished his work. I said sure, the more the merrier. \n\nSo he comes to the bar, we get another round of beers and as this bar is open 24/7, it is not unexpected that all sorts of people come in. Also, it is not very rare for a fight to happen outside this bar (though a pretty safe area otherwise). We're drinking our beer when something smashes into the window behind us. Of course, a couple of dudes (friends from what they seemed) were fighting each other. A pretty nasty fight is happening and as I am not very keen on seeing people smash each other's faces, I turn away. My friend and my BF are watching the fight through the window and as I was a bit scared I tried holding my BF's hand. That's when he harshly pushed both my hand and me away from himself and told me not to touch him. This is when I got mad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left the bar around an hour later I said it was very mean of him to behave that way and that it shows me he doesn't respect me if he can push me around like that. He said it was not his fault as he was \"really into the fight and felt like he was in it himself.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for not speaking to my BF and being mad for him pushing me away like that?",

      "description": "(Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons, also I’m on mobile so apologies) \n\n(Tl:Dr at the bottom)\n\nThis is something I’ve always wanted to know, figured I’d finally get it off my chest...\n\nSo rewind about 4 years. I was in San Francisco.on business but I have family out there so visit them while I’m there. I, of course, wanted to see the night life of the city and really take in what it had to offer. My family members obliged and we went out and had a few drinks.\n\nI’m in my mid-20s at the time but the family I was visiting was much older, late-40’s and very settled down. So they’ve outgrown the whole “stay out past 12” phase of life, but not me. I was staying in a hotel as I was there on business. So after we parted ways I decided to keep perusing the city as the night was still young and my meeting the next day wasn’t till noon (plenty of time for the Advil and pedialyte to work its magic)\n\nI’ll leave the name of the bar out but it was in the Polk Gulch area. Nice little place, quaint. I’ve always been a fan of the “hole-in-the-wall” bar vibe as opposed to the big, boisterous bar scene. So I go in, it’s about 12:30ish, I’m having a few drinks, the night is going well enough. I have small talk with a few women, nothing really develops (I was painfully single at the time) But across the bar I see a man staring me down. At first they were passing glances (but still noticeable) but as I was passing glances myself to just be sure he was, in fact, staring at me and not someone else, his staring intensified.\n\nNow I’m from New York City (moved from the city to upstate a handful of times but spent more time in the City than not). The bar scene can be very hostile at times (not always), especially at this hour of the night. So for me, a guy who is 1000mi away from home, has been incredibly heterosexual up to this point in my life and never experienced this kind of encounter with a man before,(He in no way appeared outwardly homosexual and was a very muscular man, might I add) my immediate reaction was to respond defensively with a narrowed glare. \n\nHe must’ve taken this as an invitation because he immediately began walking over to me. I was preparing myself for a confrontation right up until he greeted me with “I’m glad I can grab the attention of someone attractive in here.” Needless to say I was taken aback and took a few seconds to switch gears. \n\nI probably should’ve expected it, I mean of course I was aware of the sizable homosexual community that’s present in San Francisco but I was fairly tipsy at this point and my defenses are always up when I’m in unfamiliar territory. So I respond nicely enough, we strike up a conversation, I’m actively trying to keep it friendly and light. I don’t have any issue with homosexuality. My worldview is “As long as you’re not a dick, nothing else should matter”. \n\nSo it’s fairly clear the guy is interested. He’s doing the “passively touching of the shoulder” and laughing a bit too hard at things and making flirty comments. But I really didn’t mind, the guy was a good conversationalist, and seemed like a good enough dude. \n\nAt this point it’s about 1ish I believe(I was pretty deep at this point) but I thought to myself. “You know what? Fuck it. I’ve never done this before, never experienced this at all before. Why not give a shot? Broaden my horizons a bit. See if I am, for sure, straight. Not like anyone I know is ever going to find out about it.”\n\nNow here is why I think I might be the asshole here...\n\nI didn’t tell the gay guy this was my first time/an experiment for me. In my mind, I thought it would be a turn off and drunk me was very very committed to this at this point. So we have some more good conversation, enjoy the night, dance a bit, drunk some more, I’m (trying) to flirt back, he’s pretty receptive to it. \n\n(Kinda NSFW in the next paragraph)\n\nSo it’s about 2-2:30ish and we decide to finally leave and go back to my hotel. We get back and the ‘physical contact’ commences and oh boy.....was it bad. I almost threw up after about &gt;1minute of oral, anal was a haaaaard negative (even with a gracious amount of lube) as soon as the tip went in. The gay guy was VERY into it but I couldn’t even get it up despite his best efforts and my best efforts to close my eyes and think about Lagertha from Vikings. \n\nIt was just a total bust and it didn’t take long for the gay guy to catch on to the fact I wasn’t exactly “experienced.” I finally confessed to him that this was an experiment for me and I apologized for not telling him at all beforehand. He did say he was upset (I mean I blueballed the shit out of the guy) and that he felt “led on” but, overall, he was very understanding and I ordered him an Uber back to his place. \n\nThe next day I killed it in my meeting, hopped on a plane, went back to New York and have pretended it never happened since. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\n\nTl ;Dr: Highly heterosexual male visits San Fran, goes to a regular bar, gets hit on by gay guy. Has never had homosexual experience before but says “fuck it” because he’s 1000mi from home and “best way to know for sure if I’m straight.” Doesn’t tell gay guy this is a bit of an experiment but begins flirting back. Male and gay guy leave bar, go back to Hotel, sexy times commence, gay guy very into it but straight guy is very much struggling. Can’t get it up, almost throws up during oral, anal (even with lube) was a hard negative, overall just not a good time. Confessed to gay guy that it was an experiment for him. Gay guy is slightly upset, says he felt “led on” but was very very understanding nonetheless. Gay guy goes home, straight guy goes about the rest of his life as if nothing happened. ",

So a month later or so i texted the girl she was very cool and so we talked we had similar taste in music and she was also very shy and weird but obviously my brain got scared and I didn't know what else to talk about i decided to check her facebook what she likes it was the time when facebook was still popular in my country so we talked normally she didn't care about most things i checked or she tolerated it i wanted to have a serious friendship or a relationship whatever she wanted i would be happy to have a friend like that then one day she stopped responding. I got depressed year later my friend asked her about me and she said \"he was amazing but he knew too much about me and that scared me\" i don't know if she wasn't aware of it that you can check stuff on facebook or was it seriously that weird. When i accepted that I'm a creep and a weirdo i got addicted to stuff like cigarettes and mj i stoped going to therapy started taking pills after smoking because i felt that my whole body was in pain and so i decided to write my story here, help me I want to know is there something wrong with me.\n",

Sorry for bad format.  20 year old male working full-time and living at home with mom, step mom, and step brother. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis weekend my family wanted to see if I could come with them to a party for my step-mom's cousin. I said yes but then after getting to work and seeing my schedule I saw I would be unable to switch with anyone for the days I needed off. I came home and told them the bad news and they all took it very hard. My mom even broke out into tears (holidays are tough for her). They are all pretty emotional because of some serious things in their life. Due to that I often am made into a integral part for our family to have fun. This is usually ok as I go to very many places with them and love to see them have fun. However, this time I couldn't make it. NYE I get a text from my step-mom telling me how much I have hurt the family on the whole and ruined the whole weekend for them.  I am not surprised by this as I am often made into a bad guy when I say no to doing something with them. I have struggled with self hate before and this didn't help. I feel as if they constantly depend on me and since I fell through on this they have hardly talked to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for awkward post, I have never tried to write this down before and it is so complicated that I doubt anyone gets what is wrong. I am just having a really hard time since I love them so much but I feel nothing but guilt when I am with them. Am I the Asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Throwaway account, to avoid a potential shit show from reddit-using friends.\n\nBit of context about my relationship with my ex and with the vulnerable person (VP): I was with my ex for just shy of 5 years, and for the first year or so, everything was amazing! However over time he became controlling financially, expected to be able to choose what I wore, how my hair was cut/styled, and expected me to either skip work or university if he decided he wanted to see me, as well as emotionally abusing me about my weight and controlling what I ate to the point I developed an eating disorder. Close friends helped me get myself to a place where I was able to leave, and I ended the relationship. VP was a mutual friend of ours, and had been through a messy breakup about 3 years into our relationship, after which he stopped talking to her, and began talking about her behind her back. He kept saying that the reason she had a tough breakup was because she \"packed on the pounds after they got together\" and repeatedly said she deserved it as she no longer looked the same as she did when her relationship started. VP has mental health issues including debilitating anxiety, and a history of binging/purging food when suffering through a difficult period with said condition.\n\nRecently during a catch-up with a different friend, I was told that my ex had begun messaging VP asking for a date, and had apparently been using backhanded compliments such as \"You're so pretty for a plus sized girl\" \"You're the first big girl I could see myself going out with\" (VP is a UK size 10, for reference). VP showed my friend the messages and my friend reassured her that he meant them as a compliment and she might be more sensitive due to her anxiety. I explained to my friend details about what went down with my ex, and expressed concern that VP might end up in a situation that could seriously affect her mental health, but was told that it's none of my business, saying anything would dent VP's confidence as she hasn't dated since her breakup, and that I'm only trying to get involved because it's my ex.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I told VP that my ex has a history of abusing and controlling women based on weight? It took me so long to get out of that relationship, and I'm still struggling with the after effects, I don't want to see someone already struggling have to go through any of what I did. I can't tell if it's overstepping my bounds, especially as it hits a nerve for me, and there's nobody I can turn to IRL who can help me judge the situation.",

      "title": "AITAH for not fully siding with my Wife against my Dad?",
      "description": "My Wife has always had an issue with my Dad, and it's worth mentioning she's had an issue with older men ever since her parents split when she was much younger, and has trust issues with her own Father - various events that have left her with generalized anxiety.  We've been together around 13 years, married for 5, and over that time she has grown increasingly less fond of my Dad, to the point where she never wants to see him again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's fair to say my Dad may have stepped a foot or two in the Autistic spectrum when it comes to gauging people's moods or handling certain social situations.  He's an introvert who wanted to be an extrovert - I'm sure he once told me he believed charismatic/engaging people are those who just act on their ideas of what might be funny without worrying about what other people might think, and while we as a family we have been completely used to this from him (to the point of not seeing it as strange in any way), his efforts to be a 'goofball' or get a laugh have made other people uncomfortable - something he either gets annoyed at or doesn't seem to notice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my wife and I first started dating at 17/18, my Dad would try and treat her much like he did me and my sister - trying to get a laugh chasing her around the dining room table pretending to tickle her, or jumping out at her.  I thought nothing of it, until my wife told me it made her really uncomfortable and asked me to tell my dad to stop.  I admit I thought she was taking it too seriously, and thought it was mainly down to her issues with older men, but I asked him to stop and for the most part he did.  Things were better for a while, but some behavior crept back in, and all I could see was my dad being a dork or trying to include my wife in what was essentially part of our family humor.  His actions seemed completely innocent to me, if at times poorly judged or conceived, and as much as I saw my wife's discomfort, I always told her it was meant in good spirit and had a hard time seeing why that was not a good enough excuse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst came about 9 years in.  In the past my Dad would jokingly try and give me or my sister a big wet kiss as a stupid goodbye, intended to be funny simply for the ridiculousness of it.  You can guess where this is going right?  He tried it on my wife as we were leaving my parents' house and she was convinced he tried to kiss her on the mouth, pushed him to get away, and my dad stormed off in a sulk. Another time at a party he told her 'I nearly pinched your bum in that dress'.  Definitely inappropriate, but at the time I thought it was just him attempting to be cheeky and completely landing outside the mark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere have been many times over the years where we've met with my parents and absolutely nothing has happened, and at times I thought things were much, much better. However, after spending a few days at my Parents' house just after Christmas 2017, my wife was talking to my Dad and brother in law (who she's also not super keen on) about something trivial, and their attitude in disagreeing with her made her snap.  She told my Dad to 'Fuck Off', went upstairs and we left the next morning to awkward goodbyes.  Since then she has refused to talk to or see my dad, refused to travel with me to see them (its a 5 hour drive) and we have a 2-year-old. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has meant over the last year my parents have only spent about 10 hours total with their grandson when they come up to see me, something which hurts us all and feels like they are being completely left out.  My wife has made it clear she does not want them in the house, let alone staying over, and has only agreed to see my Mum once without my Dad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's reached a peak where we argue about the grandparent situation more than anything, and it gets worse every time.  She's now so distressed about it that she has had counseling for that and other issues, and recently after I tried to encourage her to give my parents some slack decided to report the events I've previously described from several years ago as sexual assault to the police.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm at a loss.  I want to support my wife and I can see her pain, but I can't find myself able to completely side with her while she essentially condemns a man I have viewed as an excellent, loving father, despite his faults.  I know my dad never intended to hurt her and am 100% sure all was meant in jest, but I understand he needs to be held accountable for his poorly judged actions and I am struggling to get over this hurdle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Today is my day off and I live a solid half an hour away from the place that I work. A week ago I agreed to doing an 8am to 5pm shift on this Friday and next Friday, as well as coming in early on Monday to help out. It’s mostly because of the overtime pay since I’m a full time employee and I could use the extra money. I’ve been working at this place for a good three months now and haven’t had any issues with overtime. My manager isn’t the best at communicating things so I always have to sit down and talk to her, asking specific questions. “What time exactly do you need me to come in? What are the plans for that day? Did you do [insert task here] yet?” Etc. And sometimes still I’ll show up to a shift and have to do some of her work because she didn’t do it. I’m just adding this here so you know that she typically has me doing work that’s her responsibility to make sure it gets done, because she trusts me to get it done right. That’s one of the reasons why I haven’t had an issue being able to pick up overtime. \n\nTwo days ago she let me know that her boss told her to try to find a part timer to do those shifts instead so they don’t need to be payed an overtime salary (time and a half pay). I told her I understood that, and I wanted her to let me know the moment she found someone, as well as to take me off the schedule once she did. Yesterday she told me about the girl she found, but she also told me that the girl could only do 9:30am to 4pm which wasn’t really going to help as much. She said she was going to call and talk to her. Again, I told her to please let me know if she didn’t need me to come on Friday. Fast forward to today, I show up at 8am for her to ask me “What’re you doing here  Big-Purple-Dinosaur?” \n\nHonestly at first I thought that it was a joke. I told her, “I’m here for the 8 to 5.” And she basically told me that she got the other person to do the shift even though it wasn’t the full shift just because they’re part time and her boss would be happy. But, that if I wanted to, since I was already there, I could help out by calling that person to let them know they weren’t needed today. Now I’m not the kind of person who’d be comfortable doing that. That’s something that’s fully her job, and it’s something that should have been done the day before. I told her it was fine and that I’d just go home to ‘sleep’ or get other things done. She said goodbye and closed the door on me so I left and took another half hour to drive home. \n\nOn my drive home I couldn’t help but think about the gas I wasted, the fact that I woke up early and got everything ready for the day on my day off just to have to go back home. Once I got home home, I sent her the following text message:\n\n“Hey, sorry about today. I know we talked about [part timer] coming in today. You told me she could only stay till 4 and that you were going to talk to her about things. I told you I could only stay till 5 and you said that was okay so I thought I was still coming in. I guess it was just miscommunication. Did you find someone to come in early on Monday? Is [part timer] going to do next Friday too? Just keep me posted. Wouldn’t want this to happen again.”\n\nShe’s read it and hasn’t responded yet. \n\nAm I an asshole for being upset over this and the way I talked to her? \n\nTL;DR Boss scheduled me on my day off for a shift. Gave the shift to someone else. Didn’t really tell me not to come in. Drove half an hour up a mountain to get to work just to drive another half hour back home. AITA for being annoyed and how I acted in response?",

      "description": "My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\n\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\n\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\n\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\n\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\n\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\n\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\n\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\n\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\n\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?",

      "description": "No one in my family has any money they don't travel, they eat garbage fast food, they don't read books etc. All they really do is work and watch TV. They are also very close minded about anything that is not \"real\" like spiritual things. I'm not a pseud but I like talking about philosophy, metaphysics, art and classic literature I major in math so i'm not exactly a scholar on any of those topics but in my free time I prefer reading over watching TV.  Jung is my favorite author etc. At Christmas dinner my mom remarked about me never bringing my girlfriend over, she sees on my instagram that I take photos with her and she would like to meet her. My girlfriend comes from a rich family. They are billionaires, she went to private school, she has travelled everywhere. Her education is very different from my public education I didn't read Homer or Dante until I was an adult but she says she studied them in elementary school so we have very different academic upbringings. Her parents talk about Jung with me and seem to know so much about philosophy, psychology, really any topic. They talk about Art and entertain more \"hippy\" topics like enlightenment, the occult, energy and all that. My parents are materialists in every sense of the word. Anyway I bring my girlfriend over for lunch today since we both had a day off, I just had dinner with her parents the night before and spoke about Art, and literature. With my family  the conversation drifts to TV and movies and I look at my girlfriend and get uncomfortable since her family doesn't consume mass media, they don't keep up with the news or pop culture, or politics, they really don't care about any of it and I become really embarrassed about what my family is talking about so I said this conversation is why I don't bring anyone over you talk about the most dull topics and I said I have to leave and I left.

      "title": "AITA for making by bf feel guilty on Valentines Day?",
      "description": "I’m the consummate lurker. Sorry if this (first) post turns out so long and unreadable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if this is better suited to relationships, but I’m so worried whether I’ve been the asshole or not. If that’s the verdict, I’ll be making changes / amends. I’m torn between wanting to be accommodating and realistic with my relationship, but also not be a doormat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis isn’t totally V-day (a dirty word for some people) centric. My bf’s and my 2.5 yr relationship hasn’t always been straightforward – we came to the table with very different approaches. I’ve (30) been in 2-3 of longer term relationships. Bf (32) tells me I am his first committed relationship; aside from that I know nothing about his romantic past. His Facebook is a closed book (photos very limited to any outside viewer on his page), and we didn’t know each other before 3 years ago. We live abroad so I’ve little potential for meeting his older friend. I don’t feel too comfortable asking questions about his past; when I have in the past it’s turned up some information I struggled with. I try not to ask questions in case I’m not prepared for the answers. In all other respects he’s a kind, loving and respectful partner.\n\nI learnt quickly what seems ‘obvious’ to me probably won’t to him, and that’s ok. He has some anxiety issues and I think I adjusted to thinking of about things differently. Examples – agreeing to come to a party with me might not mean he’ll talk to anyone or last past 10 minutes; planning a night in together might not happen if he’s in a certain headspace and just needs to be in a different room by himself. I know some of my friends had views on that, but I have worked on changing my expectations, being more open about what means a lot to me, and trying to work within what is comfortable to him at different times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing about me I’ve tried to improve on is that I tend to get excited and look forward to things we plan to do together, so if we’ve been discussing going out for dinner on Friday all week and he needs to cancel, I can get sad. It’s an almost physical feeling of sadness and disappointment when something changes. I’ve worked on managing expectations and not looking forward to something until the last minute, and he’s worked on having a calendar of things somewhere obvious so he feels more accountable for commitments. We don’t do too much, maybe one or two planned thing a week, less if he is sick or tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there’s been a bit of a cumulative effect. I feel like my confidence is going; I’ve started looking at things I’d like to do as an imposition to him. Sometimes he’ll ask 2-3 times if I still want to do something, and by the 3rd time I’ll assume he’s still asking because he doesn’t want to do it, I feel like a burden and I feel guilt for making him go to that effort. I’ll then say we should cancel, because I feel like I’m forcing it otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nManaging my expectations works to an extent – I don’t assume I’ll get something silly like Christmas or birthday presents, I assume nothing for things like Valentines. However I like it – and I know if I want something (a Christmas dinner, a meal on Valentines) that I’m happy to plan it myself. This week however we had been having such a wonderful week – we had a big bit of good news early in the week, his anxiety seemed good, so I got a little too hopeful on the 13th and sent a text “I’ll be cooking us steak tomorrow, I forgot to mention, but if possible, it would be great if you could contribute to dinner tomorrow night (a) a bottle of wine (b) a small amount of flowers or (c) some kind of chocolate / dessert item xx Just one of the above would be appreciated :D”. I got back a heart, and “I was planning to get something you know.. I mean after you reminded me it was valentines day” which I had done, when telling him I would be cooking dinner on Thursday.\n\nSo I thoughtlessly took that to mean that he would be able to contribute one of those things, and stupidly thought it might even mean he had planned something that I hadn’t asked for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCome V day I had shopped, bought and was ready to prepare snacks and a pricier steak dinner. I took longer off work to go to a medical appointment so I could stop and get a better type of food than we usually eat, as a treat for v-day and to celebrate the good news earlier in the week that he had suggested going out to celebrate, but for another reason we did not get around to doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis plans changed slightly, so was home before me and for the whole evening. He made a comment about still planning to walk into town “to get ‘those’ items”. I felt bad, and suggested the easiest of the three items – a bottle of wine from the store about 400m away from our house, and say that would be great. He doesn’t drink wine as routinely as me, and has said he finds it hard to buy sometimes, but I just said maybe he could get something he likes and we might both enjoy with dinner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hours pass and I get snacks out for both of us, and he takes a bath. I start to cook dinner and he comes up to ask if I still really want wine. I feel guilty - it's winter out, too - and say only if he would drink some; he asks a couple more times and I say no, not to worry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get disappointed and I think he can tell I’m feeling sad. I try to ignore it until it passes – go on cooking dinner, chatting, trying to not act differently. But it’s not the wine, it’s the effort I guess. It’s that he said he would. I get a little more sad, I feel silly for forcing things by cooking dinner. I can tell he had seen I’m a bit off – quieter – as he starts to hang around more, and ask to help cook (food was done) and be more cuddly / attentive. I start to feel less like spending time together. Just…sad. Later he cuddles up to me like he wants to be intimate, which is a big deal as he is less often interested in that, and as a result I leave it up to him to initiate pretty much always, so I don’t put him in the position of having to brush me off. I think this is one of the only times in our relationship I don’t respond to ‘advances’. I can’t make myself feel warm and stop feeling sad, so I agree when he asks if I want to be alone. I want to get the feeling out my head, so say to him I am feeling ‘grumpy’ and wish he would not say he is going to do something if he won’t do it. He doesn’t remember the message saying he had planned to contribute to the night, and doesn’t remember me saying the wine would be great, only that eventually I told him not to bother. He looks like he’s going to cry, that I’ve made him feel bad for putting the pressure on him on a stupid holiday, and I feel guilty like I should console him and make up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I just feel sad. I feel like I’m the asshole, and I should just manage my expectations better – this is such a tiny thing. But it’s having cumulative effects: I don’t look forward to things like planned dinners any more- even if we go, maybe he’ll be in a mood to rather be along and it won’t be fun. I don’t feel turned on anymore until we’re way into foreplay – what if he pulls away 5 minutes in and I’m already invested. I shouldn’t have asked for anything or ‘bought into’ valentines, I’m an idiot. But AITA? It's not his holiday, he didn't want to hurt me on purpose, and I just made him feel guilty and pushed him away when he wanted to try and be close.",

College, handsome and Mormon. Over the years, she has had issues with everything I have done up to this point and the only time she backs off is when my husband repeats what I said. \n\nRecently I decided (along with my husband) that I was done with the Mormon church, that it was a cult. My mom doesn't know yet, but she has \"checked\" to see if I am wearing my garments (magic underwear) and has made comments about my tattoos being trashy, or my nose piercing she thought was fake being gross. So I've just decided that I am absolutely done! because she's my mom I love her, and I always will. But I am done trying. AITA",

      "description": "Background:\nI am in college and in a debate society. We meet weekly and debate interesting topics. It’s very formal and was established 150 years ago, so it has a lot of traditions. One of those traditions is speaking in seniority. \n\nToday, I went to our weekly debate society meeting, and I decided I wanted to speak on the topic. I raised my hand at the same time as another member did, but I had seniority over him, so I was supposed to be called upon by the president. She called on the other student and he immediately leapt up and said 2 words. I said excuse me, I actually have seniority. He sat down, and I got up and made my speech which was the last speech of the night. \n\nNow, for the record, it is very bad to interrupt anyone’s speech. It’s against our rules and is seen as a serious offense. However, it is not abnormal for the president to call on someone, and before they begin speaking, someone can politically correct the president (say they have seniority), and they may speak. \n\nThe problem is that he immediately started speaking as soon as he was called upon. Many people approached me afterwards and complimented me on my speech, and I approached the man afterwards and apologized for interrupting his speech. We chatted a bit and all seemed well. Later tonight, the president approached me and scolded me for the interruption. I was very embarrassed and apologized profusely, but the president was rather upset with me. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Right now I am a senior in high school. I am a pretty good student and I try to help my friends out as much as possible when it comes to schoolwork. This year, I have started branching out and talking to people I haven’t typically talked to. One of these people, let’s call him Joe, has become pretty close with me. We have a bunch of classes together and we study and help each other out. Recently, we have been overwhelmed with tests and assignments and have had a hard time keeping up with everything. \n\nSo flash forward to today, Joe is cramming for a test in math and I am pretty calm because I know most of the material. Before the test, I get a text from one of Joe’s closest friends which basically explains that Joe is using me to do better in school. At first, I don’t really believe him but when I think about it, it starts to make more and more sense. Joe and I typically are pretty honest with each other but I do find it weird that we are suddenly best friends after three years of not talking to each other at all.\n\nWhen we get the test, Joe sits right behind me and he expects me to show him the answers and work like usual. Instead, I decide to not show him anything and let him take the test on his own. Obviously I felt bad about doing that because I knew he wasn’t ready, but I was sort of upset at the fact that he could potentially be using me. After the test, he is sort of pissed because he was relying on cheating off of me in order to do well. I know that sounds bad, but I had already told him that I would let him cheat off of me so he didn’t feel the need to study. If I had let him know I wasn’t going to let him, he would have had more time to study.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n",

      "description": "I'm 24yo finished my studies, already landed a high paying career making 120k a year. Not to be full of myself but people have told me I'm attractive.\n\n\nAnyway there's this guy I see around often and we always have googly eyes for each other. We chat briefly and the banter is just completely natural. He seems soo genuinely excited when he sees me with a big smile. We've been acquaintances for a while. He eventually asks me for a coffee and gives me his number.\n\n\nNow this guy has a pretty rough look about him. I don't think he's a player but he gets attention from girls and has an air of easygoingness and confidence about him. I've personally seen someone annoy him but he brushes it off. I text him saying I'm interested in grabbing a drink. He gets a little flirty and sets the plans up picking out a bar for us.\n\n\nWe texted a few days. I was talking to my friend and she is telling me how this guy needs to earn it and I came across as too easy. He works a minimum wage job. So I text him saying \"I'm not totally sure about our date since I got of a relationship.\" I leave it open for him to pursue me.\n\n\nHe texts me back \"ok well if you change your mind let me know\". I got really upset he didn't think I was worth the effort. I don't hear from him for a week. Until he texts me out of the blue inviting me to hang with his friends which I turned down. He goes missing again until 10 days later he texts me asking a question about myself. I left him on read, I feel like I don't deserve this sporadic bullshit.\n\n\nHe did mention he has problems going on at work. I thought they were just excuses at the time. But in hindsight he was telling the truth and lost a lot of work.\n\n\nWhenever I bump into him he is polite, but he's not excited when he sees me. It's been 2 months and no-one has reached out to each other. I really was hoping he would try and talk to me again.\n\n\nSo it's been 2 months and I texted him \"hey\". He replied with \"who's this?\". Clearly having deleted my number.\n\n\nThis made me soo angry. I'm just not sure If I'm angry at myself or if he was just not that into me. Who was the asshole?",

      "description": "Background:\n\nWhen I (30F) met my friend (37F), we'll call her Liz, last year, she was married and taking care of her two twin 7 year old boys. Last December (2017) she met a cop, we'll call him Asshole, who kept driving by her house during the day the play with her kids and soon started hitting on her which lead to an affair. Liz and her husband began their divorce proceedings in April, meanwhile Asshole claims he's also getting a divorce. Asshole then becomes insanely controlling and abusive. He made her leave her son's 7th birthday party to see him, he has lied about his divorce countless times, he tells her he loves her then beats her up, he's hit and kicked her dog, he's cut everyone out from her life. One night they got into a fight and he showed up drunk banging on all her doors and windows at her new apartment and refused to leave for HOURS.\n\nThrough all of this I have been there for her, offering advice (as best as one can; I, too, have been in an abusive relationship and there's only so much that can be done from the outside) offering to go to the police with her (this is tricky as he's a cop), offering to pay for a new apartment, key change, etc. Two months ago she told me she had finally had enough, she called it quits etc. This lasted all of a week and now she's back with him. \n\nI'm at the point where I just can't take this anymore. I don't know what to do. She messaged me yesterday and told me she loves me and misses me; I told her I love her and miss her too but I can't be around her because I can't be around Asshole. She said she understood but I feel awful.\n\nAITA for not continuing to be there for her? What should I do?",

      "description": "Obligatory \"I'm on mobile, please forgive the formatting\" statement.\n\nSo, every friday, my father brings my close family in for dinner to cap off the weekday. He personally cooks the food, and takes great pride in it, which we all appreciate. I live with him, so I mostly have to deal with the aftermath because he refuses to pick up a sponge. Whatever, no big.\n\nSo, today (monday, if you're reading from the future,) I saw that we still had the old pan of lasanga out on the counter, uncovered, with only one slice taken out of it (we tend to make a lot, so a significant amount gets wasted,) I deduce that neither my younger brother, younger sister, mother, father, or I would probably eat it at this point, especially since it was placed directly next to the sink, so it could be rife with mold, which most of us have an allergy to. Also, we have a mouse problem, stemming from the very same issue of leaving food out on the counter every week.\n\nSo, without another thought, I tossed it to our two dogs to eat. Some stale lasagna wouldn't bother either of them, so why not? Well, as I go to clean up another room, my dad flies into a rage, thinking the dogs had jumped up onto the counter and dragged it down, and starts yelling about how sick he was of the dogs and made them go outside. I wanted to say something, but I really didn't want to become the target of that little shitshow.\n\nWe're a decently upper-middle class family, so we don't really have use of leftovers, and we rarely eat them. Nobody after friday had taken another slice, and my father doesn't eat leftovers either.\n\nI think- what the heck? I understand the food was his work, but if he really cared so much about it, why didn't he cover it and put it in the fridge or try and preserve it in some other way? However, on the other hand, I did throw out his work, and that could be hurtful to him. I just don't understand his angle here. Am I being the asshole, or is he being unreasonable?",

      "description": "Today I went to the doctor’s office to fill out a repeat prescription form.\n\nThe front desk has the usual pamphlets (stop smoking, the dangers of diabetes etc.) laid out and a pen in a stand for patients to use.\n\nI have used this office for a number of years, so I am well aware that the patient pen often disappears from its stand and while I wouldn’t consider myself a germaphobe – something about using a pen that gets touched by hundreds of people every day – most of whom are probably ill, is just not for me.\n\nSo I bring my own pen – nothing special about it in particular just one of those silver clicky Parker ballpoints. \n\nThe following interaction took place within the span of a 30-45 seconds or so.\n\nAs I finish filling out my form a lady comes in and asks the receptionist for her own repeat prescription form - which she is handed and then asks the receptionist if there was a pen she could use.\n\nThe receptionist begins to stare at me as I hand in my form and tells me to “give her the pen”… (I should note I was standing in front of the patient pen stand) so I looked at the pen stand, no pen, I checked under the pamphlets and the floor by the desk, no pen.\n\nThe receptionist then points her finger at my pen and in a demanding tone says  “no, give her that pen”…\n\nSomewhat bewildered, I hear the lady waiting to fill in her form mutter rather sheepishly “c’mon it’s just a pen”.\n\nSomething about the entire situation just irked me little.\n\nI understand that the receptionist’s first ‘request’ may have been based on the assumption that I was using the patient pen but the second time? I just can’t see it– when there is a pen it’s one of the clear multi-pack Bic ballpoints, but when the receptionist is looking and pointing directly at my pen – lets be real, the doctor’s office isn’t going to be leaving out stainless steel pens when even the multi-pack ones are getting stolen.\n\nWhilst I wouldn’t have minded the lady using my pen and waiting for her to finish, something about her comment made me wonder, would I then also be expected to wait should another person come up to the desk and need to use my pen? \n\nNow what I did next is why I ask AITA, I pinched my pen between my index finger and thumb raised it up to my face looked the receptionist in the eyes and said in a calm but admittedly firm tone “No, my pen” to which both the receptionist and the lady seemed shocked – not gasp worthy, but clearly offended that I was not willing share my pen. The receptionist gave a little huff and made it obvious that I had inconvenienced her as she began to search for a pen on her side of the desk, at which point I walked out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this might seem silly and that I am overthinking this now and at the time, but it’s my pen dammit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "Background:\n\n(This happened when me and my cousin were 14 &amp; 15)\n\nOne day me and my cousin had the idea of building a tree house, one problem, we didn't have a tree. The tree on our plot of land was a sickly pine that was nowhere near able to hold 100+ pounds of wood. But, we had a next door neighbor, she was an amazingly kind old woman who'd never had kids. On her plot she had a beautiful oak tree that had to be hundreds of years old. We'd went to her asking to build the tree house, and she'd said yes before we could finish asking. We got lumber from a Home Improvement store and set out that summer to build our fort. Once it was finished we felt so happy and we played in it until school started again. \n\nHere's where the issues arise:\n\nLater that year the woman died of natural causes and her daughter put her home up for sale. Luckily, the daughter had put a note with the lease asking that the new owners let us have our tree house. May of that year a family moved in, an older couple with two sons. We'd had no issues until that summer, we went over to our tree house to see the two boys up there painting the walls. We went up, thanked them for painting for us only to be met with:\n\n\"Painting for you? This is our tree house now, we moved in so you can't have it.\"\n\nWe'd tried to explain that it was us who built it so we should share it at least but they wouldn't budge. We felt utterly devastated and helpless. Later that summer, the family announced that they'd be going on a vacation and wouldn't be back for 3 weeks. Me and my cousin set out to get revenge.  Day by day we dismantled the tree house and stashed the lumber in our shed until nothing was left but some nails we couldn't retrieve from the branches. As you can imagine, the boys came over livid but my parents sided with us and nothing more came of the situation.\n\nAre we the assholes?",

      "description": "This happened a few Minutes ago, so I'm still upset, sorry for any spelling mistakes, english also isn't my first language. \nI just became 30., its around 00.30 where I live. My girlfriend came over and startet cute singing at 00.00 and gratulated me. After some Time of hugging, she startet to explain that something didn't work ihr with my present but she could tell me what it is. I thought maybe its late per Post or Not finished or whatever. I Was in no way disappointed and just asked her to give it to me when it's ready. \nThis is where she startet crying and telling me i'm ungrateful. That she never had experienced someone dismissing her present. Now she is mad at me and won't Talk to me. \nWas it really that Bad to Expect a ready present instead of first hearing what it is? Or maybe a Card, a written descrition of something unmaterislistic? Thank you for your answers! ",

She also decided then would be a good time to discuss future vacations and how we shouldn't go on week long vacation anymore.\n\nI was annoyed.  I planned this whole trip and it just seemed really unappreciative.  From my perspective I was the one that was sick.  And didn't plan on getting sick.  I wasn't asking anything of her except to let me sleep it off.  Trying to switch our flights would mean missing out on the rest of the vacation when I was felling better (which happened) and meant spending more money.\n\nAITA?    \n",

The place I work at finally allows piercings so I said fuck it and went out and got a nose ring. Everyone in my school loves it and I think it looks great. \n\nWhen I told my parents they flipped out. So much that they took 80 dollars out of my savings without talking to me because last week they gave me 80 bucks for groceries and I used it on the piercing. I absoutly did not use their money, I actually had 60 dollars in cash that I've saved up to pay for the piercing. \n\nThey told me as long as I have the ring on my face they do not want to see me, and at the start of next month the top music group is having our concert and it took me 6 semesters to be in it so I am very proud of my accomplishments and would like my parents to be here for me. They will most likely not.\n\nI should add that the first time we talked about it and they said that they didnt want to see me, I cursed them out. Hard. Which is a part of why they are mad and I can understand that part but I am more upset about them not wanting to see me\n\nI talked to my dad today and he said a lot of things but it boils down to me looking unprofessional, recklessly spending money( but they dont bat an eye when I buy 60 dollar video games which is a few dollars more than this piercing) and I tried to convince him that after a while I can take it out as a please and honestly in the next few years I'll just let the hole close since I'm becoming a teacher but for the time being I want to keep it.\n\nAITA for getting a nose ring? \n",

      "description": "Ok, let me break this down... this is a long one sorry ...\n\nI was with my former boyfriend, lets call him A for two years. The last year of those two years we were long distance (he dropped out of university and moved home) and his family weren't too keen on the whole long distance thing. By the end we were seeing each other 1 day a month. \n\nDuring our relationship he lied, stole money from me, always victimised himself, cheated on me ... when I called him out on it, his answer was 'I'm a 21 year old boy. If another girl gives me attention, I cant help it' \n\nI should of seen the warning signs ! But I'm kind of old fashioned and i like the idea of working at and fixing relationships when they go wrong. \n\nSo I was leaving University and our plan was for me to move up to live with him. It had got to 6 weeks before I was moving up. I saw him on the weekend and left on the Sunday... and on the Monday he calls to break up with me, saying things didnt feel the same.\n\nThis was devastating as suddenly I had no future stability ! It was strange but after being sad for 3 days, I realised I had gotten over him. \n\nCue 6 months later where I have fallen in love with B (his best friend). We would hang out a lot as best friends during mine and A's relationship cos we lived close and there was never a single sexual intent. \n\nIt hit me like a ten tonne truck when, after I became single and A broke up with me, that all these feelings would rush into me regarding B. We would continue hanging out as friends and my crush for B would grow and grow. Like the most organic love that I have ever felt.\n\nSo me and B fell deeper and deeper in love (honestly 4 years later and he is still the perfect man) and decided to be in a relationship. \n\nSo B had to ring A and explain what had happened. Obviously A did not take it well at all. I was travelling at the time and didnt get the full scoop... and didnt want to pry. \n\nSo a year later I contacted A saying things about extending an olive branch, and him telling me he went to therapy over the whole thing. And friendship between him and B was beyond repairing. \n\nFast forward another year, A keeps sending me this cryptic messages at 3am and 4am that dont make much sense. About him being unhappy. He asked me next time I'd be in London so he could talk about his life and stuff and I replied 'but I thought you didnt like me much ?? And he replied 'yea maybe I dont.' And then said he broke up with his current gf and I said 'ouch :(' and he snapped 'I dont need sympathy from you.'\n\n He even tried to call me twice but I didnt pick up. \n\nI ended all these messages by telling him harshly to leave me alone and delete my number and let me live my life. \n\nI mentioned it to a friend the other week and she laughed said I really screwed A over. \n\nBut from time to time I still think back and wish things ended differently...\n\nAm I the asshole ???",

A few weeks ago, I was added to her Instagram bio and I was posted to her account. She did this out of her own volition. I didn't ask for this but it made me happy I guess. At least seeing me on her profile would be somewhat of a deterrent for creeps.\n\nHowever, the other day I find out that the pictures and the bio thing aren't there. I ask her and she says that her mum made her delete it because they don't want people know G were dating. I get a bit mad at this but she 'justifies' her actions by saying that her cousin had her fiance on her Instagram and 2 weeks before the wedding they called it off.\n\nNow hear me out, in my country people take social image as a big thing. Especially in small communities of the same race (families/family friends etc).\n\nSo my thing is that I would've been okay if she just let me know in advance instead of letting me find out the way I did. \n\nAITA?

      "description": "My roommate and I have been living together for the past few months. I’ve been friends him for a few years now and he’s a great dude, very relaxed and easy-going which is part of the reason I decided to find a place with him. Another part of moving in with him is we have different work schedules, which would allow us to have privacy and alone-time in our apartment.\n\nPrior to moving in with him his girlfriend asked if she would be allowed to come over. I said of course she was welcome to come over and spend time with him, but I was clear that I wasn’t comfortable moving in with another couple full-time, which she said she understood and seemed okay with. Shortly after moving in I noticed that she was constantly here, which I thought was due to helping him move and settle in. But after the first week I noticed she was still over constantly. I talked to my roommate about this and that I wasn’t comfortable with her being over when he wasn’t here. He said he understood and talked to her about this, which she become upset about because ‘she had moved most of her stuff here now’ (no clue why she did that). But for a short period she was over here less. \n\nOver the past few of months she has started saying over here more and more, particularly during the day when my roommate is at work (she spends all day in his room and doesn’t really leave, which I also think is weird as shit). Due to my work roster most of my shifts are during the afternoons and evenings, so the day time is when I get to chill out at home. I’m someone who values my privacy and alone time and knowing there’s constantly in my apartment who I didn’t agree to move in with unnerves me. \n\nI talked to my roommate about this today and he said he’d have a talk to her, but I feel guilty about causing him any stress or tension over this. A big part of the reason I agreed to live with him is because we would each get our privacy and time to have the place to ourselves, but it doesn’t really feel like I’ve gotten this. ",

      "description": "Title might make me a little bit of an asshole without any context to the story, but here it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened a good 5 years ago, when i made this account actually and I'm guessing it's going to be my throwaway from now on. However, i think about this from time to time and wonder if i was the asshole in this situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family's cat is an outdoor cat and has been living peacefully, albeit a few skirmishes with the cat across the street now and then, in the neighborhood for as long as i can remember. Our new neighbors had just moved in from the countryside and brought with them their own cat which is a pretty big cat, slightly bigger than mine, but much younger and more territorial.  At first, it was okay and thought it would be another situation with the other cat across the street, but it turned much worse than i could have imagined. My cat is old and has been through some stuff, a stitched up stomach due to it being cut open after him being stuck under a fence and an almost lost ear from his glory days along with other small tweaks but still has some fight in him. After a few weeks, i start hearing cat fights almost nightly and i would go out and pick up my cat and clear up the fights since i was a light sleeper and my family doesn't hear it that often. I lost sleep but whatever, cats gotta cat. However, one night, there was a louder than normal cat fight and i could hear my cat moaning very distinctly. i rush out and he's on the ground with the other cat circling him and runs off once i rush at him and i take my cat back inside. There's blood all around my cat's stomach and my cat doesn't look good so i do my best to patch him up and my dad takes him in the first thing in the morning to the vet for emergency and he's all stitched up but he's pretty weak when he returns so we keep him inside. The other cat got more and more confident and would stalk outside my house and patio and would get in a face-off with my cat through the windows. We started limiting my cat's outside hours for when we're home and shut him in when it's night. The other cat gets wise to this and sneaks in through my kitty door even when we're home or when the person watching the house runs off for errands and they to get in catfights indoors, whilst scratching up our floors and furniture and eating his food. One night I forgot to close it up and again, another ensuring catfight inside my house, and my cat is hurt badly again. At that moment I suggested to my dad we take the cat and move him away. He agrees, and throughout the week, we tried to lure the cat into our house and finally got him. We took the cat to an affluent neighborhood and let him loose. Few days later, little girl comes to our door and asks if we've seen their cat lately and we say no. That cat cost us thousands in vet bills and I switch from feeling like an asshole to being justified in the decision even today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Neighborhood cat is way territorial and my cat can't compete. Try to change him to an mostly indoor cat but other cat comes in multiple times and catfights ensnare and damage is done to my cat which equals up to a pretty penny. Kidnap the cat and let him loose in another neighborhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So trough most of my life my sister got lots more attention from my parents than me. I have worked for my grades finishing primary and secondary school at the top of my class(while getting bullied for existing and literally spat on in class). My sister was always got bad grades and was mean to me. One time when i was younger she was calling me names and i hit her. When my mom got home she beat me for it. To be honest, i love my parents but I cant really care about her at all. She is 8 months pregnant and in the hospital now. She moved out last November, but my parents still go over, help her out, get her and her fiancée things. Most of the time i get home late but my parents don't really help me out aside from mostly studying for 10 minutes. I appreciate it, since it is more than dad has ever helped my with it after moving home from abroad after 10 years(he came home for 2 days a month).\nI got jealous of her. Is it justified?",

      "description": "Sorry for formatting I’m doing this on mobile. I want to give everyone a full background as to what’s going on so they can get the fairest view on this as possible.\n\nThis starts in August of last year when I (16m) am on summer break. My parents decide to take away both my brother and my owns phones away for the rest of the summer because he thought we were wasting our summer because we weren’t hanging out with that many people as well as behavioral issues. My dad also told me I would have to go to therapy to improve my behavior because I was being disrespectful to my parents and I willingly went because if they think my behavior was that bad I wanted to change that. Flash forward to about two weeks ago my dad is in the car with me and we are talking and he is saying that my behavior hasn’t improved at all even though in the prior months he and my mother say that I have “made big steps”. He says that he plans on going to family therapy with me and my mom and he threatened that if that didn’t work he force me to join the military. Unfortunately this didn’t go the way he expected.\n\nI started doing research into the military and all of the benefits especially college and I always had an interest in serving and it actually looked like something really interesting to do in between hs and college. Now to preface this my Dad was a mean and  misbehaved a lot as a child and was sent to military school to fix his behavior (I don’t think it really did) and because of this he ended up taking a break in between college and high school but never went back. So last week I told my dad I was interested I joining the military on a three year active duty contract with five years as an inactive reserve as long as it’s before going to college so I can  qualify for the GI Bill, mature, and because I would really prefer to focus on school. He said that the only way he would let me join was if I went to college first and enrolled as an officer which is a six year active duty contract with four years in active that I would serve when I am I college. He also said he worked to hard to let a 17 year old make this decision. I understand he worked hard but I feel like he has no right to say that to me. My dad has always said he would pay for my brother and my college but I didn’t want to feel like I owed him something so I want to pay my own way because of the way he holds things he does over other people.  This has been a really big issue for my family and I don’t want it to cause any more issues, so WIBTA if I joined the military right after high school.\n\n",

      "description": "I sent out a group message on Facebook to have my boyfriends - let’s call him Frank - and my friends to meet us at his favorite bar for his birthday. He didn’t know I was inviting anyone and thought it was just him and I going out for a few drinks to celebrate. \n\nHe is surprised and everyone is having fun, about an hour after being there one of his oldest friends shows up, I really like this friend of his and his wife and sweet kiddos. Let’s call him Brian. All of us are drinking and having a good time, Brian brought along his parents because Frank looks at him as his second parents and they like to have a drink once in awhile. Brian’s dad buys us a round of shots and Brian is already kind of drunk by this point. Everyone’s talking and doing their own thing and Brian walks by and smacks my butt then drunkenly says “I’m so sorry, so so sorry. Don’t tell Frank, that wasn’t cool”. I kind of shake it off because I know people can act stupidly while drinking. Everyone else was busy socializing with one another and didn’t notice. That is incident #1.\n\nA drink or two later we decide it’s time to sing happy birthday because Brian’s parents are getting tired and are going to leave and we want them to take part. The group of us all get together and sing happy birthday and then Brian wipes frosting on my face. I shake it off because it wasn’t much frosting and he was just being goofy. Then he proceeds to wipe a whole cupcakes worth of frosting on my nose, mouth and chin. Smashes it on my face. I’m a little irritated at this point but kind of cover my face and go to the restroom to wipe it off. I don’t say anything because I’ve had a few drinks myself and figure I’m being too sensitive. That’s incident #2. \n\nWhile our group of friends is kind of scattered but in a general area, I finish up a conversation with a few of our friends and migrate over to my boyfriend and Brian to see how Frank is doing. Brian grabs us into a group hug and was telling me to make sure Frank has a good birthday Monday (his actual birthday) because he’s his oldest friend and some other drunken rambles. During this hug I feel a hand wander to my bra hook (on top of my shirt) on my back and feel my bra start to unclasp. I have 4 clips on the back so it isn’t the easiest and I felt the hand trying pretty hard during this group hug, it was halfway undone by the time it was over. Frank knows I’m modest and would never embarrass me by unhooking my bra in a public place. I confirmed this by asking him on the ride home and the next morning. That was incident #3. It made me feel really uncomfortable and dirty. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to ruin Frank’s birthday get together. \n\nBefore the end of the night Brian hugs me and inhales and says “mmm you smell like” pauses for a second and then says “crazy”. That’s incident #4. It just seemed rude and totally unwarranted. \n\nAt the end of the night we said our goodbyes and Brian needed a ride home. I drove him home with Frank and we discovered he was locked out of his house and kept saying he would stay outside it was no big deal. I insisted no, it was cold, we were staying until we got him inside. I called his wife who I consider a friend (we aren’t very close but still a friend nonetheless) and asked her to unlock the door and apologized profusely for his level of drunkenness. When Brian realized I called his wife he pointed to me and said “you, go” and pointed to my car. He said to Frank “you’re good” but pointed to me again “you go, you called my wife”. I stepped away and we waited till she came downstairs to let him in. \n\nThe next morning I explained to Frank what happened. If it had just been one incident of drunk stupidity, I probably would’ve shaken it off like it wasn’t a big deal. I used to work at a bar, I know people can act extremely different when drunk. I couldn’t shake how badly Brian made me feel multiple times. I told Frank I didn’t want to be around Brian when he has been drinking ever again. That I spent half of the night feeling badly and dirty, like I was in the wrong. I held back tears a lot of the night and my patience started wearing very thin. He kind of shrugged it off. I spoke to my girl friend about what happened, she was there but again I didn’t tell anyone since I didn’t want to ruin the night. She said that Frank should talk to Brian and tell him he owes me an apology. I kind of agree but didn’t have the guts to tell him. I told Frank I agreed with my friend. He hasn’t talked to him and I’m kind of hurt. I don’t want to come between Frank and Brian as they are old middle school friends (they’re both in their early 30’s now) and I would never give Frank an ultimatum to pick one of us. I just feel like the issues need to be addressed so Brian knows that this kind of behavior isn’t going to fly, inebriated or not. AITA for being upset with my boyfriend? AITA for being upset with his friend?\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend’s friend did quite a few degrading and embarrassing things to me while drunk at my boyfriend’s birthday gathering. My boyfriend hasn’t said anything to him. AITA for being upset with them both?",

When he saw that I didn’t sit next to him he moved his things to be near me. This happened several times.\n\nAfter only knowing him for about 4 days he made ‘jokes’ about torture and how it’s always the people who seem nice that turn out to be violent.

      "description": "For people who don't know, a warm up is a waterproof jacket like [this](https://www.swimoutlet.com/warm-ups-c13570/) that competitive swimmers wear during swim meets to keep from getting cold. When my swim team was participating in the league meet, my coach required that everyone wear warm ups branded with the team's name and our school.\n\nHowever, I didn't buy a warm up, so I had to borrow an old crappy one from the school. During our last meet, the coach was pissed that the team didn't make enough of an effort, and decided to withhold a gym credit (that is needed to graduate) from everyone who didn't wear a black speedo for leagues. However, I'm a bit of a loner on the team, and I didn't get the information. That's fine, I have skin conditions and asthma, which I can use to waiver the credit. \n\nObviously I was pissed. I'm not a talented swimmer, so I faced bullying from the varsity squad (I'm in JV) during the course of the year. We also had to wake up at 5 every morning in order to practice in the freezing cold water. By not giving me the credit, the coach had just invalidated 4 months of hard work on my part. Also, my parents have been forcing to me to swim since I was 5. They've promised that they'll stop forcing me to swim after this year. I've hated it for as long as I can remember, and this year I was ready to close the book on swim. I want to keep it to congratulate myself on how far I've made it and the adversity I've overcome.\n\nThe warm up I borrowed was of an older design that the school has since replaced. It's also old and itchy. The school probably doesn't need it. I'm planning to tear it to shreds and then frame it. It'll be my vengeance both on swim and the assholes I had to share it with.\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I should also note that they are living in their mom's house (which is now my fiance's house) for free and never moved away. It's a big house with 5 bedrooms. They are all adult, the youngest is currently studying in college. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is my fiance totally agreed with them. She told me her plan to sell the house and I was angry upon hearing her plan. The discussion turned into an argument, harsh words started flying out (mostly from me) and she told me I would never understand the bond between her and her siblings as I am the only child and that I am too cold blood. Well, my plan was for her to move to my house and we would rent out her house and kick all of her siblings out of the house unless they can pay the rent. Yes, I dont want my fiance to take care these freeloaders anymore. They are all adult, they have some money from their mom so they should take care of themselves. We didnt talk for one day. I kept calling but she didnt answer. The only time she picked up the phone, it's actually her sister and she told me my fiance is furious with me because I am a cold blood asshole who only thinks of myself and doesnt care about the others feeling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I dont think I am AITA.

There's only a very small amount remaining; the size of the pan suggests to me that he's made a lot. I thank him and proceed to finish off most of it, but I still leave a bit.\n\nLater on, he asks me to clean his pan because I had the last remaining morsel of food in it. I didn't know this was part of the deal, so I say no. \n\nIf roles were reversed, I certainly wouldn't have held it to him to wash up my dish because he ate something like 5% of a meal I'd made. If it were me, I would have just let it go and washed my own dish, because I'd have made the food.\n\nThere's also a small bit of context I'd like to add for some perspective on this: I often find this housemate fairly untrustworthy. He steals others' food, constantly takes liberties and blags favours, and often it seems like he takes minor pride in being manipulative in small, petty ways. He has boasted about his food theft before, so for that reason I don't want to be nice to him. \n\nIs this a bias that is affecting my outlook on this particular situation, or is it really warranted that I should wash up a pan because he's given me some free food?",

I am 17 and my boyfriend is 22. \n\nIn the past, he seemed fine with jokes made by friends about him being a pedophile for dating me because I look several years younger than I am. Also, it would technically be illegal for us to have sex so it’s not that outlandish of a comment to make.\n\nAnyway I guess I took the joke too far or overused it, because he legitimately got really mad at mad at me after my jokes. I started out by [jokingly] asking him to help me get dressed ‘because I’m so young.’\n\nI thought it went over well, and later that same day he asked me to do some chore that I forget I continued the joke by pouting and [non-seriously] telling him that he shouldn’t expect me to do any chores because ‘I’m practically a toddler.’\n\nAgain, maybe I misread his reaction but I also thought this was fine. Yesterday evening however, he legitimately yelled at me after I made the comment that I was ‘like his Lolita that actually appreciated him.’\n\nHe was super defensive and told me that that I was incredibly insensitive for making these kinds of jokes. This was the first time that he has ever actually yelled at me, so I’m pretty upset at the moment and am trying to gauge if this was just a misunderstanding or if u am obviously at fault here.\n\nTL;DR: I made repeated jokes about my boyfriend being a pedophile that he seemed fine with, but he got really upset and yelled at me over the last one that I made.

I became friends in an online community with a Canadian girl who was supportive and understanding of what I was going through.\n\nShe confided in me that her relationship was on the rocks, and in her words \"they wouldn't still be together if they weren't just horny\" As a stupid 23 yr old, I gave her the best advice that I knew how to give: do what makes you happy. I counseled her through the break-up with her fiancee as she had done with my break-up with my wife. Of course, after this happened, she confessed her feeling for me, and I had my feelings for her, so we decided to get into a relationship.\n\nI soon realized my asshole ways with my wife, and that I really wanted to be there for my son. So I told Canadian that I still had feelings for my wife. So she bought a one way plane ticket to my city. I was shocked and I told her not to come, and that we should remain friends. She was understandably upset, but didn't come.\n\nWe remained friends, and I ended up trying to win back my wife. Canadian tried to get back with her fiancee. I got back with my wife, Canadian did not get back with her fiancee. We stayed in contact until life happened and we fell out of touch. A few years later I tried to contact Canadian but her email address had been deleted. I tried to find her on Facebook but she had blocked me. I emailed mutual friends and was told to let the past lie and leave things alone.\n\nSo I did. I ended up getting divorced/re-married. Fast-forward a couple of years, and I get a message from a friend saying, \"What's Canadian's issue?\" She ranted about how Canadian was self-centered and the community is basically a bunch of Canadian's cronies. I hadn't posted to the community Facebook page in many years, but I realized even though I was blocked by Canadian, I was still part of the Facebook group. I suggested that I should start posting again. Friend encouraged this. After 3 posts I was banned. This really stung because I'm not entirely sure why I was banned, other than Canadian apparently hates me now. I migrated to the website where we met, and was subsequently banned from it, even though Canadian wasn't active there anymore. When I asked why, the response was: \"It was a community decision and it would be best for me to move on\"\n\nI've become obsessed with this situation and ended up online stalking Canadian looking for a way to contact her. I just want to know what happened. I’m confused about what I did to cause such hatred. It could be justified; I firmly believe that each point of view is valid. But whatever the reason, whatever hurt was caused, I'd like to make amends. I'm haunted by the idea that I've caused her life to be miserable. I've managed to track down her physical address, and want to send a letter. Am I the asshole for wanting to do this?",

      "description": "Quick background, I'm a 20 y/o white male from a middle class background from UK. When I was growing up my family had very little money but we lived in an expensive area (house was a dump that took years to make decent). A few years ago my mother and father divorced and my mother quickly remarried to a cash rich guy (a childhood friend who'd also just divorced). Now the family is well off with disposable cash.\n\nMy parents split just before I decided where to go for 6th form (college) and they made it clear that they wanted me to go to my local state sixth form  (free). If I really wanted to I could've gone to the local private one (~£18,000 a year), but the state one was better. They probably would've asked my grandparents for help as money was super tight (I knew this at the time). My mum and dad have always supported me when I go/do something, but I've always taken pride in making my own way and paying for trips myself. For example, whilst at 6th form I spent a month in Bolivia with school. It was ~£4000 and I payed the entire amount myself using money I earned at a summer job. There were chances to do fundraising but I had the money already so didn't participate.\n\nMy sister on the other hand (16) has had many opportunities and my perants (and step father) always bank rolls them. She's had many more opportunities than I had even when I went searching for them. This is partly because we're both interested in sciences (me physics and her medicine), and there's many more programs for females than males. She's also been lucky in the groups she's with and where they go. For example, she's in guides. Her guide troop very regularly does trips around the world. She's been to Switzerland, Mexico and is planning on Japan (I think). I was in scouts. We once went caving in Yorkshire. She does a decent amount of fund raising for them, usually raising about half with her troop. The fam then pays for the rest. I've never had a problem with this as she does work towards it.\n\nI've been out of the country for 4+ months so have been very out of touch with the family. I met up with them at Christmas (minus sister who hates France). My mum mentioned that she'd been offered a scholarship to her old boarding school (my mum earned a full scholarship when she was young so I assumed it was the same). This is a quite exclusive girl only boarding school a few hours away from where we live. It's a very good school, and my sister is more academic than me so it made sense to me (as well as my old sixth form having gone down hill after the head teacher changed). So I few days ago I got curious about the school, scholarships etc. and had a look. Turns out the scholarship is for 10% of the price, maximum. That makes it over £26,000 a year with the maximum 10%.\n\nI'm not really sure what to think right now, but mostly I'm upset and angry that my family are willing to send my sister to such an expensive school when I never got the opportunity. I realise that I'm basically being insanely jealous, but right now I've got under £500 in my account and no job for the foreseeable future. I'm currently living in a foreign country to learn a new language (didn't at school and I decided it is an important skill to have) and like I said, I'm out of touch with the family. \n\nFrom what I understand, my mum, father and grandparents are each paying a third (not sure how accurate this is, but seems legit). She's always been the favourite grandchild and my father's favourite as she's very different to me and my youngest sister (I've 2 BTW). They've always said they have money put aside for each of us to get through university (about £50,000 in the UK, but no idea how much money there is). As I'm not going to uni (apprenticing instead), not sure what's happening there. \n\nSo, reddit, I need a second opinion in this.\n\nTLDR; family willing to pay ~£25,000 a year for my sister to go to a private school when I didn't get the chance to. I'm feeling pissed and questioning if I should bring it up. \n \nAITA?\n ",

My sister sent a group message to the whole family the day afterwards essentially saying that because we all forgot he went to bed feeling unloved and she’s disappointed in us. Then, she refused to answer any of our calls.\n\n\nI just feel like instead of letting the day end with him feeling unloved, and then texting us the following day, she could’ve reminded us *on his birthday* and scolded us for needing a reminder. I feel really bad for him. I have had birthdays like that and I do love him and want him to know that. \n\n\nI haven’t brought that up yet though bc 1.) my sister is not answering calls and 2.) maybe ITA and this is totally my fault. She already has a rocky relationship with us as my parents have had a difficult time accepting she’s gay. Also, my nephew is adopted which may make him feel especially unwelcome and insecure - Im also adopted so I understand ",

      "description": "I’m 21f in university. Less than a year ago, my parents got a divorce after a 25 year long relationship. It definitely effected my relationship with both of my parents. I still love my dad, but we aren’t as close anymore and probably never will be. However, I enjoy really spending time with my dad. \n\nMy relationship with my mom, however, has been extremely rocky. She has gotten a lot more girly and emotional, and while I don’t blame her for grieving the divorce, I find that I am easily annoyed by her. My mother is a good person, however she is extremely selfish at times (the biggest reason my dad left). Of course this usually isn’t a problem since I’m at university, however I was at home over the summer and I will be going home next week for spring break. \n\nThis is where we have an issue. \n\nMy dad got engaged last weekend. I’ve met his new fíance a few times, she’s nice and I’m happy for them. I am still a little sad because my dad doesn’t seem to want to spend one on one time with me, in fact, I haven’t had one on one time with him since the divorce. Overall I am still effected by this and I miss the way my parents used to be. Now my dad doesn’t have time for me and my mom is a completely different person.\n\nSo when I go home tomorrow... I know my mom is going to ask me questions about my dad. I know that she’s going to do her best not to say bad stuff about him, which I respect. I will say I don’t want to talk about it, and she will keep pushing and pushing. This has happened many times. Finally I will get extremely irritated with her and she’ll start crying, which she often tends to do to guilt me into doing things. \n\nI just do not want to talk about my father and his relationship at all with her, AITA?

      "description": "I had a friend, was a good guy for the most part and he helped me through some stuff in the past, the only thing was he was lazy or not sober most of the time we would hang out but I didn't mind too much.My birthday was coming up and he offered to use their house so we can drink. I was reluctant because this friend is a slob, I say yes because I don't get to drink very often, but also add we need to clean and he isn't allowed to smoke inside during the party(I have friends who might be uncomfortable). I attempt to clean but I don't know where to put anything he owes, he wasn't being much help so I move all his shit to a desk in the corner. I give him money to go get a bottle of tequila, another friend comes and brings a bottle. We're hanging out in the living room(kinda crammed) then I noticed he pulled his pipe out and started smoking. I yelled \"- what the hell did tell you.\" He goes into the other room with his friend and smoked in there. not many drank, we were left with two barely touched bottles of tequila left. I was a bit bummed about the party, whether people enjoyed it or not, so I and two people cleaned till the trash can was full and left. I left the bottles there and asked my friend if I could have the bottles as a birthday present and if he could hold on to them for a while, he agreed. A week passes and I ask to hang out, he was busy.2 weeks. 3, I asked when the best time to come over and get the bottles would be, he texted back (and I quote)\n\"oh RIP that's been gone\"\n\"Ok you owe me $40\"\n\"Lmao you can believe that but it doesn't make it true \"\n\"Where did it go? \"\n\"It got drank me and - finished the bottle - brought and I think -* and -* finished the other bottle \"\n(P.s.* is his roommate and her boyfriend or something) \n\"So basically what you're telling me is - and I bought two bottles of tequila  for MY BIRTHDAY so you and your friends can drink it all even though I told you to just hold on to it? That's a really shitty thing to do.\"\n\"if you're going to pretend that -* and -* are my friends then you're deluded. and are we forgetting that the party was at my house? that i then had to clean up after y'all left? or the entire pack of batteries you ended up with? (yes that's petty to mention but batteries r expensive) and the -* and -* thing is legitimately not my fault, they take my shit all the time too\"\n\"First of all you offered 2nd we took care of most of the trash 3rd I didn't know who -* and -* were but I left you in charge of 2 bottles you and - chose to drink the rest of it, and 4th I took literally like 4 batteries. Get them to pay me back then\"\nWe didn't talk for about two weeks, during which I found out during the party he kept farting near or on my friends. When he tried to talk to me he texted me saying \n\"ghosts n goblins coming to the switch with the release of the online service\"\nIt pissed me off that he just brushed the incident off so I ignored it and never spoke to him again.

When I met them they were super religious, church twice every week, formal clothes everywhere, super mild mannered. You get the idea.

Visited while I was drinking and had their first drink with me that day. Slowly started Cussing the more I cussed near them, and even though I actually tried to talk them out of it. They started smoking a week after they saw me (tobacco) , I got a tattoo, now they have one... I know they were super sheltered so I didn't think much of it.\n\nBut the other day they started asking me about weed... Convinently I had some on me and offered to share.

They didn't and we had a great time but later a mutual friend found out and was livid.\n\nShe said that I \"ruined and corrupted them\" that if I wanted to ruin my own life I could but to keep other friend out of it. That I'm a horrible influence and a bunch of Bible stuff and she never wants me to contact either one of them ever again... So AITA or just dealing with a bitch? ",

      "description": "Context: My parents separated when I was young and was spared from the “angry divorced parent drama”. That said, my dad and I struggled with a healthy relationship when I was younger for I often took a backseat to his girlfriends. After some therapy and the both of us growing up a bit (in different ways) we hit our stride and developed a solid father-daughter relationship.\n\nThen in my mid teens my dad married a woman with 3 kids. We all had serious concerns about the marriage for my ex step mom (J) had no job, no aspirations, etc. Regardless, my dad was happy and so I was I. I had a good relationship with my step siblings and overall things were good. After 10 years J left my dad for someone she was seeing on the side. She remarried immediately after the divorce was finalized. \n\nNow, I recognize we’re in uncharted territory. I’m thrilled that my dad still has a good relationship with 2 of my ex step siblings, but only 1 actively did some work to help maintain our relationship (B). My other step sibling (A) never spoke to me after the divorce but maintains a relationship with my dad. I recognize that B &amp; A mean a lot to him, and I don’t mind him having a relationship with them. \n\nWhat I do mind is that A seems to be using my dad. He supports A financially for college, often repairs broken items, has driven A to the airport in the early hours (look folks, it’s 2019, we have Uber), and has often served as the point person for when A has needs.  A is 30, A is grown. A actively doesn’t no support themself as much as they reasonably should. Also, B &amp; A both have a perfectly fine relationship with their own biological dad, and now they have a new step dad. They offer very little to my dad in terms of support (when he renovated his home they never helped, they never help with his dog, never help watch the house. They never helped him move, sell the old home, etc. nor have they helped when he’s had two minor injuries that required a couple days of recovery).\n\nFor clarification, never would I ask my dad to terminate his relationship with B&amp;A. He’s holding on to whatever bits of his old life he can, and if that helps him, that’s ok. I’m wondering if AITA for being annoyed at his relationship with A  (and now, by proxy, B).",

      "description": "My brother is a 40-year-old unemployed male who left the mother of his four children for another woman. He has no arrangements to provide for the children, no structured child support, and doesn’t seem have any ambition to work towards a better future for his children.\n\nThe mother of his children has made a lot of mistakes in her past, and was ostracized by my family because of those mistakes. My wife and I recently decided that we want to try and spend more time with our nieces and nephews, and to try to improve their lives if we can. To do this, we decided to build a better relationship with the kids mother. As the full-time caregiver for the kids it makes more sense for us to go to her to schedule time to see the kids, but my brother has been adamant that I get his permission before taking the kids out. He even went as far to say that we should not be doing anything to help the mother of his children in any way.\n\nI fully disagree with his reaction, what I’m doing is for the benefit of the children only. Asking me to get his permission serves only as a way for him to limit any benefit the mother would get from  me spending time with the kids. For example, we are watching the kids today so that she can work an extra shift at her second job. Her picking up an extra shift will be good for the kids, plus instead of being left home alone they can spend the day having fun with my wife and I.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for planning to spend time with my nieces and nephews without asking for my brothers permission?\n\n",

      "description": " \n\nFor some context we started dating twoish years ago, broke up after 8 months because it got really toxic and got back together 5 months after. 8 or so months again after us getting back together I find out, that shes going on dates with her exs behind my back and actively flirting with them. I decide to end it, because I tell her shes blatantly cheating. She denies it, and said that she loves me and what shes doing isn't cheating.\n\nAnyways fast forward to the start of this year we decide to get back together, because she seems a lot more mature and understanding and I'm assuming shes changed for the better. I tell her before we get back together, I need to make sure that she isn't in contact with any of her exs or some guy shes been previously involved with in the past because I don't want to be cheated on again. She hesitates, saying one of the guy she cheated on me with is just a \"friend\" now and is there for her when she needs help emotionally. \n\nFast forward to now, we're together. The problem is, she literally doesn't tell \\*anyone\\* shes with me. She hides me from her friends, family, and etc. I bring this up, and ask her about it. She says that she doesn't want to make it \"official\" because its too much stress on her. I explain to her that her saying that she doesn't want to make it \"official\" is nonsense, because we're literally actively dating and exclusive to each other. She agrees that we literally are together, but then says that us \"labeling\" it would stress her out too much. \n\nToday we're out, and I notice that every time she uses her phone, she faces the other way and hides her phone so I can't see it. I'm all for privacy and what not, but this seems a bit suspicious because I don't know what shes trying to hide from me.  I then bring up that I'm not okay with her going out to bars every weekend with a single friend of hers who for the lack of a better word is a thot. This friend convinces her to excessively drink and drive. I let her know that this makes me feel uncomfortable, because when shes drunk at bars and clubs she might do something that she might regret, and also not to mention the fact that they drink and drive.\n\nShe then goes on a tangent on how I'm not letting her live her life, and that shes constantly has to change who she is for me, and how no matter what she does she'll never be enough for me because I expect too much from a relationship. She then tells me I'm a piece of shit and to leave her alone, because I don't care about her.\n\n  \nAITA for telling her I'm tired of her hiding me and acting single?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR: I ask GF who has previously cheated on me, to stop hiding me from her family and friends and to stop going out to clubs and bars and acting like shes single, and shes now telling me I'm a piece of shit who doesn't care for her and wants her to change the way she lives her life.\\*\\*",

Anyway to my story.\n\nTwo or three years ago I wanted to commission some art for some OC's. An artist contacts me and we start talking about payment and what I wanted. A price is agreed upon and I message him asking if PayPal is what we were using. He sent back that no, we would be using another payment website. I waited a few days to reply, which the two of us had done multiple times, to try and figure out setting up the account for the new site. (I didn't have my banking information at the time, so it was hard to do)\n\nI then get a message saying that he had made a PayPal account that worked and that we could use it to pay. I say okay and pay him 215-220 dollars. Everything is good, I get a rough sketch and told that it will be done in a month.\n\nNot long after, I got a message from him saying that his PayPal won't work and I try to help him. As I'm helping him figure it out, he tells me that he faked the information because he lived in a country that didn't support PayPal. I tell him there's not much I can do, and he gets mad. Tells me that paypal is a shit thing to use. The nll last thing he said was that he'd finish my drawing, but that he would have basically done it for free. \n\nI never got the drawing finished.\n\nTo add, no one of the artists in my post history are the one in the story. I've talked to a few others on here and they're great and even have a drawing commissioned right now.\n\nI also am smarter and will pay half, get a progress picture, and then send the rest.",

I’ve been with my girlfriend for just over a year now, and she is my first ever girlfriend. All that to say I have very very little experience with relationships in general, and even less experience with what is considered “the norm” when it comes to how to act in one.\nI do my best to be very accommodating to her needs, and frequently do things to make her happy, despite those things not being what I would normally enjoy. (E.g. going out recreational shopping, watching tv I wouldn’t normally, etc...) all relatively small stuff to be fair.\nNow, on to the real meat. There have been times recently where she will want to do something to me, which makes me uncomfortable. Now these aren’t huge things, generally they’re very small and temporary, and always cosmetic in nature, but the thought of them makes me massively uncomfortable. Some examples of these things include: a makeover, combing my eyebrows/plucking them, and letting her shave part of my legs. Again, these things are very minor in the grand scheme, being temporary and cosmetic in nature, but they make me very uncomfortable. \nCurrently I’m following the philosophy of, “if I feel uncomfortable about it, then I don’t have to do it.” But, whenever I refuse to let her do what she wants to me, she will get mad at me and stop talking to me completely until she calms down (Which can take quite some time). I tried telling her that I think I shouldn’t have to let her do things to me if I’m uncomfortable, but her response is (and this is a gentle paraphrase) “you should just push through even if you’re uncomfortable, just to make me happy.”\n\nSo I ask: AITA for not letting her do what she wants to me because it makes me uncomfortable?\n\n",

      "description": "I will start this off by saying I'm in no way rich myself. I don't own iPhones and Airpods, I dont own a car etc. I'm a normal college student with an above average weekly budget. My roommates on the other hand have a lot less money per week than me, and because of that they constantly call me an idiot for wasting my money on dumb expensive stuff to the point where I can't even purchase a pringles can without them complaining.   \n\n\nAt first I played along, made jokes about buying em and throwing em in the trash just to piss em off, but now I'm starting to get frustrated myself. Whenever I even think about buying something that costs more than 2-3 dollars they call me out and say that I'm just doing it to brag. I'm not. I'm used to buying expensive stuff with my sister on the daily, so whenever I see a slightly more expensive product I like I don't mind just buying it randomly just to try it out. It's even gotten to the point where I allow em to think they tricked me when calculating how much we paid for items (they think I don't realize I paid 70% of the price and that I'm just bad at counting money when in fact I just don't care enough to tell em to give me my money back).  \n\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for not caring about them and wasting my money in front of them? I already bought em tons of beer and other stuff whenever I could, but they still complain whenever I buy literally anything nowadays.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to move to my husband's hometown after his dad passed away?",
      "description": "We've lived away from his family our entire relationship, to varying degrees. The closest we've ever lived was a 2 hour flight. Generally, we were about a non-direct 4-7 hour flight away. However, about a year ago, due to a career move on my husband's part and a desire to be near my family, we moved across the country. So now we're about a 7-9 hour flight away, non-direct. His family didn't totally freak out at this, but they weren't happy. Lots of passive-aggressive comments from everyone about how we were abandoning them...even though that didn't make sense, since we weren't exactly close to begin with. Still, I was compassionate because they've never been great with change and I knew that the added travel time was a consideration. Six months in, we bought a house and our daughter started preschool in quick succession. We've really settled into the community well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, his dad died about a month ago. It wasn't a totally blindsiding shock because he had heart issues in the past, but the surgery was supposed to be fairly routine, so it was still a shock nonetheless. I don't need to tell you that it's terrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere I'm not sure if I'm an asshole is...my husband thinks we should pack up and move to live near his mom. His sister quit her job and is currently trying to move to the same neighborhood, and he thinks we should follow suit. He said that the house/the job/the location don't matter like family does, and his family needs him now and that he never should have moved so far from them to begin with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really, really, really don't want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my perspective, there are ways he can be there for his family without completely uprooting our lives in the process. He won't necessarily be able to find a job right away. Our daughter is thriving in her preschool. We have a home that barely has any equity on it, that we're still in the middle of sprucing up after buying it. It feels like a horrible idea to turn around and re-sell less than 6 months after purchase, while job searching, while trying to scramble to get our daughter into a preschool in a new state, AND while my husband is emotionally withdrawn from us during his own grieving process. Not to mention that his mom and sister have never been welcoming to me since I've known them, so I'd be an outsider at best, treated as a hostile intruder at worst every single day during a really tumultuous time\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to be respectful and loving during his grieving process, but I'm not willing to completely change everything about our life again right after we finally started feeling settled. He thinks that this is me abandoning his needs (and his family's needs) at their darkest hour, and that I'm severely overestimating the difficulty of the move since he's the only one who has to find a new job and our daughter is so young, and we live in a seller's market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Me (24/f) and my partner (26/m) have been together for around four years now. We own our own home together and have a dog that we jointly take care of but dogs details (vets, microchip etc) are in my name. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFamily History: My partner has always had a rocky relationship with his parents and in particular his mother (now known as MIL) who has been diagnosed with a mental illness. MIL has always been the type to start arguments and disrupt the family and has kicked my partner out in the past over small things e.g. if he hasn't called her back in a short enough timescale. My partner's father (now known as FIL) and brother are both enablers and just try to keep the peace and not call out MIL when she gets out of control. Personally, I don't like waiting for the next time that MIL is going to blow up and would rather go LC but that is up to my partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMain Issue: At a family gathering in February we were all sharing a box of chocolates and I mentioned that the dog was not allowed to have any. As most people know, chocolate can make dogs seriously ill and as it has no part in my dog's diet it shouldn't have even been an issue. A couple of weeks later during yet another argument, my partner said that MIL screamed out that if she wants to feed the dog chocolate she will. Which was not what they were arguing about originally so I'm not sure why she burst out with it but still. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are meant to be going on holiday this autumn and the inlaws were meant to be looking after the dog for about a week. AITA for not wanting the dog to go my inlaws house and put him into kennels instead? My partner said she didn't mean it, but to me that's a direct threat to a member of my family and I don't appreciate it. Whilst I cannot imagine that they are going to try and poison the dog, if this was my child with allergies then I certainly wouldn't be risking it. MIL hasn't apologised either.  ",

      "description": "Throwaway account. TL;DR at the beginning. Will put spoiler tags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: &gt;!My whole family is mad at me for yelling at my cousin after she tried to take over my wedding. I also said my fiancé, whom she is in love with, would never love her. No one is letting me see her and apologize. AITA?!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo make this easier to follow, my fiancé will be Jay, and my cousin will be Lisa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiancé Jay (M24) and I (F24) have been together for 10 years. We have never doubted the other in our relationship ever. We have a great relationship. Lisa (F21) and I have an okay relationship. We did grow up together, but we just never clicked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this happened when she was a senior in high school and Jay and I were 21. I went home for the holidays with Jay to celebrate Christmas with my family. During dinner, I overheard Lisa telling another cousin of ours that she wanted to fuck Jay. I confronted her later, but she said it was a joke. Last year at another Christmas gathering I went to with Jay, she told my aunt she was in love with Jay. I felt bad for her, so I didn't confront her this time. That night, Jay proposed. I saw Lisa crying and running upstairs to the bathroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward to now. Our parents, Jay and I are planning our wedding. I specifically told my family that it was only going to be us 6 planning the wedding, no one else. My aunt argued with me to let Lisa on the planning committee since Lisa wants to be a wedding planner in the future. I eventually agreed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really regret letting her on the committee. Let me list the things she's done so far:\n\n* Wanted to take control of the catering. All the food choices, cake, table covers, napkins, utensils, etc.\n* Wanted to pick out my dress. I said no to her pick, then the started to pout.\n* Wanted to pick out the bridesmaid dresses. She said she wanted this specific dress because it looked good on her. She's not even one of my bridesmaids. \n* Wanted to have a big wedding. I said no since both Jay and I wanted an intimate wedding with only family and close friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week we were having another family gathering, and Lisa would not stop gushing about how perfect the wedding was going to be. Then she listed everything Jay and I picked out saying it was all HER idea. The more lies that came out of her mouth, I got angrier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI snapped and started to yell at her. I said how it wasn't her wedding, it was mine, and I could plan it however I pleased. I also said how he loved me and he would never love her. She burst into tears and ran upstairs to cry. I realized how hurtful the things I said was and went to go apologize, but my family stopped me. They told me I should just let her plan the wedding and let Jay go talk to her. I honestly felt really bad and tried to apologize, but no one would let me. Even Jay thinks I took it too far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So, this was a while ago and all my friends told me that I'm not the asshole, while my family seemed pretty much in consensus that I totally am, so I thought I'd just ask you people.\n\nHere's the story. I decided to celebrate my birthday for the first time in about 5 years. Nothing fancy just some of my closest friends hanging out, playing games, drinking, having some nice food, you get the idea. There were about ten people invited.\n\nI never specifically invited my sister, but we are close enough for her to feel invited without any words (she confirmed this). Her boyfriend was not specifically invited, too. He, on the other hand, was in fact not welcome, as for my part. I hardly knew him, never exactly disliked him, but never really liked him either.\n\nNow, the day before said party, we had some sort of family dinner to celebrate the occasion with my parents. Her boyfriend was there, too, and she acted like it was pretty much self-explanatory that he was coming to my party. At first I did not say anything, partly because I was irritated, partly because I did not want to hurt his feelings. But later, after having thought about it, I texted her, asking whether she would be okay with not bringing him to the party, as I felt like he wouldn't quite fit in. The friends I invited know each other fairly well, for the most part. He would've been the only stranger among people who've known each other for several years, or otherwise have been getting along pretty well.\n\nShe accused me of being selfish and self centered, not considering other peoples feelings, that it was absolutely unacceptable for me not to invite him, that this wasn't about me, but about \"family\" and my feeling comfortable should not be the first thing I am worried about.\n\nI was utterly overwhelmed by her reaction as I didn't expect it at all. We never really talked about it afterwards. The two of them were having their difficulties at the time and they broke up since, so it might have been related to her being stuck in an unfulfilling relationship. I don't know. But her accusations were damn hard, so I thought I'd ask. Am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for abruptly ending this friendship?",
      "description": "In late high school I made friends with a dude one year my senior.  We were friends for a year, year and a half, maybe?  The context of this friendship: I needed a reason to get out of my house and away from my borderline-abusive sister, and he needed some company as his family grew busy and were rarely home.  Though we had little history, our relationship was cathartic, and we'd spew whatever the hell we had on our minds - basically, a lot of unfiltered thinking out loud, without fear of judgement.  From the start, we agreed on one thing: we were both very inexperienced socially, had social anxiety, and in my case the question of high-functioning autism has been raised by several teachers and doctors.  We were to be blunt and clear with each other, ask for clarification when we were confused.  No hidden resentments, no unvoiced objections about the other's rant of the day, etc.  No wondering if that tone was suggestive or not - we would ask, and we would know, and that was comforting to the both of us.\n\nThis also meant there was NO question about what we were.  We were not romantically involved.  Until the event I'll cover in a minute, I didn't think there was confusion even without our agreement to be blunt.  In fact, this was the first non-asexual person to whom I outed myself as asexual.  Whether or not me outing myself is relevant to what happened next, I am unsure.\n\nWe went to the drive-in movies one night.  I didn't have a car or a license, so we went in his car.  We left a little early to avoid the jam on the way out, and he told me he was out of gas.  Like, he was driving on E all day.  This is where shit got weird.\n\nHe wanted to go to the gas station near his house.  His house was WELL out of town, and that gas station was maybe like the tenth on the list of ones closest to us.  It struck me as odd, but I figured he might just have a coupon or membership or some other discount for that station, and since he'd paid for the tickets I didn't say anything about it.  I don't remember if I offered then, but if it were to happen now, I'd offer to pay for the gas (and insist on a closer station).  We get to that gas station and the outside lights are off, but the inside lights are on.  We can't see any other cars in the lot.  The gas station door sits wide open.  He locks me in the car and goes in, and then rushes back out.  There was no cashier, just someone in the back rifling through shelves.  We got the fuck outta there and he said \"There's this back highway by my mom's house, if we go down that for ten minutes we'll find a gas station there.\"\n\nAnd I think, *there's no way in hell we're driving ten more minutes out of town*.  If the gas ran out, we didn't need to be in the middle of nowhere (which - the town itself is just one tier above \"middle of nowhere\").  While I didn't have my license, I did have a learner's permit, and I knew the roads pretty well.  I told him we were better off returning to the drive-in and stopping at a gas station near there.\n\nFrom here, something in my gut was telling me something was *wrong*.  He would not make eye contact with me.  He was very intently focused on the road, which was unlike him.  He really didn't want to go back into town, and he started giving me excuses for it: we could just stop at his one of his parents' houses until one of them came home (in three hours).  We could still go to that other gas station he knew of.  I chalked this up to nerves and insisted no, we need to get out of dark residential areas and onto lit streets, we need to be near town where we have multiple stations and tow options, we need to stay where there's wifi/phone signal, etc., and he agreed we should return to town.\n\n2 minutes down the familiar highway into town, there's an intersection, and despite 1) agreeing to return to town and 2) him taking this route to school every day for the past 2 years, he is in the wrong lane when we pull up to the intersection.  He tells me that there's a cop here and it's too late, he has to head down this other single-lane road that leads out into the prairie.  And he doesn't say \"I'll u-turn\" or \"I'll turn around\", he says \"We'll look down that way for a gas station.\"  He wants to drive down that road.\n\nBut there *is no cop*, and I have no idea where that road goes, and this is where I realize that I might be in trouble.  I am locked in, I am far too small to get the wheel away from him, and nobody knows we are out here.  We weren't supposed to come this way, let alone down a road neither of us was familiar with.  I cannot let him take that road.\n\nI tell him to turn anyway, fuck the cop.  There's nobody else out here at 2 in the morning.  We're not hurting anyone.  And I *yell* this.  Loudly.  Over halfway through the intersection, he turns, and we resume the road back into town.\n\nFrom here, he continues to give excuses to get us off the main road.  \"I don't know this place\", \"this doesn't look familiar\", etc.  This is still the route he would have taken every weekday for the past two years.  It's... literally just take this highway, the only four-lane highway, all the way to the high school, where you turn onto the main street.  It's not a hard route.  I drove it once before this and I knew where we were.  I direct him to a gas station in the middle of town.  It is well-lit, no robbery this time.  While he's filling up I text my sister to tell her we're close to the house (my parents made her stay up and wait for me because last time I was out late, I got locked out of the house - I had no idea if she was actually waiting, though).  When he gets back in the car, even though she hadn't responded yet, I told him she texted me asking where I was and that I told her we were on our way.  My house was also quite a ways out of town, in the other direction - a route he was much less familiar with, but after hearing my sister was up and waiting, he had no more trouble navigating darker, smaller, more confusing streets to get to my house.\n\nOnce I'm safe, I write down what I remember happening for later reference and spend an hour calming down, then go to bed.  And what followed was years of me wondering what the fuck happened.  I cannot stress how bad my gut feeling had been that night.  I am a forgiving person.  I've forgiven and salvaged friendships from worse, believe it or not.  But that night every ounce of trust I had in this dude *evaporated*.  Every instinct I had was screaming *danger, danger*, to the point where I considered grabbing at the wheel anyway and forcing us off the road once we were a little closer to town and someone might stop to check on us.  I almost did, at that isolated intersection with the invisible cop.  Had his weird behavior been because of the robbery (which - I didn't realize until now, actually, that I never saw this robbery; I'm pretty sure he wasn't lying about what he saw inside b/c what I saw outside was also so strange), or had there actually been bad intentions?  If it *was* bad intentions, how far had he planned to go, and what had stopped him until I'd had the chance to contact my sister?  Not long after this happened, I wrote about the incident for a class.  It was a private assignment, just read by the teacher, and I kept the kid's name out of it (this teacher didn't know him, anyway).  The teacher said I was right to trust my gut.  Years after, I have come to the following conclusion, the only one that reconciles the strange events of the night, my gut feeling, and who I knew this dude to be:\n\nHe had no bad intentions.  He didn't go into it with a plan to put hands on me.  I think what he wanted was for us to end up in a house or in the car alone with nothing else to do so he'd have a chance to make a move, set the mood, whatever you'd want to call it.  I don't think he'd have touched me without consent.  But it just... never crossed his mind that locking me in his car and trying to force us first to his house and then into the middle of nowhere without telling me why would be *terrifying*.  It would breach our pact about being blunt, but we did have social anxiety, and maybe he took \"asexual\" to mean \"straight but a little nervous\" and decided a sideways approach was best.  Maybe, once we were parked somewhere, he would have bluntly asked.  But he never got farther than trying to set the stage, because of the robbery and my insistence we head back into town instead.  I am very certain that this is what happened.\n\nHe didn't contact me for two months after that.  He knew he'd done something wrong.  After some time had passed (though - keep in mind I was still processing what happened, hadn't quite reached the above conclusion, still had no idea what he'd intended that night) he asked if I wanted to join him for lunch or something.  I turned him down.  I was terrified of the thought of being alone with him again.  He invited himself to my graduation at the end of the school year, and I told my classmate - \"Don't leave me alone with him.\"  She didn't treat him badly or anything - in fact, they hung out with each other more than I did with either of them - but she followed my request without question.  He rode with me and my mother to the ceremony and we exchanged a few words, but he spoke mostly to my mother.  He was avoiding me, too.\n\nI never addressed him directly about what happened, and that's where I wonder if I'm the asshole.\n\nSee, I was afraid to be alone with him, but this wasn't something I could ask him about in front of others.  I could have texted, but every time I chickened out.  It seemed like a conversation best had face-to-face, like texting would result in misunderstandings and reading with the wrong tone.  If his answer was \"No, I was just nervous,\" I don't think I would have believed him right away.  And if his answer was \"Yes, I wanted to get us alone toge",

      "description": "So I just recently found this subreddit and figured I would share my story from a couple of years ago.\n\nI was in the cinema with some friends watching Super Bowl. Patriots vs Falcons. We had booked our seats several weeks prior in order to get the best possible seats just below the walking area, so we could just jump down instead of having to go all the way around and inconvinience people.\n\nWhen we got there some guy had taken the very center seat and refused to move. So after several minutes of confrontations and threatening with getting the usher he finally moved a couple of seats to the side. But before he could move he \"accidentally\" spilled cola on my seat. Now I spent the first quarter of the game sitting on a soaking wet seat. This was so fucking frustrating and I had a hard time enjoying myself for what is a fun night of tradition with my friends.\n\nPatriots were really far behind and this guy was an annoyance constantly making hand signatures and grunting whenever the refs would make \"a wrong call\". We are roughly down to 5 minutes of the first half and Patriots are behind with 20-25 points and this guy goes out to get some drinks before the halftime show. As he goes away I prepare my revenge.\n\nHe had locked his seat so he could jump down instead of going around. I however had noticed this and decided to unlock his seat so it would go back and forwards whenever you move in the seat. He comes back with a very big cola and as he steps into his seat he gets surprised about it not being locked, he trips and spills his drink all over himself while me, my friends and a good chunk of the cinema burst out laughing.\n\nHe ends up leaving, presumably to go get cleaned up, however he never returned, which I figure was due to his team losing badly.\n\nWell for people who remember Patriots overcame a 25 points deficit and managed to win in the biggest Super Bowl comeback in history and this guy missed it all because he had to spill drinks on a seat he didn't even pay for in the first place. \n\nI ended up feeling like an asshole but at the same time it felt so good after having to sit on a soaking seat for almost 5 hours.",

      "description": "Backstory: I have a friend named Dylan. He came to our school and he plays percussion with me. He has a brother who is basically a legend in our band with how good he is at marimba(he’s even in a professional indoor drumline), so he tries to act a lot like him and he tries to better than everyone else. Normally that wouldn’t really be a problem, but he puts other people down when they can’t play things right, he acts as if he’s the top dog, he’s extremely defiant to our section leader, etc. \n\n\nAnyways going into the story, he dates a girl in our section, and he’s very clingy to her and he freaks out over very little things. His girl is friends with another girl in my section, jasmine, and they’re basically like sisters. Well jasmine is bi, and one night faith fell asleep with her without a shirt on. When Dylan found out, he completely freaked out. Ever since then, he’s hated jasmine. \n\nSo yesterday at lunch before his girl came over to our table, he did like everything he possibly could to make sure jasmine wouldn’t sit with us. I’m good friends with jasmine so I asked him “dude what the hell is your problem with her” and he goes on about how jasmine is a “bad influence to his girlfriend” and so on, even though jasmine is extremely sweet and is nowhere near a bad influence. So I got really frustrated and went off to choir\n\nBefore concert band started(because I have Dylan, his girl, and jasmine all in that period), I pulled jasmine and Dylan’s girlfriend aside, and basically said “look, I don’t know what’s dylan’s problem with jasmine but you guys need to work something out, pr i’ll get our percussion instructor to work it out for you guys. We’re a front ensemble, that means we’re a family, we don’t exclude people who aren’t assholes” and they said they understood and they went to talk to Dylan about it\n\nLater on in concert band i saw Dylan crying his eyes out because his girl was talking to him about it, and today I found out he wants nothing to do with me anymore because i “hate him and am a fake friend” even though I love Dylan(no homo tho) just as much as the rest of the front and I always go to help him whenever he says something is wrong \n\n\nSo what do you guys think, AITA?",

      "description": "TDLR; I didn't ask him his intentions with me sooner &amp; it confused me.\n\n\nI don't know if I'm blowing this out of proportion or what\n\n\nI matched with him on Tinder almost 2 months ago. Tbh I didn't intend to catch any feelings, since I got out of an emotionally abusive relationship a few months prior \nThe first date/hang out went good. We watched a couple movies &amp; cuddled. It ended with us doing the hooptiddy doop. His gma yelled at him saying \"this isn't a motel!\" I automatically thought she meant I was a slut (the reason why is my mom calls my sister one for going to a motel &amp; my anxiety kicked in). He told me she was just in a bad mood. When he dropped me off I told him I had a good time, but he didn't really say anything  until he dmed me. So while we were messaging he asks me questions about if he was a good kisser &amp; stuff. We flirt a little back &amp; forth\n\n\nOnto the 2nd date/hang out, it was bad because my mom continuously texting me made me have a panic attack, which lead to me crying &amp; second guessing through the whole time. I honestly didn't think he'd want to talk to me again, but he told me it was alright, and to just breathe.\n\nthe third time we made cupcakes, everything was going great, we just got done hoopity dooping. Youtube was on when he got a notification from a girl saying something about meeting up. I got a tad bit upset as I didn't think he'd be asking me for a third date if he was talking to someone else. I started to kinda stare at the screen, when he asked me what was wrong, i stayed silent for a bit, cause i was trying to gather my thoughts. I asked him what happened with his ex, then i noticed he became really red &amp; told me \"a bunch of stupid shit\". He then kept talking about her until it was time for me to leave.\n\nMy 21st birthday came around a few weeks later. I stayed the night &amp; we got drunk. We fucked for a good hour or two then went to sleep. It was different because he usually cuddled me really close, this time he kept moving close &amp; away from me, I decided to just sleep on the other side of the bed. At this time, I was starting to think he wasn't actually into me.\n\nAfter that, we tried to find ways to hang out, but on the days we're about to, he stops replying until 1 am, &amp; says he fell asleep. \nAt first, I was okay with it, but then I started noticing every time he was going to tell his gma about it or see if there was gas for the car, he didn't talk to me for the rest of the night, never even let me know he wasn't coming. So I felt stood up. This happened about 5 or 6 times, a couple of those times he didn't talk to me for a day or two after\n\nHe told me he felt lonely &amp; needed company. He also told me it was okay to tell him I miss him, but the third time I did, he skipped over it like nothing happened so I stopped saying it.\n\n\n\nHe stayed a couple nights last week because he was moving. It seemed like he was into me, but too nervous to do anything, at the same time it looked like he was annoyed with me &amp; just there to be there. I was way too anxious &amp; did many stupid things (one was knocking everything down that I touched because I was too shaky, another is trying to change in my tiny closet). There's a little more detail, but I'm too tired to write it out lol.\n\nHe reduced his messages to about 3-4 messages a day when we used to talk back &amp; forth through the day. He even logs right off when he sees me go online, then messages me after I got off.\n\nLast night, I asked him what his intentions were with me &amp; he said \"I just got out of a relationship, but I like hanging out with you.\"\nThis morning after he left me on seen, I decided to block him because it was fucking with my feelings too much. Am I the asshole for doing that?",

We’ve been intimate since month 6 of dating and it was a shock to her since the very first time as I did at one point fall asleep during the point of “climax”. At least 95.5% of the time after intercourse is done I will fall asleep within seconds. The other 4.5% I will actually fill with energy and we will continue our day as normal. Most recently it’s become a problem because she has developed severely terrible insomnia and it makes her incredibly angry when I fall asleep and she is left alone. I haven’t really tried anything to avoid this because I feel like there nothing I can do that will stop me from falling asleep. It also doesn’t help that I’m a fairly heavy sleeper. Most of all the time we do both reach climax, it’s not like I get taken care of and she is left empty handed. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?

      "description": "Ten days ago seven or eight middle-school/early high-school kids came down my street and destroyed a boombox/cd-player in front of my house and ran off. I went out and collected the pieces, but they were long gone.\n\nToday (ten days later) I see the same group. I grab a trash bag and hop in my car (the stereo is still in my car from when I collected the pieces). They are already at the end of the road, a block or so, turning toward an empty field. \n\nI drive down and hold my phone up like I'm recording--but it's a prepaid Samsung and not even on. I roll down my window and tell them I have something for them. They look understandably suspicious. They look like they're about to bolt so I start to get out of the car with the bag, and they run. One of them hesitates. I'm saying stuff like, \"This is the stereo you left in the road, cops are on the way, I don't want to upload this video to Youtube, etc.\" Then he bolts, too. The road doesn't go into the empty field, so I drive my car  into the dead end and see them filtering into the woods on the far side of the field--except the one who ran last. He's hiding behind a tree.\n\nI get out and whistle to him, and he comes out. I keep pretending to video the whole thing. He puts his hands up defensively and tells me he'll take the bag if i leave it on the ground. He looks pretty scared. I tell him I'm not going to do anything to him but put the video on Youtube if he doesn't take the bag. I walk to the car, get the bag, he takes it, I \"film\" him putting it into a dumpster, and leave before he's even done turning around. \n\nAITA? I admit the kid looked scared shitless, but he was big and old enough to know better--and there were like 7 or 8 of them together... I was never physically near them... so I don't feel like I was threatening them. I am about 5'11\" 220 with a big beard, but in a Galfinakis and not Momoa way.",

      "description": "Sadly my Nephews (11M and 12M) get bullied at school and I dont agree with the pacifist education of my brother and his wife that leaded to them being victims at first. I told them to be happy and defend their honour they need to beat the main bully up and get revenge for everything, it would be the best if they destroy his life. Also I bought them a pepper spray so they can defend themself. Now my brother is really angry because this doesnt fit his pacifist believes. I think he is the asshole since he completly ignores the fact that his children get bullied and I just try to help them.",

      "description": "Background: I work downtown in a city with a very large homeless population, across the street from a homeless shelter. Sometimes homeless people come in and use the bathroom, grab a free cup of coffee, etc, and so long as they don't make a scene and aren't bothering customers I don't mind them. \n\nBut then there's one in particular who annoys the ever living shit out of me.\n\nHe is an older gentleman, maybe in his late 50s, early 60s, and he's definitely developmentally disabled. Like he can get around, but he's definitely on the spectrum. He is nice to everyone, but has no sense of social cues, talks to anyone who will speak to him, and interrupts sales conversations with customers. Sometimes, he hangs out in the store for hours, and customers leave because he annoys them. He annoys me too, but I don't say anything to him because I feel bad. Am I the asshole for hating when this guy comes in, and would I be an asshole if I told him to stop coming in because he interrupts business and drives away customers?",

      "description": "My wife and I have been together since high school. Due to her brother being 6 years older, he was already out of the home when I came around, living in a different state, so I saw him infrequently. When my wife and I married, we moved to the same state as BIL and started seeing each other much more often.\n\nIn the 20+ years I've been with my wife, I've learned a lot about her family, not just from what I've observed, but from what she has shared with me. All in all, they're good people, I love them and consider them family, I'd do for them as I would my own biological family. But they have their quirks, the main one being that they do everything possible to make sure they look \"perfect\" to all outsiders - quotes because that word gets used perhaps more than any other in their family. Unfortunately, as my wife has so humbly pointed out to me (and her therapist), this means any indication that something is not perfect triggers insecurities that leads to tension, which of course is always the responsibility of the perfection questioner. This goes pretty deep, so for the sake of brevity, I'll cut to the chase.\n\nMy BIL and I got to know each other fairly well and, despite some differences, were cool with each other. A few years ago, we decide to do a strenuous all day hike together. The day was great, to the point I felt we'd actually gotten closer. With 2 miles left, we're only an hour from our car, my BIL suddenly says something that catches me completely off guard:\n\nWhat is it about my family that you hate some much?\n\nI ask him what the fuck he means and he says he knows I think his parents were shit and that I \"don't know what the fuck I'm talking about,\" then tells a few anecdotal stories that were clearly fed to him by his other sister and mom. Then he said:\n\n&gt; Think what you want, my parents were perfect, they couldn't have done any better.\n\nIt clicked, and I responded:\n\n&gt; That's the issue, you're all so caught up in looking perfect that you fail to see reality. Believe it or not, all the things you just accused me of came from your sister (my wife), not me. I'm the one who has spent hours reminding her how great you all are and how terrible it would be to cut off communication with you. But no, she's perfect, just like all of you, so this is all on me. I'm used to it, your sister spent the first few years of our marriage blaming me for her insecurities, and thankfully, she had the courage to look inside herself. I love you, I love your parents, and I love my wife... despite all of the imperfections.\n\nThe rest of the hike was quiet, then I put on comedy on our 90 minute drive home, which lightened things up a bit. This was a few years ago, and since then, my BIL has kept his distance from me. When I told my wife about the whole incident, she completely sided with me and even said, \"Now imagine being raised with that your whole life.\"\n\nStill, I've waffled between feeling like I did the right thing and feeling like a complete asshole. So, AITA?",

      "description": "Obligatory sorry for bad formatting, I'm on mobile.\n\nOkay for some backstory. I live in a small rural college town in a one bedroom apartment with my \"friend.\" From the very beginning I said I didn't think either of us could ever say that each other couldn't have people over and agreed that we wouldn't have people over at unreasonable times. That being said I also asked that he tell me if he's having people over and he agreed. \n\nRoughly 8 months and one break up later an additional rule is that my ex can under no circumstances be at the apartment. (Things didn't end that bed, just rough emotionally on me, but roommate is still friends with her.) My roommate has since been super weird about people coming over, sometimes telling me, and sometimes not saying anything until he finds out I'm coming home or he tells me right before he knows I'm on my way. This isn't just frustrating because he blatantly ignores my (imho) very simple courtesy request, but also because of the way he sneaks around it. He'll text me to ask when I'm home, like tonight for example. I was on my way back from out of town and was supposed to arrive around six. I got invited to hang out with a friend and I texted my roommate to tell him I'd be back at closer to midnight. As I'm scrolling through my social media feed I see that he has people at the house. I decide it can wait and don't say anything. At 11:30 he asks if I'll be home soon. I reply\n\n\"Probably, btw i really don't apparently you not telling me you're having people over. We've talked about this multiple times\"\n\n*Seen*\n\n\"Seriously it's not that hard to text me, for instance, instead of asking when I'll be back so you'll know whether or not I'll come back while they're there friggin just tell me you're having people over\"\n\n*Seen*\n\nWhen I come home he's on his computer and I have some small talk and start unpacking my stuff. As I set up my desk I notice that my bag of little popper things which was full, is now almost empty. I ask him about it as he pops into a call and he says that they used a few (they used like 3/4 of the bag) I tell him how rude that is and he avoids eye contact and says he'll buy me more. I tell him that's not what it's about it's about the blatantly lack of respect for me. I bring up the having people over and he basically blows me off. I just don't even know what to say to him. He's so apathetic it's extremely frustrating and makes me wonder if I'm being ridiculous. \n\nSorry for being so wordy, looking forward to a verdict.",

      "description": "Hey this happened a while ago, but I am still really thinking about it so here I go.\n\nIt was the summer of 2018, and I got an internship at the science center. I lived in St.Louis and was 16 years old. I worked down on center stage, but on that particular day I was sent to the first floor to test a new exhibit. While he got prepared I was told to go out on the floor. I am not really that great at social situations so I tried to avoid people as much as I could. Encouraged to help where I could, I saw an amazing creation somebody had made (There was an air tunnel where the ball would go through a series of pipes and end up at the end. ) This kid had created an open version where it would shoot from one pipe to another in open air. I was legitimately impressed but saw one flaw. The ball kept getting caught on a pipe and fall. Seeing this kid was struggling, and being an anti-social I went to fix it. Then the mother saw me. And holy shit I got chewed out. She was quiet but SO LOUD at the same time. A lot of people were looking and I had to take it because ; again , anti-social. Plus I have a past of bursting into tears at the smallest things so I was focusing on not embarrassing myself. She said things like \"You should have let my child take care of it!\" and \"You should just go away!\" I was called in a moment later and went on with my day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR : Fixed a project and got chewed out",

      "description": "Since before thanksgiving, I’ve been sick with asthmatic bronchitis and had to quit smoking for my health after 12 years. I got together with my SO in 2014 and he picked up the habit of smoking. Since I’ve been sick, I’ve asked I’m to take my health into consideration and see how the smell and irritant effects me and the asthma part of my sickness. \n\nSince I’ve asked him to stop, I’ve been called inconsiderate and unsupportive in seeing how he feels towards the situation and the effort he puts forward in quitting. But how can I see the effort if he continues to smoke a vape pen and buy cigarettes because “it’s the weekend”. He feels like I step on him every time he lights a cigarette. I’m angry because he didn’t keep a promise he made when buying cigarettes that he would not smoke when I’m home to make it easier for me. Since that false promise, I’ve been salty and disappointed at him. I feel that I can’t properly heal because the irritant is everywhere from his clothes, hair, skin, etc. \n\nI’m tired of having this fight with him, justifying why he gets to smoke. I’m tired of not being able to breathe and waking up at night coughing and having asthma attacks. I can’t even lay with him because the smell is so bad. He does try by taking showers and washing his hands, but i don’t see that as a strong effort. \n\nTL;DR Am I the asshole for making him stop smoking?\n\n",

      "description": "Let’s start by saying I don’t have a lot of friends. I organized a birthday dinner and invited my best friend and her girlfriend (who is also a close friend). I asked them weeks before the date and then confirmed a few days before hand both times they said they were definitely coming. Keep in mind it was my best friends birthday a few weeks before mine, and I made sure I attended a gaming night she hosted in celebration, and bought her a thoughtful gift. \n\nI made a reservation at my favorite restaurant, arrived 15 minutes early on the night to make sure I was there when they arrived. Half an hour passed and I thought it was strange they weren’t there/I hadn’t heard from them. They were both active on Facebook so I messaged them asking when they were coming. They both read my messages and did not respond. I sat at my favorite restaurant eating my favorite food alone on my birthday. I did not hear from them at all regarding the dinner (not to mention they did not even wish me a happy birthday) and then in the following weeks they invite me to a Christmas dinner they’re hosting for a group of friends. Of course after what’s happened I decline the invite and instantly get a message asking why I’m not coming. \n\nI am furious. I am somebody that forgives people for literally everything, and I feel like that’s the reason they’re shocked I haven’t just got over it. As well as anger I can’t help but feel incredibly guilty for declining their invite. Am I being an asshole if I just cut these people off?\n",

In that 6 months I made new friends, which have been good friends of mine since.\n\n When me and my gf got back together, eventually my friends wanted to meet her. On occasion even to this date theyve invited her over with me to have a little party, or even to hang. But only after hanging with them about 3 or 4 times, my gf told me at dinner by ourselves that she doesnt like them, that theyre not nice or theyre bad. She says they act as if they dont want her around. And she said shes never coming to hang out with them again. \n\nBut from my perspective, they have been very kind to her. And she hasnt spent enough time with them for anyone to really be rude to her or push her out. It upset me as it hurt my feelings for my girlfriend to insult my friends. \n\nWe havent said much to eachother these past couple days. Im passive aggressive which I think is a bad thing and i feel bad for not wanting to talk to her too much. Is this something to really make a deal over? ",

      "description": "I’ve been going to the same dog park for about a year, we go to the large dog side because I have a Siberian Husky but he’s on the smaller side, about 45 pounds. He has some regular friends there that he loves to play with.\n\nOne day this guy with a Boxer shows up, and his dog comes in and is very energetic and excited, probably around the same age as my dog, who is a year and a half.\n\nMy dog greets the  Boxer, and they immediately start to play, running around, chasing each other and wrestling. Both the dogs’ tails are wagging, they are both taking turns with who is the instigator of the play, and they take breaks to get water together at the water fountain. All of the common signs that both dogs are enjoying themselves and neither is scared or intimidated or being harmed.\n\nHowever, this other dog owner complains that my dog is bullying his dog. I’m pretty confused, because there is absolutely no bullying going on, although they are energetic. He also mentioned that he started coming here because his dog was getting bullied at another dog park, which made me think that maybe he doesn’t understand how dogs play.\n\nThe next day, he comes in after we’d been there for a little while, and he asked how long we’ve been at the dog park, and then suggests that we should  leave so he can ‘have a turn’. I tell him that this is not a private backyard, and my dog is doing nothing wrong, and we won’t leave. He says he doesn’t like them playing like that because he doesn’t want his dog to look “like a junkyard dog”. \n\nAs our dogs play, I tried to point out to him the common signs that dogs are having fun, as well as the signs that a dog is being harmed or a fight is about to start.\n\nThen he asked me, “what if we were at the park with our kids, and your kid was punching my kid in the face over and over again, would you just say that it’s fine?” I told him, “if my kid was punching your kid I would take action immediately, but if our kids were throwing a ball back-and-forth and having fun and you were panicking thinking that your child was being harmed, I would calmly explain to you what normal play looks like.”\n\nThen my boyfriend brings the dog to the dog park the next day, and has almost exact same encounter with him. But this time, there is another lady there who also seems to be very panicked and high stress, and is interpreting any normal dog play as fighting. According to my boyfriend, some of the other regulars who have the very energetic dogs left because they were so uncomfortable with these people claiming that their dogs were starting fights. He stayed for a little while longer but then both of these dog owners ganged up on him, calling our dog a bully.\n\nThere is always that occasional person who comes in and thinks that it is their private backyard, and wants to throw a ball with their dog but have all the other dogs leave them alone, but this is a new level of ignorance and entitlement.\n\nWe have been hesitant to come back here now just because of the stress, but I don’t think it’s fair that our dog suffers just because other people either don’t understand their dogs or don’t actually want their dogs to socialize and want to treat it like their own private backyard.\n\nTL/DR: A new Boxer and owner started coming to a dog park where we are regulars, the dogs immediately took to each other and are clearly friends and love playing together but he interprets play as aggression (tails are wagging and both dogs come back to each other to start playing) and thinks that I should leave the park when he comes in to let each dog “have their turn “. \n\n",

      "description": "So a little background to start (sorry if this gets rambly) , I'm a 21 year old student working on a degree in marine biology. Where I was living before I had kinda reached my full potential as far as how much I was getting out of the schools there which didn't have many courses for my specific degree and on top of that a shitty home life made me itching to find a change of scenery. Luckily for me at the time my family who lives near the university I was eyeing already knew of my situation and offered to let me stay with them while I took some courses and waited for my in state tuition to kick in to go to that university, seemed like a no brainier to take them up on such a generous deal. Fast forward a little bit to this last August I had trouble getting financial aid for school (probably because I moved states) when they suggested I get a job, I agreed at the time just to have something to do while I wait for the next semester. About a week later they really started pushing for me to find a job telling me that they were still more than happy to take care of the necessities but if I wanted money for hobbies and such I needed a job, made sense to me I was just grateful they were letting me stay there. Ended up getting some jobs semi regularly through a temp agency and I thought everyone was content with that, it was slightly annoying having no permanent place but not too bad. Later they suggested that I start pitching in for gas since I was borrowing their extra vehicle again made sense to me and only seemed fair. After about a month of the temp work all of sudden the opinion of my job started to shift and they became somewhat pushy about me finding consistent work, I was a bit confused by this but didn't faze me too much since I had already been looking for something more permanent. Pretty much the only kind of job I actively avoid is fast food but after a week later all of a sudden they were very pushy about me getting a fast food job, I didn't really want to but again I felt obligated to because of how generous they were being letting me stay. Then the subtle nudges of getting my own car started which kinda threw me off because the only time I use a vehicle if for the job they wanted me to get, I wasn't getting a lot of hours at work so they said I needed to get a full-time job to save for a car citing reasons of driving myself to work (their idea), more freedom (Im a homebody that doesn't really like going out much) and lastly driving myself to school. This kinda drove up my anxiety as I thought of when I tried to balance work and school before (spoiler: didn't work very well and gave me a major bout of depression) because if I have a car that means insurance and gas and maintenance ect;. I didn't really sign up for this especially because I was planning on living on campus and not like a hour and a half away, I'm trying to be grateful but it feels like at this rate I'll be railroaded into balancing work and school. Am I just being a lazy entitled person here only wanting to focus on school?\n\n\nTLDR: Family seemingly went from supportive of me going to school full-time to wanting me to work full-time.",

Then, after we’re both done covering the household budget for the month sometimes I buy stuff just because I can pay for it. When that happens I do so from my personal account. Our budget together covers all our immediate needs, savings for long and short term goals, an emergency fund, travel, and more. All my individual expenses come from my personal funds after expenses. But it’s a major huge deal that I’m so irresponsible with “our” money when I spend a buck from my own account on something she wouldn’t spend on from hers.\n\nAITA for using the money left over in my personal account after we’ve covered our agreed-on  household budget for personal purchases? All I want is agency over the spare change I have left after keeping up my end of what we agreed to when we agreed to do money as a couple.\n\nWhat do you think?\n",

      "description": "(sorry if there’s any formatting issues, this is my first post on reddit, and I’m on mobile.)\nI’m in high school, so obviously, I’m gonna have at least a little anxiety, right? Cus that’s the excuse my mom gives me when I try to talk to her about things that are giving me serious anxiety spikes. But I know it’s not just a teen phase thing, because even my mom herself has told me that I’ve had GAD since early childhood. \nFor the past few months, my mom has been really trying to make more memories with me before I get older and go off to college, since she’s a fairly sentimental woman, and didn’t get that opportunity with my older brother.\nAnd, while I have been doing my best to help her on that matter, the problem that has lead me to posting this is that my mom, especially during the first month or so of doing this, seems to not realize that I need a long time to recharge every day from even just an hour of interaction, assuming the interaction was uncomfortable for me in any way. The reason my mom has this issue is because, while she does try her best to be caring and understanding of my mental situation, she is an extrovert who’s never suffered very long with depression, and has only had to deal with an anxiety disorder of her own since I was in third grade, but by then she’d already developed well-working coping methods for it, and also put herself on medication for it pretty soon after. I am the opposite. I won’t go into it very deeply, but my anxiety, coupled with my extremely introverted nature, both tend to make me not want to interact with people very much at all, especially during times of high stress.\nSo, pretty much, even though my mom has a decent understanding of both introverts and anxiety disorders, she still sometimes can’t seem to fathom how anything could keep me from interacting socially with people at all times of the day. It’s gotten better since I started telling her when I feel like social interaction is going to make me spiral into a panic attack, but she still doesn’t quite seem to get it- and i don’t blame her for it, since she’s not used to people like me.\nBut, anyways, normally this stuff wouldn’t bother me, at least, not on the days where my anxiety or introverted need to crawl under a rock and pretend I don’t exist in the real world from time to time aren’t bugging me too much. However, the problem there is that when I do tell her no, she stands in my doorway and gives me a sad look (like, we’re talking puppy eyes, bottom lip poking out, the whole nine) and sometimes even whines that she Just Wants To Spend Time With Me Before I Goes To College.\nI think part of her not understanding my anxiety is that I’m on medications for it, but I haven’t actually told her that they don’t work that well yet, since without them I can barely function at all.",

      "description": "I (21F) live in a two bedroom apartment with my boyfriend (23M) and my friend (20F). We’ve been living together for almost a year now. My boyfriend and I are by no means dirty, she just cares about cleanliness a lot more than we do. We do our best to keep up cleanliness for her in common areas, always clean the kitchen after use, don’t leave dishes laying around, do the dishes, always pick up our trash, etc. I try to clean the whole place at least once a week as well. Our place always looks nice. \n\nAnyways, our kitchen is one long hallway and at the start is our washer and dryer. The washer dryer is to the left, then there’s some empty space, then to the right is the kitchen. Our room is the farthest from the kitchen, so when we do laundry, we bring out our laundry basket and keep it next to the dryer. And as our laundry is done I put it back in the hamper and bring it back. In the past before we had a hamper that divided into sections, there were times when we did leave our towels in a controlled pile on the floor in front of the washer because we had a clean load in the hamper. But like I said, there’s some empty space before you actually get to the kitchen counters and everything so it’s not like it was IN the kitchen. There’s just no wall separating it from the kitchen. \n\nSo yesterday I was doing laundry and roommate had friends over. I had the hamper right next to the washer and dryer (like always) and was actively doing the laundry. It got to be very late, her friends left, she went to bed, my laundry still wasn’t done, so I just went to bed. I did leave the hamper out there by accident, but everything in it was clean I was just waiting on the last thing in the dryer. I wake up with a very not friendly message about her “opinion on leaving my dirty laundry in the kitchen” (her words). She said it made her uncomfortable having dirty underwear where she prepares food and it stands out to her and her guests. \n\nI’ve been doing the same thing for almost a year and she’s never said anything. She’s definitely left her hamper by the washer and dryer as well. There’s definitely some separation between the kitchen and the washer too which really makes it feel dramatic to me how she says I leave it “in the kitchen”. What do you guys think AITA here? What should I say when I reply to her? ",

      "title": "AITA for telling my wife she needs to be more interesting?",
      "description": "Context: my wife (31) and I (31) have been together for 8 years, is pregnant with our first child (12 weeks, planned), and while we've told family members, we haven't announced to the greater world. Lately we've been talking about when we can announce, and while before she didn't want to because of concerns around early pregnancy complications, she now says she doesn't want to because she is worried she'll be reduced to just being known as \"an incubator\" and that her identity will revolve completely around the baby. Also, we moved ~2000 away from our families, so we don't get to see them often.\n\nI've asked her why this worries her and she said it's because my family only asks about how how big the baby is, or how sick she is. This is definitely true, as we have a big group family text with all 8 of us and it's the main thing they ask about every week. I said, \"What else would you like them to ask you about?\", and she said \"Anything else.\"\n\nShe's one of the most interesting people I've ever met, but she doesn't talk much unless you dig for it. She's an introvert, I'm an extrovert. When we first met I put in almost all of the effort into our relationship. She grew up racing speed boats with her family, went to school for an economics degree but then switched to computer engineering later, loves beer and the same kinds of music I do. Her typical day however is to come home, sit on the couch with our dogs, and watch FRIENDS reruns until it's time for bed. To be absolutely clear, I have no problem with this, but if you ask her \"What's up lately?\", she'll just respond, \"Not much.\"\n\nShe doesn't really participate much in our group texts, and has muted the conversation on her phone because \"otherwise it goes off all day and distracts me from work\". I'm totally fine with it, but I told her it gives off the impression she doesn't want to talk with my side of the family because it's the main way we communicate. She said that if someone wants to talk to her they can call her to talk because she doesn't like texting as much and they can talk to her directly. I told her that while that is true, she's given off the vibe that she wants to be left alone, and that has most likely deterred anyone from doing that.\n\nI told her she's a closed book, with extremely interested chapters and stories of her life inside, but when she refuses to talk to people that's an active decision that then really only gives them her \"cover\" to look at, and right now her \"cover\" is \"pregnant daughter/sister-in-law\". I even flipped it and asked her what she asks our neighbor about when they talk, who has a 1yr old son, and she said \"... how her son is doing...\". I told her that most people aren't going to dig in to find the good stories like I did, and she needs to open up a little bit and put effort into relationships with people if she wants them to get to know her.\n\nAm I the/an asshole?",

      "description": "Apologies because this is long but its been on my mind for a while. For context I suffer from anxiety and I get panic attacks a lot.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had been invited to our friends birthday party. I knew most people going, including this asshole guy (AG for short) I used to be close friends with but no longer spoke to after he started acting like a complete cunt to me and my best friends.\n\nIdk why but I was feeling really anxious from the moment I got to the party. I tried to stick by my bf to make myself feel more comfortable but he kept leaving to mingle and talk to other people at the party. I kept having panic attacks and went to the bathroom to calm down about 7 or 8 times during the night.\n\nThen AG came in and as soon as I heard his voice I freaked. I wanted to leave right at that moment but it was only like half 11.\n\n(I was staying the night at my bfs. I had no way to get to my house so I had to wait until he was good to leave.)\n\nBy about 12 I was super uncomfortable and told my bf I wanted to go. He was a bit upset and said he wanted to stay with his friends. I was thinking at this point that the party would end at around 2am, and that I could definitely hang on til then, but then he said there was some match on at 6am that most of the party were going to stick around to watch. I knew I could hold out for a short while but not until 6am, so he said if I really wanted to leave earlier then we could.\n\nI had an ok time from then, thinking I'd only be staying another hour or 2, until AG came over to me. He was very drunk and wanted to apologise for how he had acted towards me and my friends, and he kept asking if I'd be friends with him again. I was really panicking at this time and it was a highly uncomfortable situation. What made it worse is that he said he was wrong to treat me and my friends how he did, \"except X (one of my best friends), she turned out to be a selfish bitch and she hurt me bad.\"\n\nThis was an all round bad conversation, and I know for a fact that X actually was a really good friend to him and none of us understand why he hates her so much now.\n\nAnyway after he leaves me alone I find my bf and tell him what happened and that I really want to leave. He kinda laughs and doesnt get why Im so uncomfortable even though he knows what happened between me and this dude.\n\nBf is real pissed I want to leave, tries to convince me to stay, even goes so far as to try to get me to take a nap with him on one of the couches. Im super anxious by this point and cant stop crying.\n\nEventually he gets it and we leave. Hes very angry on the walk to his and when he asks if i feel better and i say no he yells at me, \"what was the point of us leaving if you don't even feel better now?\"\n\nWhen we got home he gave me a big hug and told me he loved me and I felt okay again.\n\nIt's been a few weeks and I can't stop replaying what happened. Am i the asshole here for making him leave?",

His character in the movie is definitely on the racist side of the spectrum. I forget what the exact phrase he uses with the couple is but he uses the term \"negro\" very nonchalantly and the couple give him this bemused look. It is a very short scene but it is in there for a reason.\n\nI didn't like it for a number of reasons so I went to the r/movies thread to see what people were saying. Way down at the bottom, perhaps the most downvoted comment, someone wrote this \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a4rric/official_discussion_the_mule_spoilers/eby5l8d/?st=jpycj12x&amp;sh=2a2b43dd\n\nand I took issue with it mainly for the terminology.

      "description": "Obligatory mobile notes, apologies for format. TL;DR at the bottom since this'll require explaining.\n\nMy best friend (22M) has a hero complex. All of his relationships and love interests are women who need 'help' or are dependent in some way, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. His first girlfriend has anger issues and used him as her target; he didn't want to break up with her because she always told him no one else understood her even when she would kick the shit out of him.\n\nBackstory over. His new girlfriend is a little younger than us (20F) and also a bit high on the autism spectrum. I have nothing against him dating someone on the spectrum, but she's completely dependent on him in a way that basically mimics a parental relationship. She tortures his cat because she doesn't understand when animals are upset, and she does the same to our cat when she comes over until I'm forced to yell at her because she doesn't understand when I ask her to stop. He drives her everywhere, and she keeps getting fired from jobs so he supports her financially. I should also mention they've been together about a year now, but she moved in when they had been dating for about 5 months. \n\nShe's recently decided she doesn't like our friends, because they don't pay attention to her, so when we're hanging out and they come over, she usually tells her bf that she's overwhelmed  and makes him take her home, even though he wants to stay, and she knew they were coming and could have stayed home. He essentially never gets to hang out with friends because of this. \n\nShe's making her bf take her along to his favorite band soon, even though he knows she'll get overwhelmed, because she wants to go, and he'll have to skip this thing he loves because she won't let him take someone else instead. Tons of stuff like this happens frequently. \n\nI know this might seem bad of me to judge them, but from the outside looking in, I think that this whole relationship is about him taking care of her, and I know he's giving up his own happiness for her. \n\nI don't want her coming over to my place anymore because she tortures my cat, who gets priority in my life over a woman I don't like, hurts my best friend, and even tries to take my stuff when she can. If I tell him she can't come over, he'll probably never get to come over again because she can't bear to be without him. /s\n\nTL;DR my best friends gf is emotionally immature and draining him, but he doesn't realize it. She spreads her misery to my life and I want to tell him she isn't welcome in my home, and that he deserves better. WIBTA? \n\n",

I hate being around him and he’s over at our place a lot.  \n\nLike if someone asks something he will say “the Jews!” A lot.  For example if I asked who knocked the garbage over he will say “the Jews!”   I know he’s just trying to be funny, but it’s a dumb joke and still racist.  \n\nHe also once just volunteered that he’d never date a black woman.  That he just wasn’t into them.  Like thanks for the info, but no one asked and I really doubt any black women are going to be banging down your door anyways.  \n\nHe’s brought up the border wall several times.  He just keeps repeating the same reasoning for it over and over again.  It’s those nasty Jews again.  Why can’t we have a wall, but Israel can?   Like it’s the same thing at all.  \n\nIt’s a bunch of other little stuff too.  Like sometimes he’ll just randomly say something in the way that slaves used to talk.  I don’t know the word for it, but say shit like “yes masser sir”. \n\nI’ve talked to my bf about it over and over and over again and he refuses to say anything to him about it.  I guess they had a really bad relationship growing up and this is the first time in their lives that they get along well.  That’s all fine and dandy, but that shouldn’t mean he gets a free pass on racism.  It’s probably not my place to call him out on it, but my bf won’t. ",

My parents are Indian, but I was born in the US. \n\nI'm an atheist and so are my parents, we both only follow the religion to honor our ancestors and we place more importance on the language than actual Gods or goddesses (which we don't believe actually exist and are just representations of traits/morals).\n\nThey think that a girl should only like one guy in her entire life, and that she should end up marrying whichever guy she likes. And sex should only be between a husband and her wife. \n\nI do a lot of things that they consider a sin. I curse. I don't think that's a bad thing at all as long as it's used in a tasteful way. I use Reddit. I watch porn. I masturbate. I have crushes. All of these aren't inherently sinful. I'm not going to say a natural process that growing up presents is a sin. That's bullshit.\n\nBut this is a new one for me. I can obviously control whether I have a boyfriend or not and I can control whether I have sex before marriage and whether I sext with my boyfriend. All of these aren't random natural processes. These are my decisions. \n\nSo, is it really a sin to have a boyfriend? I'm feeling so guilty about it. Especially since he's white and his family isn't well off or even functional. He also doesn't want to go to college, he has plans and he's smart but he's found a different path for himself that doesn't involve college. So that's a triple oof. \n\nI obviously really like him. The only reason I feel any doubt is because of this stuff. I feel so fucking guilty for liking and being in a relationship with a white guy who's so below my parents' standards I might as well be a prostitute. I'm so so confused. \n\nMy dad is the one who is very strict about this stuff. If my parents find out they will be heartbroken and will probably commit suicide and then I will have to also. They'll send me to India. They'll say that I'm a slut. But my parents are such good people otherwise. They work so hard for us and they let us buy stuff and go wherever and have whatever.\n\n The only things they expect from me and my sister is, and I quote (roughly translated): \"good character (morality, and chastity) and a great education (good enough to benefit the world and help people)\".\n\nMy dad is a prominent member of our community. So many people know us and are waiting for me especially (I'm the eldest daughter) to mess up so they can be like \"haha look at this righteous holier-than-thou, his daughter ended up marrying a WHITE GUY HAHAHA we KNEW IT\". \n\nFuck.

      "description": "My friend and his wife's baby died in the womb 2 weeks before it was born. It was an absolute tragedy and I can't begin to imagine how difficult it must have been for them. Their friends and family (myself included) have done everything to provide support and condolences. All in all my friends seem to be doing well despite the devastating loss.\n\nIn the weeks since the baby's passing, my friend's wife has posted 3 different photos on Instagram of their dead baby. It looks like the photos were professionally done. When I first saw the photos my gut reaction was negative. I felt it was in poor taste to post photos of the deceased on social media. I understand having the photos taken, but why post them on social media? \n\nI don't know what such a process is like and I'm willing to be wrong. It is not my intention to disparage their loss - no one should ever have to suffer the loss of their child. I am strictly trying to understand why someone would post photos of their dead baby on social media.",

      "description": " \n\nSo the 3k limit is not long enough to give all the details of the situation so I’m gonna try to make it super bare bones.\n\nBasically I’ve been in a long term, long distance relationship with my SO for 5-6 years.  We haven’t seen each other since then.  I also have a friend who I’m incredibly close to who I’ve known longer.  He’s literally just a friend but the way we talk doesn’t really look that way and that’s led to a lot of problems over the years between my SO and I.  A lot of fights.\n\nBecause of those and because I can see his point I’ve toned down how I talk to my friend a lot but I still talk to him because he’s basically one of my closest friends, even if my SO gets upset when he sees his name.\n\nAnyway so last year I was in the same city as my friend for the first time in like forever so I stopped by and we hung out and we took some pictures.  Now I used to be a model, I’m in school now to be a teacher but I used to take “nude suggestive” pictures, basically I may have been nude in them but the pictures never showed anything specifically hence the “suggestive” part.  And I kinda took those pictures with my friend.\n\nWhich my SO saw when they were posted online and he absolutely flipped out at me.  Now - again, this guy is literally just my friend but… we’ve had some “racy” conversations which upset my SO every time and some of them kind of leaded to believe something was going on that wasn’t and then some of them my SO pointed out about the pictures.\n\nOkay so whatever.  I mean to me he’s just my friend and I used to be a model and my friend is working on being a photographer so it literally didn’t mean anything but… I mean okay sure, maybe I shouldn’t have taken them.  Which I admitted to my SO after he accused me of cheating (not the sex but the whole “friendship/”not-friendship”” thing my friend and I have going on and just that being the sort of culmination of the whole situation).\n\nI didn’t cheat.  What I did wasn’t cheating.  But I can see how taking the pictures in a situation like this was probably not the best move so, okay I get it and I admitted it while re-stating that I didn’t cheat.\n\nThe problem is that I could tell he (my SO) was upset about the whole thing and it took me a couple days to kind of see his point, and things were quiet between us until then so things were kind of healing.  But then after I kind of came clean in a way and figured the whole situation was settled after that, he literally flipped out when I started talking to my friend again.  Like he has me blocked and basically is calling me a cheater all over again.\n\nI’m running into the limit again.  Basically AITA for thinking it’s okay to try to curb how I talk to my friend but not stop talking to him all the way.",

I've had to have these really hurtful conversations with him 5 times now (\"I'm feeling very unloved and unwanted, I don't care if I am asleep or in the middle of something, please, come to me when you're horny!) \n\nWe had another one of these conversations this week and since then he's been extra nice, doing more chores around the house, taking me out to dinner, but still hasn't instigated sex.

      "description": "Disclaimer: My parents are very caring and I am very fortunate to have them. They're great cooks and they make me work for things (most of the time it kind of sucks for me but I understand it's totally necessary) and they are very understanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that out of the way, I'd like to talk about one thing that does get on my nerves: My parents only talk to me about grades/missing assignments/other school stuff, scout stuff I need to do, and my future (as in colleges I want to visit or how I should get a second job). Here is some information that's probably relevant:\n\n\\- I'm a A/B student\n\n\\- I'm involved in many activities, such as spring play, scouts bsa, and robotics\n\n\\- I'm a junior in high school\n\n\\- Sometimes teachers are a bit slow on putting grades in the gradebook. This means sometimes assignments will show up as missing even though I turned them in.\n\n\\- I work as a camp counselor for a cub scout camp. It's an amazing job but it doesn't pay well, so I'm looking for a second one once I get my driver's license.\n\n\\- I am working on getting my driver's license. We've had to reschedule twice due to scheduling conflicts.\n\n\\- My parents need to be told things multiple times to make them understand. For example, they would bring up a missing assignment that was turned in multiple times.\n\nAll of this has been making me frustrated, so when I finally said something about it I made sure to be civil, but my parents ended up getting pretty mad. I appreciate them caring about my future, but I'd like to talk about... you know, not that for a little bit too.\n\nSo do my parents need to lay off a little or am I just dumb?",

Also, please avoid risky subjects here (politics, religion, etc). Keep it calm. Don't be gross or edgy. 2. Please avoid insulting others or inciting aggression towards users here. Be kind. This server is for everyone, no matter their gender, religion, background, or race.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a regular member of this server, that being a revival of a game that didn't receive any support from the developer. The staff members of the server were picked rather haphazardly, as they were usually just picked from how well they were known in the original game, not how good they would be as a staff member.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe people in this server constantly call each other the n-word and f-word in a seemingly joking way, including some of the staff members. From here forward, I will be calling some staff members relevant to the story as S1, S2, CM (Community Manager) and O (owner).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go to S1 in DMs moderately concerned about the other members constant usage of slurs, and while I'm not specifically offended by it, I am worried it would give the community a generally \"toxic\" reputation. S1 tells me that most people generally ignore the rules. S1 is one of the few staff members who would most likely be considered a \"good\" staff member, and they say if other people of the same rank permit it, he is fine with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater, I go to O in DMs expressing similar concern, who has already been aware of the issue and has told people to stop doing it, yet these have fallen on deaf ears a few days after their announcement. I talk to CM about the issue and present what O said, and CM says that they agree with my viewpoint, yet that they would \"come off as pissy\" if they started to truly enforce it. I advise CM to talk to the other staff about the issue, which I presume they follow suit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS2 is a staff member that was given their position because of their haphazard decisions. S2 was responsible for \\~13% of all usage of the N-word in the entire server, S2, after hearing the discussion that CM introduced to the staff room, decides to *post in announcements* about who sent these concerns, that being me, and basically publicly ridicule my concerns. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should mention that previously I have been in a fair share of controversy regarding this server, and although most people ignored them after a while, S2 has been basically the only person who has clinged on to the drama. S2 has never liked me, and has been the catalyst for lots of this controversy (digging up events from the past to make decisions meant to give me some sort of disadvantage in game.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole for telling staff members of a server to enforce their rules more strictly?",

WTF. She argued that because we make more money we should treat each other proportionally so I was being CHEAP and not showing her how much I care.\n\nOk, yes we are definitely high income earners (we are both physicians, we each made 360k pretax in 2018). This of course is a huge jump from 2016 when we both finished our ER residencies earning 50k a yr each.\n\nBut here is the thing. I grew up in a low middle class household. I like to think I am frugal in general. The value of each dollar in my eyes today is the same as it was 7 years ago when I was a broke ass med student. I just CANNOT fathom throwing away tens of thousands of dollars on a watch or jewelry. I love my wife and I would rather dump that $$$ into our student loans or car payments or mortgage or invest in stocks, and just receive no presents whatsoever, because doing any of that helps secure our financial future. My wife isn’t the best with money and used to carry credit card balances for years until we married. And despite my view that any car other than a japanese econobox, is a waste of money she still went ahead and got herself a Porsche macan when we started our attending salary jobs 2 years ago. Which we still have monthly payments of 1300 for another three years! I don’t know am I just way off base here and being the asshole? God I just can’t get over her massive waste of money and how this year’s anniversary is going to be nothing but bad memories in the future",

      "description": "So this story is a bit twisted- and in the end, I'm an uninvolved bystander who involved herself out of spite. I get it. Asshole reasons. I already know I'm the asshole in this sense... No regrets still... But I am curious about what people would think of my actions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently my friends took in a roommate, charging him cheap rent for a nice place near work. The man took up the deal because he wanted to save money for his wedding. Great. Friends helping another friend out.\n\nFor the first several months this roommate failed to make payments, the rent was piling up and he wasn't paying because of financial reasons. I'm not clear on how many months this went on because my friend was vague in telling me- all I know is that he didn't pay right away and it made them nervous he never would. \n\nDuring this time, roommate gets married to a woman several hundred miles away- both of them work and live separately. When he comes back from his wedding, a new face starts showing up at my friends' house. It's a girl he works with, one whom he claims at first is just a friend- though in later months consistently proves that she is far more than just a friend. How it was explained to me- was that he claimed him and his new wife were in an open relationship. We were all skeptical. \n\nSo the girlfriend begins living at their house, using their appliances and what not, and staying there in their home when no one else is. The two of them never offer to pay up more for the rent. Over the summer the cooling and water bills rose in excess- it was getting to be a hindrance to have so many people (especially when their rent was a flat rate that didn't include utilities). To top it off, my friends soon found out they were pregnant and expecting in January- eventually, they were able to push hard enough to get the man to pay up on his accrued rent due- which he did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from the girl living at the house scotch-free, the only issues I heard of was that the roommate constantly tried to change the thermostat down without asking, ate their food and left tons of dirty dishes in the sink. \n\nWith the coming of the baby, however, the near eight months that my friends were dealing with these people had finally come to an end. They moved out with the roommate telling my friends how grateful he was and how much money he was able to save up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, we are all at work one night and a different guy that my friends used to the work with was chatting us away. Somehow the topic of the old roommate comes up- he asks if he still lived at my friend's house. My friend replied \"no\", and asked why. \n\nApparently, the old roommate was shit talking them behind their backs, saying that he made my friends their bitch and negotiated a low rent at their house and ultimately used them. It was clear disrespect, it hurt them and pissed all of us off. \n\nI brought it up long in the past that someone should tell his wife on FB or something he was a possible cheater, but my friends were too afraid to because their life as new parents was soon to begin and they didn't want to ruin a marriage. So I made a FB and sent her a message myself just asking if they were in an open relationship as he claimed they were and if she was aware he had a girlfriend here. Nothing else, just asking. \n\nI've been cheated on before by a person who claimed the SAME thing. If it were me, I'd want to know... But after I sent the message I'm worried if I made a stupid move. I know revenge does nothing for my friends but I'm petty and annoyed they've been essentially walked on by that guy. They've filled me in on these details since the beginning. I've met this guy and he's done little to prove he's honest or nice. \n\nIf they are in an open relationship- then good, whatever, but if they weren't, I may have possibly ruined a new marriage between two people I hardly know. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Context here is that I'm miserable.  \n\nHe doesn't care to hear it, doesn't care to address it, fix it, or do anything about it. Am committed to our marriage and cheating isn't an option but I'm incredibly lonely and don't know how to fix it alone.  So, in the meantime I get a thrill that this guy at work has a crush on me and that apprently I'm not invisible.  I did shut him down and inform him that I'm married but I still daydream about cheating and entertaining the flirtations because it's nice to get some affirmation when you've been feeling so shitty for so long.  Shut the guy down yesterday and was saddened that my tiny source of affirmation seems to be gone since today he's avoiding me and that's what I had to do because daydreaming about entertaining it is different then actually doing so so I shot him down and am kinda sad now.\n\nAm I such an asshole that I kind of needed that attention right now?",

I don’t. \n\nI could see myself wanting to have a dinner with my parents, siblings, and grandparents. I have a few friends that I’ll hang out with sometime before I go. And I’ll make it over to my in-laws house too. \n\nThe people that seem to be upset that I’m leaving are the people that I see at family parties once or twice a year, and the friends I haven’t seen since leaving school. I don’t see the point in having a party where I’ll see people I don’t see in my everyday life, or even often in my life at all. It feels superficial and weird to me. \n\nWhen I told my sister this, she gave me a look that made it seem like I was being irrational and then gave me an, “okay, if that’s how you feel.” \n\nMy husband said something about how I should make my rounds to say goodbye to people too, and there are people that I will do this with, but I don’t see the need to have a going away party to invite a bunch of people who I already live my life without seeing, or honestly of making it a big deal of leaving at all.\n\nIs this one of those things where you’re supposed to just suck it up and do for the people around you?

      "description": "Okay, so let me catch y’all up to speed. My girlfriend and her friends deal with a person in their dorm who is by all means a nuisance. He harasses people, bullies people, and is a general asshole to my girlfriends friends. As for my girlfriend, he’s very nice and regularly asks her on dates. I don’t really care about him because she likes the guy less than me. For me it’s all coming to a head because he’s hurting her friends (emotionally) and I’m honestly tired of her having to deal with him and not respecting her being in a relationship. \n\nNow a few months ago one day in a campus building he exposed himself to a group of 5 or so including my girlfriend and her friends. This is towards the end of a long list of things he should be punished for, but I digress. This is a felony charge he could face where I live. Would I be the asshole if I told him to go bother another group of people? I feel like I shouldn’t report it myself to the police because it’s not my place, but the guy needs a reality check. I’m really fed up with the shit I hear about them having to deal with, so would be out of line to remind him police involvement could be taken? I feel like this thinly veiled threat may be out of line because it’s hollow (at least on my part) and I’d only be threatening for personal benefit rather than reporting the crime for the sake of reporting a crime.",

I tried to help her by getting her a flight home (in Los Angeles) so bought her a one way to lax. It had a 1 hour layover in SF and she called me from SF saying I’m an asshole for not getting her a direct flight, freaking out cause she needed a cigarette. She pretty much told me I’m a cheap piece of shit and she’s gonna miss her flight and just stay there by herself( all cause she’s fiending for a cig). I smoke as well, so I get it sucks not being able to smoke but I wouldn’t freak out this bad. The flight was $84 but a direct one was like $200 so yeah I kinda didn’t wanna spend that and didn’t think a layover was that big a deal. She’s supper pissed off and crying and I feel a bit bad, but honestly I don’t see it as that crazy. All in all the total flight time is 4 hours, that’s not super crazy imo. If anything I’m a bit worried about her being there but what can I do? I kinda feel like I should call her brother, but when I told her I was she freaked out even worse. I’m at a bit of a loss.\n\nI dunno. Am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "My Fiancee (26F) and I (26M) have been together for 7+ years. 3+ of which we've been engaged. Ive been an off and on pot smoker since 18, and until recently (2017ish) I barely drank alcohol. Myself: I dropped out of highschool in grade 12, couple years later got my college diploma, and then got my GED to patch up old wounds in my life path. Ive smoked my fair share of pot, and have had many cold turkey quits lasting months/years. January, 2017 I began smoking cigs which quickly went from 2-3 smokes a day to over a pack a day. Quit that and began vaping to ween off tobacco. Last year December I quit vaping. I never cared for booze, but recently its been getting to the point where I recognize and tell myself i need to stop, but buy more anyway. The Fiancee: School Girl, High Grades, Never really drank until I started drinking recently, never touched/smoked/eaten etc. any type of drug and still refuses to. I will never force her, matter of fact, im proud of her.\n\nOver the 7 years we've been together, we have had our ups and downs but overall its been outstanding, love the girl to death. However, every time I decide to smoke a little or get back into smoking she gets pissy with me saying I change and im not the same person after I start smoking again. So I assured her that if I start up again, I would take note on my behavior and if she notices a major change I want her to be honest and tell me so I can see it for myself; Ive been in constant disbelief of me having any personality, behavior or attitude change whilst using marijuana. Ive made myself immediately do house chores after smoking which has become a small habit now, which she seems to love, since my productivity at home has increased. \n\nWith that being said, after a small argument we had about me smoking, and me insisting she allow me to make my own decisions and not try to give me strict guidelines to follow (no smoking/drinking/going out) I found myself fist deep in drywall... yeah, I punched my wall... and this was something I used to do as an adolescent after being abused by a step father. It has become a natural thing for me to swing at a wall when mad or angry. Heres the catch.. during my sober spurts, ive never gotten mad to the point of hitting something. \n\nAfter talking to my Fiancee, she said something that totally shredded me apart, \"just because you arent hitting me, hitting the wall and getting this mad is subjecting me to abuse still, just not physical.\"\n\nFurthermore, I was raised in a very abusing setting, step dad abused me quite often and disciplinary measures for me doing dumb childlike shit were usually excessive. I feel like ive gained some terrible traits being raised in said family, and that freaks me out. \n\nI dont feel like an asshole for making my own decisions to do things but I absolutely feel like the asshole for subjecting her to my attitude and behavioral changes that she has yet to comment on.\n\nThis is a burner incase anyone is wondering.

We're all different people now, and when I call to check in there's always new drama and older bro is mad at younger bro while mom is mad at sister, etc, etc, blah, blah. I don't fight with them because I'm not there enough to get on each other's nerves.\n\nI love my family, but I have no interest in moving closer to them.

I think there were times she chose to hang out with me rather than Jake. I also started noticing Jake kind of giving me a mean look. A few days later, Jake and Sarah had a big fight and they wouldnt talk anymore like all the friendship they had built just vanished.\n\n I just have this feeling that I ruined their friendship because I started hanging with her. I just feel so bad for both of them because they were really close and basically inseparable and until now, they would just avoid each other and would never talk to each other.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My significant other has this pair of shorts that he loves because they are stretchy and comfortable. The problem is, they have a huge hole above one knee. Sometimes you can even see his boxers through the hole. Because of the material these shorts are made of, the hole is obviously not meant to be there and in no way looks fashionable. I don't mind if he wears these shorts around the house or to work out around his buddies, but I prefer that he not wear them out in public. He knows how much I dislike these shorts (and some of his other clothes that are in similar states of disrepair). \n\nI should note that he has plenty of other clothes that do not have holes. He simply refuses to get rid of any clothes that have holes because he thinks they're comfortable. I have tried mending his clothes before, but he is generally not careful with his clothes, so he always rips them again. \n\nI grew up in a culture where it was the women's job to make sure her family looked presentable in public; if they weren't, then people looked down on the woman for not taking care of her family. I know this is a sexist and outdated view, but it still affects me. My SO and I have had multiple conversations about this topic and he knows I'm sensitive about it. Growing up, he was allowed to wear whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. He didn't go to formal events and didn't own a suit until he graduated high school. To say the least, he does not have a good grasp of what is appropriate to wear and when (and he's actually sensitive about it sometimes). A few years into our relationship, he agreed to not wear dirty or holey clothes in public and to let me help pick out his outfits for formal events. \n\nHe and I just took a trip to a big name retail store in a nice part of our city to pick up some odds and ends. I noticed that he was wearing these shorts earlier in the day at home but thought he had changed into a pair of shorts that look very similar but don't have any holes. It was also dark outside when we went to the store, and the shorts are black. Turns out, he wore the shorts out in public. His other clothes were appropriate, and I didn't actually notice until we were almost done shopping. I didn't say anything in the momemt so as not to embarrass him in public. \n\nWhen we were home, I asked him if he knew he was wearing the shorts with a hole. He said he didn't notice until we got to the store. Then he asked if I was embarrassed that he went out in those pants, and I said yes. He got upset and refused to talk to me because he said doesn't want to interact with someone who is embarrassed by him for his clothes.\n\nAITA for being embarrassed about his clothing choice? ",

      "description": "Happened 30 minutes ago. I went to buy food at a certain fast food restaurant. The location of the fast food place is on a street filled with bars. And it just so happened that a local university was doing a bar hop. There were groups and groups of students all wearing a specific t-shirt of various colors with most of them having stuff written on them with a sharpie. While I was waiting in-line I noticed that there was a girl who, in my opinion, had a pretty funny phrase written on the back right shoulder of her shirt. I thought it was funny and wanted to take a photo of it. Went to pull out my phone, camera froze on a still of her whole body when i wanted to zoom in on her shoulder. Girl behind me accuses me of trying to take a photo of the girl's ass (cause she saw my frozen phone) in front of me and causes a scene. I try to explain myself but damage is already done and I'm accused of sexual harassment. AITA?",

It felt as though he lost his personality, and started making just jokes about things that just are gruesome and downright weird. He would also just barge into conversations (no matter what we were talking about) and change the subject entirely.\n\nJames, Ben and I started to drift away from him, purposefully ignoring him if we had the chance, and just up until recently, everything was fine. \n\nFast Forward a few more days, to my Industrial Tech class.

Naturally, I turned around and pushed him away, asking, “What the hell is wrong with you?” \n\nI am now literally not talking to him at all.

We've been officially together for 3 years and she was really a great help to me.\n\nFfw to 4 months ago, she broke up with me and told me that we need to let go of each other because religion will tear us apart in the end (we're from different religions and deeply religious families). I accepted that and I did my best to move on but we still talk every once in a while.\n\nFfw to present, she said that being with me was taking a toll on her mental state. She told me that she has cried a lot of nights when we were still dating, unbeknownst to me. She didn't know how to handle the problems I share to her and I think she blames me for her being depressed too.\n\nI noticed that she doesn't want to call me at night anymore(we used to call at night) and I wasn't sure if this was because she doesn't like talking to me cause it'll ruin her mood or if she's moved on already. Now she's interested in another guy (though I don't mind that, I respect her decisions)\n\nI'm wondering if me sharing my depressing thoughts was not a good thing and maybe I should've just kept them to myself.",

      "description": "So this is kind of different from what I see on here and it mostly pertains to people who are Greek (Fraternities and sororities). However, the main idea is easy to understand so anyone is welcome to answer. But real quick...\n\nPdad - Sorority girls tend to ask Frat guys if they would want to be their Pdad. Its usually asked of someone you have a platonic relationship with and have come to be very close to as a friend and mentor. (can also have Pmoms).\n\nBig Bro - A brother from your Fraternity that is meant to guide you in life, academics and the ways the Frat is run. \n\nPsibling - Someone who shares the same PDad/Mom as you or someone who has asked your Big Bro or Big sis to be their PDad/Mom. \n\n(These terms can be different depending on the organization but this is how it works in mine.)\n\nSo recently my fraternity went to hang out with a sorority. I recently joined so I didn't know the sorority girls at all so it was mostly me getting to know people. After an hour or so I was sitting on the couch talking when one girl came over and she asked \"How would you feel about having a Psibling?\". I wasn't sure what to say and I didn't know what that was so I replied \"What is a Psibling?\". She explained that she would be asking my Big Bro to be her Pdad so we would become my Psiblings. I personally didn't care, I already knew they were close and that the relationship they had was platonic. So I wasn't sure what she wanted me to say, \"Do you want my blessing or something? I mean congrats but I'm not sure what to say.\" I don't know if I came off sounding like a jerk but I honestly don't care. She's going to ask him regardless and what he does is his business. On top of that, I just met her that day so I'm not really sure what to do besides saying congrats and moving on. \n\nNow I'm thinking I might have come off a bit mean since afterwards she was giving me attitude for the rest of the night and just blatantly ignored me at a party while talking to my brothers.  If it were just a random sorority girl, I wouldn't really care, but since my Big Bro is probably saying yes, I'll probably see her a lot more at parties and events. I don't really  care if we're friends, but I wouldn't mind if we're at least on speaking terms so we avoid any awkward moments and for my Big Bro's sake. \n\nBut what do you think Reddit? ",

      "description": "I am 18, have just begun college. I study computer science and got to work at a tech store. I had honestly loved it there for the short time I worked there. One thing to note was that except me, every person who worked in the store was a woman. Many of them were really friendly to me, and I think they are geniunely nice. My manager , who is in her early 50s, was definitely not nice though, and made really inappropriate comments.. Like remarking that I wore nice tight pants once in a suggestive way,but I loved the job so thought to leave it at that, I convinced 2 of the women who heard it to not let the problem become bigger. \n\n\nDuring my time there, I kept seeing instances of disabled and elderly people having to travel an excruciatingly long distance for them, sometimes even a hundred feet or so during busy days,so I told my manager that it might be better if we just kept the woman’s parking a couple of metres back instead of it being in front of the store, and on weekdays keep it as it is. I suggested this to her extremely politely, and also gave her a sheet with approval from all the other staff for this idea, as long as the parking was only pushed back a couple of feet. I also promised I would look out for women at night when they make their way to the car.\n\nBut my manager got really, really angry. Saying this was sexist and narrow minded and I should be ashamed, that she didn’t expect this from me etc. I just apologised and continued working. I then got to know that I had been fired the next day. I was honestly shocked, like everyone was. I was the most knowledgeable person about tech stuff there. I am not saying this because I believe I am superior, but my father is a tech journalist and I grew up in a household where I had a fascination for these things from a very young age. I could answer questions the other staff couldn’t, so if a person wanted a very specific phone( for example, I would recommend them to wait for the google pixel lite if they wanted a good camera on a budget or the limited edition Nokia 9, and just buy the pixel 3 if they didn’t have any issue with the money etc. I can go on and on with the specifications and features), they would be redirected to me. I can confidently say I was one of the best, and firing me for something that I talked about really politely and apologised for seems insane to me. \n\nI have honestly been really upset about this, that job meant a lot to me and it was loads of fun. The company was excellent, the store in itself was nice, I got to check out the phones when they had arrived etc. \nI recently received news that the owner was going to visit our store in a while, and a few of my ex employees told me to talk about the matter to him, and that they would support me too.\n\nWas I the asshole? And will I be the asshole if I talk to the owner about this?\n\nThanks a lot for taking your time and replying. I am honestly a very open person, criticism is fine too! I just want the truth, thanks!",

      "description": "For this one, I need to start a ways back. My first girlfriend was in middle school, 8th grade. It was the typical middle school romance, her coming up to me and asking \"Will you be my boyfriend?\" and me agreeing while having no idea what having a girlfriend entailed. Needless to say, it  didn't last long before she broke up with me. I wasn't at all hurt about it.  \n\n\nSkip ahead to high school. We developed a close friendship where we spent a lot of time together and she often called me. I wasn't the best friend, but who is in high school? I was a bit of an asshole, even giving her the nickname \"Penguin\" because of how she waddled while she walked. She adopted the nickname and loved it and I never told her the real reason for it. But still, I listened every time she called me about the boys she was interested in, I listened every time she broke up with a boyfriend and cried about being single, and I even dealt with her asking me during these periods, \"Do you think we'll ever get back together\", to which I replied, \"No.\"  \n\n\nThis went on for many, many years. I went off to University and she still called me about the same problems and still asked the same question. Finally, after listening to her despair about being single forever for the 30th time, I broke. I told her \"\\[Name\\], do you enjoy being single?\", she said \"of course not\", and I popped back with \"Well, you better get used to it if you keep doing this shit.\" Silence ensued, then I (or maybe she) hung up. I have to add in the detail that I was slightly intoxicated when this happened.  \n\n\nThe calling stopped and from what I heard, she actually started having some meaningful relationships to the point where now she's engaged. I ruined a friendship, but a part of me says that it was worth it and I was helping a friend. AITA?",

      "description": "For context, my workplace is a very small (about 100ft^2 or ~9.3m^2) outbuilding, and only accommodates 2 people (three is stretching it) people at a time. We only have about 5 people who work throughout the week, so it’s a very small department both in terms of space and people.\n\nRecently I have been absolutely disgusted by the way my coworkers leave our space. Food in boxes and bags left for weeks at a time until it expires. Drinks untouched after a few swallows. Fresh fruit left rotting in the back room. And that’s just the uneaten stuff. I think I’m the only one who sweeps or mops spills off the floor and cleans off the counters and desk.\n\nI have been asking nicely for everyone to clean up after themselves and to not leave food in the building unless they really need to do so (one person is diabetic) for over six months. Yet everything I listed before was still a regular occurrence. And so I finally broke. I’m tired of cleaning up other people’s messes when they are too lazy to clean up after themselves after repeatedly being asked to do so.\n\nSo I instituted a new food policy. If you leave food in the building after you leave and it is unopened, it will be put on a shelf for you to collect. If it hasn’t been collected or opened by the end of the week, it’s thrown out. If open food or fresh fruit is left behind, it gets thrown out the next day. The same goes for drinks.\n\nI think this is fair, but everyone who works here is saying this is way too harsh, and I am out of line. AITA here?",

      "description": "So my sister (28f) and I (24f) haven’t had the best relationship, a little over a year ago we just started speaking... after barely talking for four years\n\nShe has a masters and is Pursuing a career in therapy. I never completed college and work 2 retail jobs.\n\nI really like my work. My coworkers and I often bond over the BS thrown at us, but it still wears on me. Because of personal reasons I do not have the resources to go back to school.\n\nWhenever I mention my job to my sister (the good and the bad) she starts bringing up various reasons why I should go back to school, or at the very least, get a better job. \n\nI feel like she’s delusional, I can’t just have work experience magically appear on my resume and Again I’ve been with both jobs for a while I’ve shown a lot of dedication and management skills to retail jobs. I honestly wouldn’t mind calling myself a manager of a Starbucks one day.\n\nBack to my sister, she’s getting married next month and since I live closer then our younger sister I’ll be the only sibling attending. Because of this I’m in the wedding party and will be helping a lot with the wedding. I’ve also been a person my sister has gone to to bitch about various elements that aren’t coming together smoothly. But I always try to calm her down and remind her it’ll be a great night\n\nAnyways, today I was showing pictures to my sister of dresses I wanted to wear to the wedding. The one I like the most was a little pricey so I told her it was only worth it if she loved it too. She starts to go off on how there are jobs out there starting at 12/hrs\n\nI lost my mind, I told her I wasn’t going to go to the wedding if she kept this up because it’s really making me uncomfortable, my rant ended in me saying I’m not a client, I’m her sister.\n\nShe replied by saying I should stop treating her like a client, and I’m just out of loss for words because I felt like as sisters I should be able to just complain and just have her assurance that it’s a bad day, not to ditch the whole job.",

      "title": "AITA for texting my landlord about my housemates?",
      "description": "Sorry for the essay. \nTo keep anonymous I will keep several details different but basically I live in a very old duplex with two people that live above me on the second floor.  Now first off I will say that I completely understand that a certain amount of noise from your neighbors is unavoidable and not their fault, I have lived in several apartments and I understand that people cannot help that the building makes noise when they walk around and do daily tasks.  However it has become imo, really excessive.  I have a large dog and so do they.   When my Landlord told me that two people were moving upstairs with the dog, she assured me it was part of their lease to put carpeting down for the dog and to please let her know if there were any issues.  Trying to be nice I texted them and let them know they are welcome to share the dog poop in outside as long as they do their part in taking it to the garbage etc.  Not one time have they taken it out or changed the bag, but they use it twice daily for his poop, I do it every week.  We share laundry, and when they do their laundry they tend to leave it in for a minimum of 48 hours until I text them that I have to do laundry as well.  I am the only one who ever cleans the back staircase that we share.  These are all issues I could easily ignore if not for the noise.  I am aware that I make noise, and my dog barks, and my TV is turned up too loud.  But most of the time my dog is barking at the ceiling wondering what the fuck is going on, and my TV is turned too loud to try to drown out the noise so that I can get some fucking sleep sometimes.  Let’s get to the noise.  \n\nTheir dog has a certain habit of chewing a bone directly on the wood floor which makes my ceiling fans shake, my walls shake, is so unbearably loud that my dog will actually start to shake and cry because it sounds like somebody is breaking in through the ceiling.  I have texted them about this no less than four separate times, it continues to be a daily issue.  In addition to that they are constantly slamming furniture around, throwing things at the ground, throwing the ball across the apartment and there are 90 pound dog runs around jumping and playing for hours at a time( we have a fenced in yard).   They are yelling frequently.  I get about 2 to 3 hours of sleep a night before work and I’m tired and crabby all the time. The noise is CONSTANT and way louder than somebody just walking around having a normal day.  I’m starting to feel like I’m losing my fucking mind, so I finally texted my landlord and asked if I could and my lease early and move somewhere else.  She said no and asked me why I wanted to leave because she knows I love my apartment and I told her only about the noise and laundry issue.  I told her I would prefer for her to not contact them yet as I would like to trade a few more times for them to resolve it so we can remain friendly however she was angry because apparently it was part of their lease to put rugs down for their dog and they clearly have not so she insisted on emailing them And told me if I have any further issues with noise or the laundry to contact her again.  \n\nI now feel really awkward and I’m nervous seeing these people around, and I do feel badly about contacting the landlord but at the same time my quality-of-life has gone down significantly since they moved in, I pay a lot of money to live here and I can’t sleep or rest ever and I have to do my laundry on their schedule of when I can get them to fucking finish theirs. \n\nI feel like I was a dick, I am a 27-year-old person acting like a grandmother complaining about noise but I can’t sleep and I’m going nuts!  I feel like I pay to live here as well and I shouldn’t have to be miserable all the time because they act like they live in their own house.  I did not tell my landlord that they smoke weed constantly and make my apartment smell like weed as well, and I didn’t tell the landlord that their dog tried to attack me outside and I am afraid of running into it in my own house and having it attack me or my dog.  \nAm I an asshole for contacting the landlord? Should I just suck it up?",

Great girl so it seemed, but just didn’t have anything there so didn’t want to waste either of our time. Today I decide to go to another ex’s home, whom I broke up with 8 months ago for cheating with a friend of mine. I still care for the girl very much cause we were together for so long and I know her so well, but have no intentions of ever being with her. I go there to give her the verbal beatdown of her life because she is on and off dating a guy who is addicted to heroin and beats her. She is still in love with me, and tries to come onto me 10+ times which I stave off each one and eventually leave. My more recent ex is now following me and calling me telling me I’m a cheater and a liar and all sorts is shit. I make her get in my car and drive and talk, which I was kinda Dickish cause I felt I was being followed for no good reason. Ended up dropping her off just as mad as she was to begin with. AITA",

I really found her attractive so saw her again. And then again. And then again.\n\nAfter finishing sex, we'd use the remaining time left to talk about our lives usually. Slowly I noticed we'd do this until we went ahead of time. Then one day, she offered me a free session. Then asked for my number.\n\nThen we ended up meeting up outside of sessions and fucking for free. We got closer and began sort of....dating I guess? We know a lot about each other personally. We fuck a lot and I never pay.\n\nNow recently, I started to think about this. I've been caught up in the excitement of it for so long that I nevet bothered to think about how crazy this all is. \n\nShe's a prostitute. She's fucked a lot of men. And most of all, she knows how to *use* sex...so I concluded through my own reasoning, that she's planning on getting me hooked on her to then withdraw sex, and then make me pay because she knows I'll be hooked. \n\nSo I called her to meet up and said to her \"Tell me the truth....what's your fucking game?\" and she said \"What??\" so I explained what I think her plan is.\n\nShe looked so shocked and disgusted at me that she called me \"Fucking psycho asshole\" and stormed out.

We don't do this too often, but it feels good to get a little dressed up and have some good Italian food every once in a while. This time, she had a Groupon that was $63 off for four glasses of wine, two apps, and four main courses. We asked the waiter right at the beginning if we could order two of the main courses to go since there were only two of us, and she said no problem (not part of the assholery, I want to be clear that we weren't trying to trick anyone).\n\nSo we have a great meal, ordered our two other main courses to go, then asked for the check. This is where the potential assholery begins. Every item was accounted for on the check, and the total came out to $115 before tax. This meant we should have paid about $60 before tip when all was said and done. Not too bad. HOWEVER, we looked down at the total, and it said something like $7.32, which was just the tax. My fiancee figured we were just misunderstanding the check, as a lot of it was written by hand, so we put down the credit card. Then the receipt came back for a $7.32 total. We were surprised, to say the least, but also pretty excited at the prospect of having an extra $50 in our pocket.\n\nThen my fiancee began to wonder if we should tell anyone. Nobody mentioned that our meal would be comped, and she was worried that someone put it in wrong and would get in trouble for it later. I said that it was fine, our waitress probably knew what she was doing, and not to look a gift horse in the mouth. We ended up not telling anybody, and my fiancee even said on the way out that she thought our waitress gave her a knowing nod as we thanked her.\n\nSo AITA (AWTA?) for not telling anyone about this potentially accidental comped meal? Also, since I think this is very relevant, we tipped $30, a 25% tip on the full amount of the check.",

      "description": "My (ex) girlfriend and I recently broke up with the main reason being a lack of affection on her part. We only \"officially\" dated for a month, but we were into each other and practically dating for almost half a year. Although we were \"dating\", she never really showed any affection. We would never really hang out as there was always something up with her and we would only really see each other in high school. To describe it best, I was basically just a friend she occasionally kissed. Whenever I brought it up, she would always get hostile with me and blame that she was like this because of her exes. Before hand, she would say she would try to change, but closer to the breakup she said that she would always be un-affectionate, and wouldn't really change. She made me feel like shit, but always claimed she loved me. How hard is it to give the occasional hug? or to hold my hand? AITA for wanting to feel loved?",

      "description": "My ex and I separated (and subsequently divorced) about two years ago. Since then, she has been very upfront with me that she's writing a memoir about the end of our marriage and her subsequent life being single. She has also told me that I am free to read it after it's done in case I want to object to how I'm portrayed.\n\nThe thing is that I really don't want to read it. I'm not ashamed of how things ended, and I don't feel like there's embarrassing dirty laundry that she might air.... I just can't really imagine myself sitting down and going through her accounting of that era for a few hundred pages. \n\nAs I figure it, the publishing market is so competitive that there's almost no way her book will be published anyway (and that's not a knock on her, because she's an excellent writer). However, in the off chance that the book gets published, I will have passed on an opportunity to have some say in it before it sees the light of day.\n\nIn short, I don't think she is being malicious, but I feel like her offering me the chance to read it is a continuation of patterns of control and self-absorption that were underlying the end of our marriage. Am I an asshole for wanting nothing to do with that?",

      "description": "Both of us are non-native speakers in the US. We have been together for about a year now. When I first met her, her English didn't seem to be a problem as it's decent enough to have a quick chat but as time passed by I realised that she has a very limited vocabulary and hardly formulates a sentence without making a grammatical error. I believe that this prevents us from having meaningful conversations 90% of the times as I have to ask multiple questions - for every single sentence she says - to fully understand her, at which point I find myself losing interest.\n\nI politely brought up the topic and suggested that we work on our English together as mine isn't perfect either. I told her about how often you need to Google things up when you're not sure about how to use certain words and that it takes hard work, practice and time to get better with a language. I suggested mobile applications that she could use to improve her vocabulary. I bought her a kindle and read a book with her so that we could talk about it and she doesn't lose interest and develops the habit of reading. She read a few chapters sincerely for a while but after that I really had to push her to complete the book and after that she stopped reading. The problem is that she doesn't believe that there is enough room for improvement as her general argument is that other people understand her fairly well and that her English is a lot better than other people from her country.\n\nI feel bad for expecting her to change herself for me but also I find it really difficult to carry on this way, specially when I think about a long-term relationship with her. Would I be the asshole if I left her?",

And say say stuff like \"yeah i know im an asshole\" and thats it. No attempts to change it.\n\n\\-Making plans to meet and not showing up, without letting you know. You'd wait for them and they wouldnt show OR, they wouldnt even pick up the phone. And if you do reach them they'll be like \"oh yeah, i couldnt make it sorry\" (this one i REALLY cant wrap my head around. it takes little effort to text \"cant make it, sorry\")\n\n\\-Making me go to hospital (was urgent, but i was being an idiot) and promising they'll come with me and not picking up the phone the next day.\n\n  \nThese are just some of the examples that keep repeating. there are many more, that made me realize that while they are good people they lack respect for anyone if they keep doing that stuff. \n\nlong ago I had a crush on the guy and didnt act on it. Yesterday the girl asked why i never did anything about him.   \ni gave her a vague response.   \nBut what i really wanted to tell her was \"One of the reasons is that I love you both very much, but you are very unreliable, and dont seem to take the people around you into consideration, when they tell you that your behavior is harming them, and while i might have made my peace with that, im not sure i will tolerate they way they behave in a partner.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We had a class together when we were younger, but we didn’t really get close until around 6 years ago. We ended up dating and broke up, but we stayed friends and got really close again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe don’t really live close at all, so most of our talking happens online, usually when both of us had time (which was often). However, she recently made a new group of friends and tends to hang out with them more. Normally this wouldn’t bother me, making new friends is always great, right? But what’s happened is that because she’s made new friends, she doesn’t talk to me or respond as much even though I know she’s online and active (I’m in a discord server of hers and I can see her talking in it). Now I’ve talked to her about how it bothers me, because she has complained about how her now boyfriend tends to not talk to her very often at times, and I pointed out the hypocrisy of how she wants him to respond and give her attention, but she does what he’s doing to me. This happened before as well, and is actually what caused our break up the first time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that break has ended and she’s had more time to be online and talk, she has continued to do the same thing. Towards the end of break I let her know that I wanted to have a talk so that I could rant about things (because she’s still my best friend and really the only one I’m comfortable ranting to), but she’s been back at school for a week and hasn’t mentioned that she’s had time to talk. I brought it up today, and she told me that she’s been avoiding having the talk because she hates having talks. The thing is, whenever she has problems or something comes up, I always drop what I’m doing to listen to her, but I haven’t had to rant and she’s been out with those new friends basically all week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting her to give me some attention and actually talk to me?

      "description": "This story takes place probably about 9 years ago, when i was around 13.  I was at a campground for the weekend, camping with my family and enjoying the summer.  The campground was at a lake, and I would spend every day fishing, swimming, and catching snakes, of which there was a great many of at the lake.  Now, snakes and other animals had always been a passion of mine, having grown up watching Jeff Corwin and, of course, Steve Irwin (As an aside, FUCK PETA), and I loved nothing more than to go out, catch snakes, frogs, and turtles, and show them to the other kids at the campground to show them that they weren't scary.\n\nWell, one day while I am fishing, I notice some kids from the campground next to ours yelling and screaming.  At first I thought they were just being kids and having fun. But then I heard crying.\n\nI decided to go make sure everything was alright, and reeled up my line and walked over.\n\nWhat I saw made my blood run hot.\n\n3 kids were on the beach, laughing at another girl, probably about 8 or so, while a teenager, probably about 15, was running through the water, a big grin on his face as he smacked at it with a stick.  Confused, I walked closer, to see he was trying to beat a tiny, maybe foot long garter snake to death.\n\nNow for those of you who don't know, a garter snake is a small, thin snake that feeds on bugs, amphibians, worms, and fish.  It is on hundred percent harmless to humans.\n\nNow here comes the part where I MAY have been an asshole.\n\nThrowing down my fishing stuff, I charge over, while the kid chases the snake up onto the land.  I yell at him, and he turns to me, and i could see the surprise in his face.  Now he was probably six inches taller than me, since i was pretty short for my age.  But I was also a football lineman for my school, and weighed more than him by a long shot.\n\nI grabbed him by the throat and by the belt he had on, wrenching him down to me and screaming in his face, before practically tossing him into the lake.  I then grab the snake and check it for damage.  It had a gash on its back and had a small bit of it's tail broken off, but otherwise seemed fine.\n\nAs the kid was getting out of the lake, I yelled at him, asking what the hell he thought he was doing.  He sputtered and looked confused, and just said something about it biting one of the kids.  I asked him which one, and he pointed to the little girl who had been asking him to stop.\n\nI had her come over to me, putting on my best nice guy face.  She was scared, of course, but still came over.  I asked her if she was scared of the snake, and like any 8 year old girl, she nodded and said yes.   I held out the snake and had her touch it, which she was hesitant to do, but when she did I saw her eyes light up.  I explained to her and the other kids, who had crowded in closer to look, that snakes are nice, and aren't trying to hurt anyone.  To illustrate the point, i put the snake down, and it immediately slithered away.",

      "description": "I do not post a lot so I am sorry if the format is wrong also on mobile. \n\r\nBackstory: In 2014 my wife (29F) and I (29M) got custody of her sisters 5 children. Shortly after that we found out we were going to have our first child. So we went from 0 to 6 kids in 9 months. Well part of getting custody was setting up child support. We both knew that neither parent would likely pay anything so we told the court to set the support at $550 a month for each parent. This is not a lot of child support for 5 kids and we hoped by setting it low we may be able to get something. We live in NC and the children’s parents live in TX.\n\r\nIn 2018 my parents were involved in a really bad accident and we lost my mom. I was in TX with my family and my wife made arrangements with her sister to stay with the children at our home in NC while she consoled me in TX. This lead to her sister trying to forcibly regain custody by saying I was abusive and that we abandoned the kids. Long story short everything she did failed, however she irreparably damaged our relationship with her. We wanted nothing to do with her anymore and decided to help get the kids set up and moved to their Dads house in TX.\n\r\nThat all ended around Aug. 2018 when the dad let my SIL see them and she never brought them back to him. After that things went quite from them. We contacted the child support office and informed them that we no longer had the kids so that they would stop trying to collect more child support. That stopped the child support that the parents owed from growing, but they still owe arrears. Fast forward to today when my wife is hysterical because she is getting texts from the kids dad because he finally got a job and is being told that he is going to have his paycheck garnished to pay arrears. AITA for wanting to get the child support that we are owed?   \r\n",

      "description": "I’m 15 and in a group of about six other kids. Four girls, two guys. \n\nSo one of these girls, let’s call her Bowzette, has poor interpersonal skills and is generally not great at relationships in general. She’s also a really private person and can only deal with the ‘flirty friend’ status of relationships. Also, comments related to sex are completely off limits with her. Also she has really bad anxiety and bulimia etc. We were all really worried about her getting abused at hine. \n\nAnyway, this new guy came into our group, let’s call him Big Kev. \n\nBig Kev joined our group a few months ago and he is kinda weird. He won’t make conversation unless he’s really close to you or if it’s about politics, (he says he is a communist). He won’t let you have a different opinion and will argue to the DEATH with you, e,g. A girl in my group is Christian and says marriage is between a man and woman, so he shouted at her for all of lunch and made her cry.  Thing is, he is also a bit of a racist. There is a guy in our group who is black and he makes weird jokes at him, about slave ships and stuff. It freaks me out. \n\nAnyway, Big Kev fancied Bowzette, so they started DMing whatever. \n\nBut then, as was later revealed, he started stalking her. Following her around WHILE NOT SPEAKING, staring, waiting for her, walking her home IN SILENCE. It freaked her out, she told him to stop.  He didn’t. \n\nAnyway, she started having panic attacks cos she felt like she lost control and her bulimia worsened because of the stress, So this one guy in our group, let’s call him Darren, goes up to him Big Kev and tells him to fuck off and that no one likes him. So he does. And he dropped out of school and has no friends because he only hung out with our group and got bullied by everyone else. \n\nThe thing is, I was complicit in this. I didn’t speak up for Big Kev despite being close with him, (talking outside of school whatever, sleepovers, parties), and I think he struggles with social interaction and he may have autism. \n\nI just can’t sympathise with him because of his character but I don’t want this to ruin his life, (no GCSEs etc and depressed). \n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "Context: United States. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA good friend of mine has asked me to be her character reference to support her enlistment in the army. I have advocated on her behalf during her challenging college search and have always been firmly in her corner even when no one else was. She often feels like she's living in more successful peoples' shadow, including her brother, who just recently enlisted. She has yet to tell me why she's joining, just that she needs a reference. She has never once mentioned the army before this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I find military recruitment morally reprehensible. I went to HS in an impoverished district and saw a lot of penniless students get swept up into military service just so they could get through college and have the same opportunities as their wealthier counterparts. If someone feels genuinely passionate about serving their country, then I say more power to 'em. I can respect that. But I can't respect the downright predatory and manipulative techniques used to bolster recruitment, particularly the targeting of minorities, the impoverished, and women. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to support my friend in whatever path she chooses in life, but I feel very uneasy about actively supporting her choice to join the army. I don't really want to be an active participant in her enlistment because I don't think she's joining for the right reasons, and I think recruitment played a huge role in her decision. I of course will emotionally support her no matter what.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA if I refuse to be her reference?",

She always wakes up late in the morning before we plan a family trip and yells at everybody else for not preparing, doesnt work at all and our house is always a mess, and she will never admit she is wrong no matter what. In addition when she is mad, my dad yells me to just hide in my room and avoid her, this happens about once a month and their is no reasoning with her at all, she will never listen to anything we say no matter how much it makes sense. My aunts and my grandma on my moms side seem to agree with me and she has been in a few large scale arguments against the rest of my family. Recently she threw away some of my skin care medication(non-prescription). I argued with her and told her that this was the last straw and I became really mad telling her that she needs to get a job, start to listen to what I have to say. i referenced getting a job because my dad always comes home from work just to get yelled at by her and we always have adjust ans listen to everything she says. I'm not  who is right here, I want to acknowledge her reasons to though. She says that I have a messy room, (which is true)and that wheter she gets a job or not is between her and my dad which is another valid reasons. I hope what I did wasn't just fueled by my anger and I need some help. Thanks guys. ",

      "description": "This is more \"settle a debate\" than any real issue at this stage. Growing up I was raised with two cousins like we were siblings. They are sisters, and when we were kids they would randomly bully me because I was younger and smaller and so on. Fast forward to our teens, and they stopped growing around 5 ft. I got the tall genes and ended up 7 inches taller. At some point around the time I turned 16 when my meanest cousin was in her early 20's she insulted me and hit me (not unusual behavior for her) and I beat the hell out of her. I freely admit that I overreacted to her hitting me in the face with a comb. It just...flipped a switch and for a good 5 minutes I forgot that I am 7 inches taller and a lot stronger. \n\nAnyway, after that she stopped trying to bully me. That was 25+ years ago and we have interacted in person on occasion, but basically we only exchange hi &amp; bye at family functions when necessary. Her sister (who I never beat up) once tried to criticize my parenting because I wouldn't make my son hug her &amp; while I kept my hands to myself I basically told her to mind her business and not my child. Again, after that we exchanged polite greetings and otherwise don't speak. \n\nFast forward to now, my dad is ill and so is my mom. I'm an only child so I take care of things for them that they can't take care of themselves. They live in an apartment building owned by my aunt &amp; managed by my cousins. There's been a series of problems with the building (the furnace went out, the hot water heater stopped working, the lights in the back were out, no one shoveled etc) and my parents have largely reached a point where they can't handle the repeated need to chase my cousins down to get work done. I've taken that over and correspond with them exclusively by email. It's all business because as far as I'm concerned we're only going to deal with each other until the spring when my parents will move into an assisted living facility. Anyway, I had to go over to the building for some paperwork, saw them and my aunt in the hallway, spoke and kept walking. \n\nMy aunt is sort of old lady insistent that we are family and should try to get along. I  am not interested. I do not think they are interested either. For all practical purposes if our mothers weren't sisters we would not be friends. They're super religious, fairly judgemental from what I have overheard at family functions, and just not my kind of people. I'm not their kind of people either. It's fine, I don't wish them ill, I will be glad when my parents move into their new place because they (and my aunt) seem to be slum lords in the making, but I am largely divorced from any emotional ties to them. In a discussion about it, the fact that we're a small family came up. I got the \"Be the bigger person speech\" and I made it clear that I am firm in my decision to maintain the last 25 years of cordial distance. Am I the asshole for not being the bigger person?",

      "description": "One of my classmates, who I’ll call Jacob, had a pretty bad reputation throughout the department. I‘d heard stories of his behavior before having classes with him. It was pretty obvious to me where his bad rep came from even on day 1 of classes with him.\n\nHe was the typical college English snob, was outwardly misogynistic and found ways to incorporate this, his “intellectual superiority,” and other harmful beliefs into a lot of his work/discussions. He made it really difficult to work in groups because rather than contributing to projects, he would just take up time by distracting people and even insulting them (whether intentionally or not). One of his group projects I saw play out ended with him insulting a partner to the point of tears, which he apparently felt no remorse over.\n\nAnyway, our class is gearing up for a big midterm exam. A couple weeks out, I set up a study guide on google docs to share with my classmates. I would’ve shared it with everyone automatically, but I didn’t have everyone’s emails. So I messaged the class in the course’s online page, offering to share if they sent me their email. I made sure to share with everyone who asked and provided their email. Jacob did not ask so I could not share it with him. \n\nThe study guide fills up, we all take the test, and when our professor passes it back, he tells us we are all welcome to retake it if we want. \n\nAfter this, Jacob was the only one in the class who messaged me asking for access to the study guide. I did not feel comfortable giving him the guide that he had not contributed to, when over half his classmates had worked together to finish it. I told him exactly this and that I was open to talk about it, but he never responded.\n\nA few days before the retake, he messaged the whole class his own version of a study guide, saying he had to make a new one because “he apparently was not allowed on the other one.” \n\nI talked to a few other classmates to see what they thought, but I worry that my (our) bias about him made me TA.

      "description": "So last night, we all went out with friends. I was fully ready to pay for my meal, which was wings. I ordered a side fries because I thought everything came with fries, but it ended up being an extra $2.99. He offered to pay for my meal and I told him what I ordered and he seemed okay. I ordered another beer and told him I’ll pay for that one (has a fun and tonic and a beer in total). Then a while later he says “why don’t you pay for your own meal. Didn’t think you’d order all this stuff” (literally fries and a beer). I got upset at the table, like I was just quiet and wasn’t smiling much, just drank my beer. He got mad at me when I told him why I was upset. Fast forward, we talked it out and everything seemed fine. I looked at the bill and asked him what I owe him, and he said “don’t worry about it”. WHAT THE FUCK. Then he gets MAD at me and won’t say he loved me when I told him goodnight. I gave him every opportunity to let me pay!!! And now he’s still upset with me, the next day, that I “expect” him to pay. Which I never did, but I think it’s rude to offer to pay and then just retract your offer and get mad at the person when they get upset. I offered to pay for the extra things but he still got mad!! It’s $12 more which I was fine with paying. Not only that, he left a hefty tip and the bill came to $80, and he expects me to pay $40. I was never even discussed the tip amount. I literally am broke after buying him things for Christmas, his birthday and Valentine’s Day and he knows that. Am I the asshole for being upset?? ",

      "description": "Ahhhh a family argument on Christmas Eve... brilliant.\n\nSo here's some facts:\n\nMy mum and dad divorced when I was 8, 10 years ago. Mum moved out the family home and I pretty much lived with her permanently. We have been fine financially, up until a few months ago.\n\nI soon found out that she was using my dads child support to pay the bills and rent. When this stopped when I turned 18 in June, she started asking me for rent. I was working part-time as I was still in education, but didn't mind chucking her £200 for rent. None of my friends pay rent, but oh well.\n\nRecently, I landed a dream career in the fire service in London, and if I may say so myself, earn very decent money for myself. My training salary is £27k, her salary is £18k - you get the idea. \n\nI left home on the 17th of December and moved 120 miles away to London, paying £600 a month in AirBnb for training. I will be moving to London in a flat once I pass out from training, which is looking to be about £800 p/m rent depending on my station allocation. \n\nMum has asked for full rent for December, because I came home on Sunday to spend time with my family over Christmas (because training is off), so owe her for the month. Fine, that's cool with me.\n\nShe then asked for January's. I will be home for 15 hours in January. Like literally, I leave at 3pm and will not be returning until late March for a couple days. I said no, and thought i was well within my right to say no. \n\nHer arguments are as followed:\n\n\\- I earn more than her now so I'm in a debt for raising me for 18 years\n\n\\- She can't get someone to live in my room so it'll be filled with my stuff\n\n\\- She won't be able to afford rent if I don't give her the cash\n\nShe is insisting I pay, but I don't understand why and don't want to start a full blown argument. My argument, amongst not actually living there, is that I won't be able to afford London rent AND rent at home too if I want to live comfortably.",

I have a huge issue with bad cuticles. Cuticles are a big deal to me. \n\nHis nails are clean and clipped but he doesn't take care of his cuticles. I don't expect most 19 year old guys too.

      "description": "So my friend had a party and she invited some boys in our friendship group who are KNOWN for being drug users. She explicitly told them no drugs. During her party one of the boys pulls me to the side and asks if I want some coke. I thank him but say no and tell them they shouldn’t be doing it as my friend has explicitly said no drugs. I didn’t mention it to my friend as I didn’t want to cause a scene and thought it would ruin the night for her, and I actually forgot about it as I was quite drunk, until my friend and another friend were praising one of the boys in question for how nice and, to use her words, “innocent” he was. The other friend was romantically involved with him and I didn’t like him as I thought she could do a lot better (he’s known for being sly, proven by the fact he had told her he doesn’t do drugs). I tell them that he can’t be that nice as he was doing coke at the party behind her back, and she went absolutely mad at me and stopped speaking to me because apparently I should’ve told her at the time and it was strange how I’d used that as a reason to express my disapproval of him. I didn’t tell her at the time as she even said herself it would’ve ruined the party. I also get along with the boys in question a lot better than her, she’s an asshole herself and tbh I didn’t really need to tell her at all. She’s not annoyed at the boys in question for disobeying her even though she views them as friends and she’s not confronted them but she’s completely stopped speaking to me? AITA?",

      "description": "Some context: my roommates and I live on the ground floor of an apartment building and thus have a sliding door we can get into and out of our apartment with instead of using the building door.\n\nEvery time I've come home the last two weeks, if someone else is home, the door is slightly cracked. I live in the US near DC, it's cold right now, consistently in the 30-40's (farenheit). I brought it up politely before, and mostly got poo-pooed for being neurotic about the door.\n\nToday, I came home, and the door is cracked open. I come in and loudly ask \"Why is the door cracked? Whoever goes in and out needs to slide it shut.\" Both my roommates jumped down my throat about being an asshole immediately. \n\nContext on the situation: they did have guests over, and I disregarded that this might be rude to get on people's cases about when there are guests over. Allegedly, that why is my roommates were mad tonight, despite this being a recurring problem I've addressed before. \n\nMy opinion is that it is even more reasonable to bring up when there are guests over. They should be aware of shutting the door too, it's not a hard task and it runs up our heating bill.\n\nTL:DR?

      "description": "So I befriended someone online last year (we'll call him A) and learned that he was in a really shit situation financially and emotionally. He used to live in the south and his family and the people in his small town weren't very respectful or accepting of his gender identity/sexuality/general existence. I wasn't in a much better place financially, but after much begging and pleading on my part (he didn't want to move across the US to live in the Pacific Northwest initially because he'd never lived so far from home, which is understandable) he finally let me buy him a plane ticket to get to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe moved in with me in July of 2018, and I already had a job waiting for him when he got up here. Through no fault of his own, he was laid off a week later (the job had been for a temp agency in a volatile position that depended entirely upon the work load the company had, and the temp agency had hired too many people for what the job required). A couple of weeks later, he found another job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, we were living in a shitty little 1 bedroom apartment with a third roommate (J), who had approved of and helped with the decision to move A in with us, but J had made it clear he was moving out at the end of the lease. Come October, I'd been laid off from my job for the same reason as A (we'd been working in different departments at the same company), but found another job within a day of being laid off. He was working too, but was getting less and less hours. He eventually decided to quit...a week or so after we moved into our new apartment (this is important, as it sets a precedent).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI barely managed to convince him to wait until he had another job lined up, because I would have had to pay all of our bills (which doesn't amount to as much as some people's I know) on not enough income. But it didn't matter anyway, because he ended up getting laid off from there too. Fast forward two and a half months, and he's finally gotten another job (after I've had to pull some shady shit to get our bills paid for which I already know I'm the asshole). I had to beg and plead with him to actually put in applications in the first place and I dragged him to the Subway he got a job at to put in his application. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Subway doesn't do 'full time' (40 hours a week minimum) for anyone who isn't management. Their 'full time' is no more than 30 hours a week, as it is dependent upon the company's policy what their definition of full time is. Minimum wage here isn't enough to survive on, as in most places, especially not if you're only making part time. I was ecstatic for him when he got a job, because the stress of having to pay all the bills and buy our groceries was killing me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got an email from the recruiter of the temp agency I work for now that my site is hiring for 3 more positions in my department. I don't make amazing money here, but it's more than minimum wage and is guaranteed 40 hours a week. Not to mention that the only skill you need to have is the basic understanding of how to use a computer and talk on a headset, and it's temp to hire (hired on permanently after 90 days). I'd talked to A about this in the past about possibly getting a position here and he agreed that he would be interested. I told him about the position and he immediately said that he wouldn't do it because he'd just gotten hired on with Subway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had three separate conversations (read: arguments) with him about this, trying to get him to understand why I'm so anxious and upset about him taking this part time food service job over a full time temp to hire position that is so much more secure and has consistent hours. And he comes back at me saying that I need to stop bothering him about it and that it's starting to piss him off that I'm not respecting his decision. I'm frustrated beyond belief, and I'm scared that I'm not going to be able to make rent if he's not getting consistent hours. It's putting strain on our friendship, and I'm too much of a pushover (not a humblebrag, i'm the fucking worst about this) that I'll never be able to kick him out, especially since he literally has nowhere to go. He couldn't even get back home to the south if he wanted to because we have $0 in savings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLogically, I think I know I'm not the asshole in this situation, but I am constantly doubting myself about everything I say and do because I'm not a terribly confident person, and I'm anxious about everything and anything I do. Especially when it comes to roommates, as I've had pretty much this exact situation happen in the past. You'd think I'd learn, but that's where that pushover bit comes to bite me in the ass. Anyway, this is my first post on Reddit and I'm sorry for writing a novel for you all. Let me know what you guys think...?",

This is also where all of the dope boys hang out, selling weed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a normal walk to or from the train, I pass 1-3 \"loud loud loud loud\"ers trying to sell me weed, and this even happens when I am walking with other people. This has been a continuous thing over the past 3 years (they don't get the hint). In addition to finding it incredibly annoying, I wonder why it is allowed? These boys don't live in this neighborhood, they only come here to sell their drugs. Weed is still illegal in this city and I imagine this type of dealing would be illegal regardless. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not a consumer, I don't mind if people do, but I really feel like this type of activity really brings down the neighborhood. I didn't think that this would be controversial. As a non-POC, I am just having a hard time understanding why this is so normalized. I get that there are structural inequalities, but selling weed seems like the easy way out (SN: I wouldn't dare say lazy, as this would draw out accusations of me being a racist, but that's absolutely what I mean. It takes effort to learn a marketable skill. Drug dealing at this scale is lazy and regressive.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for bringing this up in a community forum? Not a single person expressed any agreement to my post and I was immediately accused of being a \"privledged princess\", a \"gentrifier\" and \"inviting POLICE to harass Black boys\".",

      "title": "AITA For smacking a teenager?",
      "description": "I had my 6 year old daughter at the park earlier today, as there was a community event going on nearby and there would be a lot of kids for her to play with. It didn't take long before I noticed a huge teenager, I'm guessing 16-17, playing extremely rough with his siblings. Like almost sadistically rough, shoving them off the play equipment, slapping them as they came down slides, that sort of thing. Several parents were discussing it and multiple asked him to cool it and were ignored. I told my daughter to play with the kids away from him, and he was getting progressively more rough and his parents were nowhere in sight.\n\nEventually her and a small handful of children around her age and a couple of parents broke away from that group to play at a smaller jungle gym nearby. All was well until this guy and one of his brothers came over, and he tried to get his younger brother to encourage the other kids to \"play fight.\" Myself and other parents told him off. For the next few minutes he climbed the outside of the jungle gym, ran up slides, threw swings over the bar and people were actively looking for his parents and some suggested calling the cops. I was about to call my daughter back over to leave, and told him he was \"acting like an idiot\". Apparently this set him off, because as my daughter was walking down the jungle gym stairs he slammed into her from behind with his hip as hard as he could and launched her off onto the ground and immediately goes \"sorry, I'm an idiot.\" \n\nI ran over, smacked him in the face and immediately pulled my daughter up to safety and put her behind me. Again, my daughter is 6 and this kid was huge. I'm 5'8, 200lbs and he was a head taller than me and at least my weight and he checked my kid like a hockey player. Here's the kicker, his fucking parents had been 20 feet away this whole time and had outright ignored this behavior and didn't speak up when other parents asked around for them. The kid is sitting on the ground crying, saying I hit him and to call the police. Other parents advocated for me, and I swear to God this guy starts yelling at his son despite not giving a fuck five minutes prior, doesn't say a word about me hitting him, and rounds up his other kids. Doesn't call the cops, doesn't say shit. Other parents are checking in, making sure my daughter is ok.\n\nI don't feel like I'm the asshole, but maybe I have a biased view and handled it poorly so I could use some perspective. Violence isn't usually my go-to, but seeing my child slam the ground that hard and someone that big standing over her set something off and I viewed him as an immediate threat to her safety, I just reacted to keep her safe and get her out of there. I hit him hard enough to floor him and clearly he wasn't \"normal\" for his age, so I maybe went a bit too hard.",

      "description": "Been together a little over 2 years. BF always visits Vegas during March Madness and bets on the games. This was typically a boys’ weekend, but last year his boys couldn’t make it so he invited me. We didn’t actually do much since he was sick the first night and angry at losing the second, but it was still fun to walk around. His father and his now wife were there too and they’re really nice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn’t planning on him taking me this year, tbh. But, apparently, his father’s wife wanted me to go so BF bought me a plane ticket. I have never begged or pressured him to take me, but I’m always down to go. A few nights ago, BF mentioned that he’s apparently planning to split his time between me and his one (possibly two) friend(s) that are planning to go this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was news to me and I asked what I was meant to do while he was at a pool party or bar with his friend(s). He told me to just walk around or spend some time with his fam. I 100% do not feel comfortable walking around a city like Vegas by myself and don’t want to impose myself on his family. I also don’t think it’s fair for me to just sit in the hotel room while he’s off doing whatever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe’s now upset at me for asking why I can’t join him and his friend and acting like I’m an idiot for not understanding why they wouldn’t wanted me hanging with them. I understand it being a boys’ trip, but then why bring me at all? Am I being the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "AITA for contacting a guy’s friends after he ghosted me \n\nOk so this is what happened. I’ve been casually seeing this guy from a dating app. Everything was going well, we hung out a few times and texted/called almost every day. \n\nHe called me on Friday to hang out and I wasn’t able to because I was cleaning my place and doing stuff for school. He persisted, going as far as inviting me over to his dad’s place and that he really wanted to see me. I sort of felt like it was too early in our courtship to meet family members, so I decline and he understood. But I told him I wanted to see him and so we made plans for breakfast on Saturday. \n\nSaturday comes around, I text him, he replies and says where we should meet and I said agree and ask what time. No response. I text again. Nothing. I wait about 30 minutes and call. No answer. This is unlike him seeing as how he’s called and texted me more during our time talking to each other.  I assume he got caught up in something and go about my day, figuring he’ll get back to me eventually. He doesn’t. \n\n\n \nI thought that ghosting someone in the middle of making plans just seems unlikely, especially considering he contacted ME to hang out and even invited me to meet his dad. By now I’m worried because we had plans, he was responding and had told me the night before how excited he was to see me. So I just didn’t think he would be ghosting me, and if he didn’t want to hang out, I figured he would at least tell me. I call/text a few more times saying that I’m worried and that it’s hes not interested in seeing me, it’s fine just let me know so I can stop worrying about him. Still nothing. So I reached out to his friends on Instagram, asking if they heard from him bc he’s not answering his phone. Then I get a response from him, over 24 hours later, that he ‘needed space and contacting my friends was creepy’.  Okkkkkkk.... and then his friend responded that he’s ‘fine and I need to take the L And move on.’ \n\nI sort of feel like, wtf? Am I the asshole for reaching out to his friends? Did I overreact? ",

      "description": "TL;DR; copied from below: I have been the lead on a project for 3 of the last 4 iterations and do a vast majority of the work. My coworker who came up with the project idea was the lead on the 1st iteration. He felt that he deserved half of the allotted bonus while I deserved the other half. People who actually did work were left out while I was not given a fair share. I told my coworker what was up and shit hit the fan. AITA? \n\n\nI worked really hard on a project at work. No exaggeration, I did over 70% of the work to make this happen flawlessly. \n\n\nThe Monday after completing the project, my coworker comes to me and asks if I’d heard anything about bonuses. I say no, but it’s still early and I just sent the budget to our bosses. He says “well I was asked who deserves a bonus and I said you and me. Don’t tell (a specific coworker).” “...ok” “I just really need the money” and he goes off on a tangent about how expensive it is owning a house and having a kid. \n\n\nThe problem is, this mouthy coworker did almost nothing. Yes, the project was his idea, and in years past, he has done some work. But this year, he did not. He dropped the ball on most of his tasks. As a matter of fact, the coworker he told me not to mention bonuses to picked up the slack and completed his work. \n\n\nSo the next day, angered by the injustice, I make a plan to speak to one of our 2 bosses about the bonuses. Unfortunately, I couldn’t catch him that day (it was one of those almost comically anti-serendipitous days where everything that could go wrong, did). Later that evening, I’m out for a drink with the hard working coworker. She asks if I know when we will get our bonuses. I really tried to avoid an answer, but she knows me well enough to question me further. I don’t want to be a liar over this. After I told her, “well I’m working on it.” And “I didn’t get to connect with our boss today”, I finally say “our other coworker claims just he and I should get bonuses this time, but I know that’s not fair so I’m going to ask that the bosses throw you some”\n\n\nUnderstandably, she was livid. It really did feel like a mistake when I told her, but it also didn’t feel like my secret to keep just because a coworker (not even ranking above me) told me to. \n\n\nThe following day I spoke to both of our bosses in succession. They each said that what happened wasn’t right and they would rectify it. The second boss even thanked me for looking out for my coworker. \n\n\nA week later, my left-out-of-bonus coworker and my selfish coworker go out for drinks and get wasted. A fight ensues. From what I’ve been told by others, it was a shouting match with her screaming she can’t believe he would stab her in the back and he can’t believe she would think he’s capable of stabbing her in the back... On and on. The selfish coworker is dropping the f bomb in public. They leave the bar and he keeps sending her texts, saying it’s f-ed up that she would accuse him of that. She’s f-ing stupid. Etc. \n\n\nI know there were a lot of screw ups here. Obviously, that one selfish coworker is an ass. But AITA, too?\n\n\nTL;DR: I have been the lead on a project for 3 of the last 4 iterations and do a vast majority of the work.

      "description": "My ex lost a gold bracelet or some kind of jewellery when we were dating. Let me say it was years ago I'm talking 2014-15. She asked about it a lot then and we looked for it together but we gave up and thought it was missing for good. Lo and behold I find it in 2019 buried under garbage in a compartment in my car. I was low on money so I went to one of the gold for cash places and sold it. \n\nAdmittedly a bad thing to do cause I remembered it was hers. We broke up in 2016 but we have mutual friends and although we don't talk I see her sometimes. So yeah I could've given it back. I kinda felt like an asshole but I came to peace with it because it's been years she probably forgot about it and she had tons of gold jewellery cause her family gifts her that kinda thing all the time. \n\nOne of our mutual friends is my best friend. We were talking about money and I accidentally brought up the cash for gold thing and eventually had to tell him the truth about it because I couldn't think of a cover. Dumb of me to let it slip but nbd cause he's my best bud and she's a friend from high school. Well he made me feel like a huge steaming pile of shit for not giving it back. I crashed with him for a while and he even insinuated that he can't help but think I might be behind things he's lost. The bracelet was completely different then stealing from your best friend who helping you out by letting you crash with them right? Cause I'd never do that. \n\nNot saying I think what I did was right but I thought it was excusable. And now since then things with my bud aren't the same. We're still friend but it's tense and he's cold toward me and the more I think about it the more I'm on the fence. Was I an asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "I live with two roommates. I go to school full time and have classes everyday starting from 8 am that go all the way into the afternoon, and on top of that I also have night classes. On the days I have night classes, I tend to stay there even after my day classes are finished because I carpool with my best friend, AND its a 30 min drive from my school to my home and I don't like going back and forth because my car's a bit of a gas guzzler. When I'm not at school, I'm at work which my shifts basically start from almost right when I get out of school all the way to late at night, Roommate 1 is unemployed and always at the house, and Roommate 2 does work and have school, but he tends to still have more free time at the house than I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I understand that I should be pitching in more to do chores like taking trash out and cleaning the bathroom because I DO use those things the few times I am home. But I rarely eat at home let alone even use any dishes because I don't eat at home. I usually eat at either school or work, and the few rare times I do eat at home I eat these frozen power bowls that come with their OWN bowls and use my portable utensils when I eat them (because if I don't consistently use them I'll forget about them, it sounds dumb I know but it's just how it is for me.) I also have depression which tends to make me a little complacent, I won't lie, but usually I'm on top of chores.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just recently just took a trip that lasted for about half a week and came back a few days ago. I was at the store with one of my roommates, when suddenly he piped up and said, \"Roommate 2 says you need to start doing chores more.\" I told him sure, but what about the dishes since I'm never home and use them? From there it turned into a huge argument and us going back and forth with him saying \"well, you live here and it doesn't matter if you don't use them you need to do them anyways\" and me arguing back \"if I never use them I'm basically just cleaning up after you two and that isn't fair\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the thing is, is that this isn't even the first time we haven't seen eye to eye in the house, and I don't like saying anything about it because Roommate 2 gets fussy back and then him and I will end up fighting. The last instance was when THEIR dog had been chewing my stuff up for MONTHS since I had first moved in and all Roommate 2 would say is, \"Don't leave your stuff on the floor\". After months of doing that, the dog would still find ways to chew my shit up and would chew up quite expensive things of mine too, including my glasses and shoes. When I brought this to attention, we got into a fight because all he said \"just don't let her in your room\", which was hard because every morning he would open the room door to let her in. He wouldn't even compensate me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really want to know if I'm in the wrong for the whole dishes thing, or maybe even both instances, because I'm tired of feeling singled out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "      Background, hubby is currently in a PhD program that he wants to quit and he wants to start a JD . I'm very supportive of his decision to do this. Last year, he applied to a handful of PhD programs and only got into one and unfortunately, it's not going well. (It's a new program and kind of running itself into the ground but that's another story)\n\n     I just finished my nursing degree and I do not start my new job until February. So we're pretty broke and stretched really thin to make it until then. He's not currently working because of PhD program. \n\n      He has taken the LSAT and did decently. He's gotten lots of emails from lots of school and quite a few have given him fee waivers, and one school has already offered him a full tuition scholarship and he hasn't even applied yet. \n\n      Today, he got an email from Harvard asking him to apply. He's already looked up admission requirements and he's at about the 25th percentile of their admissions. But he's convinced that they must have sent him an email because they pulled his LSAT and academic records. When he was asking my opinion about it, I told him I felt it was a waste of money. Well, he moped for a couple hours and hardly spoke to me and once he was speaking to me, he told me I hurt his feelings and he felt I was not being supportive and that I was being a dick about it. I apologized because I really didn't mean to hurt his feelings and it's not that I don't think he can it's that I don't think it's practical and it makes more sense to apply to the places that won't wreck us financially. But I also told him that he can apply if he feels that strongly about it. However, I'm still being treated like the asshole. AITA for giving my opinion instead of being unwaveringly supportive?\n\nTL/DR: Hubby wants to apply to Harvard law school and I told him I thought it was a bad idea. AITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "We'd been dating for 2 months, and I really enjoyed spending time with her, talking with her on the phone every night and just doing things with her. But then I went on a week-long vacation  and met someone else that I really liked, now this new girl, I didn't want to go out with her, and I didn't feel sexually attracted to her at all, she quickly became like a best friend to me, and we spent a lot of time together. I really enjoyed how the new girl was always coming up with interesting and wild things to talk about, always surprising me with weird things to say. But the new girl lived hours away so I didn't see her after the trip, but we kept in touch via email.\n\nBut then I come home to my girlfriend...and I didn't feel attracted to her anymore. Yes she was nice, no she didn't cause any problems, but talking to her felt so boring compared to when I'd talked to the new girl. But I felt bad - because my gf didn't do anything wrong. So I didn't want to break up with her, because it wasn't her fault, it was me, not her. So over the course of 2 weeks, after I got home I spent 2 weeks growing more distant, talking more and more about the trip I'd taken and how much fun I'd had, and how I wished she'd be more interesting too. She was trying to be more interesting and even bought me a book on relationships, but I already knew it was over. I called her less and less until I stopped calling her altogether, until one morning she took me aside and said \"It's over\" and I said \"Okay.\" I also bought her a really nice birthday present which I'd promised I'd get her something nice before we broke up and I followed through (even though I didn't go to her birthday since it was after we broke up).\n\nAm I the asshole? I was trying to let her down gently, and let maintain the \"power\" and the agency in the relationship because I didn't want to break her heart. I thought I was doing the right thing, but after I told a friend about it he was really concerned.",

      "description": "First of all, apologies for any typos. I am typing this whilst I am still quite angry and confused, and see this sub as a good place to realise whether I am in the wrong, which I am very willing to accept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Eurovision 2018 the winning Israeli singer wore a Kimono-style dress. This angered my half-Japanese girlfriend at the time and she continues to use it as an example of a micro-aggresion against non-white people in our country (the UK) and a form of cultural appropriation. At the time I said this was an overreaction and right now when she brought it up again over dinner I voiced my concerns that she tends to get too worked up over issues that she views as cultural appropriation. In my oppinion cultures borrow from eachother all the time, which is usually a great thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis leads to her saying I cannot understand because I am white and privilaged and people can't appropriate my English or Irish culture (I spent my formative years in Ireland) becuase it is not the same for white people. I object to this pretty strongly and say that I think it's ridiculous that I am not allowed to have an oppinon just becuase of my background. She is from a very wealthly Japanese family and I am from a comparatively regular British/Irish family. When I even mention the fact that she might have been more privaleged than me (having gone to a very nice private school etc.) she shuts me down under the same argument I see used that people can't be racist against whites/ reverse racism doesn't exist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ended up backing down but she is furious at me for even voicing those oppinions and I can see it being an issue if it ever comes up again. Am I the arsehole for these views? I genuinly don't know if I am ignorant bigot or if she has unfair standards anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies if this isn't as interesting or dramatic as the usual posts on this sub, but a judgment would be much appreciated, whichever judgement it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I thought she was being greedy asking for £100 for a car she got free but it was still worth it. Fast forward a year and the car is starting to have problems, I had to spend £180 to get a new part. So I told my mum and sister that I might not be able to afford to keep my car. My sister offered to buy it for £150, she was going to offer more but my mum told her she couldn’t spend more than that on the car. I thought she thought that the car wasn’t worth any more so I decided to get it valued by a company, they said they might be able to buy it for £400-£900. It would depend on an inspection and test drive. So I booked it in. \nI told my sister about the valuation and then I got a text from my mum telling me I couldn’t sell the car, it wasn’t mine to sell. She told me that it was only a loaner and I had to give it back if I didn’t want it. I asked her why she sold it to me then and she said she hadn’t the £100 was for transporting the car from my uncles 60 miles away. \nIf I sold the car now my mum would never talk to me again.\nI’m not sure what to do next, AITA.",

      "description": "This morning, i got a phone call from the \"IRS\".  An automated one saying i needed to call them back.\n\n\nI already knew it was a scam, but i called back anyway. When i did, It was a man, with a thick Indian accent and he asked my name. Which i gave him, not my real one. I told him it was John Cena. Saying that i owed in unpaid taxes, he never gave me an exact amount, just an outstanding sum. \n\n\nBut, i know the IRS never calls you anyway (without sending something in the mail first), so i knew he was scamming me. But i played along anyway, just for the heck of it. He asked me to buy Itunes gift cards. I actually asked about them not sending something in the mail, they went quiet after that.\n\n\nI also asked the exact amount i owed, he said this was just a collection agency hired by the IRS and that they didn't know the details. Even though they introduced themselves as the IRS itself, nnot some affiliate. \n\n\nBut then, \"If you wan't us to find that out, we need your Social Security Number or an active Credit Card.\" \n\n\nIt went back and forth like that, i just kept asking \"Why do you need my credit card to give me a number?\", he never gave me an answer. Just kept repeating \"We need your credit card to check your case file.\", \n\n\nIt got heated after a bit. \"You don't need my credit card to give me a F***ing number.\" \"We do. We can't check your case file without an active credit card.\"\n\n\nSo, he started listing off a bunch of charges and threats that \"The Police will be their soon unless you give me a credit card.\"\n\n\n\"I can't understand a word you're saying, where are you from?\" He told me Texas, i called him out on this, that the IRS is centered in DC, not Texas but he changed the story again. That they were just a collection agency sent by the IRS.\n\n\nHe kept going on, i kept just mocking his voice, i said things like \"Can you get someone who can at least speak English?\", plus i also impersonated him, i spoke in a faux Indian accent \"Oh, I work at the Kwik-E-Mart!\"\n\n\nAfter a bit, I threatened to hang up, and he brought up my \"outstanding debt\" that needs to be paid urgently. I just told him \"How the hell can i pay something, til i know how much the M*ther F*cker costs?\", he, once again, asked for my credit card.\n\n\nI figured i had my fun, so i told him my cell phone was going dead and to call my home phone. When he asked for the number though, i didn't give him my actual phone number. I actually gave him the number for my local police station.\n\n\nAnyway, about an hour or so later, i called back.  They answered as the IRS, i replied \"Hey, Madarchod (Mother F***er in Hindi), i'm calling about the scam.\"\n\n\nSo, he got mad at me \"If you think it's a scam, then why are you calling? You should not waste your time, right?\"\n\n\nThen he told me it's not a scam and that the police will be dispatched if i hang up. But i did anyway.\n\n\nNow, i feel kind of guilty about doing this. I mean, this guy runs a scam to get people out of money but i feel bad because i mocked his accent and everything. Am i the Asshole for doing this?",

      "description": "Alt for privacy.\n\nFor a bit more context: I currently use a Samsung Galaxy J7, given to me by my biological dad around 2016. I am 15.\n\nFor Christmas, my mother and stepfather gave me a Samsung Galaxy S5, which, unlike my current J7, can actually make calls and texts, since my biological dad does not pay for the data plan on it anymore, since I moved away.\n\n-\n\nHere's what the phone does better than my current phone:\n\n-It has a fingerprint scanner, unlike my J7.\n\n-It has 1080p, unlike the 720p with my J7.\n\n-Might either have better or worse storage space, I haven't checked.\n\n-Has a screensaver while charging.\n\n-Smaller.\n\n-Can make phone calls.\n\nHere's what it does worse:\n\n-Keyboard is burnt into the screen among a few other undiscernable things.\n\n-Screen is zoomed WAY in compared to current phone, making 1080p mostly moot.\n\n-Has a screensaver while charging, which can lead to screen burn-in.\n\n-Fingerprint scanner sucks ass.\n\n-Might have better or worse storage space, I haven't checked.\n\n-Supposed to be waterproof, but the charging cover is broken.\n\n-Does not have a case.\n\n-Smaller.\n\n-Keyboard has more space between keys, making keys smaller.\n\n-UI is very fucky to navigate.\n\n-Flashlight cannot be accessed from the drop-down menu, which I use somewhat often.\n\n-\n\nI was asked if I wanted a phone and felt somewhat pressured to say yes, though I stressed that my current phone was already very good and I didn't really need anything that was powerful, just something that could make phone calls, **since I already had a very good phone.**\n\nThey've been telling me that now I need to give my phone BACK to my dad, since he was the one who got it for me. I'm being given a phone that is WORSE than my current one, and being told to give my good one away, and I'm feeling very scammed right now. Does this make me the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "So I'll try to make this quick:\n\nAbout 30 minutes ago I was walking back alone after having a joint with a mate when I decided (as is tradition) to stop by and grab a kebab. So I go in and order the kebab at my favourite local balti, wait for a couple minutes to get the food then start to head out. I say thanks to the team, even drop \"have a good night\" as it's 12ish and are soon closing. Then right as I'm leaving, the delivery guy for then who is counting the change for the night drops \"You're henging nobhead\" effectively saying I stink of weed.\n\nI was fully aware that I likely had an air of the Savage cabbage to me, but I wasn't expecting to be berrated for it. I thought there was some kind of unspoken symbiotic relationship between people who are high and fast food restaurants opened past 10ish. The worst part is I rarely smoke weed and I feel kinda embarrassed and shitty about the whole thing. Is it obnoxious to go in to a place that serves food when stoned if you might smell? Should I go in and apologize later or would you do the same? The place deals with drunk people all the time and I tried to be as respectful as possible, barring the fact I was (and still to an extent as I write this) a little baked.",

I was at Cambridge back then, and it's my second week of staying (I stayed for 3 weeks). Being at the UK for the first time, I was still kind of in awe about how the houses look like they're still in the 19th century while back at Hong Kong, which is where I live, tall buildings are the norm. So naturally, I wandered around the streets alone, going around to take pictures of the Townscape since I was interested in the architecture. I was randomly googling for places to go around Cambridge when I hit up University of Cambridge's Downing Site on my search result. I decided to go there on a whim, then uttery dissapointed myself with a nice little dead end at the gate. Of course it's closed to the public, isn't it?\n\nThen, it happened. I saw an African-American guy running like hell's after him, holding a plastic bag in his hands. Behind him is another person yelling, \"Oi! Hey, stop!\" whatever it is to the former. But instead of trying to help the man who's got something stolen from him, or calling the cops, I ignored it all, and had my headphones play my songlist on the loudest volume, keeping a stone cold face while watching it all happen in a metter of seconds.\n\nThe African-American took a left, escaped into a bar (I think, It has a name but I forgot, maybe it's The Castle (just googled it again)), then was out of my sight. The guy pursuing him also stopped to catch a breath or call the police as well.\n\nI could've at least tripped the thief (he was too busy looking behind him) while I'm at it... I'm such a fucking idiot, am I not?",

      "description": "Our basement has many purposes, it the catch all for a lot of stuff we don’t use everyday (as a basement should be). It’s where dh’s 3 guitars and amps live, his star wars Lego collection and 3 tall shelves of books (already read), there’s a small tv for my teenage son and a couch/futon for guests. However it’s also my office.  I’m a bookkeeper, and a new client needed to drop off 10 bankers boxes of paperwork. In frustration with the lack of space and stupid junk, I move the furniture around (and made a donation pile of other stuff). The futon ends up covering access to the lower book shelves. I made sure to make ample space for dh’s guitars and amps since he plays them at least a few days per week. \nHe came home and was annoyed that I covered the books (even though I feel like one could easily push the futon a few inches to grab a book) and said “why don’t you put the futon in front of your desk”. I don’t feel like shelves with already read books and a desk where I work everyday are comparable. I tried being respectful of his belongings so I focused on a space for the guitars... I’m hurt that he compared my desk (insinuated belittling my business/working from home) to his books, and is “mad” at me for not caring about his stuff.... AITA???\n\n",

      "description": "My brother has been dating Amber for close to five years. During one point of their relationship, she cheated on him with his best friend Jessie. They split for a few months and she continued to sleep with Jessie. It was messy as fuck and tore our friend group apart. My family told him to dump her. She comes back crying a few months later and pleading it was a mistake. He ends up forgiving her and low and behold she's pregnant. Everyone in my family says he needs to get a DNA test but he refuses. He says he's not worried about it because it has to be his due to timing. I don't believe this.\n\nBaby is born in November and I keep getting pressured to see it because I'm the aunt. My mom continously is texting me \"when will the aunt see the baby?\" I say I will visit when they get a DNA test proving it belongs to my brother. I confronted my brother abour this. He has the audacity to lie to me and say they did the DNA test \"when the baby was born in the hospital\". Yeah okay bullshit. I tell him this is bullshit and not some routine test done. He doesn't press further.\n\nAt this point my family is calling me heartless because I have refused to see his kid. My sister says he refuses the DNA test. Everyone in my family has tried to get him to agree but he says he's not worried about it because he loves the baby. My family says I need to love him because he's my brother. I disagree. I'm not being an aunt unless I know this kid belongs to my goddamn brother. I feel my brother is being willfully ignorant in this and therefore if I agree this, I am agreeing to him never finding out if the kid is truly his and blindly throwing his life away.\n\nAm I crazy? Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "Sorry if this post is a mess... this is my first Reddit post and I’m new to all this. \n\nSo I met a guy online a few months ago, let’s call him B. Our relationship actually started off pretty rocky, he has a drinking and drug problem and was verbally and sexually abusive towards me. \n\nI don’t know why I had such a hard time leaving him, I should have. I mainly stayed with him and took the abuse because he helped me a lot financially and I wasn’t in a great spot. He was also extremely attentive and kind after his “episodes” and he would stop the substance abusive for a few days, promise to quit forever... did all the perfect boyfriend things, brought me flowers, took me on dates, promised me an amazing future. Of course that didn’t last though and he would go back to his usual ways. \n\nSo about 4 months into this relationship I am desperate to escape it. He won’t stop calling me names and he never takes no for an answer. I guess that’s important to say because otherwise we were safe. I wanted so badly to leave and after an especially abusive night I finally got the courage to tell him to leave and never speak to me again (he was unofficially living with me at this point.)\n\nThis caused him to go into a complete meltdown. He begged for my forgiveness but I wasn’t changing my mind. He was sober at this point so I wasn’t worried about him hurting me... he was never abusive while sober. \n\nAnyway, he left for awhile and fast forward to that night I was laying in bed feeling like a complete failure... I had this nagging feeling in my gut something was wrong. I wasn’t actually due for my period for a few days but I just felt the urge to check. I had an extra pregnancy test from awhile ago. I had bought a 2 pack from a scare from a previous relationship and had an extra in my bathroom. So I peed on the stick and waited... probably within 30 seconds a VERY faint positive line showed up. I could barely see it but I knew it was there and I just knew it wasn’t wrong. I went into a complete panic. \n\nShortly after this B came home to get some of his stuff... he saw me in hysterics and asked me what was wrong. I was so upset I think I yelled something like “IM FUCKING PREGNANT WITH SOMEONE I HATES BABY. MY LIFE IS RUINED.”\nHe was quiet for a moment and then just said he was going to make things right.\n\nWe didn’t talk much that night, but the next morning he told me he was going to change and that he was excited to have a baby and couldn’t wait because he wanted to spend his life with me and now we could start. I didn’t say much to him. We didn’t talk about the break up anymore.\n\nSo the past month since he found out he has been an amazing boyfriend, hasn’t drank or done drugs, has been kind and attentive and has genuinely been trying to do everything to make me happy. Hasn’t called me one name, has respected my boundaries. Basically I think this really has changed him and he wants to be a better man.... he has told his mom and his family and he talks to them about how excited he is to be a dad all the time.\n\nI called and scheduled an ultrasound for next week, which has to be done before an abortion. After the ultrasound they said it’s a pretty quick process. Within a week I can choose a medical or surgical abortion. I might JUST make it for the cut off for a medical abortion which is 9 weeks... surgical is 15.  I’m in Canada BTW so abortion is easily accessible to me.\n\nBasically the guilt is eating away at me. He has changed so much and wants this baby more than anything, but my gut is telling me I can’t risk him going back to his old ways...I can’t risk ruining my life. I feel like an awful person and want to know if I’m the asshole for considering having an abortion and just telling him I had a miscarriage.",

      "description": "I'm a 29 year old guy, and my friend, let's call her bestie, is a 30 year old girl.\n\nWe have a mutual friend who is borderline neckbeard/nice guy, has a crush on bestie, and is extremely creepy around her, to the point where he sits beside her, rubs her thigh, puts his head on her shoulder, invites her home for drinks at night etc. The thing is that she's happily engaged, which she has said many times.\n\nLast saturday we had a housewarming party for me, and both attended. Creepy friend did like he always does, and bestie was extremely uncomfortable but was otherwise nice to him, laughed and talked. More and more as the night progressed she turned to me to get away from him, which worked.\n\nAnyways, to the main point. Back on monday, or if it was tuesday, she posted a screenshot of him texting her about how nice it was to see her again and that she missed him. We both laughed about it, but this is where things apparently turned sour;\n\nI wrote \"I hope you don't think of me as shitty for saying but, but I kind of think you kind of enable his behaviour. That Creepy friend is EXTREMELY slow in getting hints, and that she needs to give him an absolute verbal asswhooping, so that he understands, and finally stops. As long as you don't make your point absolutely 110% clear that you don't like him romantically, he won't stop, because he's slow.\".\n\nI thought things were alright, as all she said was \"I thought he'd understand with my ring on my finger and all\", and I didn't hear anything more... until about half an hour ago.\n\nShe wrote that she wasn't mad, but that she was flabbergasted and disappointed that I had written that to her.\n\nI immediately felt shame, and apologised and that I had no intention of it sounding like I blamed her, just that I wanted to fix the awkwardness between them, and giving my point of view as to how to fix it.\n\nWe quickly made up and things are good again, but it still got me thinking. AITA?\n\nI am in no way blaming my actions on this, but it's still important to know. I have mild Aspergers, which makes it sometime that stuff I say or write sometimes doesn't get interpreted the way I intend it t, and this is what happened here. \n\nWhat I thought was helpful advice, as I want bestie to be comfortable around creepy, I just said what I thought would help.\n\nI have no problem being the asshole, as I felt ashamed, and I apologised profoundly, but at the same time I want to hear other people's perspective as to WHY I would be the asshole, WHY what I said was interpreted as a rude thing to say, and how I should think about it in the future so I don't repeat it. \n\nLike I told bestie, I would neve rever intentionally hurt her, but that I'm struggling socially every day and I'm learning new social rules every day and that I'm willing to learn from my mistakes as I always aim to be the most kind-hearted person I can be.

      "description": "AITA Reddit,\n\nBackground story childhood friend 1 comes over to my house last night after work for a small get together with our other childhood friend 2 who is currently living with me and my wife. We were hanging out and slamming some shots down. Childhood friend 1 gets more intoxicated than I've ever seen him to the point where I believe he may of been under the influence of more than just alcohol at this point. He was continuously talking about suicidal ideation and kept saying he needed to go to his work early in the AM and needed to leave right away but couldn't decide where he needed to leave to. I called his boss to verify that he did not in fact work in the AM however worked in the PM perfect. Childhood friend 2 recently got in a roll over as a result of similar circumstances and is the last person to tell someone not to drive under the influence and even he was a little weary at this point. All three of us were telling him we were uncomfortable with him driving ANY distance regardless of whether he's driven this intoxicated before or not childhood friend 2 already had his wake up call and refuses to drive intoxicated any more. Thank goodness. Childhood friend 1 was slurry speech, speaking erradicatelly, breaking cigarettes repeatedly trying to smoke one, could not stand up straight and kept saying he needed to leave but couldn't explain where or why and being very defensive. I pickpocketed his keys and said I was going to the bathroom. I then moved his car a few blocks of way out of LOS after repeatedly offering him a ride home from my wife who had no alcohol consumption this night. He continously refused and eventually walked home. Which I much preferred a brisk walk over never seeing him again *shrug* fast forward to today he's extremely aggressive and angry about the situation last night and refuses to communicate with any of us. \n\nTLDR: friend got too intoxicated at my house. I moved his car so he didn't jeaporodize his safety or the safety of others. AM I THE ASSHOLE? ",

      "description": "Hello Reddit, we meet again through a throwaway. Not sure how to organise this, so please tell if you find something unnecessary/confusing and I'll edit it. I'll try my best to answer questions and be unbiased.\n\nI'm 15F. And my friend, let's call her Laura, is 17F. Laura's always been really critical and sometimes very harsh with her words, sometimes towards me. I've dismissed it as just her personality, but there was one conversation that bothered me. \n\nIn a group chat, the topic was \"people who don't talk unless they have something valuable to say\", and I started to say a lot from my perspective. I basically said that it's okay to say anything as long as you're doing no harm. \n\nLaura and another friend, let's call him Noah, started to make fun of me. I usually don't mind when people insult me as a joke. Laura, however, sounded pretty serious and I felt like she was just bashing me for no reason. She said things like \"she thinks she has something valuable to say\", and after I was done, she said \"you just gave us a lecture about something we never said was wrong, and I bet it was just because you wanted to talk\". I later messaged her about it, to see why exactly she did it. She said she was just making the point that I just don't stop talking. I still didn't really understand *why*, but I brushed it off as me nitpicking.\n\nShe also likes to write, so she wrote some descriptions of group members that were supposed to be nice. Mine was about 8 lines long, but there are some parts I thought were rude:\n\n\"she hasn't read half the books or seen anywhere near the required repertoire of films for the proper level of respect.\"\n\n\"she's one of those psychopaths who actually likes maths.\"\n\n\"all you need to know about her is that she's easy to make fun of.\"\n\nI wasn't sure if I was being oversensitive, so I messaged another member of the group chat about it. Let's call her Sarah. Sarah called it \"brutal\" compared to everyone else's descriptions. Sarah said that Laura basically called me a psychopath and undeserving of respect. So I decided to confront her about it. I also asked her if she feels pressured to agree with Noah or act like him (since he does make fun of me), because I know that she has feelings for him. Her response was basically denying that, and that she gets anxious and projects on others. We went off-topic and it basically turned into me trying to suggest solutions for her problems. It was still filled with those kinda snarky or rude comments I've been mentioning. It hasn't been brought up again since.\n\nI really can't tell who's wrong here, I'm trying to see if I was hypocritical and made fun of her before or something but can't remember anything, or if she was even disrespectful at all. Regardless of whether I end up being the asshole or not, I'm not sure what the next step is.\n\nTL;DR: Friend acts snarky towards me and blames it on anxiety when confronted.",

      "description": "I couldn’t think of a better, more neutral way of putting it, but that’s essentially what happened..so yeah.\n\nI dated her for about 3 months. She was really gorgeous ,confident and free spirited. I loved how silly and bold she was, it was something that made her really unique in my book. \nThis whole thing happened a month ago. I had a really, really big presentation and I got really tensed. I had the opportunity to invite my gf to the function, and so I did, on the condition that she would not embarrass me and not drink, because she had a habit of drinking a lot during such occasions and losing control. \n\nWell, turns out she made fun of me just because she thought it was hilarious. She burped loudly when I was talking to my co workers, and told about how I didn’t even have sex because of the stress. She proceeded to ask my coworkers if they could resist her body. They were obviously uncomfortable too. The presentation ultimately went horribly bad at first because she kept making stupid silly faces backstage, but then I just ignored her for the rest of the night and all went well.\n\nFirst thing I did when we sat in the car was saying I was breaking up with her that night, she told me she was just trying to lighten my mood. I refused to let her touch me then, and dropped her off to her building. She said she wasn’t going to go till we sorted out the issue, I just told her to get out.\n Then I gave her a text message saying I was sorry for being rude to her but we weren’t compatible, and to just move on with her life.\n\nFast forward to today, I bumped into a friend of hers who said that I had been an asshole for her to break up with her for being ‘silly’ at a gathering, and that no one could believe I turned out to be such a jerk.\n\nNow I am already seeing someone, but this interaction made me question if I had indeed been a jerk. An unbiased opinion would help.",

      "description": "So at the beggining of the school year we all got added to grade messaging group. That way we could share homework, projects ect. One of the people from this group, who I shall call \"S\", added my number and started directly messaging me. It started with a simple \"Hi\". I responded with \"Hry who are you\" and the conversation flourished. When the sunbwas setting i had alreadhly spoken to her about relationships and she asked me who i liked. From our lenghtly conversation. Brief encounter at school and general same intrests i knew that i liked her. So when she asked me who i liked and i had played it off as \"Nobody\" she had said \"Oh its me isnt it\". I said yes and we slept. The next month was alright. Occasionally we would \"sext\" and talk on a call. At some point she sent me a video of her stripping. I told her she was beutiful and how good she looked and we moved on. Later in the same week i asked her if she liked me. She saidbshe really did but didnt want to date anyone. I then found out she was talking to many other boys from different schools and was sending them nudes aswell. I told her i loved her and if she loved me she would understand that i didnt want to be coming in second to some chad. Seeing that i was pretty Beta. She said it was her choice. I agreed. She lied about being raped by her ex and that i was the best guy she ever met. She asked me for my best friends number and started flirting with him.  I asked her if she liked him and she blocked me. 3 months  latershe unblocked me and lied aboitbher dad raping her. She was never touched once. She landed up treating me worse than before and made me think worse of myself. I knew she had changed in thwt time che blocked me. She was playong many boys now. I told her i was done. She sent me 2 more nudes and asked me to stay. I said i didnt want to be played like a game anymore. I stopped talking to her. That was last year. This year on regestraion day at school, i saw her mom and helped her get the correct books. I ignored S. AITA?",

      "description": "On mobile. Sorry for the formatting. \n\nLast year my girlfriend(22f) bought me(25m) a pair of sneakers for my birthday. The sneakers are pretty expensive and I had been eyeing them because they are pretty stylish. \n\nFast forward to a couple months ago when I started going to the gym. I have a pair of sneakers that I regularly wear, but occasionally I wear the gift sneakers because 1) I like to flex from time to time and 2) they are very comfortable. I didn't mention that I was wearing them to the gym because I didn't think it was a big deal, but turns out I was wrong. \n\nYesterday I sent her a picture of me mid-workout featuring the sneakers and she was livid. She said that I didn't appreciate the gift and held no value in the things she gave me. She also equated it to her wearing shoes to gave her to a construction site (she studies engineering). I was very surprised and told her that her comparison was totally off base. I explained that not only is the gym always being cleaned, but that I check and clean my sneakers once a week anyway. I also told her that while the shoes were stylishly designed, they were engineered for sports and that one day or so in the gym wouldn't really hurt. \n\nAfter a prolonged back and forth she calmed down after I  promised not to wear the sneakers back to the gym. I still think she is being a bit ridiculous, but she refused to hear me when I tell her that I don't assign value to things based on where I wear them. They're special because she gave them to me.

I can not afford to go to where she is right now and it would be difficult for me to get time off from my company. ",

      "description": " For the story I’ll call the kid I got expelled D\n\nOk so as the title explains, at my old school there was this kid who I never really liked but never did anything about it except keep my distance from him. A little backstory, this was at my old school which primarily consisted of 65% Jewish people. \n\nAnyways, at one point in the school year D started acting differently and a bunch of people told me that he started drawing swastikas on all of his papers. D was in a computer class I had and I noticed he kept looking up stuff about Hitler and the Holocaust. Now here’s where it all gets “juicy”. So in my computer class my friend (who has recently sprained his finger and just got the cast off) called D out for being anti-Semitic. At this point D proceeds I get all up in my friends face and twist him sprained finger.\n\nMy friends disengages from the situation and reports it too the teacher which leads the her finding a bunch of Anti-Semitic things in D’s computer which leads him to getting lunch detention. At lunch detention my friends notice that D keeps staring at us.\n\nSo one day in lunch as my friend walks by the lunch detention table, D told my Jewish friend that he’d kill him. At which point my friend reports D to the principal which causes at investigation where they ask me if D had harmed me or threatened me in any way. I admit I was biased because I was never very fond of D, so I said he had been acting strangely. \nWe find out the next week that D had been expelled and it was partially my fault. \n\nI saw him not too long ago and he seems too have changed a lot and he seems completely sane. I still feel really bad for getting him expelled and for causing him parents (who were lovely people) so much grief. \n",

      "description": "Her reasoning is since I’m her dependent on tax stuff, if I get paid too much she doesn’t get as much back and may even end up owing a lot that she can’t afford. Sometimes she throws that it may affect my VA benefits but absolutely refuses to look into if it would so that’s up to me to figure out. (This was Monday night and I just haven’t had time until later today to check the VA stuff) She says this is how I’m paying rent to her. \n\nMy thing is, I’m at cart pusher at a common store that’s everywhere. I’m extremely tired of being rained on and although I was fine working in the 90° and 100° weather last summer (I had just come from a job working next to a large oven in a small space) I do not want to do that again this year. I’m also extremely depressed about feeling like I’m stuck where I’m at with no future (I’m in college and still trying to figure out what I want to do) and her saying I can’t get a better job just solidifies this feeling. I put in to transfer departments a few days ago and me telling her this is what reignited this argument. \n\nSo AMITA for being mad at my mom for telling me I’m not allowed to get a better job as long as I live with her?\n\nAlso might be relevant that we don’t get along very well. I can add why if you guys want. And yes I have suggested family therapy but she refuses and blames it on my work/school schedule despite me telling her I would do whatever I need to to make time for it. As it stands I’m not talking to her when I move out. ",

      "description": " \n\nContext  : We have an incredible relationship and are very happy with each  other. Literally, the only « problem » we have in our relationship comes  back to Girlfriend’s dogs.  Boyfriend « is not very fond of dogs ». He  grew up with cats.  Girlfriend has two dogs one of whom she has had for 9  years and the other for 4. One time, girlfriend went to boyfriend’s  house with the dogs to sleep over. The dogs are accustomed to sleeping  in her bed, but they were in the living room because Boyfriend didn’t  want them in his bedroom. They ended up clearly unhappy and barking ,  which resulted in Girlfriend walking home at 3AM thinking the  relationship was doomed. As a result, we made an agreement due to the  fact boyfriend is not comfortable with dogs in his apartment (especially  in his bed). The agreement was that for each night he slept over at  Girlfriend’s place, Girlfriend would sleep at his place, without her  dogs – potentially leaving them overnight alone. Girlfriend thought once  in a Blue Moon it would be acceptable if she left late at night and  came back early. Well, the only time the she ever attempted to do this,  she came home to two very sad dogs, one of whom had puked all over and  she had to take the next day off work to clean the apartment. (It is  important to note that girlfriend has also gone out before to the very  early hours of the morning (even as late as 9AM ONCE) without them  puking).\n\nSince then, Girlfriend has  never slept at Boyfriend’s house and he has only slept at her house  because she does not feel comfortable leaving her dogs.\n\nBoyfriend is wondering if Girlfriend is the asshole for breaking the original sleeping agreement.\n\nWho  is the asshole ?  Is our relationship fucking doomed?!?!? Should, the  boyfriend, eat the dogs for breakfast? Should, the Girlfriend, hand over  the fucking keyboard?\n\nPS \\_ Am I the  asshole for insisting on typing this because English is my first  language and his is not while the keyboard is an AZERTY?\n\nPPS\\_Boyfriend is mad because I have way more karma point than him!

He didn’t have a car so my dad got him a discount on a lease for a brand new dodge dart. He then couldn’t keep up with the payments and asked me to “loan” him some money. Over several months I gave him my paychecks at work for his car, (while I was 16) as well as paying for our dates and anything else he needed.\n\nHe ended up dropping out of college and joining the military. He was payed wayyy more than our fast food job and I still bought him clothes and food and anything he wanted. He turned into a huge asshole while he was away and often called me pathetic, needy, annoying, and having low self esteem.\n\nHe later dumped me over snapchat and blocked me instantly, he couldn’t even give me a phone call and I was heartbroken. A couple months later, he hit me up and wanted to see me when he came back in town. We made plans and I took off work because I still had hope of getting back together, yet he ghosted me last minute and said he never wanted to see me again.\n\nI knew where he was staying so I went and keyed the car that my dad got him and I paid for.

One of my friends (driver) offers to drive us with his vehicle, so long as we pay for gas (all good). On the way there we had must’ve been too close to the vehicle in front of us on the highway and had a small rock hit and chip the windshield. None of us actually noticed it at the time until one of my friends (passenger) pointed it out. We went on and enjoyed our weekend.\n\nFast forward to driving back home from the festival, the chip transforms into a small crack along the bottom of the windshield, shitty, but don’t think much of it.\n\nNow fast forward to today, nearly half a year later. Me and the 2 other passengers receive a text message from the driver asking for us to help pay for the windshield replacement that he had done because he felt it was not fair that he should pay for all of it (keep in mind we hadn’t heard a word about it in ~6 months).\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking we should not have to pay for the windshield simply because we were in the vehicle at the time of the crack?

That wasn't agreed upon and I don't think it's fair that you got that money.\"\n\nThere was a lot that was bad about that relationship, so maybe I just have leftover anxiety, but I've been feeling guilty for requiring him to pay half of the rent starting at month 3 when I hadn't told him rent was an expectation. I kinda thought it was common sense that if you live somewhere, you gotta pay something.\n\nHe never paid for food or water, either, and the grocery bill was easily $200 more a month because the dude could eat. Do I owe him the rent money (that's already been spent on rent, so I'd have to save up to send the $2200) back since I didn't initially tell him he'd have to pay rent? ",

Just whenever we don’t get a rush is when we can go to the bathroom or take a smoke break. Downtime is when we should be cleaning, restocking shelves, checking pumps, and other smaller tasks.

      "description": "So 3years ago my bf and I separated for like 1 month if so long because I just felt stifled in the relationship. So within that supposedly short space of time, he started talking to this girl from work. I had no idea about this and I still don't fully know the time table of their friendship. When we got back together I went on his computer just to browse some forums as I left my laptop at home. Upon opening it, he had his photo gallery opened and I saw snapchat pics between them and also this very long love letter thanking her for being so awesome in a nutshell. When I found it I flipped out and he had to leave work early. He said he was bored and he really had no feelings for her because I was the only one he wanted. \n\nWe did not get back together right away because for some reason I just felt he was lying. If it was nothing he had a whole 3 months to tell me and he didn't. He said no time was the right time.\n\nFast forward a couple months later, I saw he was checking up on her on social media. I stressed that I didn't appreciate what he was doing and it really made think he was lying to me again about not having feelings. He said he wouldn't do it again and I left it as that.\n\nNow Monday of this week, he came across a post I made on a forum about a crush. It was a tarot reading thing and I just posted in it for shits and giggles but it wasn't anything serious. I posted a letter of my fake crush and he THOUGHT I was talking about this guy who liked me during the period we were broken up for. The guy and I had nothing but he always assumed something happened. The guy lives in NY and I live far across the globe. \n\nSo I told him I knew he still looked up the girl and I actually didn't. I pretended I did because for some reason he has been moving kinda weird with me. You know if someone is guilty they try to project things on to you? Well turns out he is still looking her up and when I asked him he said he was bored, again. I told him it was entirely disrespectful for him to keep doing that even when I greatly expressed that it was very suspicious and makes me uncomfortable.\n\nHe still saw nothing was wrong so I broke up with him. It's been a week and he has not reached out or contacted me. Am I the asshole for breaking up?",

My last final is next Wednesday, and I’m going home on Saturday for winter break. \n\nWinter break lasts a little over a month, and I’m honestly not looking forward to it. It’ll be nice to see my family but I really think a month is too much. I’m just going to be sitting around super bored in my small town with nothing to do when I’m used to the city and being able to do whatever I want. \n\nUsually when I’m sitting around bored like this I get super depressed and basically end up just sitting in my room crying because of how bored and lonely I am. My family basically does nothing, they just let me sit in my room all day. And I don’t really have any high school friends I could hang out with(nor would I want to hang out with them). I don’t have my drivers license so I can’t even drive anywhere when I want. \n\nI want to go back to school maybe after New Years. I’ll have spent the holidays with my family, and then I can come back to the city and do what I want. I’ll have no classes, and my annoying roommate won’t be there, so I can really get some peace and relaxation for 3 weeks. Yeah my friends will be at home but I love hanging out by myself, so it’s perfect.\n\nI tried to lie and say the semester starts earlier but my mom found out the truth. Now I’m thinking about saying a job that I want starts early so I have to come back early if I want it, but I feel bad for lying this much. If I just say I want to come back early for alone time, they won’t listen because they’re strict and value their desire to see me/know what I’m doing all the time than more than my desires for independence. WIBTA for making up some reason to leave earlier?\n\nTldr: Winter break at college is a month, but I don’t want to be at home bored in my small town with my strict parents for that long when I could be chilling in the city. WIBTA if I lied for some reason to go back to school earlier?",

I AM kinda awkward though.\n\nNot sure if this is valid information but I am Bisexual or a Bicurious lesbian and am out of the closed. She is homophobic. Unfortunately her being homophobic couldn't be the reason for my discomfort around her, since I always hated hugging her, but came out when I was 14-15 yo. All my friends love their moms, some are even best friends with their moms.\n\nMy mom and I can't stand each other, but sometimes when she has not been particularly painful to be around and has even been nice, I would think she deserves a hug. I would hug her then feel terrible.\n\nI need help. Am I a dipshit for not loving my mom unconditionally?",

      "description": "I'm a business student at a US University. Every year, the summer internship cycle gets more and more competitive. After about 20 declines, I finally received an offer for a company that I feel neutral about. \n\nThe problem is, they only gave me about 5 days to decide whether I wanted to accept or decline. It's an extremely large corporation, not a small business. AITA for potentially wasting an employers time and money on onboarding, even though I may pull out at some point?.\n\nI'm well aware that this will definitely burn a bridge, but I also know that I'm spending thousands of dollars on tuition and want to get the perfect opportunity post-graduation. It's a bit of a \"bird in the hand\" situation. ",

COP: (agressive) YEAH IS THAT WHAT SHOULD BE DOING? Me: Well that's just what I do COP: YEAH?! ME: Have a safe night sir (should've said \"officer\")\n\nI rolled up my window. He then agreesively backed up. I assume to write down my license plate number?\n\n I understand the cop could have had a rough day.... but the road I was on.... and everywhere... has a problem with people not using blinkers.

      "title": "AITA for thinking that this constitutes being a bad friend?",
      "description": "My friend and I used to be in a romantic relationship, but after breaking up about ten months ago we decided that our friendship was still mutually important and we would continue to be close friends. Part of it was necessity, as we were both still on the lease for the same apartment (we live with other roommates, not just the two of us). That being said, we were honestly very close friends and for the most part things had been fine and even great. \n\nA few months ago, he made a few friends at work. Not a problem - it’s great to make new friends. I made new friends as well. Soon after, however, the behavior that I’m unhappy about began. We would make plans together like normal. However, those plans would sometimes result in two scenarios. \n\nFirst scenario: \nHe would forget (according to him; I honestly don’t think it was “intentional” either but I can’t read minds so who knows?) about the plans he made with me and make new plans with someone. It was usually the same friend that he’d make these new plans with. \n\nPersonally, if I were to forget about a plan and accidentally make a new one, I would apologize to the second person and explain that I had already committed to doing something else and either offer to do it another time or ask the first person if they would be willing to do something the three of us depending on the situation. His solution was to just say “sorry” and continue on with the second plan, leaving me out.\n\nSecond scenario: \nHe would go spend time with that same friend from the first scenario either earlier in the same day or the night before something we had planned to do. That itself isn’t a problem at all. Make all the plans with friends you want. However, when I would express concern that he frequently got very drunk when he spent time with this person and we had plans coming up, he’d insist he “wouldn’t be drinking” or “wouldn’t get drunk” and it would be fine. It turns out, that wasn’t usually the case. He would often get drunk and then be so drunk or hungover when he got back that he would have to back out of the plans he had made with me. Sometimes he’d come back hours later than expected and it would be too late regardless of whether he was drunk.\n\nWhen I started pointing out that he was doing this, he didn’t see a problem with it. He seems to think that because we live in the same apartment, it doesn’t matter if we have plans to do something because I’m just there already. In my opinion, living in the same apartment doesn’t mean that you’re spending time with or actively maintaining a friendship with somebody and isn’t an excuse for backing out of or refusing to make plans.\n\nHis solution to this became rather than making plans with me, telling me “no promises” when I’d invite him to do something. He was saying “no promises” that he wouldn’t forget about the plans and go out with the other friend instead, or that he didn’t want to make a plan in case said other friend asked him later on to do something at the time I had invited him to do something.  \n\nLater on, I mentioned I’d be interested in meeting this friend sometime since they seem to hang out a lot and they sounded interesting. His response was that that wouldn’t be possible, because this person didn’t like me. I don’t know this person, and our only mutual friend is him, so I asked what he said that would make this person not like me. He told me that he didn’t say anything, but then later changed his story to say that he didn’t actually know what he said at all because he had been drunk. \n\nWhen I have a gripe with him, I usually keep it private and only bring it up with him because I think that talking about it with others in most cases would be unwarranted and I don’t want friends of mine to form opinions of him, particularly negative ones, through secondhand things rather than from actual interactions they have with him.\n\nAs far as I can tell, I am the only person that he calls his “friend” that he does these things to, and he otherwise acts completely normal with me outside of doing these things. Am I the asshole for being upset about and thinking that him doing this is acting like a poor friend?",

      "description": "I popped out in my lunch hour to buy a new pair of shoes from an independent store I’ve been frequenting for years. My podiatrist recommended the store originally, my purchase history is in their database, and the consultants who work there really know their stuff and give great advice. I happily handed over the price on the price tag for the new design the consultant recommended.  \n\nI then wandered over to the local shopping center, where I happened to see a sign outside a chain sports shoe store saying “50% off all Asics”. They were selling the identical shoes I’d literally just bought for over £50 off.  I asked if they had my size in stock, and they did.  \n\nSo after some hesitation, I traipsed back over to the independent store and said “I hate to do this, but...” [showed them a photo I’d taken of the price tag of the same shoes on sale a few hundred meters away].  The consultant held his hands up in the air and looked completely downcast, “oh our friends at the center are at it again”.  \n\nHe ultimately offered to price match and refund me the difference on the grounds he’d rather keep me as a customer than not, and said he could completely see where I was coming from but bemoaned their tactics and explained it wouldn’t make them any money.  \n\nIt wasn’t like I had a problem paying the full price, and I value the service in that independent store, so I feel really shitty about having asked - but at the same time, I’m a consumer and not a charity.

      "description": "Background: Together three years, we were close friends for a year before that. He's been smoking for like 15 years, but has been (allegedly) trying to quit for as long as I've known him. Vaping is the thing that helps him the most (He says he's tried the gum, the patch, etc) and I have absolutely no problem at all with him vaping indoors. Cigarette smoke gives me headaches and it also emotionally hurts me that I can't even sit close to him after he smokes\n\nCurrent situation: we don't live together, but we spend most of our time at his place. It is a no smoking apartment and he has lived there for a while, but he recently decided he didn't care and was going to smoke indoors since he would probably be losing his security deposit anyway. He still claims to want to quit smoking, occasionally mentions he has set a quit date, but no success. \n\n\nWhy I think I might be TA: he knows that cigarette smoke bothers me. I asked him to smoke outside and he acted like he was doing me a huge favor for obeying the terms of his lease and showing me what I feel is basic courtesy. He only smokes outside when I'm around, like his house doesn't smell if I don't see him smoke. I've asked him to brush his teeth after he smokes and he said of course, that's easy. But he doesn't do it and acts like I'm making a fuss when I remind him. I'm worried he'll think he can smoke indoors if/when we move in together.\n\nThis is the only topic we struggle with like this. We can talk about money, sex, communication problems, or whatever. We listen to each other, behaviors change if needed, nobody's feelings are hurt. But he acts like I'm being unreasonable when I try to talk to him about his smoking. \n\nAITA? Are my expectations too high?",

      "description": "Posted on confession and confessions but someone said it might be more relevant here.\n\nIt was my first year at university. I was thrilled. Honestly, I was a bit scared. Having gone through my college years of GAD (generalised anxiety disorder) and hardly ever attending, I scrambled together some mediocre grades and got a place at a University. I made some friends during freshers, but nobody really close, these friends didn’t really invite me to anything, you know? I always had to ask if somethings happening, didn’t help they were in a different flat. Anyways, after freshers, I made some close friends, two people I would consider my best friends, back then.\n\nWe formed our friends group and constantly invited new people and made friends. I was a virgin and kiss-less at the time, so I would constantly be on the subreddit “Seduction” to do research and put the stuff I learned into practise. I finally lost my virginity to a girl. I was on top of the world. I did more stuff with other girls. I had an amazing friends group. Sure, there was drama at times…But overall, it was fucking awesome.\n\nWell, it was fucking awesome until girl A joined the group. Now, whenever there were girls joining our group, I never really interacted with them because people would joke around like “oh he’s trying to get with her “. So, I pretty much just ignored her. Friend A on the other hand, he loves to flirt with girls and he’s extremely confident. He sort of taught me a lot that I know today. Anyways, girl A had a boyfriend, but friend A didn’t really care and just kept talking/flirting with her. Turns out that she was on a long break with this boyfriend and things weren’t going too well. So, friend A decides he can potentially get in there. Now, I genuinely loved Friend A, and I wanted the best for him, so I wing manned him a lot. Friend A and girl A became quite romantically involved, no sex or anything, but a lot of kissing. Friend A was obsessed with her. He fell in love within a week. But so, did she. Then, when friend A confessed this love, she also returned it. She told Friend A everything he wanted to hear. Friend A obviously wanted a relationship but she didn’t want to officially break up with her long-term boyfriend. \n\nShe constantly told Friend A things such as: you’re the best thing ever, you’d be the best boyfriend. You know? Stuff like that. She’d say she loves him and he’d say it back. Then, one day, she decides things are going too far right? She has a boyfriend that she’s on a “break” with, so she decides to tell friend A that she just wants to be friends after saying she loves him. Friend A is distraught and assumes she’s gotten back with her BF. She had not. Friend A decides to just be friends with her. They’d still hang out, and she’d kiss him and flirt with him. Bizarre. I was fully involved at this point, trying to sort out this thing. I honestly wanted them to just be together because they were perfect, and I loved seeing my mate so happy. Numerous times over, she’d say she just wants to be friends with him and then he’d get mad and scream at her, and then the next day she’d tell him she loves him. Over and over again. A complete cycle of bullshit. Lmao.\n\nOne night, we’re all out clubbing (like the full group of more people), and we’re all having fun, but obviously them two are having drama, so Friend A storms off, and then Girl A starts flirting with me and then another friend breaks up a moment where we’re about to kiss (we were both intoxicated). Anyways, that night, friend A didn’t see any of that, but at one point he’s screaming at her and then storms off in the middle of the street and Girl A is crying in the middle of the road. I genuinely felt really bad for her because I never could fully understand why he would get so aggressive. I talked to her about it, we spoke with friend A, and everything was sorted, they were just going to be friends.\n\nFriend A was constantly a bit of a dick to me at times. But he became even more so. Maybe he blamed me for ending their “relationship”? I don’t know. Me and the whole group sort of disliked him because he made a lot of drama and was a dick to people. After that night where everything was sorted, girl A starts messaging me a lot, and being quite flirty, which I flirted back to. She invited me to her room like the next day and we just chilled and stayed up all night chatting about life, nothing romantic. I asked her about the moment we nearly kissed in the club, but she claimed she doesn’t remember. She kept constantly inviting me to the library, which I accepted. After having bad anxiety for 2 years, and not being able to leave my room, I decided to not turn down opportunities, I should be grateful that I can leave my house without throwing up, feeling anxious, head spinning, feeling tired and unwell, so I accepted every offer from people at university. Friend A was extremely jealous that I was hanging out with girl A. We both told him nothing is going on and we’re just friends. Times pass, she becomes my gym buddy, my library buddy, my hangout buddy. We would constantly message each other. We would flirt for a joke. And then, when we went clubbing, we would get drunk and dance together, and then I’d lean in and so would she and then she’d usually pull away and tell me we can’t kiss. This happened a lot. Why didn’t I just get the message right? Well, there were tons of mixed signals. She’d grind on me at the bar, sometimes she’d even lean in herself. We’d hold hands and hug and flirt with many sex jokes. Now this whole time, I was constantly battling myself, telling myself she’s just a friend and I shouldn’t do anything. She then goes and tells friend A the other reason she hasn’t kissed me is because of him. Kind of a mixed signal to be honest.\n\nAnyways, we’d video call all the time, still flirt, she’d tell me to stop flirting, and I’d stop and then she’d flirt with me so I continued again. One night, we were drunk and in the same bed and cuddling and says fuck it and we start dry humping but then she stays stop so we stop. It’s like, when I’m sober I’m like ok she’s just a friend, no problem, girls and guys can be friends. But when we’re both drunk, the barrier goes and we sort of lose control. Friend A hated all of this and heard about it, and seen it all. He called me a dick friend, and I always knew it was wrong what I was doing, considering he was still in love with her this whole time, but it didn’t stop me because she wasn’t an object and she could make her own decisions. I don’t even know my own thought pattern to be honest. I just sort of went with it. He always told us if anything happened, he’d never speak to us ever again.\n\nSo, there was a holiday break, I go back to my country and we’re constantly video calling. And I badly missed her, so I told her that I liked her in more than a friend way because I don’t just miss my friends. She tells me she doesn’t feel the same way. I respect that and move on quite quickly, but I just continue to be her friend. Friend A, tells us that he doesn’t love her anymore and we can do anything. The next day, I arrive back at university and there’s a little group party. My parents gave me alcohol so I said I’d share it with her. We drank a 1/3 of a bottle of prosecco and a 1/3 bottle of wine each. Then, I drank her some of her schnapps, which was already mostly gone. She was wearing quite a casual outfit and then she asked me if she should change and I told her no there’s no need. She then strangely changed her outfit from casual into a dress. I wondered like, is there a reason for this, I don’t know… \n\nAnyways, we head from the party to another friends flat, we’re holding hands and talking about how “coupley” we are. We get there, and we both start drinking some more schnapps. Maybe an hour or so later, I offer out my hand and take her into the corridor, and I lean in to kiss her, she tells me no and then a second later starts dry humping me. So I lean in again, and she tries to move away, so I grab her hand and block her path and ask her why not. She then storms away and begins crying. She comes back with her other girl friend visibly upset. I tell her I’m sorry for upsetting her and I leave the party and go back to my flat as I didn’t want to create any drama and ruin the atmosphere. She then video calls me and tells me she’s coming to my flat. I meet her in the corridor and she says to go to my room. We’re lying on the bed just talking about random stuff and our friends come and check on us and then they leave. \n\nI start drinking some vodka toffee on my side. She goes into the toilet and says she feels sick, so I offer to hold her hair back( like I’ve done plenty of times beforehand). There was once a time she was so drunk that I had to carry her home. She tells me to get out as she doesn’t want me to see her throwing up, which I assumed was weird as I’ve seen her throw up before. Anyways, I just sit by the door and I’m not really hearing her throw up, so I walk in and then sit next to her. She gives me a hug and then lies on my chest. She tells me I’m comfy. We get into the bed and she asks for one of my shirts as she likes sleeping in a shirt, so I comply. We’re giggling and laughing and having banter and then we start snuggling in bed. I start escalating on her like the seduction posts I’ve read. She’s obliging and next minute we’re kissing each other on the neck and dry humping. I try to kiss her on the lips but she turns her head away, so I ask why, she tells me she’ll catch feelings, so I kiss her on the cheek, which she then says “you’d be so good”, idk about you, but I took that as a continue… I continue to kiss her on the neck and she’s also kissing me back. I have a foot fetish. She doesn’t know, but we’ve joked in the past about her not knowing my fetish. So, I decide t",

So if I'm worth $31/hr, I should put 77% effort into my job. But that's unfair to the children who need my help.\n\nI'd only put in 77% of effort if there's a net societal benefit to the person dying. That usually means if the person is an organ donor.

Last semester, he took a \"business law\" class for business students (this is relevant). \n\nA few months ago, I stopped providing real answers when my husband would ask me about how work was going or if I had anything exciting come up.  He's always had a tendency to try to tell me how to resolve situations at work, which is super annoying because he has no idea what he's talking about, but it's gotten so much worse since he took this stupid business law class.  He now thinks that he is an expert on law and lectures me about it.  I wasn't even telling him detailed stuff about my cases.  Our conversations would go like this:\n\n&gt;Me: I have to go to court tomorrow.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Him: State court or federal court?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: State court.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Him: Why don't you remove the case to federal court?  You know, you can do that by (insert long lecture that is littered with mistakes).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Because the federal court doesn't have jurisdiction and, even if it did, I wouldn't want to do that because (explanation).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Him: Well that's really stupid. (Insert more lecturing).\n\nI told him to knock it off a few times but he said that he was \"just trying to help.\" So, I stopped telling him anything about work.  I know that probably wasn't very mature of me but that's what I did.\n\nThis was working out great for me until last night, when we had dinner with my parents.  My mom brought up a recent win that I had mentioned to her in passing but had not told my husband about.  He handled it very gracefully while we were at dinner but when we got home, he made it clear that he was very hurt that I hadn't told him about this.  Now I feel like an asshole because I prioritized my comfort over his feelings but at the same time I really do not want to go back to listening to his long lectures.  AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We got an apartment together and well our relationship went south. We are no longer in a relationship. My bedroom is the living room meaning I have no bed just the couch my daughters have the other bedroom. I go to college full time and work full time. My so called friend almost never does anything with me. We are past the point of being sour about the end of our relationship so it isn’t like we fight about that but it is hurtful to me who is alone here with no family or friends that she is forever going out with other friends/family and never invites me along to do anything with just her or her and others all the while proclaiming to still be my best friend. Finally I had enough and told her yeah I don’t care I don’t want to hear about it because it is hurtful and that in my opinion she wasn’t being a good friend to me. She then responds all mad and tells me she has to live her life yada yada and acts like I am not supposed to be bothered by this. Now when I say she never invites me this is not an exaggeration.

      "description": "My roommate always complains about being overweight and how he can never get guys and how much he hates being fat he never shuts up about it. Ever. It's so annoying. I also should state I would call us kinda friends, not just two guys who live together. \n\nSo today we where walking back from class together and he was complaining about how no guys will hook up with him because he's fat and he just wants to be skinny (they also don't go out with him because he outs people in our homophobic college, and has already hooked up with every gay and even some straight men in our area) and then suddenly I look next to me and he isn't there, he has stopped to take the elevator. We are only on the second floor going down and he has no problems with his legs yet He always always takes the elevator.\n\nI tell him \"hey why don't we take the stairs they're right here and that elevator is super slow\" and he says \" why you got nowhere to be\" I groan and say something along the lines of \"you know you should be taking the stairs\" to which he says \"oh yeah why is that huh?\" And I say \"because you're fat\".\n\nI feel like I should note, he isn't just \"overweight\" or \"big boned\" he is undeniably unhealthily fat. To me, when it isn't called for, it is very rude to say it, but it's also just a fact and it's stupid to pretend like it isn't. He was also literally just saying it about himself.\n\nSo he gets upset with me saying he can do what he wants and so I get upset and say something along the lines of \"yeah, you can do what you want, but when you choose to eat ramen multiple times every day, get drunk multiple days a week, and refuse to do so much as use the stairs when it comes to excersize, then I don't want to hear you complain all day about how hard it is, you could change if you wanted to with minimal effort and you don't because you're lazy\". \n\nNow he is really upset with me and doesn't want to talk to me. Obviously I know loosing weight is hard, and if he even went to the gym like twice a week or even tried to eat healthier I wouldn't care about him complaining so much, but he does absolutely nothing, and I see nothing wrong with telling him the truth about it especially when he complains all the time and can't seem to comprehend that there's a connection between his habits and his weight.\n\n",

Maybe a 45 minute drive at most. Thing is, none of us are particularly close. But we want to change that. And my brothers have invited me to go to a hockey game they will pay for this Saturday. \n\nThing is, I reserve Saturdays for my \"weekly\" dungeons and dragons game. It's been a couple weeks since we played, and everyone wants to continue as we left on a pretty big cliffhanger. \nAnd to add to it, we have a good military friend joining the game who is stationed in Korea. And leaving in a couple weeks. \n\nI know I want to hang out with all of them, but I have absolutely no interest or desire to see a hockey game. And I cant invite them to DnD, as its cramped enough as is. \n\nAm I the asshole for turning town free tickets to a hockey game with my brothers for dnd? ",

      "description": "I’ll try and summarize this the best I can. So, my best friend (at the time) and I had a falling out a few years ago after 6 years of friendship. The reason doesn’t really matter, there were fights leading up to it as well. We were becoming different people and less compatible as friends. She moved away, and we never talked about what happened or reconciled. I look back on our friendship with fond memories and cherish the times we had together, but I’m happier without her in my life and I think she feels the same.\n\nI now find out her mother is dying of cancer. Her mom has battled cancer multiple times in the past while we were friends, but now it’s severe and there really is little hope left. A few weeks ago, she invited me to the Facebook group they are using to accept donations for a last-resort alternative therapy treatment and give everyone updates. I’m going to send a check of a few hundred dollars to show my support, but I kind of feel bad not saying anything directly to her or her mother along with it?\n\nI was close with her family, especially her mom. I basically lived at their house throughout high school, and took trips with them to their hometown and hung out with all the cousins, grandmas, family friends, etc. Being so close at one point, I feel guilty not reaching out and giving my condolences to my former friend. We haven’t spoken in over two years, and I’m afraid if I reach out it will open a door to rekindle a friendship that I’m not willing to have again. I know it sounds harsh, but I know that is what is best for me.\n\nSo, my dilemma is that I feel guilty either way and I’m not sure what the right thing is to do in this situation. I would like to send my condolences, but I don’t want to open a door to friendship (which I’m not sure she even would want, it’s just a possibility I must consider). But I also feel guilty staying silent with all that is going on. I feel like if I was someone on the outside looking in, objectively, I would think that when someone is dying all past shit should be put aside and do what you can for that person. But it’s just so much more complicated than that. Should I reach out to the friend? Should I reach out directly to the mom? Would reaching out only to the mom and not the friend seem more petty than anything? AHHHH HELP.\n\nSo, AITA for staying silent about my ex-best friend’s mom dying of cancer?",

We are really great friends and I can even drop a joke here or there about the rejection with no awkwardness or anything.\n\nNow that I'm friends with her however, I met her sister and WOW, she is (in my personal opinion) better than Sarah in every way (not to say Sarah isn't great). I am super crushing hard on her right now, and want to ask her out. Really, she is the girl of my dreams.

      "description": "I guess some backstory needed. Without too much detailes, some time ago I made a mobile game, a clicker that was reletevely succusfull, it gives me about 12$ a day (and a bit more after the launch). For you it may not be a lot, but in my country it is more than some ppl make by working whole day. All the drawing were done by my good friend free, but I still took him to cinema and pizza after the launch, coding was done by another friend for some cash that I promised to pay after the release (and I did). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy am I telling  all that? Becouse my in laws were like \"hey, your sil draw and is studing as a programmer, make next game with her\" they thought that is was really easy and would give her a lot of opportunities. She also really wanted to be part of it, she was really exited, really wanted financial independence (she is 16 years old). I was a bit skeptical since I already gave her some really easy stuff to do for a lot of money and she was too unreliable to do that. But I had to agree since now I don't have money for freelancers and my friends are busy while project is bigger. Anyway, I was really generous in my opinion and offered her 50 of earnings if she does coding and art, Ill do the rest (balance, publishing). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime goes on, she is unable to do the coding part for all kind of reasons. Ok, I I'll do it myself in that game engine where you can make a game without coding. Despite having real job, wife that needs attention somehow I managed to learn that engine, that she, a very clever (as said by my in laws) girl that literally has all day as her free time couldn't (no collage for now). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore time goes on, she is unable to finish anything, when she doesn't like the way something is drawn she takes a fucking 3 hour rest. It came to the point when she literally opens photoshop, does something for 10 mins and calls it a day. After that she is just chilling in social networks, not even studying. I should mentioned that all this time I reminded her that she needs to work, but she would just roll her eyes. Meanwhile I have finished almost half of my game AND STILL HAD TIME TO JUST CHILL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI a few days ago I gave her a deadlines for some arts that I need, she asked \"and what if don't fit in it'? I said that ill find an artist who will. Knowing that she will ignore my warning I started looking for an artist. I found a girl that had style that I wanted, poor soul was so exited that she suggested to work for exposure (yeah, paradise choosing begars lol) of course I insisted on actually paying. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I expected, my sil failed to finish what I asked for, and I said that she is no longer part of my team, no one actually expected me to kick her out, I guess my bad for being a bit soft in the past. Now she doesn't speak with me, and all my in laws are mad at me and act as if I have done something unbelievably bad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  TL;DR Started making game with sister in law, she didn't do anything, kicked her out, everyone is pissed at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n P.S. The girl that I hired does great job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Often times there is some excuse offered as a pretext before the story about why it was purchased - \"Oh, it was just the change from the 5 when I got a coffee.\" or so on.\n\nI'll often respond by simply telling him that he probably shouldn't purchase those, that in the long run he will lose money on them. \n\nAnd he will usually respond by saying some logical fallacy - there are plenty of those.

      "description": " \n\nSo my former friend, who I'll call \"E\" had some codependency issues. I knew this from the start and did what I could to accommodate without jeopardizing things I wanted to do like screensharing if I just wanted to play video games or link the vid I was watching on Youtube so we could discuss it.\n\nRecently, another friend showed me Pokemon on Minecraft and I joined a public server and started up a breeding ranch for pokemon (the one thing I've always wanted to do in pokemon games!). Well I met a few other breeders who wanted to start a group ranch and I accepted b/c I got a lot of jobs and spreading out with a few others would make it a lot easier. The ranch was going to be massive and would take at least one week if not two.\n\nI made a server on Discord for the new group so that we could all hop in and out of voice chat when available b/c we're all in different timezones. I added E to the server too so that they wouldn't feel left out even though they couldn't play due to shoddy internet. We did our best to talk about other things aside from building, but a lot of the conversation ended up on making the ranch.\n\nE got upset with me and asked if I could go to private call with everyone so I could screen share. I told them that it wasn't possible b/c of the timezone differences since a call would literally call everyone's mobile devices or laptops and cause them inconvenience. They attempted to guilt trip me and accused me of being unfair and unwilling and left the server. I was too tired to deal with it at the moment so I took a deep breath and let it go.\n\nNext day E sends me messages saying I was in the wrong and needed to apologize because my refusal had hurt them. Again, I stated I wasn't refusing. I literally couldn't do it b/c I had to think of everyone else b/c it was a group project and that E was in the wrong to have accused me and attempted to guilt trip me like that and now go off on me when I'd done nothing wrong. E shouted that they weren't asking me to move the sun and moon, just that everyone be in a private call so I could screenshare. I again told E that that wasn't possible. E said they refused to apologize and wanted me to apologize for hurting them. I had said previously that I was sorry that they were hurt, but that I would not take blame b/c I'm not responsible for their internet making it difficult to place the game. E basically said that wasn't good enough.\n\nAs someone who just got out of a toxic relationship, I said that I wasn't going to take blame for something I didn't do and said goodbye.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Throwaway because my wife knows my main account.\n\nMy wife and I have been together for 6 years. We recently bought our first home together after living in an apartment for the past 3 years. She’s going to school for a PhD in biology and is doing great, and I just landed a job as a CPA while I finish my military contract. Everything is perfect... well, almost.\n\nWife has always had reptiles. She had them before I met her, and it is something she is extremely passionate about. She had about 5 snakes, 5 geckos, and a group of communal frogs. She takes great care of them and dedicates a good chunk of her time to them each day.\n\nI was never a huge fan of her creepy crawlies, but she never made me care for them and paid for them all herself so I didn’t mind. I had absolutely nothing to do with them. \n\nThat brings us to our current issue... Wife is pregnant. It’s not unwanted and we’re both very excited, albeit nervous. \n\nI don’t want to bring kids into a household with so many reptiles (possibility of bites, diseases such as salmonella, etc), she is adamant that her reptiles are staying. She said that our kids do not have to interact with or be around the reptiles if I didn’t want them to, but she isn’t getting rid of them because they’re her “pets” and she’s attached to them. We had quite a big argument about this. \n \nShe argued that her reptiles are kept in enclosures that the kids can’t access, in a room that is easily locked, and she is very careful about hygiene and washing her hands after interacting with her reptiles. She also claimed none of her reptiles are dangerous or venomous, so they pose no threat.\n\nI simply don’t feel comfortable with our kids growing up in a house full of reptiles.\n\nAfter our argument, I was angry and ended up putting all of her reptiles on Craigslist to be rehomed. She went away for a few days to take care of something for school and bada bing, bada boom... her reptiles were gone.\n\nShe came home, blew up at me, broke down crying, and asked how I could do this to her. She asked me if I rehomed her first snake, which she’s had since she was 17 years old and raised from a baby. I told her all of them had been rehomed. \n\nShe acted like I killed her dog. She demanded I give her the info of the buyer, and I did, but it seems unlikely that she’ll get any of them back.\n\nShe’s threatening divorce over this. I am at a loss. They’re *reptiles*. They’re not cats or dogs, they don’t bond with their owners. She’s refusing to see my side of the situation and is treating me like some sort of monster.\n\nReddit, AITA?

      "description": "So, a little backstory to this. I had lice in middle school and my friend from back then noticed and told me that I had lice, and I was super grateful for her telling me that. I got all the lice out but I have an irrational fear of getting lice again so every time I talk to someone, new people or not, I always check their hair while talking to them if I see any lice crawling in the persons hair.\n\nSo, now I work at a desk job and yesterday, while I was talking to a female co worker at her desk, I saw an adult lice crawling in her hair. Ive seen lice up close so I knew what that was immediately after I spotted it.  I honestly froze up and I made up a lie that I got sick all of a sudden to leave her desk.After I finished talking to her, I went to my desk and I was thinking what should I do.  Tell her or not tell her?\n\nI went on lunch and I smoked a blunt while thinking on what I should do, thinking about my coworkers and not wanting to happened like that episode in The Office with the lice outbreak\n\nSo I told my co worker to come with me and get a snack at the break room so that we can talk. While mid way of walking there, I told her “ So, I wanna tell you something but I want you to know that  before I tell you, I want you to know that it took me a lot of guts to say this and Im not trying to come at you in a rude way or in a negative way but I think you might have lice. “\n She asked me why do I think that and I then proceeded to tell her about how I also had it and that I can spot them easily now. She didn’t react that much, she just said okay and the walk to our desk was quiet. That day she left without saying good bye but I didn’t think much of it. I still thought we were on good terms\n\nToday, she didn’t talk to me at all and she asked my best friend ( who also works with us and also knows about me seeing the lice in our co workers hair)  “ Why did Gm205 tell me that I had lice? Because I don’t “ and she walked away\n\nI thought I went with the best option, but my co worker thinks otherwise. I honestly don’t think I did anything wrong but I kinda wanna know if telling her was the best thing to do.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my co worker she has lice? \n\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend is opposed to me getting a motorcycle, at least for the present time. We live in a large city with notably bad traffic, it is admittedly dangerous to ride a motorcycle in this city. (Or anywhere.) However, one of the nice things about a bike is that you can lane split and get places faster, which would be very helpful for me as I am taking night college classes. I have to get across town after work in a hurry. Also, I'm a basic bro, I've always wanted a motorcycle.\n\nWe don't share finances and I can easily afford the motorcycle and the additional insurance for it. He's not against the concept in general, but we are planning to move to a smaller city in a few years, and he says he'll sign off on the decision then. \n\nWIBTA if I bought a motorcycle despite his objection? I get it, he cares about my safety, but at the same time, I've always wanted a motorcycle, I can afford it, I'm a good safety conscious rider. I always planned to buy a motorcycle someday, but now seems like a good time because of school and my tight schedule.\n\n(Why can't I just leave work early, you ask? The answer is, I can and I do, I can set my own hours and nobody is really allowed to say boo about it. However, it's still a job and I need it for the next few years, sometimes I get stuck working late because my coworkers and vendors decide to shit the bed 5PM and I need to fix it by the next morning. I work as hard as I can to prevent bed-shittings and I can come in early to fix things too, but still, cutting traffic time in half would be a huge help.)",

      "title": "AITA for controlling my partner's drinking?",
      "description": "My partner has had an unpredictable drinking problem for the last 5-6 years. When we first started dating and went out either just us or with friends, I noticed how fast drinks would be consumed and then how quickly it could escalate: blackout, sleepwalking outside of buildings in his underwear, punch windows and get cuts, try to climb out of moving cars, and just in general become an entirely different person. \n\nAfter writing it off as him being a \"bad drunk\" I decided we needed to have some rules so I wouldn't have to worry if he went out with friends. Before this ever got a chance to be discussed, the cops were called on one of the more unruly times my partner was wandering around drunk in our apartment complex. \n\nWe decided together this couldn't go on any longer and decided that he couldn't be trusted to drink alone, drink more than 3 drinks in a social setting, and had to be open about where he kept alcohol (like not in a shoe box under our bed so I couldn't find it). \n\nAt first, he was super great with everything, told his friends how much he'd changed, loved that he could remember nights better and I was happy since my anxiety and worry wasn't through the roof when he'd go out. Well as time passed, the \"rules\" were more guidelines and slowly but surely he stopped following them. I found empty bottles hidden around the apartment, he'd come home drunk and deny it, or he'd stay with friends who enabled the behavior and thought I was being a prude. \n\nThis has led to many huge fights about how I can't trust him if he keeps lying to me about drinking alone or when he's out. He has said that I am being controlling of his drinking, that I'm trying to keep the rules around as a power move of control. \n\nLast night was the final straw after I saw that he went to a gas station, chugged a bota box, threw it in a dumpster so I wouldn't find it and was trashed the entire night and doesn't remember a thing. He left the door open so my cats could have ran away, broke things from stumbling around the apartment and persistently lied until he knew he couldn't and told me about the bota box. \n\nIt's getting to the point where if it hasn't changed over the last 5 years, I feel like it will never get better and I might have to consider leaving the relationship.\n\nAITA for wanting to have some sort of boundary to his drinking habits, like going sober or the previous rules? I'm open to any and all advice, I just really want to do the right thing and if I am being controlling, to figure out a way to deal with this.",

      "title": "AITA For kicking out my roommate?",
      "description": "My boyfriend and I moved out of his brothers basement suite (finally) and got our own house to rent last year. Our buddy and coworker (I work with my boyfriend, family business) was going through a tough time and recently broke up with his fiancee, so we figured, hey this could probably work out! He was renting a room elsewhere and was crashing on our couch more often than not, so when we got the place he moved in with us. The only rule was that we listen to loud music, and that won't change, and he needed to be okay with that. He heard how loud our music was before he moved in so he said it wouldn't be a problem. My boyfriend and I put our names on the lease and he rented a room and we split the rent in half with him, but we pay for the utilities.\n\nEverything was alright for the first 4 months, he would kind of clean up after himself, he'd interact with people that came over, and be really appreciative when I cleaned the house and when my boyfriend would cook us dinner. \n\nThen he got comfortable. He stopped cleaning up after himself completely, he stopped offering to make dinner, and eventually started expecting that dinner would be made for him all the time. (We would go over to a friend's, have dinner with them, and come home at 830pm and he'd ask \"did you guys already eat? Oh, I guess I'll make something for myself\") Our music didn't change, but his whining about the volume increased. It's almost as if he felt entitled to everything we do for him.\n\nFast forward to last night. Our roomie hurt his knee, so he stayed home all day by himself. We came home around 530 and we started cooking and cleaning. My boyfriend just finished cooking an amazing meal, and I was uncharacteristically drunk.  I was eating while reading my book and rocking out to my favourite band. Roomie comes down taps my google home and shuts off the music, without asking to turn it down beforehand, and said \"I'm sorry but I'm irritated, I'm getting really sick of all this music.\" And then goes upstairs. I'm irrational in my drunken state and I looked at my boyfriend and told him to deal with it, since I felt like I couldn't without blowing up. \n\nMy bf goes up and talks to him and reminded him that this was the deal. We wanted loud music when we had our own place and that's what was happening. We would have been respectful if he asked about turning down the music, which he never did, he'd just complain about it. \"I don't remember you guys telling me anything like that.\" Which we did. Literally our only rule. And he goes on to say \"well maybe you guys would be better off on your own.\" Bf: \"fine then, move out.\" Roomie: \"GOOD.\"\n\nWhile I have been growing increasingly exasperated with him, this isn't what I wanted to happen. If anything we were going to wait to talk to him until we renewed the lease. I know that my frustrations were starting to come out in full force, i haven't been a saint in the situation, and I was even planning on having a talk with him about his cleanliness so that it would make the rest of the year run out smoothly. Then this happened. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: Roomie has been increasingly growing too comfortable in our home, having meals made for him and being cleaned up after. We had one rule, that we wanted to listen to loud music, he said it was fine. Last night he turned off our music without asking to turn it down first and the discussion that followed resulted in him getting kicked out. \n\nAITA for getting my roommate kicked out?",

He's the kind of guy who everyone loves, but is actually a bit of an dick, however people tend to look past it because he is energetic and funny. We both worked in a pretty tight environment with a team of 8 other people. We worked long periods (almost 3 months) full on, then had a good chunk of time to relax, however we were still working together during these periods. We often used this down time to blow off steam by going out drinking and meeting new people, hooking up, etc, stuff we couldn't do during our 'on' time. \n\nSo I'd been working with Tony for about a month in an 'off' period, and we'd got on really well. He was a pretty intense guy, a heavy drinker, and when he was drunk he would get pretty loose, not really having a filter, saying whatever he wanted, not really caring what happened or who he hurt. It was pretty funny, because we got on well and I was never on the recieving end, and it was mostly harmless. Then one night just before we start our 'on' period, we go for a night out. I'm late to the party, so I'm more sober than everyone else, but still up for a good time. I meet them at a bar, and the first thing Tony does is smack me in the balls, in a friendly way, but hard, I'm pissed off, I tell him to fuck off, he argues with me but eventually does. Not wanting to ruin a good night, I tell him to come back in 5 mins when I've had a chance to cool down and forget about it. 5 mins later he comes back, and we're all cool, albeit a little tense. We move on, keep drinking, and eventually, after a few bars, decide to get some food. I'm still relatively sober at this point. During the process of getting a hotdog, an argument breaks out between Tony and some locals. I do my best to intervene, trying to calm down this other guy, while our coworker tried to calm down Tony. Suddenly Tony turns on me, pushing me, telling me not to get involved, telling me not to get in-between him, etc, luckily nothing physical but pretty intense stuff. Eventually I tell him to go fuck himself, and walk home by myself. The next day it's put down to a drunken argument and we move on. However this starts an air of tension between us.\n\nSo then comes our 'on' period. It's a pretty high stress time, however the 10 of us are a strong team so we get through it. However Tony is turning into a bit of a dick to me, it starts with \"jokes\" than are a little personal, then turn into him slagging me off to the rest of the team behind my back, although within earshot. I confront him, we move on, and again it kinda gets forgotten about, but the tension is still there. \n\nThen comes the catalyst. We finish the 'on' period, and get some time off. Cue plenty off drinking, partying, and general debauchery. In this time I meet a lovely girl, let's call her Rebecca. We getting on well, hanging out a lot, the usual. Then she messages me saying things are going too quickly, and she wants to stay friends, but that's it. Sad times, but shit happens, I'm not gonna lose sleep over it. My team know about all this (we're close to we tell eachother everything). A couple of days later she messages and says she was sorry, she just got nervous, and wants to meet again. So that night we meet with Rebecca and her friends, she's with her dad cuz it's just been her birthday, we have a few drinks, then go to a bar where Tony and some of my team are drinking. Tony launches into her, threatening to hurt her if she screws me around again, verbally abusing her, saying that's she's slut and a whore (to her Dad), a genuinely unbelievable encounter. I'm shocked, completely and utterly. I confront him, he tells me that I should have expected it, I should have known what he's like, completely not accepting what he did was totally wrong. He keep this stance up. Things between me and Rebecca  kinda break down, again I'm sad but not gonna lose sleep over it. However I'm still bloody mad at Tony. He was  well out of line, and his refusal to admit and apologise rubbed me the wrong way. He has abused a member of the public, who he doesn't know, and her father, put our name into disrepute (Rebecca and her father were well aware of where we were working), and to make matters worse, the incident is being brushed under the rug by our team leader, because he's friends with Tony. Again, we move on, we don't want to ruin the team dynamic, it's not worth it over a girl. Fuck...\n\nAbout two weeks later, I leave that job, partially because of Tony, and partially for other reasons. I leave on good terms, and the team leader gives me a very good reference, all happy as. However a week later I get a message from Rebecca saying she'd met Tony on a night out, and he'd been incredibly abusive to her, slandering her and telling vicious untrue personal rumours about her. I am fuming, however I tell her there isn't much I can do unfortunately, since I don't work with him anymore, and I know how things have been dealt with in the past. \n\nWhile looking for a new job, I meet a lot of old friends, who are mutual friends with Tony and my old team. When they ask why I left the job, I tell them, partially for other reasons, and partially because Tony was was an abusive alcoholic who needed to be babysat on a night out because he lacked self restraint and could not be trusted not to be horrifically rude to people he didn't know, and then to make things worse would not show any empathy or understanding for where he has gone wrong, and I did not want to work with him anymore because he made my life very difficult. I was generally pretty scathing of him, to people we both knew very well, as well as other people in the industry. \n\nWell this backfired on me. I got a new job, things are going well, and then my new team and my old team with Tony end up working next to each other. It's a little awkward but we're all grown ups. Or so I thought. A couple of days later I get the following text from Tony\n\nHi u/unofficial_ed ,\n\nIt has got back to me though quite a few people this side and in XXXXX that you have been talking shit about me. I know this for a fact and you slagging me off its not something I want to hear anymore ! I'm sure you don't want me to take this further!! So it's your choice if I hear you saying anything bad towards me again you will be sorry.\n\nKind regards \nTony. \n\nFuck. This message pissed me off, partly at myself because I really should be above that kind of behaviour, I was raised better than talking about people behind their backs, and partly because of the hypocrisy of it all. So anyway not wanting to start anything that I know I will lose (he is stubborn and judging from his message and past behaviour this could potentially turn violent), I apologise in text and in person. He seems cool with it, although there is still tension. \n\nSo that begs the question; I slagged off someone I used to work with to our mutual friends, and others in the industry. Am I the asshole? \n\nTL;DR: someone I used to work with was a dick to me and incredibly abusive to a girl I was with, and in return I told our mutual friends plus other people in the industry about how he was a dick to me and incredibly abusive to a girl I was with.

I was looking through tweets about this article and the top one was a woman saying, \"Looks like just as I had expected.\" I was a bit taken aback by how unnecessarily rude to this person who did an impressive task by himself. So I had decided to put my own two cents on the whole situation and I responded with this: https://imgur.com/gallery/gJnZoas  .As you can see, I have been suspended for promoting violence against a race.

It's been almost 3 weeks since we try to see each other but everytime she either have something else planned last minute or didn't wake up.\nI feel really bad about all this and I was kind of angry at her when she told me she wouldn't be there yesterday again.

      "description": "Okay so my friend K is dating a girl who isn’t so great in Thailand who’s manipulative and abusive. In the first week of them dating she lied about having cancer. She’s mistreated him so much and he just sucks it up and takes it. They break up and get back together a lot and it’s toxic. I’ve been warning him about the red flags that she’s been blatantly showing to him and he acknowledges it but “wants it to work”. \n\nAside from that she appears to have a shitty family, I say appears because I don’t trust what she says and my friend is a little naive and gullible. So she tells him about how fucked up her stepdad is and how he called her a bitch and what not, and how her mom just enables this behavior and does nothing about it. It sounds extremely bad. The girls sister has a young infant that is mistreated often and rides in the car with no seatbelt. So hearing it all gets my friend riled up and he says he wants to fight the stepdad and feels protective of a young child he’s never even met or will likely meet.  And in my head I’m thinking, “you will never see this girl as she’s across the planet it isn’t that serious, I understand her conditions aren’t that great but to let it affect your schoolwork and outer vibe is ridiculous.” Yes he’s allowed this to let him be off task, his grades even slipped a little from being with her. And another thing is I’m skeptical of if all the details can even be true, as she has always tried to push blame on him during arguments and when he stands his ground something all of a sudden happens to make him forget his anger and go into “protective boyfriend mode”. It seems like a way to just divert attention away from the issue and to get sympathy. If it’s all true then I pray for her but I doubt it. There’s no way for him to even verify it considering he’s across the planet.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I said this to him? And apologies if this post is written in a shitty way I’m on mobile.",

Technically not a pocket knife, its a multi tool, but it does have a small semi dull blade on it so meh. She said she did not feel comfortable with the knife on my hip as I could \"force my gf to do things.\" \n\nMy GF tells her we regularly fuck and to not worry about it. I make the joke \"If you don't like what is on my belt, you will hate whats in my center console.\" GF pinches my arm and gives me a dirty look. She knows my glock is there, hell our first date was to a gun range. (Texas yall.) This chick though. \n\nI hear an ear piercing \"YOU HAVE A GUN!!!\" This starts an argument where she is saying that you never bring your gun on a date. I could suddenly decide to rape her and use the gun to force her. You know basically saying a bunch of things I would never do. \n\nThis started an entire argument that lasted till I dropped her off. She then tried to get my girlfriend to leave the car, actually crying as she pleaded with her, and threw a huge fit afterwards. \n\nNow before anyone says anything about it, I never hide the fact that I am armed when I am not at home. (Robberies can happen anywhere so do not preach about being paranoid vs being prepared.) I have always let my dates know I pack heat. Hell most of the time the gun range is the first date because it is an excellent ice breaker, gets the adrenaline pumping, and gets everyone in a good mood when all safety precautions are taken and proper technique is taught. \n\nAITA for carrying on dates even though I inform my dates ahead of time?",

      "description": "So we found a dog around a month and a half ago. It was a very energetic social dog we'll call \"Levi.\" So we took Levi to PetSmart to see if she had a chip and she did! They contacted the owner but could not get in touch with them. Left multiple messages and we ended up just taking Levi in for the time being. \n\nNow, Levi is a very energetic dog and when she was in the backyard she ended up running away. We were worried and looked and found her in an animal shelter. They had also contacted the owners, but once again, no replies. So after a week of her being in the shelter we decided to foster Levi until we could find a better home suited for her (we aren't home enough to properly exercise her for hours like her breed requires). So we've been fostering her for about two to three weeks now, and a couple days ago, she escaped and ran away again. A woman found her, and called the owners (just like we did), only this time, they responded and picked her up.\n\nSo we decided to contact them to ask about seeing Levi (and making sure she was in a good home, since we felt like the owners did not GAF about her and could've been mistreating her). Today we went and we saw her tied to a tiny post in the backyard, with the backyard fence broken. We were pretty pissed off since it's 50 degrees and raining right now, so we asked one of the kids to bring her inside. We gave them the dog food, leash, collar, etc. and were going to drive off when Levi ran off. We chased her and put her back in our car, but the more we think about it the less we want to give her back to her owner. \n\nThe owner is a woman with 4 kids who lives in a house with roommates and apparently puts Levi outside in the backyard often. We told her we won't give her back unless she goes through the official adoption process and pays the $100 to adopt her back, since we are legally fostering her right now. I feel like she will refuse to pay the $100 because up until now she has had no regard for where Levi was this past month and a half and did not even pick up her calls about her.\n\nI feel like she changed her mind about owning Levi and suddenly wanted her back. We are taking her home with us and gave her the shelter's contact info in case she wants to officially adopt her, but right now I am furious at how dirty and cold Levi is. She is shivering. AITA? I feel bad since we made her kids cry right before Thanksgiving and basically took their dog away.\n\nTLDR: We took back the dog we were keeping for a month and a half from the original owners since they didn't seem to be taking care of her. Made kids cry before Thanksgiving",

She was all too happy to give him the number and they hug with a kiss on the cheek before he leaves. \n\nAt this point I was just over it. I wasn't that interested in her and if she's the type of person to show interest in another guy and exchange info in front of me I have no future with her.\n\nI decided to make up some random excuse to get away from her and just got in my car and drove home. I didn't want to have to deal with her company for a 40 minute drive and was over it. \n\nOh well, I honestly feel like a bit of an asshole, but also feel it was just in a sense considering what happened....",

A good family friend, let's refer to as FF, came for a visit with my dad. I thought I'd just be a little hello, but I woke up the next morning to see he was still here. Not too bothered by this, as it didn't really affect me. I then got back from school and basketball practice, to my surprise, find he was going to indefinitely be living in my room. Now, I have to move all my shit into the living, which I will now share with my much younger sibling, who I try to take care of, but don't get along with too well. My mom is obviously pissed, and so am I and my brother, but I'm conflicted. I never really knew FF too well, but he always seems like a nice guy, but I'm a teenager. I need my space, which I now have to share on a couch, with my brother, in the middle of the house. \nSorry about post length, it's my first time and I wanted to get this off my chest.",

      "title": "AITA for requesting a cleaning fee from roommate",
      "description": " TLDR: Roommate leaves a big mess after moving out,  forcing me to clean it up. I requested he pay me a cleaning fee since he knew his move out date well in advance. He doesn’t think he left a big mess and is refusing to pay me or even apologize.\n\nI live in a 2 BR / 2 BA apartment, and I suddenly had a room available and needed help with the rent until the end of the lease (2 months remaining). A remote coworker of mine who lived on the other side of the country wanted the chance to live where I do to start a new chapter in life and get a preview of living in a new city... So we decided that having him move in with me might be a good opportunity where both of us could benefit. I get help with rent, and he can move into a furnished room and only have to bring his clothes and personal possessions without the stress of buying furniture, paying deposits, setting up utilities, etc. I was a bit reluctant living with a coworker, but he seemed OK, it was only going to last for a short period of time, and I really needed help with rent.\n\nSo he moved in two months ago, usually kept to himself but we were always friendly and cordial with each other. At times, I even took him out to bars, movies, comedy shows, and even introduced him to some of my friends, just so that he felt more at home and welcomed. He’s kind of a messy guy, but he kept it contained to his bedroom and bathroom. Sometimes he left his dirty dishes in the sink or some beer bottles in the common areas, but it was never a big deal. Paid his rent and portion of the utilities on time, and there was never a problem with that.\n\nI noticed that he loves ordering from Amazon Prime… like a lot. About 3 or 4 days of the week had new packages awaiting for him, and he acquired quite a few things in the two months he was here. He also got his meals and groceries delivered too because he doesn’t drive, and he never wanted to go out of his room. When he wasn’t working, he stayed in his room and played games until 4 in the morning. Not a problem, I thought. He is probably just super introverted and would rather stay home.\n\nFast forward six weeks later, about 2 weeks before the end of the lease. He decided that he doesn’t want to live in this city after all and instead wants to move to another city to live closer to friends and family. Totally cool with me, and I offered to help him with any of the logistics. I asked him several times over the next week and a half about his plans to get his stuff out of the apartment. He reassured me that he would ship some stuff to his next destination, and whatever is left over he’d either sell, give away to neighbors, or just throw away in the dumpster. “Sounds good to me!”, I said. “Just to be clear, I don’t want to keep any of your stuff. Whatever is yours here, I don’t want it, so please do me the favor of just chucking it in the garbage.”\n\n“Yeah, no problem. I’ll do that.”, he told me. We had this conversation several times, and the expectation was very clear: before you move out, move out all of your shit because I don’t want it, and I don’t want to deal with it.\n\nFast forward about 10 days later, and he’s all packed up and ready to leave. I took him to the airport, we shook hands, and off he goes. I went back to the apartment and his room and bathroom were a disaster. He’s been living like a slob in my apartment for the last two months, and sure enough, a lot of his stuff were still there: unused suitcases, fast food trash, a fucking fishtank, all of his personal hygienic products like soap and shampoo, plus a lot of other random stuff too. His toilet hadn’t been scrubbed ever, and there was a putrid ring of shit baked onto the bowl that made me want to puke. It was so fucking disgusting and I couldn’t believe that a grown man could live like this. How did I never notice this before?\n\nI spent two hours cleaning out all of the shit (figuratively and literally) that he left behind. It took six garbage bags and several trips to the dumpster to get rid of everything, including the fucking fish tank that I specifically asked him to deal with. Don’t worry, the fish tank only ever contained gravel and water, and he never bothered to put fish in it, so no fish were harmed! At this point, I’m fucking disappointed in him and really shocked that he could leave all this stuff behind because he was too lazy to deal with it himself. And to a coworker no less. I texted him to let him know what I found, and he gives me all of the excuses like he ran out of time and didn’t leave too much behind. I called out his bullshit and told him that it actually took me a while to clean up his mess. He’s not even the slightest bit apologetic and doesn’t think it’s a big deal to leave a room in someone’s apartment in worse condition than he found it in. \n\nI demanded that he pay me back for my time and money I spent on cleaning supplies. $100 for a cleaning fee seemed very reasonable to me. And then he starts blowing up and acts like I’m trying to rip him off and gouge him for money. “I didn’t leave that much behind? It wouldn’t have taken me two hours to clean it. I just moved to a new city, and I can’t deal with this right now. You’re making such a big deal out of this man. You’re moving out of the apartment in a few days. Why don’t you just leave it there?”\n\nAm I the asshole here for asking my short term roommate / coworker to pay me for a cleaning fee for dealing withi his stuff?",

The latest meds she's been taking have kept her pretty stable to the point where I'd forget she even has epilepsy (she's not photosensitive)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting a new job in a couple of weeks and I've been caught extremely short on money (being paid about 20% of my usual wage this month and I get the higher wage out of both of us). I've used up my savings helping my partner get out of financial trouble and we also have some ongoing expenses that can't be missed but aren't part of 'regular' billing (new sofa, holiday. Stuff like that)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough I'm starting a new job, I don't have any spare flexi-time or annual leave hours to take for me to go home and look after her. If I do go then the company would charge me for time owed. which of course I can't afford. We've been together for coming up to 2 years so I'm used to her seizures now and I know how to deal with them, however I can't really help much even when I'm there. I've take her up to the hospital many times to make sure she's okay and every single time we've just ended up sitting around all night long just to be discharged in the morning with nothing but a \"you're fine. just get some rest\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWriting this I feel like the asshole for not helping, of course I don't want her to suffer, however I'm very financially focused at the moment as it's what I'm feeling the most pressure from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I (24m) am in a polyamorous relationship. My GF (23F) has another BF (24m). My GF and I were planning on spending last night and all day together for most of the week, but complications came up throughout the week and those plans went through several iterations. Now, we did spend most of Wednesday afternoon/evening together, but then she spent most of Thursday with her BF, Thursday night, all day Friday, and then Friday night with him. They don't get to see each other as often as she and I do, so that's chill.\n\nWhen other stuff came up towards the end of the week, I wanted to confirm that our plans were still on, but she, after having spent so much time with the two of us this week, felt like she needed a rest day, so we decided that our plans were off, so she could have Sunday (today) to herself. I was obviously disappointed, but I understood. Then some shit came up with me and I was in a bad place, and I leant on her a lot through this. Then the whole situation changed again and it was now an option for me to stay over at her house last night, but it was too late for me to arrange that on my end. We bother really wanted to see each other after dealing with all my stuff, but it just wasn't viable. So I continued to insist that she just enjoy her day for herself. Recharge, recenter, etc. \n\nBut then she goes out for lunch with her other BF and ends up spending most of the day with him and that really upset me, so I mentioned that to her, and she said that I had ample opportunity to go back to the original plan of us spending time together today, but I know how much she was needing time to herself. I'm not upset at her for spending time with her other BF, it just feels like if she was going to make plans with somebody, why not try and make other plans with me again? AITA for being upset about this?",

And in that time we’ve never dated, but I’ve been incredibly close to her, I have basically been her best friend and closest friend for all that time. She’s had several serious relationships in that time and all the while I’ve been in love with her. I didn’t tell her till around 6 months ago, we were both just chilling and for some reason we both started talking about “how come we never got together”.\n\nWell I just came out with it, told her how hard it was for me over these last few years especially being the third wheel. I mean I have been in a couple of relationships, but all the time I was wishing it was her ( unhealthy as fuck I know). But surprisingly she said she felt the same, she told me she has had the same feelings about me for a while too. \n\nWe make out, nothing too major and I go home, the next day I get a message saying we shouldn’t talk for a bit as she needs to clear her head, I think cool no worries, everything’s fine. 4 months pass and I hear nothing, I try messaging her but she leaves it on open. All until a few days before Christmas.\n\nShe messages me asking to meet up, me being over the heals in love with her, I just say yes. Invite her over and we talk for a little bit, she kisses me and we then start to have sex (escalated madly I know). Afterwards is nice again, we chill, I think everything is fine. Until she leaves and messages me the next day with the same thing, this time she feels like she can’t talk to me anymore. However a week later she asks me to transfer her some money (as she’s at uni) to help her get some food (around £50). And I still don’t hear anything back for a while.\n\nNow I’m really upset and I don’t know how to feel, just confused and a little bit unsure what to think, have I been used? \n\nAny advice would be cool ",

      "description": "My crush, let's call her Rachel, is a national-level tennis player. I just met her at the beginning of this semester, since I moved states during winter break. I haven't been able to get an 'in' with her, so to speak. We're kind of casual friends that hang out at school, but nothing more. So I asked her last week (before spring break) what she was doing on spring break. She said not much, just teaching one of her friends to play tennis. I realized this was a chance and said to her, 'I've always wanted to play tennis, but I never got a chance. Can you teach me over spring break?' \n\nThe thing is, this is a lie. What Rachel doesn't know is that my dad was a D1 tennis player in college and I grew up playing tennis, and was semi-competitive as a kid, but after my mom and him divorced, I really stopped playing and focused on swimming. But she doesn't know this because I just moved here a few months ago.\n\nSo basically, I told two lies to her: 1) I don't know how to play tennis and 2) I'm interested in learning. So far, it's going great. I'm playing the part of a beginner- albeit a good beginner- really well, and she and I are hanging out more. \n\nBut I was texting a friend from my old school about all this, and he said it was a asshole move to lie to her. I said it was a harmless lie, and do think so.\n\nSo, aita, or am I in the right here? ",

      "description": "Today was a wild one. The caretaker for our grandmother is going to quit once my mom comes back from an overseas trip. She was really fed up with my grandmother obsessing and ripping the diaper off of herself every time she, the caretaker, would put it on. \n\nDuring the ordeal I called my cousin as she hasn’t had many updates about our grandmother’s condition after moving to our house. Both my mom and dad were pissed at me saying, “they (my cousin and aunt) are not going to do shit. They have nothing to do with this. She can’t do anything. She doesn’t need to know about this” and “what was your point in calling her?”. I honestly don’t know why I called her. It was more of a response to the heat of the moment. My dad was like “you don’t do some shit like that wtf is wrong with you!” And all that pizazz.\n\n\nI don’t see what I did wrong. Was I the asshole for calling my cousin?",

      "description": "BF (m/33) and I (f/about to be 34) have been together 3 years. Last year, he totally dropped the ball and planned nothing (not even a card). This year, I heavily suggested (aka, planned) what I wanted to do... Starting with, we stay up Thursday night and watch the meteor shower and then stay home together from work on Friday. I figured we could sleep in, just enjoy each other, maybe get breakfast.  \n  \nWell, to start with, he first bailed on taking Friday off together, after he agreed to it with me, because he had to work. I was bummed but said of course, and I will see you when you get off work and we can set up for the meteors.  \n  \nThen, he tells me the night before that the meteor showers don’t peak til late, so he’s going to do his usual Thursday night xbox night and then he’ll hop off closer to midnight and we can go outside. I voiced that I was not okay with that, and I asked him to please give up xbox for one night, since it’s my weekend.  \n  \nLastly, I got a txt from him while I was still at work yesterday, stating that he was going to go out and grab a couple of beers with friends and he’d see me back at the house later. I again expressed my feelings were hurt and I wanted us to save our drinking for outside, because when he drinks too much, he either falls asleep or gets really angry... so I wanted to wait and drink together while watching the stars. He shut down supremely and said I needed to respect him and his life, and he wasn’t changing his plans.  \n  \nNeedless to say, when he got home, I wasn’t happy and so I was cold to him... and that pissed him off and we had a huge fight over the whole thing, because he says I am the asshole for trying to “control” him and that I live in a fairytale world, if I think any man is going to set up special blankets and drinks outside for us to watch meteor showers. The way I see it, he is the asshole for standing me up for my birthday plans. And just for clarification, my bday is Saturday. It wasn’t last night/the night of the meteor shower, I just thought it would be a nice kick off and romantic for us, especially since he’s been dropping the ball so much lately.  \n  \nSo, Reddit... AITA? ",

      "description": "Yeah, it's about a touchy subject, so it's more nuanced than the generalization of the title.\n\nThis happened quite a few years back, but it's still something that gets me back and forth in a debate with myself when I'm reminded by it by a single solitary image I can often see floating on the internet.  Sometimes I reason myself into thinking that I was in the right, and other times I can reason myself into believing I was in the wrong. \n\nBack then, me and my friend were both furries. Don't laugh; it's important to the story. We were the cliche kind, too. \"Do you rp?\"'s and \"owo\"'s were tossed around daily between us. Yeah, we did rp, very intensely in fact. We'd switch off who gets to be lead, and the lead chooses who doms, what the characters are, what the main gist is, what the main kinks are, etc. Yes, this is important. We also both really liked one very particular artist a lot.\n\nI had gotten a job so that I could feed my Xbox 360 with games and my FA with art. I decided that with my first paycheck, I'd surprise my friend with art of his OC from our favorite artist as a birthday present, since he was about to turn 19. The piece was $70, and when I broke the news, he wasn't exactly the most enthusiastic. Mind you, at just 16, working only 6 or 7 hours every week, $70 was a ton of money for me. I mean, that could buy the newest Halo game and a bunch of soda! So, seeing that he was not excited at all about it, I felt as though he didn't care that much, so I decided to supplement my OC into his lineart. The only thing that the artist needed to change was the tail, after all. It wasn't close to being colored\n\nWhen I told him, he was distraught.\n\nMind you, he gave the same \"oh cool I guess\" reaction across the 2 days after I ordered it. When I was trying to hype him up, he would send short answers with the periods, which was very weird for him.\n\nHe was so saddened that I wasn't buying him free art for his character anymore. I told him that I really didn't want to inconvenience the artist any further because he already has to redo the sketch of the tail. But, he was desperate, so he wants to buy it back. He can't pay with money of course, else he'd buy it himself, evident by how much he wanted it so much, so he said that he'd do a 'scene' for every dollar it cost me. I'd be able to control the rp for 75 scenes, which are basically just things meant to get each other off, and he'd get his art (75 because of a new $5 inconvenience fee from the artist for changing so much).\n\nMind you, this is NOT sex, or illegal. It is not prostitution. He also turned 19, so he was an adult +1 year more. A furry rp is a textual adventure. There is no trading of nudes and there is no irl stuffs. Think of it akin to hiring an writer to help write half of a book. \n\nI control the kinks, who doms, the characters, all that jazz. We got through 40 scenes, and then he started to wane. \n\nHe sorta just stopped doing it for a month at 30 left. He was sick, he had a headache, he had a ton of homework, he had to hang out with friends, etc. Of course being the horny kid I was I kept badgering him, and I eventually got him to say what my suspicions were all along. He was just bored of it all. He simply didn't want to rp anymore. Of course this was after he got his piece of art and I had sent it to him.\n\nI didn't just want to rp at that point. I was angry; I felt as if a friend had used me. We agreed on a deal based on his terms, and he didn't follow through with it just because it inconvenienced him. Or, at least, that's what it felt like. \n\nWe did one more rp or so, and then three days later I gave him the option to buy back the scenes at the same 1-dollar-rate. He sent 20, and planned to do the last nine in the week, which he did. \n\nBack then, I was a satisfied little teen that had gotten a finished service. Just a few months later, I started reflecting on what I did, and doubt started eating away at my verdict.\n\nAm I the asshole for making him finish such an odd debt? Granted, you have to imagine the kinds of conversations a horny 16 yo teen was throwing at the guy to influence him to continue; he didn't want to do anything at all, not even send the money back. I didn't cuss the guy out; I wasn't allowed, but I used a very upset and angry tone with him. ",

      "description": "Background: I (22M) will be graduating next week and moving away from school to start my job. Me and my SO (22F) spend most of our time together other then when we have class or have a lot of assignments to do. We have been dating for 2.5 years at this point and will continue to date once I leave for work.(Work is 3 hours away.) Understandably, she is upset that we have to be long distance with my job and wants to spend as much time as possible together before I leave.\n\nThe situation: Being my last week before I move I wanted to hangout with my best friend from school (one of my best friends overall) before moving after not hanging out for who knows how long. We haven’t hung out much this semester due to it being both our senior years and having a lot of school obligations. She is very upset with me for wanting to go out to grab a few beers with him, stating that we have had these plans made (staying in because she has to study) for over a week. Mind you we always “plan” on hanging out and never really deviate from that but my friends don’t make plans that far in advance so she feels slighted when I wanted to change them. We have been arguing about this for a few days now, as I am still planning on going to grab a beer with him. It really kills the mood as she isn’t acting sad but more frustrated and angry that I’m “choosing to hangout with him instead of her” I understand her being sad to lose some time with me but at most it’s 4 hours of the day. I don’t understand how she is still angry at me for wanting to catch up with my friend one last time before I leave and won’t see him for an indefinite period of time.\n\nAITA for wanting to grab a beer with my friend still? \n\n(Sorry for formatting and any typos I am on mobile)",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to know why my roommate had a cop go to his room looking for him?",
      "description": "Let’s set the scene. I am a freshman in my first semester of college, adapting to life far from home in my dorm, which is set up so that myself and my roommate have rather small, separate rooms, and share a bathroom (still better than a larger shared room imo, and you’ll see why). When I first met my roommate, who I will call Ken (not his real name), he seemed rather unassuming. Ken, if you’re reading this, I’m sorry man. Ken mostly keeps to himself, but he doesn’t keep to himself quietly - I hear him talking all hours of day and night, banging on the desk that is close to our shared wall (sometimes to a beat, sometimes repeatedly, almost all times loudly) and I once caught him trying to do a naked sprint from the bathroom to his room to grab some TP - while carrying his laptop, which he took for quality pooping time, I assume. The last one is for comedic relief before the big plot twist.\n\nKen started to talk, as the semester caught on, a bit too loudly and too often. I eventually started hearing him literally talk during and coming out of the shower, in his room with his door ajar and him standing up without headphones or any visible phone/laptop connection to someone to speak with, and as he was both entering and exiting the dorm. He talked to himself, and I don’t mind - I think out loud all the time, but I don’t think out loud *loudly.* I had a lil too much one day and politely knocked on his door, and told him, “Could you keep it down a bit? I can hear you talking.” He nodded along and said yeah, and it stopped for a while. Then came tonight. I heard a rather loud, repetitive banging that was going for a minute of thuds against the wall, so I got up to try to knock on his door and inform him of him being loud - the first part that I thought was odd was that I didn’t see his light coming in from under his door. That’s because he was in total darkness, and propped his door open to peep at me. Just then, the residential advisor comes in with a campus police officer, and they ask for Ken. I then go back to my room and I don’t know what’s going on now. Did he drop acid and have a bad trip or something? Is it a mental health thing? I don’t know, and as someone who lives with him essentially I’m a bit concerned. So, I call my RA, and she comes to talk things over, and then contacts the RA on duty, to which they share details but the details can’t be shared with me - privacy stuff, obviously, but the RA tells me everything is okay afterward. I talked to him and he seems okay, I didn’t pry I just asked him if he was okay.\n\nA lot of people I mentioned to online (not irl, I wouldn’t want to encroach Ken’s privacy) said I was an asshole for not respecting it was probably a mental health issue - but shouldn’t I be aware if my roommate is starting to develop extreme paranoia or schizophrenia or something? I don’t know, I just thought it was reasonable for me to want to know why this happened even if I can’t get all the details since I happen to share a close living space with him.",

      "description": "Around six months ago we had two police officers circle around our neighborhood while we were having a barbeque outside with music playing at a moderate, the officer's did not stop that day. Flash forward to this month where as I was arriving from work and putting the dogs outside, into the fenced in area we recently installed had installed. One dog out of the three we have slips away and goes around fifthteen feet in front of the driveway at this moment I realized that the neighbor was out walking their dogs and I put everything down and rush towards her. I this point she started yelling at me with cuss words and insults. But I start ignoring her and focus on getting my dog which happens to be a small  Chihuahua meanwhile trying to not get bitten by her pit bulls that are barking and throwing bites at him. Instead of calming her dogs down she stands there and waits till I pick my dog up. Once I pick him up I put them outside and go cook dinner. I had a gut feeling that we were going to get a visit from the cops, sure enough that same day we had an officer show up and tell us that they have received multiple calls from our neighbor in the past 5-6 months about disturbances coming from this address. But every time that they come and check the place out there's nothing. She said that because she took a video of the event we had to receive a 50$ fine. We were confused and so was she because when the cop showed up to here place out neighbor all ready knew the type of fine we needed code and all. I didn't think much of it till later today when I arrived from work she yelled at me and said \" in case you were wondering it was me who called the cops. Don't think your above everything. What I did was through the legal system\"  that really did seem odd and it's making me believe that she hates us for some reason. So AITA?",

      "description": "Let me start off by saying that I love my nephew dearly, he's like a little brother to me and I wish him everything he dreams of.\n\n\nThat being said, with his birthday coming up I'm invited and I promised I'd go without hesitation. It only occurred to me now that my mother could be coming as well. Now, we've all had horrible experiences with her and so far my sister (nephew's mother) has been the most forgiving of us (it's just the 3 of us: sister, brother and me).\nMy falling out with our mother is the most recent(1,5 year ago), to keep it short and for context purposes only: a lot of physical, mental and emotional abuse, since I am the youngest and last to be living in with our mother my siblings weren't there to protect me as they also did not want to see or confront her. I left home abruptly after one last beating, I still have a scar from it. I pressed charges for that, by the way. \n\n\nNow, I have informed my sister about it, as our mother lied and twisted the story. My sister was devastated by this news but didn't know how to inform her children about it as they're just young (5 and 7 at that point). Only thing she said was that my brother(he had a similar falling out 2 years before mine) and I were in a fight with our mother. My nephew said that we should just talk it out (bless his heart).\n\nMy sister has had serious mental issues due to her childhood with our mother, leading her to once suffer from a burn-out. Important to add here that my sister is 18 years older than me, 16 for my brother, so things have changed in a bad way when we grew up. She left home fairly early.\nIt still baffles me that our mother is welcome in her house after everything, but whatever. It's her house and rules. The reason she also does this is because she doesn't want to take away 'grandma'  time from her children if they wish to see her, of course.\n\n\nSo back to the main part of this, I asked my sister over text if our mother was coming. My sister said yes, but she was fairly hurt by the way I asked it since she wanted her son to have HIS day with the people he loves. She said she'd find it unfortunate if knowing our mother is coming would stop me from doing so, but not for my sister but for my nephew. I agree my nephew deserves the time of his life with the people he desires, but this is too much for me. I refuse to be in the same room as her, speak to her or look at her. I feel horrible knowing my nephew wants me there.\n\n\nSo Would I Be The A-hole for not going?",

      "description": "Was chatting with my (24f) boyfriend (27m) and he mentioned how he was drunk at my sister’s wedding, which was last summer. I said I thought he wasn’t and he said he was. So I say “but you drove my car...” For context, the wedding was a 2 minute drive from where we were staying. I went with my parents and sister and he drove my sister’s friends (since it was a hot day and the women were in heels). Fast forward to the end of the night, I’ve drank a bit as expected so I’m not going to drive back, but bf says he is sober and drives us. He says he didn’t drive us, but I remind him of a detail and he remembers he did drive. Then he realizes he didn’t really drink until the after party, after which neither of us drove. \n\nSo I’m thinking everything’s okay, but he’s hurt that I thought he drove drunk. I definitely wouldn’t have thought that of him but when he said he had been drunk that night, I think “maybe I wouldn’t have known.” For one, I was drinking so my judgment was impaired, but also I’ve maybe seen him drunk once or twice in the 4 yrs we’ve been together, and maybe I wouldn’t recognize it.

      "title": "AITA (F) for telling my SO (M) to cut contact with an old female friend of his?",
      "description": "This happened a few years ago, but somehow it came up in conversation (OK, an argument) recently again, and it does still bother me to this day, so I really would appreciate non-biased third party takes on this.   \n\n\nBuckle in, buckaroos. Sorry this is a long one, been thinking about this for years, but finally decided to post for feedback/perspective.   \n\n\n\\-  \n\n\nSo, my partner and I live together, have done for over 5 years. When we first started seeing each other, I knew of one of his closest friends, we'll call her \"H\". At first, I was a bit nervous meeting her, because I wanted to make a good impression and become friends as well, because I really liked my now SO a lot. Things were fine at first - she was a bit lewd and rowdy, but it didn't matter, because I was elated to be seeing this sweet guy.   \n\n\nThen, my SO told me; before we got fully into our relationship, he told me he and his friend \"H\" had slept together once, about a year or so before. He wanted to be upfront and honest about it, which I absolutely appreciate, but it definitely made me feel uncomfortable. He said it was because they had both been without sexual contact for so long in both their lives, and they were the only people each other trusted, so it was a one time thing, purely physical, never to happen again.   \n\n\nI was definitely put off by this; I thought it was absolutely crazy to sleep with a close friend like that, because I can't imagine crossing that kind of line with a friend, and then being able to go back to the way things were as friends before... but hey, apparently they were able to work it out and things were fine, so I dealt with that information, and tried my best to stay calm and not make anything out of it. It was in the past, it only happened once, he told me about it voluntarily, very early on, and all that mattered was us now, and the future, right?   \n\n\nNot too long into the relationship, me, my SO, SO's brother, and \"H\" were in the car together, giving her a lift home. Somehow, (I think she was either high or had been drinking) she felt it was appropriate to bring up her old relationship wherein she was totally unsatisfied and didn't get any sex from him for months, and was so deprived... which is exactly when H and SO decided to sleep together. I knew this information, and hearing all of this in the back seat made me absolutely mortified. I wasn't sure if they knew I knew, but my SO knew, next to me, and he blushed and shook his head... he knew that it was totally uncool that she was bringing this up... but hey, she was under the influence of some kind, so totally tactless and tasteless, but let it slide... still early days.   \n\n\nThen, the phone calls at 2:00 AM started. Apparently, these happened once in a while (although who knows if they were actually that rare). H would call SO while I was staying over, and woke us both up (SO refuses to turn his phone off at night, in case there's an \"emergency\"). She was drunk and upset; she was loud so I could hear her just talking at him for about 20 minutes straight, then had to go and hung up.   \n\n\nAnother night, she called at about 1:30 AM, again, woke us both up (which was super irritating as he worked an early shift and I worked full time as well); she was drunk, crying, asking for a lift home from the bar (the bar in question was a 5 minute drive from our place, but also her place was only 5 mins from the bar, so why she didn't get a taxi or something, I don't know). She was totally expecting him to knight up and come and get her. SO's brother ended up going to take her home.   \n\n\nI was really trying to be patient with all of this, as I was new in SO's life and his friends'... I was the newcomer, and I was very much aware of that, and I didn't want to throw off the ecosystem of their group of friends, etc... again, I wanted to make a good impression, and become friends with them as well so we could all get along and be happy... but then she started coming over and visiting often with SO's brother and his roommate (they live in the basement part of our house). I would come home to loud sex noises coming up from the basement, and sometimes it would start very late at night.... it was H and the roommate downstairs. I'll be honest, this was extremely hard for me to hear, as it was pretty much the audio that was missing from the image of my SO and her doing the deed in my mind. It completed the picture, and I just couldn't deal with it anymore.   \n\n\nI told my SO how I was feeling, and I was very upset about the whole thing. I tried to get along and be respectful, but I felt like I was being disrespected, and I just felt trashy, like I had entered into a very trashy world, and I didn't want that. I just felt so uncomfortable, and I couldn't deal with the sounds, the phone calls, how she tastelessly brought up inappropriate subjects directly in front of me... I wasn't going to let it continue. So, I told him I couldn't deal with how she was acting, so either he started cutting out contact with her so she wouldn't be around anymore, or I would go.   \n\n\nHe defended her every time it came up in discussion, an argument, you name it. It was a fucking hard time, and our relationship had literally just started. He couldn't see things from my perspective at all, and would just say that she didn't mean anything by it, yadda yadda. The whole situation was just mortifying for me; it was so tasteless, and I couldn't handle it, so I gave him a choice. Yes, I still feel awful about it, but I had to protect myself, or walk away. SO agreed to cut contact, but I know that he still checked in with her, asking how she was occasionally... it absolutely bothers me, but I saw it on his steam once when he left the house in a hurry, and it popped up on his screen. I feel bad for looking at his PC screen, but I never brought it up with him, I just let it go. I figured it wouldn't do any actual harm at that point, but honestly, it still fucking hurts that he lied to my face about it, even if nothing funny was going on.   \n\n\nFinally, for a few days, things were quieter at home. But, it was a sad time as well, because I was finally leaving a toxic group of friends that I met with a couple times a week. I had forgotten some equipment at their house, so I went over to pick it up. The one friend, \"A\", knew where it was, but he wasn't there when I arrived. I asked if I could see A, or have him give me my piece of equipment back, and the rest of the guys looked awkwardly at me, saying he was...erm, indisposed... upstairs, at the moment. I was totally oblivious, and asked something like \"Oh no, is he sick? I can come back another time if-...\". No no, he wasn't sick. He was upstairs indisposed.... with H. Yep, you read that right. H had made the rounds that week, to literally everywhere I was going. I couldn't fucking escape. I said, \"you know what, I'll just come back another day\", and left.   \n\n\nSo, that was probably the shittiest week right there. My SO was upset because I gave him an ultimatum, I was leaving a group of people who I thought were my friends, I had audio replay of this chick banging pretty much everyone I know in my head... and I never got that equipment back in one piece.   \n\n\nSo reddit, please help me out here. Sincerely need to know so I can have a full discussion with my SO about this without him quitting the conversation out of frustration, walking away, or just stonewalling me about it. Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I am in the same room as last year with all my old buddies except two moved out, my old roommate and another guy. I thought I would be fine with it but as the year has progressed his behavior continued to chip away at me. \n\nI would be working with my headphones on at my computer and he will repeatedly tap my shoulder and start talking to me. He loudly sings at his desk and watches YouTube videos while loudly laughing his head off (the YouTube thing isnt a huge problem since everyone can have fun but I at least stifle my laugh when I watch tv). His side of the room is a complete pigsty with old food trash and candy all over the floor, which my friend told him to clean but he still hasn't done it. He will wait outside the shower door while I shower and right when I walk out he dips in which is pretty awkward in my underwear. \n\nI have told him a couple times that when I have headphones on at my desk I am trying to work but it never worked. So I finally snapped a little at him and sternly asked if he could give me some space as a final hurrah so I could stay in my old room. I wasnt loud or rude or anything but I wasnt very polite and I know that. He listened for that day but immediately went back to tapping my shoulder and initiating conversation when I'm obviously trying to work. My friend said he filed a complaint against me so I'm just planning on moving out which kind of sucks but I just wanted to know if I was the asshole for snapping at him?",

So I got cut off from my mom and younger brother. This all lasted until I joined the military. Out of nowhere my mom comes out of the woodwork and tries to act like nothing has happened and be all happy and invite me over for dinner.

      "description": "I’m 26 and whenever I come to visit my parents (my dad is 60 and my mom is 57) my mom smells HORRIBLE, this has been going on for over a year. No one has the guts to tell her. My mom is an alcoholic and my dad kinda is too (my whole life they both get drunk every night, but my dad is functioning whereas my mom doesn’t have a job and sneaks beers in the daytime, she shakes if she doesn’t have it). I don’t know if the lack of hygiene is from the alcoholism or if she’s depressed. She’s a happy person otherwise so I just don’t know. My parents are in a really bad spot financially and I know that contributes to her not being happy. But she won’t work because of the alcoholism. My dad was drunk the other night and yelled that she never bathes, but she still hasn’t showered. She also claims that she’s afraid of falling in the shower (but that’s probably because she’s always drunk and doesn’t want to fall). Twice a month when I come from out of town she asks me to help her shower, but I want her to do it daily like a normal person. I can’t take this anymore. I can’t even hug her her skin is so greasy and gross I love her but don’t know what to do anymore. WIBTA if I told her to stop this and be honest with her and tell her that she smells and she HAS to shower? I can’t do this anymore ",

      "description": "My wife (28f) and I (29m) got married in 2016. She got divorced from her ex in 2014.  She has 2 kids with her ex (6 y/o twins - boy and girl). \n\nIn the time we’ve been together, my wife and the ex vacation together at least once a year in the summer. I’ve never been invited. As far as I know, they’ve always shared one big hotel room because it’s cheaper. Supposedly, they split the kids in the beds. (So I guess my wife sleeps in the bed with my stepdaughter and the ex-husband sleeps in bed with my stepson). \n\nI have never really loved this arrangement but I have tried to be understanding. At this point though I think we’ve blended families to the point where these trips no longer need to be this separate thing. I brought up to my wife that, this summer, I would be more comfortable if I went with them. \n\nShe was hesitant and starts talking about how the kids appreciate being able to vacation alone with both parents. But, correct me if I’m wrong, is that not a normal consequence of divorce?? I’m starting to question whether she secretly misses her old life. I told her as much and she acted hurt that I would question how much she loves me/us.  But I can’t help but to wonder. \n\nFor the record, I am not asking her to axe the vacations. What I envision is that we all go and get separate hotel rooms. Can someone please let me know if there’s something wrong with that?? ",

      "description": "English isn't my first language so feel free to ask me to clarify anything you don't understand. It's quite long. And I don't live in the US.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I moved out to live with my SO. I do housework, cook everyday, and I help making videos on his channel. My mun isn't too happy about me living with my boyfriend before we get married. Saying things like \"Back in my days you'd be killed for doing such thing\".\n\nAfter moving out, she insisted talking with me on the phone everyday. I was quite busy settling down so I didn't call for 2 days. I was bombarded with texts, I replied saying I'm quite busy and will call later. On the third day she teared up when I called her back, crying about how she went through so much bringing me up and I wasn't grateful about everything she did. This happened more than a few times and I got really annoyed. I visited my parents a couple of times. She cried everytime she sees me because she \"sacrificed a lot for you, I quit my job to take care of you, I gave you money to go to school. I didn't abuse you, why do you not care about me?\"\n\nEventually I grew tired of her dramatic reaction and stopped contacting her. I feel guilty doing so, but I really don't want to deal with her tears anymore. She started texting my boyfriend about she's feeling ill/depressed. I'm torn between guilt and an ill-feeling towards her. \n\nLet me tell you a bit more about my mum. My mum was very strict and very demanding on my grades ever since I was young. In my earliest memories in primary school, I always have to score 80/100 or above in tests and exams, else my mum would get super angry and give me a beating. She would stay with me every second to monitor my study, making sure I recite everything before any tests. She would beat me with a clothes hanger or a thin wooden stick if I got the answer wrong. She would lock me up between the door gate and the door, where it's fully visible to neighbours. She did this to get me embarrassed, hoping it would make me apologize and be a good kid afterwards. \n\nDuring grade 11 mum stopped monotoring me because she couldn't keep up with my studies anymore. I didn't know how to study on my own. I got distracted by video games and my grades went down. Even worse, I got bullied at the same time. They picked me because I was weird. Because I don't know how to social with others, spent too much time studying.\n\nI cried every single night in bed. Everything was going wrong but I don't trust my parents enough to tell them about it. Afterall, all my mum has ever said during dinner was \"Remember, no boyfriend. Study hard.\" and \"How was the test?\" \n\nTo be honest, I don't trust her, and I don't like her. But I also feel guilty for not appreciating her sacrifices. I haven't talked to my parents for over 6 months now. Am I an asshole for being so cold-blooded? I don't know what to do. ",

My dad saw me and asked if I had been drinking. I said yes, and he didn‘t have an answer for that. So I went to sleep.\n\nSome days later he complained to my brothers about it, so one of them came to me and told me that I should have said no. I argued that I would feel like I‘d insult him if I lied blatantly in his face like that. My brothers‘ argument is that they know, but they at least want to live in the illusion that I‘m not doing anything „bad“. Like I just shouldn‘t adress the elephant in the room.\n\nNow I‘m not so sure anymore. I feel like I‘d set my integrity aside for their comfort. They already know all my shit. I don‘t like lying to them. So, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Should I lie to my parents about my drinking, even though they know already? They say they’d be more relaxed.",

I go back to my friends apartment, since I wasn’t feeling well and didn’t want to stay in a hotel with someone else high. He books a $400 a night hotel and kept complaining that he didn’t have a good trip (because we didn’t have much time, didn’t really do much fun things bc I was high) and that I should pay him for half the hotel bill.\n\nThe first few times he mentioned it, I just kind of ignored it. He mentioned it again a month later, so I end up sending him the $200+ for half of the hotel.\n\nWe are very close friends and both make good money but I don’t think the principle of what he did was right.

      "description": "My girlfriend and I (male) are taking a trip abroad soon, where we plan to swim. She loves swimming, and loves to wear a bikini. We're both of the same religion, however I'm probably a bit more religious than she is, although this doesn't factor in so much when I consider what she wishes to wear. She asked me how I felt about this, knowing that people in my family are more conservative. Now I honestly have no problem at all, and have been clear on that with her, going so far as to promise here that there will literally never be a time when I ask her to cover herself up. I do have one issue though, and when prodded, I told her that I would get jealous seeing other guys notice her, which is the only thing that gets to me really. I personally also don't like swimming with just a pair of shorts on, I wear a rash top or just a shirt sometimes.  \n\n\nI told her it's her body, and she can do as she wishes, and I won't shy away from being around her at all. She complained that if she did wear longer, more conservative clothing, it may be uncomfortable to swim in. I told her that it's up to her if she feels that way, and she should choose to be comfortable above all else. She still doubted that I was being fully honest, and didn't know if she should cover up more or not.  \n\n\nEventually, after some jokes and a lot of back and forth, I did eventually tell her that I think she could wear a rash top, with a bikini underneath and  some short shorts, if she really wanted me to feel totally comfortable, and she could in my opinion swim comfortably. Although again, she didn't have to make that compromise for me at all. She seemed really happy to bring this to a conclusion though. I even gave her a white rash top I had which fit her almost perfectly.  \n\n\nThis still left me feeling uncertain - did I force her to make this decision? I tried to be as honest as possible with her, without pushing her in any direction. AITA?",

      "description": "Alright, a little backstory is required for you to understand why I’m so upset:\n\nThis cousin of mine is one that I babysat since she was probably 2. I have been in her life in a major way for most of it and I did my best to help guide her into good decisions as I got older and made mistakes I didn’t want her to (I’m about 10 years her senior). She is an intelligent, physically gifted athlete that got a full ride to the college of her choice on athletic scholarships alone. She has always been more mature than her friends and honestly that gave me and her immediate family a lot of hope. She had a few little mess ups including a pregnancy scare last year that I helped her with; got her a test, and when it was negative I took her to get condoms and told her that if she ever, EVER needed condoms or to get birth control to *call me* because I would postmates her some condoms or take her to planned parenthood for BC myself. I always made it very clear that I didn’t judge her for having sex or not being safe once, but that if she needed help in the future I was always there no questions asked, and I would never tell her parents. \n\nHere’s where shit hit the fan: we just found out she’s pregnant. She’s 18, the guy that did it is denying any and all responsibility and she has just started college in August of last year. Before this, she was raised by my great aunt and uncle because get this: her parents were teenagers when they had her and couldn’t care for her. Aunt and uncle did absolutely everything they could to provide a good home and life for her and I think they nailed it. They had no obligation to take her in, either. They set aside all the wants and dreams they had as a couple after raising their own 6 kids and started over again with an infant. \n\nSo now, with my cousin wanting to keep this child, drop out of college and go into the Air Force, I am just waiting for the day that she asks my aunt and uncle to help her with her baby. And I’m livid about it. She has no right to ask them to do that all over again. They are in their 70s at this point and her bio parents aren’t in any shape to help her with an infant either. I think she’s being incredibly stupid, selfish and short sighted, and I don’t know if she gets that she’s putting another child in the same position as she was as an infant. It’s infuriating. As a result I told my family I’m not supporting her. I’m not going to a baby shower, I’m not congratulating her, I’m not having anything to do with her anymore. If she wants to keep this child that’s her choice and I’m not going to try to talk her out of it, but I’m also not going to put on a happy face and pretend like this is at all a good thing. My mom thinks I’m being cruel. My girlfriend and boyfriend think I’m valid in feeling this way. Now I’m conflicted and don’t know where I stand. So help me out Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "I'm a class rep for a university level film program. I was voted into the position by the class at the start of the year with my job being the go between for students should they have concerns about the program or teaching methods and are not comfortable enough to go to the teachers themselves.\n\nIt's the day before our weekly classes, and our group chat had everyone being upset with not knowing if we have class tomorrow. They then referred to me directly asking if we had class or not, to which I replied, \"As far as what the schedule says, we have class tomorrow morning and X project is due. If you would like to be 100% certain, you may contact the instructors with the contact info they provided.\"\n\nThey then said I was not doing my job and proceeded to be upset with me, with one class member saying if I didn't want to talk to the teachers that she would act as the person people could go to to find out when assignments are due and when we have classes.\n\nMy issue is that they have done this *many* times before, and always at the last possible moment, and they never took the responsibility to ask a teacher during or after class to confirm when the dates. I not only told them when we have class and what is due, I also reiterated what my job was as a class rep, and now they are upset with me, but I feel like at a university level, it's the student's individual responsibility to show up to class and hand in assignments on time.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "AITA here? So, I signed up for a membership for a store during Christmas so I could save some cash in my purchases. The cashier said the first 2 months are free I just have to cancel before that time and it came with a magazine subscription. A month later and they charged me (surprise, surprise) but I figured they'd try this so I called the magazine subscription and find it's not them who charged me but the actual store. This means, the cashier signed me up for a loyalty program for their store (which is what I got charged for) and a magazine subscription which would charge me in another month. I cancelled the magazine subscription easily but the store loyalty program person wasn't giving in without a fight. I let her go on for 5 minutes about how much money I'd save by continuing my membership because I get that it's her job so I let her do it. However, after I said no I'd rather cancel she kept talking over me. I tried a few times to ask about cancelling and getting a refund and she continued to talk over me. I finally raised my voice and said, \"hey, you need to stop. I can't get a word in because you keep talking over me. All I need to know is did you cancel it and am I getting a refund?\" She became all rude and once I got my answer I hung up. I was really irritated but now I feel kinda bad. So, AITA or what?",

Keep that in mind. I'm a bridesmaid in a high school friends wedding which is happening at the end of May. Here comes the dilemma.\n\nHer bachelorette weekend is the same weekend as my organizations annual spring bar crawl. A few facts about the party. Her bachelorette weekend is us renting a cabin up in the more rural part of Michigan and just hanging out with a few activities here and there. The kicker is she invited her MOTHER and MOTHER IN LAW so it's going to be a weird weekend for sure as none of the bridal party is close and having her two mothers there is bound to be uncomfortable. She doesn't drink and 2 of the bridesmaids are under 21 so it's not going to be a typical bachelorette weekend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy idea is to miss the Friday of her party and go to my organizations bar crawl and drive up by myself early Saturday. I feel an obligation to go to the bar crawl as I'm president of the organization and it's one of the last major events I have as president. Am I the asshole for even considering that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew reddit user so apologize for the formatting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ",

My boyfriend and I’s lease wasn’t up yet so we waited a week to move in with our friends.\n\nWell we all have another semi mutual couple that are friends. We’ve know each other for a few years but they don’t really try to talk or have much contact with my boyfriend and I, just our other friends. Anyway one day during the week that we hadn’t moved in yet they had told us they were all drinking the night before and they stayed the night because they didn’t want to drive home. Which is fine...but then they decided it was 1. Okay and 2. Kinda funny that they had sex in what was supposed to be/is our bedroom. We had some objects in there but no furniture luckily but I found that to be EXTREMELY disrespectful to our new place, our room especially and rude af. They never apologized and still come over every once and a while but they really only hangout with our other friends/roommates. I’m still bothered by it when they come over knowing they probably feel no remorse for what they did. \n\nSo am I overreacting a bit? Should I mention it again and set boundaries? Should I say nothing at all and let it go? What should I do reddit?",

      "description": "Now before anyone jumps into “you have the right to break up with anyone for whatever reason!” I know :) but while of course I have the right to, I need to know if I am being a huge dick here.\n\n\n\nDue to a shaky past for the majority of my childhood and early adulthood with male figures and men in general, I developed a lot of trust issues with men. After one particular incident I had to see a trauma &amp; ptsd specialist 3 times a week. It’s been a few years since then and I personally feel like I’ve made a lot of progress. I formed many healthy relationships with men over the years, whether as mentors, friends, fwbs or even just as acquaintances. \n\n\n\nAlmost a year ago I got into a serious relationship with a really nice guy. While he knows vaguely about some of my past, he honestly doesn’t seem interested in any further and never asked so I don’t tell him. I have mentioned some things that make me particularly uncomfortable or nervous, and he perfectly avoids them no questions asked. \n\n\n\nRecently, as our relationship has grown stronger through time, we spend a lot more time together. I’ve found myself being overwhelmed and have negative thoughts that I thought I moved past come swirling back - I overthink stupid small things he says or does for no reason. I think he’s being extremely controlling, manipulative or “power playing” (if that’s a thing) when he’s not. And I’m not being gaslit here - I don’t bring these things up to him and in time I look back and realize I was overreacting. But these constant one-sided internal struggles are wearing me down. \n\n\n\nAnd I know not bringing this up to him is a red flag. I can’t bring myself to communicate things like this to him. Sometimes thinking about telling him these dark and personal things makes me physically nauseous. I decided to go back to therapy, as it seems like an obvious next step. I let him know this, and asked if he was ok with it and he let me know he’s here for me no matter what. He said he’s fine with whatever baggage I bring and clearly I’m making an effort to help myself so he’s actually really proud.\n\n\n\nBut despite how supportive and positive and lovely he is, I can’t stay with him. I brought this all up to him 2 nights ago in his apartment. He said he needed to think and has since gone radio silent with me except one text: “what more could I have done?” I feel awful, and my friends are pretty evenly split on whether I’m justified or not. He always gives me space when I want is, listens when I need or backs off when I can’t talk about something. He’s supportive and genuinely so sweet, and yet I feel like I just can’t get through it with him. ",

      "description": "We started dating in October. Then she cut me off because she thought I was too selfish, to which I took the high road and wished her well. Then she texted me again about two weeks ago, and I took her on a few dates these past couple of weeks.\n\nGetting back together, she made it abundantly clear that she was hesitant about getting involved with me. Sort of a first red flag to already be qualifying this “relationship.”\n\nShe’s got a lot of debt putting herself through law school, and I’m fortunate to come from a wealthy family. And I would pay for everything whenever we went out. She had made it clear that she would not be paying for anything while we were out because she couldn’t afford to (which I understood). I didn’t mind at all. However, the last time we got ice cream together with her friend, I had to double park because there was no parking, and she asked me what I wanted, and she didn’t ask for any money— INSTEAD SHE PUT HER HAND OUT WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING. Right in front of my face. Right in front of her friend. I am a big believer in trusting your gut, and my gut told me right there that this is bad news. Big red flag for me.\n\nShe has an issue with seemingly every goddam thing I do. I will be driving, and she will tell me not to do slight honks when I’m driving because it’s unnecessary. (Ever heard of no backseat driving). If I don’t text her all day, she tells me I’m not putting in enough effort. Above all, she did not make me feel good about myself and was just such a difficult person. Third red flag.\n\nWhy do I need any more problems in my life? I made up my mind I didn’t want her in my life after talking to a close friend. So she texted me today asking if I needed my space, and I told her yes, and she should just focus on her. And I told her that I don’t want to do this anymore, and she told me I was a dick, and immediately blocked my number and all forms of social media.\n\nNow, she did explicitly tell me not to bring any drama for her during her finals, which I totally did. I could’ve faked it through finals, but I didn’t care all that much to fake it. And I do feel bad because this is extra bull shit for her to deal with on her plate.\n\nAlthough she was a royal pain in the ass, am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for going to my manager behind my co-worker’s back",
      "description": "Jessica (not her real name) and I started in the company on the same day, a year ago. We get along pretty well that’s why I feel so bad right now for going to my manager because of her work performance. \n\nOur company is a huge startup company. We only commenced our operations last year. I was hired as an Accountant and Jessica as an Accounting Analyst. She has an MBA degree and 13 years of experience working as a Financial Advisor in a for-profit school. On the other hand,  I am an Accounting major with four years experience. \n\nMy previous job was very similar to what I am doing. My manager showed us how the process is done only once, I picked it up quickly. I had to help her learn everything which I don’t mind. It is sometimes annoying though because she is not “computer savvy”. Anybody who works in accounting should have at least basic knowledge in MS Excel and she has none. Our tasks are related and I come up with process improvements to help us do things pretty quickly, she is always iffy about it. I kinda feel like she doesn’t want changes in the current process so I adapt to whatever she wants, if she can’t be flexible, I’m the one adjusting. She eventually learned stuff. \n\nRecently, I noticed that on some of her emails she is using “Accountant” as her title instead of “Accounting Analyst”. I didn’t tell anyone about this. I don’t know if anybody noticed. One time I sent an email to our vendors and she told me that I’m not using the correct format. Yes, there is a template and me and my manager are not really using it because it’s a waste of time, a non-value adding activity really. I told her that and she told me she wants everything to be uniform. She was acting like a manager when I taught her most of the things that she knows. I schedule to reconcile vendor accounts monthly, as per usual practice, she wants to do it almost everyday because of the volume which makes no fucking sense, worst is she asks me for assistance or bossing me around like “email them, ask this, ask that”. One incident I was speaking to the Sr Manager of one our biggest vendors on the phone because we cannot pay some huge invoices due to IT issues, she was beside literally telling me what to say. She even forced me to put the Sr Manager on hold so she can coach me. She told me to call IT right now and make someone in IT talk to the Sr Manager since it’s not our fault. \n\nOutside of work we are fine and I wish we never talk about work. Yesterday, I told my manager if he can create a boundary between my job and hers. There’s no clear division but I didn’t tell her about my co-worker’s attitude and the incidents above. She wants to dominate everything but her ideas are out of the line. I might sounded like an asshole undermining my co-worker to my manager but I couldn’t take it anymore and now I feel bad because instead of talking to her first, I went straight to my manager. AITA?

      "description": "This is obviously a throwaway, due to identification purposes. \n\nOkay so this will long guys, but I'll to make it as short as possible. I will post a TLDR at the end.\n\nTo preface this, I'm aware of the r/deadbedrooms and r/relationships and while I've been reading both of them, I felt like this is the best one to post in. \n\nSo my (f22) partner (m25) and I have been together for 3 and a half years and we live together. During the beginning of our relationship he disclosed to me that he was diagnosed with BPD and was severely depressed with previous suicidal thoughts (i was 19 at that time). This go towards a downward spiral and our relationship was never the same. He got into this tendency of \"spoiling\" me and giving up things to make me happy and while I asked him not to do that, he insisted. \n\nFast forward to 6 months later, he begins to become resentful and bitter, but fails to communicate any issues. A few months later he begins cutting, and tells me about suicidal thoughts. Now guys, i will also add that at that time i was going to college and working 30 hrs/w because he was unemployed. Things became financially and emotionally stressful. Everyday i would come home and worry that he'd be gone, i really didnt know what to do. Now im not gonna lie and say i was easy to deal with, because i wasnt. We were both emotionally unstable.\n\nWhen it got really bad, i made the executive decision to call his mom and take him to the hospital. He agreed and was admitted for 1 month. During that month, i found out i was pregnant (this all happened during final exam month). \n\nAfter he left the hospital we dealt with the pregnancy and decided to abort (mutual decision). I did the pill abortion and it was so excrutiating. I passed out from the pain and spent a long time screaming. While this was happening he was on discord with his friends, and i got upset. I didnt have an issue with the actual abortion, but with his priorities.\n\nIn end of 2017, i got diagnosed with BPDII. Which really drove the nail in the coffin.\n\nFast forward to early 2018 when we are both in school. Out sex decreased and he didnt even want to spend time with me. He explained it as he just got out of the hospital and wanted to find himself after being lost for so long. I understood and was trying to be as patient as possible. \n\nEver since that our sex deceased from 1 a week at the beginning of 2018 to once every 2-3 weeks at the end of 2018. \n\nNow this is where it grts tricky, once his sex drive started going down, he suggested an open relationship for me, i didn't know what to think because i only wanted him. I didnt want to have sex with anyone else. A few months after, i do find someone and have sex with them. It was disappointing and we decide to end the open relationship. \n\nLate 2018, i connect with a guy that i started talking to when we had an open relationship but we never met or did anything. We mostly talked about vid games and joked around. Later on, when tthings between my partner and i get tough, i start talking to this guy more often and yes this is 100% my fault and i begin sending him suggestive msg/pics. It didnt go any further than that and it was only 2 or 3 times. I would never sleep with him or even do anything. \n\nMy partner found out by going thru my phone. This create big problems, for obvious reasons. While we were arguing he found out that i did t sleep with him or send him any pictures showing anything, so he didnt want to end things, which surprised me. \n\nI accepted all responsibility and i told him everything that happened. While he told me that he's only staying with me bc its financially beneficial i make around (100k) and hes still in school, we have debts and a car together. \n\nRecently everytime he brings a problem up or says he cant live like this, i ask him if he wants to leave he says no, and i always assure him that if he did, i wouldn't leave him with all the bills (theyre mostly in his name), he says he only said that bc he was angry and didn't mean it. Im worried that hes only staying with me because of convinience not because he truly wants to. Its not that i care that im paying for the bills, i just dont want him to stay with me because of financial responsibilities. I want him to be happy and not to have to settle. \n\nI love my partner very much and i honestly hate myself for even doing something like this because he had been cheated on before by his previous ex. \n\n\nTLDR; my (f22) partner (m25) and i had a rough patch and i sent suggestive pics to another guy, he found out and stayed. He said hes only staying bc its financially beneficial to stay but later said he didnt mean it. \n\nI know im the asshole for cheating, but the question is AITA for questioning why he stays? \n\nSorry for the mistakes, English isnt my first language.

I debated posting on r/relationship_advice, but he's been throwing the word \"asshole\" in my face so much that I figured it would be more fitting to come here for support.\n\nI am an avid supporter of daily sunscreen wear. Seeing pictures of how well people age due to regular wear, and hearing about it from my friends and family has inspired me to take care of my face and prevent unnecessary skin damage. My boyfriend and I have been together for several months, and I feel like he is husband material. Because of this, I plan on looking at his face for a very long time, and I want him to benefit from sunscreen in the same way I feel I am. I have asked him on multiple occasions to consider using sunscreen, but he refuses. He doesn't like the smell, and feels that my request is only something I can/should be asking as a wife, not a girlfriend. He then went on to say that he will gladly wear sunscreen for me when and if we do get married. \n\nThis comment on sunscreen being a \"husbandy request\" has really thrown me for a loop, and I fear deeper misogynist issues could be at play. That being said, AITA for pushing my boyfriend to use sunscreen so he will look good for years to come? ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I both are both in college. He doesn't have a lot of money saved up right now since he hasn't worked since the summer, but he recently found a part time retail job near his school and should be starting soon. A couple weeks ago we found a concert we wanted to go that cost $40 per person and since he didn't have a lot saved up in his account I said I would pay for both of us and he could pay me back whenever he could. He does a sport with his college that is having a competition this weekend, which should have been free except he signed up a day late and so instead it cost him $30. I'm slightly annoyed that he obviously had enough money to pay for this competition but didn't have enough to pay me for the concert when it was a similar amount? He hasn't started working yet so he has even less in his account right now then he did two weeks ago when we bought tickets. He also owes me another $250 for a vacation we booked for spring break since he figured he'd be working by then and would have enough to go on the trip. I'm not exactly dying for the money right this second since I have a decent amount saved up, but it's still kind of annoying that he's perfectly okay paying for things he wants (he also goes out and buys food maybe 2 or 3x a week) but can't start paying me back. When we go out to eat we always intend on splitting it but if I end up paying and ask him to Venmo me after, he often ends up forgetting. But if he pays, he never forgets to ask me to Venmo him. He's broke af so sometimes I know he owes me money for food or a concert or whatever but I let it go since I have a lot more saved up and it's not *that* big a deal. But I guess I'm just starting to get a bit irritated that he'll easily drop money on shit he wants but will drag his feet whenever he needs to start paying me back for stuff. AITA? ",

      "description": "About 2 months ago I (23M) got an ear piercing. My parents (both 64) saw it for the first time a couple weeks ago and were immediately upset and angry at what I had done. \n\nMy mum, although not a fan of it, was nowhere near as bad as my dad who expressed how disappointed and ashamed of me he was. My mum said to leave it so he did and we enjoyed a nice dinner without anymore mention of it. I assumed this was the end of it. \n\nHowever I woke up next morning to a lengthy email from my dad about it, where he repeated how upset and disappointed he was with me (especially as I know they wouldn't like it), how earrings are not for men, make you look like a punk and will damage the way people see you (judged in job interviews etc), how it could be unsafe and cause my ear to get ripped off, how it's a waste of money, and how he hasn't been able to sleep thinking about it. \n\nThis massively upset me for a number of reasons. Firstly, I never like fighting with my parents, and we haven't really ever since I was a kid. I was also upset that I had hurt him and my mum, because I never deliberately want to upset them. \nHowever, I was also upset by the degree of my dad's reaction and made me worry that if they have an issue with my views and lifestyle choices. It's not a big deal to me  and I view tattoos  and piercings s vert normal whereas they clearly do not. If I were to bring someone home who had tattoos or piercings or were 'different' in another way, would they have an issue with that. I feel almost angry that they are disappointed that I am different to exactly how they want me to be and won't let me live my own life. As such, I don't want to get rid of it, as I feel they should be more accepting of who I am.\n\nSo am I the arsehole for not taking it out and now making a concious decision to do something that I know will make my parents angry and upset? \n\n\nFor context, my dad is 64, very conservative, and not the most affectionate of men, and rarely expresses his emotions. I on the other hand have fairly liberal views and am quite happy expressing my emotions - I also have a job and no one has an issue with my piercing, which is partly why I chose to get it when I did. \n\nTL:DR Got a piercing. Parents don't like it. Going to keep it anyway. \n",

      "description": "Using a throwaway even though my roommate will immediately recognize this if she sees it.\n\nMe roommate (22 F) and I (24 F) have been living together for six months and so far everything has been gravy. We're friends from college, live our own lives, and both do our share of the chores around the apartment.\n\nA few days ago my roommate, we'll call her Claire, brought home an Emu egg. We live in rural Australia, so seeing an emu egg is not that big a deal, but then she told me she found it on a \"mound\" in the bush and I'm like holy shit is this an actual live emu in here? She just shrugged. I said it was fucked up to just take an egg that had a chick in it. She told me she thought it was \"abandoned\" and she was gonna try to get it to hatch.\n\nNow at this point I pretty much washed my hands of the situation. I didn't like having this egg around but I wasn't gonna sabotage my living situation over it. She would keep it in her room under a heat lamp (she has a pet lizard that needs one), so I'd hardly see it.\n\nNow, one day I come home from work and I'm completely wrecked cause I work on my feet all day. I walk over to the couch and sit down on this U-shaped cushion (kinda like [this one](https://secure.img1-fg.wfcdn.com/im/59675625/resize-h600-w600%5Ecompr-r85/4146/41464506/U+Shaped+Body+Pillow+Protector.jpg)) we've had forever and put some trash TV on. Of course I end up falling asleep lying on the couch.\n\nFlash forward to a couple hours later and I wake up to Claire prodding me in the shoulder. I open my eyes and she is glaring straight at me, holding the egg right in my face. There is a tiny chink poked out of it ad the baby emu's beak is legit coming through. I scream and ask her why the fuck she is holding a hatching ANIMAL in my face. She tells me that she left the egg in the U-shaped cushion to \"incubate\" and that by sleeping on it for ages I had \"hatched\" it.\n\nShe said it was the egg's \"cooling period\" and by sitting on it I caused it to hatch premature. I told her she she should \"cool HER period\" and that she didn't know what she was talking about. I think she was just mad that I hatched the egg and not her.\n\nNow she is talking about me LEAVING THE APARTMENT (the lease is in her name) over this.\n\nI feel like it was an honest mistake and she shouldn't have stolen the egg and LEFT IT ON THE COUCH in the first place. So please, tell me, AITA here?!??",

      "description": "My mother has recently had an operation on her shoulder and asked me if I could walk our dog in the mornings, a job which she normally does. Of course I’d love to do it, but I have a fear of going outside on some days. It sometimes gets to a point where I can’t leave the house to go shopping or hold a steady job. I’ve told her about it before but she just thinks I’m faking it to get out of doing stuff and paying my way through life.\n\nI’m more worried for the dog’s sake that if my mental health gets the better of me one day, nobody is going to walk him, so do I have to grin and bear it anyway? It doesn’t help that the last time I walked him, he barked at 2 pit bulls who jumped on him and would have mauled him if I hadn’t had him on the lead to pull him away.\n\nOf course this isn’t a case where I don’t want to walk my dog, it’s more “sometimes I’m too scared to leave the house by myself, let alone while I charge of an animal.”",

      "description": " As always, be advised of the possible mobile formatting errors.\n\nThis last December, my boyfriend and I got engaged. We’re both 24 and graduate students in different programs at the same university. My freshman year, before we met, I dated another guy at the same school. I’ll call him K. He was a senior and was graduating that year. It was my first relationship with a guy (I didn’t come out until I got to college), so I’ll admit I probably rushed into things. I fell pretty hard for him, but he always seemed kinda distant. K was a super outgoing person and had a big group of friends he’d go out with nearly every weekend, but would never invite me to go along. In fact, I only ever met two of his friends ‘accidentally’ when I showed up to his apartment to surprise him with a fountain Coke from McDonalds (which for some reason does taste better than from anywhere else). When we were alone he was always super sweet and would talk about how much he liked having me around, but never wanted to go out in public together.\n\nNear the end of the year, K landed a job in the same city as our school. I had been wary of talking to him about our future before, since I didn't know he'd live/work after graduation. But now that I knew he was going to be around for the foreseeable future, I decided to confronted him about my concerns. We had a long conversation, which essentially boiled down to ‘thanks for the fun and support, but I can only ever see a future for myself with a woman.’ Obviously it hurt a lot. I left his place in tears the next morning, and in the time it took me to walk home he’d blocked my number and all my social media. It took me awhile to get over it.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to last week. Despite living in the same town, I hadn’t seen K since we broke up. One day after work I stopped for a guilty pleasure dinner at Taco Bell and K's there. We make eye contact and he nods. While waiting we do the awkward ‘how’ve you been?’ chat. He makes a comment about the ring on my finger, and says congrats. I take my food, head to my fiancé’s apartment and tell him what happened. We laugh, and quickly move on. The next day I get a text as long as a CVS receipt from K. He talked about how he’s missed me and had wanted to reach out earlier. He said he knows he could make me happier than my fiancé could (which, no lol) and he wants another chance. I try as nicely as I can to tell him no, he missed his chance. He changes tactics and talks about how lonely he’s been and can't talk to his friends about it. I told him sorry, that’s not my problem. He then basically says if I don’t talk to him, I’m responsible for any negative impact on his mental health and any ‘consequences’ that might bring. By this point, I’m over it - I tell him to fuck off and block his number.\n\nI don't want anything bad to happen to him,  but I don't think it's my problem anymore. So reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "My friend/roommate is very well off, a lot more than I am, and she has a car + licence and I don't. We were driving home from a ways away, 2 or 3 hours and got into our home city at around 10 at night.\n\nI wanted to stop by a pawnshop I usually go to in order to buy out my laptop that night, and asked her to stop in. She said no, that she'd been driving for hours, there was snow on the ground and she wanted to go home asap. Later, as we were getting into the city, she asked me to input our address into google maps, since she's been in the city for only a few months and hasn't memorized the route in an out of the city.\n\nI think she was being unreasonable. The pawn shop was like a 15 minute walk away from our apartment and I didn't want to go walk in the snow with my laptop. We live in a rough area and didn't want to get robbed.\n\nSo I input the pawnshop adress and didn't tell her until we were almost there. When she realized what street we were on, she stopped in the middle of the street and told me to get the fuck out of her car. I tried to ask her to at least pull up to a curb but she kept screaming so I freaked and jumped out.\n\nI ended up walking back anyways without my laptop, and when I got back I started to get mad at her for abandoning me like she did.\n\nBut she started screaming and crying about how I 'used' her, and how she never wants to talk to me again. An issue, since we signed a 12 month lease together and we're only 5 months in. When I reminded her, she said she doesn't care and demanded the money I owed her, about 600$ in total.\n\nSince we were both new renters, the apartment complex asked us to supply one months rent as a security deposit, and she paid the thing in whole because she was working the summer before and was generally better off. She said I could pay her back my half whenever, and I was planning to do it over the summer when I could work.\n\nNow she's rescinding on the deal and basically telling me to GTFO of her life after the lease ends because I asked her to make one little detour that wouldn't have taken 10 minutes.\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "First post, I'm nervous as heck and I'm on mobile, so sorry if there's formatting issues. Also, throwaway.\n\nSo, a few years back my brother moved in with us (my husband and I) when we got a new place, as we were all ready to get out of my parents place and figured it made sense for us all to live together.\n\nI was pregnant with my first kid when we moved in, and had her several months later.\n\nMy relationship with my brother did not survive this. Things were kinda shitty before I had her, but they turned absolutely irreparable afterwards.\n\nHe made absolutely 0 effort to be around/be a part of my life/my kids life from the moment I stepped into the hospital, and he was blatantly disrespectful while he was blowing us all off.\n\nMy brother in law was stationed in Korea during this time, and he made an effort to be and succeeded in being a larger part of my newborn daughters life than my own brother ever has. Yeah. A guy stationed in a different COUNTRY was a better uncle than the guy sitting upstairs. \n\nanyways, he moved out and we pretty much dropped all contact, mutually. He doesnt really like any of our family so he usually stays away from family events. Its been easy for us to just ignore each other. He doesnt seem to have any issue with this, and I dont either.\n\nHowever, tomorrow is one of my extended family members birthday. We were all set to go and celebrate, but my mom texted me tonight and told me that my brother is going to be there.\n\nI WOULD just go and ignore him, except I KNOW my family is going to refer to him as \"uncle (his name)\" around my daughter.\n\nI dont want that. At ALL. \n\nHe has done nothing to be her uncle. Everyone she knows as an uncle, has made an effort to be in her life and she knows they love her. My brother has done nothing to warrant that title except be related to her by blood, and that's not good enough for me.\n\nIt would basically insinuate to her that my brother is a close family member, akin to her very beloved Uncle (BIL name), when he absolutely is not.\n\nI would just ignore my feelings and deal with being uncomfortable about it - however, my kid is going to be 3 very soon. She's old enough now where if anyone refers to him as \"uncle (name)\", she's going to come home with me and ask about him/to see him.\n\nThat's why it's an issue. I dont want to deal with that.\n\nHowever, I know that if I tell my family not to call him that in front of her, I'm going to be called out as the asshole.\n\nAlso, INB4 \"but he's family!\" Both my hubs and I have had difficult relations with blood family, so we subscribe to the \"family are those who care about you\" line of thinking. \n\nOne of my friends already kinda voted me as YTA because \"hes family and [I] cant keep him out of her life forever\" but I feel like I can and its warranted.\n\nSo, WIBTA for asking my family not to refer to my brother as my daughters uncle, and to just have him go by only his name instead?",

      "description": "Some context here: I'm Indian, but have grown up abroad my whole life, including in London. As such, I don't have the accent, but still connect deeply to my culture; Hindi is my first language, and I visit Delhi to see my family every year. I grew up pretty well-off, but both of my parents grew up in abject poverty, and raised me humbly. The school I went to was filled with rich kids, who would often not realize the privileged position they were in. Casual conversation at my school was often about which holiday home in the Mediterranean they were visiting this spring, and I generally felt pretty out of place. \n\nMany of my friends are British, and often fiercely patriotic. They have a tendency to make jokes that make me feel uncomfortable, such as attending a fancy dress party dressed as \"the Sun setting on the British Empire\", and saying things such as \"you're only allowed to be proud of where you're from if you're from Britain\", among countless other examples. Whenever I previously expressed discomfort, they would often play it off as them trying to be \"edgy\" or \"ironic\". One comment that made me particularly outraged was when one of them got into a fight with one of our mutual friends, who is Japanese, and blurted out \"President Truman didn't do enough; he should have dropped three bombs\" (or something to that effect) (I went absolutely ballistic at her for that one. Haven't had a conversation with her since, don't intend to).\n\nFor a while, I kept mute. I'm generally not outgoing, and have found a group of friends who I generally enjoyed hanging out with, aside from in instances like this. I am afraid of jeopardizing that. Recently however, particularly after the New Zealand attacks, I've been calling them out. In one heated exchange, I told a friend that her \"jokes\" were what normalized white supremacy. I'm certain that the comments they make don't come from genuine malicious intent, but I feel as though I'm drifting from my group of friends because I don't find them funny. I feel as though that sort of normalization is what often leads me to feel ashamed of my own skin color and my heritage. \n\nMy family, particularly my grandparents, had a poor relationship with the British. My grandfather lost three of his siblings when he was forced to leave his home during the partition. I understand that I was not a direct victim of colonization, and I also understand that my friends who make these jokes are not the direct perpetrators. Nonetheless, I feel uncomfortable and offended when jokes are made about colonization. Mostly, I'm worried that I'm being too easily offended here, and making a big deal out of some light-hearted banter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My friends are making jokes about colonization that I've recently become more uncomfortable about. Am I the asshole for being offended, given my heritage?",

      "description": "Last night I ran into my crush, let's call her Amy, at the library, alongside some other people. They were gossiping and shittalking multiple people. They were really mad at a 'friend of mine' named Andy who was working on their group project and didn't show up. They straight up asked me where he was. I didn't know for sure, but I gave my most honest, best guess. I said he was probably at home jacking off. I was 90% sure this was true, because that's what he does- he's even admitted it, saying that he has no hobbies other than jacking off and that it's the only thing he does. Then I mentioned some other dirt about him, kinda trashed him a little bit. I need to remind you that everyone else was trash talking as well, and everything I said was true. For example, that I'm not really friends with him and that I just feel sorry for him and that he's a pervert. Both true.\n\nToday, Amy, her group, and I all found out that Andy had a band concert and wasn't staying home jerking off, and he basically called me a liar. Amy didn't say it out, but it seemed like my crush kind if thinks I'm a backstabbing liar now. It's just that in class she kinda ignored me and shit.\n\nPosted this on other subs, and some people are calling me the asshole for gossiping. I don't think so, because I was just answering Amy's question truthfully, and everyone else was gossiping as well.",

She makes me super happy, helps me deal with a lot of my anxiety issues, and has been a super sweet and supporting person to me. She does all this for me and I try to do all this for her and we both show appreciation on us having each other's backs\n\nHowever, she threw a curve ball at me the other day, and now I cannot get passed it some.\n\nWe go to school with a guy and she's a neighbor to him. Every now and then, she will ask him to give him a ride home (fine with it. I do go immediately from school to work some days so I completely understand it). There are some days even when I'm not busy, she will ask him and not let me know when I offer to take her home.\n\nWhat then threw me off was when she told me said guy liked her right before I did and I then caught said guy taking her to lunch and such. He claims to be just be a friend to her but he constantly is with her, talking to her, and she even pushes me back some times for him, like she would rather spend time with him more than me. I might be blind (I am legally blind without glasses), but that looks like someone making a move on her. And it both worries me and upset me.\n\nI ask if I am the asshole because we recently fought over this and she is stubborn to her side saying they are only friends and I shouldn't be jealous of him being nice to her.\n\nTLDR: we have a friend that's neighbors to my GF and he is getting more time with her than me and making a move in my eyes.

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2.5 years, and in a lot of ways we are great. Super supportive of each other, open lines of communication, we live together and don't fight much, like all the things you want in your day to day to make things go smoothly. With one exception, our bedroom life. \n\nThe first few months of our relationship were long distance, at which point she moved to my city to live with me. Up until that point our sex lives had been pretty great, even a bit adventurous, both of us were pretty happy with our bedroom performance when we got to see each other.\n\nHowever, she had a lot of trouble finding a job she liked once she moved here, and her self confidence took a massive hit, which first decreased the adventurousness of our sex life, until it became non existent. At the time while I wasn't OK with this, I didn't feel like it would be fair or OK for me to push for a more active bedroom experience. So things went this way for a few months. \n\nFast forward seven months or so, and she has finally found herself a well paying job in her desired field. Much happiness is had. After a couple of weeks of things going ok I start to mildly push for a more active sex life, and she rebuffs. Ok cool I get it, let's try again in a few days... Which she also is meh to. Alright a little strange, so I mention it to her and she says that it's just been a while, let her initiate. Ok got it, and then three weeks go by without her initiating. \n\nAt this point I have a serious sit down conversation with her, explaining how I feel and what I need in terms of a sexual component for a relationship. She understands, but expressed that she has really felt her desire for sex drop, that her libido is gone. We discuss this and agree we need to work on this component of our relationship. But then nothing happens. I offer to be more romantic, ask how I can better satisfy her, read more articles about how I can be a better lover more times than I'd care to count... But nothing has really changed, and her input on these questions is pretty minimal. \n\nThis cycle has repeated at this point at least six or so times, without much movement on her part. There is some sexual nature on an occasional basis, and we will even get on a rythm sometimes, but inevitably things just kinda peter out. At this point whenever I bring up the conversation, tears are had and exclamations of I'm trying ensue. \n\nI feel like I've made my position clear, made my desire to help us work on this evident, and frankly had agreement from her that this is something we need to work on, but nothing has changed. At this point I feel like I'm becoming a nice guy with a fedora about the whole situation, but I also feel like it's not unfair of me to clearly communicate a desire for a sexual component of a relationship. \n\nSo, am I the asshole by pressuring for a sexual component of my relationship? Or am I just terrible in the bedroom? (A possibility that must be considered)",

      "description": "So my SO and I have been together for a little over 2 years and known each other for about 8.  He is not into gift giving or receiving in general and really only does my birthday and Christmas because it's something I want.  I take a lot of joy in finding people the perfect gift.  He doesn't want to celebrate his birthday and so I respect that.  When it comes to gifts for him, he prefers experiences over material things.  When it comes to our anniversary we do something together and while I honestly would like to do something for valentine's day I think that would be pushing it so we pretty much ignore it.  I think that's a pretty good summary of our gift giving situation.\n\nEarly on in our relationship he asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I said a pair of earrings.  I had a lost one of my diamond studs (an inexpensive pair, something like $100 and honestly the only piece of jewelry I had that didn't come on a piece of cardboard).  He asked me multiple times what I wanted and each time that's what I said.  Eventually he just said \"I'm not going to ever buy you jewelry so... yeah.\"  I asked why not and he said he thinks it's stupid and he doesn't like shopping for it.  (I will add that this was in the price range we had discussed and he ended up spending more than this on my Christmas gift.  Football tickets, which I loved.)\n\nSo here's the thing.  I think one of the things that can make a gift thoughtful or nice or whatever is to buy something for someone that they wouldn't buy for themselves normally.  It doesn't have to be something you agree with or enjoy shopping for or anything like that.  It's about making them happy.  For example, I think it's ridiculous that he has a $300 pen.  I mean it's a nice pen!  But whoa that's steep for a pen.  However if he mentioned he wanted that pen and it was in the price range for a gift, I would love to buy it for him, because it's something he really wants.\n\nAnd so that is why I am rather annoyed on this total, unequivocal ban on jewelry.  It seems arbitrary and against the idea of gifting something to someone for the purpose of their happiness rather than having anything to do with yours.  I will also add that I'm not a picky gift receiver and he has gotten me lovely gifts including things like a trip to a bookstore I've always wanted to go to, a ton of WWII books because he knows I'm a history nerd, the football tickets, etc.  I would never receive a gift and not appreciate it.  But it just... digs at me a little when he refuses to buy something because he thinks its \"stupid,\" which kind of feels like he's saying there's something wrong with me for wanting it. \n\nSo.  Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Back in 2013, when I was a teenager, a group of real life friends of mine and I used to play online games with this guy from another state. We got along pretty well with that guy and played together until 2015, but never met in real life. Since then we didn't keep much touch to him(We talk on a whatsapp group like twice a year and that's it).\n\nAs we got older and life happened that real life group kinda broke up due to some fights. Also people on that group started working, going to college, relationships, etc. So we don't really hang out together anymore. \n\nYesterday, on Christmas Eve, that guy was drunk and messaged us on that whatsapp group. He said that he wanted to come visit us and asked for a place to stay. No one offered a place for him, since everybody in that group still lives with their parents(that's quite common in my country) and they wouldn't be ok hosting a total stranger, but he still bought the plane tickets anyway without any agreement on our part. He said he would be coming next month to stay for a week.\n\n It took literally 30 mins from telling us that he wanted to come and buying the tickets. The thing is we don't have a place for him to stay and no one would be able to spend the whole week with him due to work, college and other obligations. It's a small city so he basically wouldn't have anything to do here by himself.\n\nWIBTA for telling him that he should cancel his tickets(here in my country law allows you to cancel and get a full refund up to a week after you bought it) since the group of people that he would come to visit doesn't get along that well anymore and there isn't even a place for him to stay? He would basically be wasting his time and money on a experience that most likely would be shitty for people involved.",

I am really proud of her for going back to school at 50 but I might not attend her graduation ceremony.  My mom is horrible about telling me anything family related (ex: birthday parties, thanksgiving dinner times) so I asked her 2 months ago when her graduation was scheduled because I wanted to be there.  She told me she wasn’t walking because she didn’t want to pay the extra fee, anyways she told me yesterday she is walking after all and has know she is walking for about a month and never told me.  It’s next week and I work 2 jobs (60-70 hour weeks) and the schedule is already set so I cannot make it.  I’ve tried trading shifts but no one is willing, I might be about to get someone to cover it or call in sick but I just started this new job and I would hate to look bad.\n\nI want to go but I had such little notice and at the end of the day my rent is more important to me.  My family’s making me feel even worse about it and I went off to my mom about how if she really wanted me there she would have told me weeks ago.  Am I the asshole?",

He started dating a girl \\[18F\\] a few months ago who I don't feel good about. She needs to know where he is all the time--for example, they have a shared Google calendar because \"she doesn't do well not knowing where he is.\" She stages a meltdown anytime she feels she's not getting attention from him. Just the other day, she texted me at two in the morning asking if he was home and asleep, to which I did not respond because it felt creepy and invasive.\n\nThese behaviors to me scream manipulation. My roommate even said once that she could be possessive, but when I raised an eyebrow, he said, \"No, no, not like that,\" and immediately backpedaled. I tried to let it go until I couldn't. I told  a few of my friends that I thought he needed to break up with her for his own safety/sanity, which quickly made its way around campus and he confronted me about it.  I admitted that I had been talking about her and that I was worried about him. I asked if he was doing okay, he and he said he was fine--more than that, that my own experience in a toxic relationship had colored my visions of what was happening between them and I needed to mind my own business.\n\nSince then, I've stopped talking about their relationship to others because I realize that's inappropriate. Still, I think he needs to leave her. AITA for wanting him to dump her or should I just let it go?",

He studies philosophy and believes that experiencing a trip could help him gain a new perspective on his ego/emotional issues. It is true that psychedelics help a lot of people. \n\nBut even though these drugs are not addictive, him making this into a lifestyle would stress me out. I don't like the risk-- the lack of safety that would come with him being mentally unable to control himself for periods of time. And while psychedelics alone are not an inherent gateway to drug addiction, I also feel that him taking them could couple with his emotional vulnerability and lack of self-control, potentially leading him to try harder/actually addictive drugs.\n\nI have addicts in my family and he does not. While he promises to not let himself spiral out of control, I try to explain that no one wakes up one day and decides they want to become a drug addict-- it's a very gradual process and starts out like it's all fun and games. \n\nRelationships are full of boundaries and personal preferences. I told him that if he decided to take psychedelics then our relationship would be in jeopardy. If he decided to do this frequently, it definitely would be a cause for splitting. Am I being too paranoid? Am I not letting him live? I just want what's best for him, and I can't help but think that this ain't it. ",

      "description": "So, this happened last year but I have been thinking about it a bit recently and wondered if I was the person in the wrong within this situation.\n\nI became single in Jan last year.\n\nI was on tinder and I met E. We got talking last March, and E asked me out on a date. I accepted.\n\nWe had an amazing date and I really enjoyed myself, so we went on a few more. He was so lovely- kind, caring, chatty, thoughtful and affectionate, and he made me laugh a lot. The thing is, E was a very chivalrous person and point blank refused to let me contribute to dates, to the point where if I did pay he got upset and quite angry.\n\nThings were going good, and we were dating for about 2 months. I really enjoyed his company. \n\nNow, my birthday is in May, and I told him not to bother getting me anything as he had been so generous in the past. However, my birthday rolls around and he turns up at my house, and to my utter shock he gives me my present- a 5 star couples holiday to Tunisia. As soon as he gives me this, he asks me to be his girlfriend. I accepted.\n\nThings went well, and the day of the holiday rolls around. He came to pick me up from my house, and suddenly he was like a different person. Literally a complete 180 of the person he was before the holiday- he was quiet, moody, and didn't speak to me AT ALL until we got to the airport. I thought he was just tired and gave him the benefit of the doubt, but when we actually got to Tunisia, he continued this behaviour- he snapped a lot, hardly said a word to me (and when he did it was about his ex girlfriend) and was on his phone the ENTIRE time. Literally 24/7- at dinner, at drinks, by the pool. He also hardly wanted to spend time with me, never coming to breakfast, going to bed very early and he slept pretty much on the opposite side of the bed to me. I kept asking him what was wrong, if I had upset him, if there was anything I could do to help but he just said there was nothing wrong. Honestly, the whole holiday felt as though I was a spare part and he had just taken me as he had no-one else to go with. This carried on for the entire 10 days we were there.\n\nWhen we came back, he dropped me off at home, didn't even say goodbye. I asked to meet up with him the next day and said that I was breaking up with him for the way he acted on holiday- he told me he could see it coming as he knew he wasn't himself. I offered to pay for half the holiday, but again, he refused to let me.\n\nWas I the A-hole in this situation? I feel like I was as he bought me a holiday, however he made me completely miserable the whole time, was very rude, constantly talked about his ex and was on his phone the whole time. At the time I felt as though I did the right thing as I wasn't happy at all, but I feel guilty that I went on the holiday in the first place. Is there anything I should have done differently? ",

      "description": "So I live with my family, we get along great, I help with works around the house daily, and i help with our bigger cleaning that we do every weekend.\n\ni’m 17, I have a job and also go to art school so I have a lot of homeworks and very little free time. I have a boyfriend and a group of friends.\n\nI usually spend my fridays at the bf and then go home.\n\nMy mom seems to have a problem with this, she always says how I’m a bad daughter because I’d rather be with my friends/bf than with her.\n\nWhen I stay home and say that we should go somewhere we always end up only cleaning the house anyways - and then her crying because I can’t choose a place where i want to go with her. \n\nthe thing is i don’t really want to go somewhere with her when i can be with people that i have more fun with. \n\nfor example today, when i wanted to stay one more night with my bf, because my sunday shift was cancelled, she texted me that no, i need to go home and we’ll go somewhere as family. \nSo i got home, she told me to do the dishes and now I’m sitting at my computer for an hour, and when i ask her if we’re going anywhere she just say that “why should we go when u don’t wanna go anyways” \n\nit just makes  me mad and i feel like i’m wasting my time when i could have been elsewhere.

      "description": "Sorry for the long post in advance, there is just a lot to cover here. \n\nI \\[20M\\] don't really date because I've just had bad experiences in the past, but it's been 4 years since I was in a relationship so I decided to put myself out there. In my chem class, we have a small group of friends (we all met and started talking the past 2 months) which consists of myself, two other guys, and one girl \\[21F\\]. I knew the guys pretty well, but I never really talked to the girl until this past month. First day of us actually meeting each other, we talked in class and enjoyed each others company. Day two, she asks for my phone number and in my head, I take this as her showing interest in me. Day three, I ask her to coffee and she says yes which only reaffirms my belief that she likes me. After this, we keep talking for four more days, and then I decide to ask her to breakfast. She says she can't that day (Tuesday) but she can on Thursday. In my experience, when someone is into you, they show all of the signs that she showed me. Thursday comes, we have a great time at breakfast, and I get so excited about where things are going that I call my sister to tell her about this girl I've been seeing. My sister asks if I'm going to introduce her to our family anytime soon which makes me realize that I haven't actually asked her if we are dating or not. So I text her asking if these have been dates or us just hanging out as friends. About three hours later, she finally texts back that she thought we were just friends hanging out and that she doesn't want a relationship because things could get awkward next semester. I'm a little upset, but I'm an adult who can handle things not going my way, so I'm civil about everything and I reassure her that this won't have an effect on our friendship. I take the night to process everything that happened including everything she said and I still feel like she has feelings for me, and - although it's possible that I'm being delusional - I feel like her answer was a little open ended because she never said that she didn't have feelings for me. The next day, I text her again addressing this saying that if her only concern is that if things go bad between us then next semester will be awkward, or if she just only views me as a friend - which I could accept. She waits three days to finally respond and tells me that she's actually been seeing a guy since before she met me. At this point, I'm pissed because I feel like that was something she absolutely should have told me, even back when we got coffee. Although I never explicitly said that I was looking for a relationship, I felt like it was fairly obvious and she should've been more honest with me. I didn't respond to her text, and I don't really know how I'm going to react when I see her in class on Tuesday. So I'm asking, am I the asshole for being pissed about this situation? Or is this my fault for not explicitly stating my intentions on the first date?",

      "description": "My fiancé and I have had a rough time recently that has little to do with our relationship. The personal circumstances we are experiencing have caused us to stress and let go of our anger on each other. We both know that this needs to change and we have been working to resolve this. \n\nWe were having an especially rough morning and broke out into an argument. I can't even remember what we were arguing about because it wasn't over a real issue. Before we were able to resolve the argument, we had to go to work. We work for the same company but usually never see each other because we are in different departments. However, there was a required meeting everyone was required to be in that day.  I could feel and see her giving me dagger eyes from across the room so I made a little heart with my hands to alleviate some of the tension. My fiancé made another heart but broke it in half which I thought was hilarious. In response, I texted her (yes during the meeting) \"Thank you for splitting your heart and giving me half of it. I love you\". \n\nShe responded back with \"you're an ass for not taking me seriously\" but I assumed that she was responding to my joke when she did this? I'm really confused on what I did wrong here but I obviously messed up since she hasn't talked to me much since that day (which was 2 days ago now). AITA?? ",

      "description": "Ok, strap in for a long one because there is a lot to explain. I work as a lifeguard at the public pool in my town and we usually work long shifts where no one is around except for your coworker, so you usually get to know the person pretty well. For a period of time me and another coworker (let's call her Amy) and I had a small relationship. It did not end well, we ended up having a fight but at the end of it we decided to sweep it under the rug and forget about it. Enter girl number 2, let's call her Katy. Katy and I have a long history because we were on the swim team together and went to school together and is a fellow lifeguard, I'm gonna be completely honest, I hate Katy. She led a boy on for THREE YEARS just because she wanted to do it because it was \"funny\". She is also a shit stirrer. Before the incidant she and I already did not like each other because I called her out on being a turd cake before. So, when. Katy finds out about my unceremonious breakup with Amy (that's another thing I hated about it, EVERYONE KNEW the second we started dating) Katy went on the full offensive, binging it up every single time we we're in a room together, weather it was at practice or while lifeguarding. It got so bad that I had to contact my coach and boss to try to get them to separate Katy and I. At practice she would always hop in my lane just to fuck with me and start shit. Throughout the couple of months she did this I usually just sucked it up and did not get angry or outburst at her, so it was building on me pretty heavily. Here comes the unfortunate day, we go to our final swim meet of the season, (literally the last day) and I'm getting ready to race, so I have my speedo on and my cap ready to get in, the girls had just dove in and a pretty sizeable chunk of the team is at the opposite end of the pool cheering on the girls. So I go over there to help support, but right as I walked up I hear Katy, straight up say to Amy, that I have been bragging about sending nudes and having sex with her. ( The relationship never got past the kissing stage) , I thing in my head \"WhAt the fuCk\" and I see red, I grab her by the shoulders and pull here away from the crowd and put her in an awkward but REALLY firm bear hug,   and I tell her to fuck off and never speak of that again  in a super aggressive tone. Then I let her go and I put on my swim cap and jump in the water and do my swim (was not a good swim btw) then go to the warm down lane and warm down, I get out of the water and my coach says, \"Katy said you strangled her, your done\" \nI leave the last meet of the season in shame because I let my anger get the best of me. Fast forward to school, I get suspended, I have to talk to a judge and police officer, (got charged with battery). The day I get back I speak with the principal and Katy and her mother, I apologise in full about what I did, ( I do wholeheartedly regret it) I broke into tears while doing it. After that I told her how Katy borderline bullied me for four months, THE INSTANT I say that, Katy breaks down into tears and starts screaming and denying everything I said and how I was a total scumbag and how I was rude and abusive twords her before the incident, and straight up lies through her fucking TEETH about everything, then I try to explain how one of my friends and brother witnessed her doing it and they can come in and verify my claims the mother says \" Friends and Brothers will lie for each other\" I almost put HER in a bear hug after that comment. But I sat there. I sat there and took it all. I did not know what to do, so it's been sitting on my mind. For two years. I still can't tell if I am truly a scumbag or not. Now today I have heard all sorts of story's and rumors about what has really happened, some said I threw her on the ground and beat the tar out of her, that's the issue no one really saw the physical contact so lo and behold, people made up a bunch of shit. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": " So, there was a YouTube (YT) and Twitch streamer I really liked, let’s call her J for jerk. Now, J was fairly family-friendly on YT, but not so much on Twitch. She started streaming on Twitch more often than YT and that community wasn’t too thrilled about it. I was fine with it, though.\n\nI also followed J’s boyfriend on both YT and Twitch, let’s call him B for bystander.\n\nAnyway, J was streaming on Twitch more often than not, and uploading the highlights of her streams to YT, with curse words bleeped out. The community had mixed feelings, and J was getting a lot of crap for it. This is important. I supported her all the way.\n\nThat damned shiny Mr. Mime reaction highlight on YT. There was the usual “Holy \\[bleep\\]”. B was in the background, and he said that J has gotten more obscene since she started Twitch streaming.\n\nMy comment on the video: “B is right, you have gotten more obscene lately, but it makes the reactions as seen on YT a lot funnier!”\n\nThe next day, on B’s Twitch chat, I found I had been permanently banned from B’s chat. I created a second account with virtually the same name, and asked what was wrong. That got banned too. So I messaged the mods, asking what the heck was going on.\n\nKeep in mind, I loved this community, and felt accepted here, and I wanted to join what we called “the mod squad”.\n\nI was met with vague, toying replies, such as “you know what you did”, “don’t even try to deny it, we’ve seen it”, and the like. I annoyed pretty much all the mods. When I finally pinpointed what the issue was, the comment on the Mr. Mime video, I apologized, and was LITERALLY told to fuck off. I even deleted the original comment. Nothing. I was banned from both J and B’s Twitch chats because they shared a lot of mods.\n\nSo I tried getting the support of the community, by reposting the story on several of J’s YT videos. I wasn’t going to admit fault, because I didn’t feel like I did anything wrong in the first place. The mods again ignored me, and JOY HERSELF told me to go away and cool off. I did, I thought about it, and said (basically) “so long and thanks for all the fish.” I added that, after provoking the mods and being kind of a demanding dick about the whole situation, that I probably deserved the ban on J’s channel, but not B’s. He had nothing to do with this.\n\nI still haven’t been let back in, and it’s been almost two months. Since then, I’ve undone all of my likes on J’s YT, and unsubscribed. I’m still allowed to watch, just no chat, but I don’t do that. The mods are almost always there and I now have a deep resentment for them. The worst part is, I can’t appeal my case without disclosing my identity and getting the third account banned as well.\n\nIn summary, I made a comment that looked insulting on the surface, and mods assumed I was being toxic and banned me. I reinforced this by being impatient, demanding, and annoying. Should I be let back into either chat?",

      "description": "I had two best friends, a boy and a girl, who were dating at the time. We'll call them Michael &amp; Elizabeth. We were inseparable, we lived together (in a larger shared house) and had the occasional threesome.\n\nAfter about a year, I met my current boyfriend, and we started casually dating. I told them, several times, how he felt so different and so special and how I was SERIOUSLY into him. I had always preferred non-monogamous relationships, but he insisted on monogamy. I was (and am) so in love with this man that I agreed!\n\nBut then things went off the rails. Michael told me that he felt my relationship came out of nowhere, and several times urged me to break up with my boyfriend. He told me that he always kind of felt like I was dating he &amp; Elizabeth, as sort of a three-way-relationship. We had canoodled maybe five times total over the course of the year, so I was, understandably, very confused. I had chased my boyfriend for months, with their support and assistance, if Michael had wanted a relationship with me, he could have said something before, or let me know that's how he was thinking of me, at the very least.\n\nA few months later, Michael &amp; Elizabeth's relationship started going downhill, for a wide variety of reasons. Eventually she broke things off, and he lost his mind completely. He cried to me about how she was the love of his life and life wasn't worth living without her, that he didn't think anybody else would ever love him. I told him that was ridiculous. I urged him to seek assistance for his declining mental health, but he refused, claiming there were waitlists at therapists and inpatient treatment was too expensive. I provided him with information for clinics and even offered to accompany him if he wanted, but he continues to turn down my advice.\n\nEventually, he began confronting me with bizarre scenarios in an attempt to boost his confidence, I think. It started innocuously enough, \"If you hadn't met boyfriend and I had never met Elizabeth, do you think we ever would have dated?\" and \"do you think we'll ever have sex again?\" But soon progressed to \"If your boyfriend broke up with you in the near future would you date me?\" and eventually \"If I were dying and my last wish were to have sex with you would you do it?\"\n\nI was very uncomfortable with these hypotheticals, and refused to talk about most of them. I had no interest in him, romantically or sexually, and no interest in pondering the loss of my boyfriend. Despite my telling him it made me uncomfortable, he didn't stop, and I began distancing myself from him.\n\nHis lack of respect for my relationship, and constant complaining about his mental health, while refusing to seek treatment led me to slowly cut all contact  with him. Over course of the past few months I've removed him almost entirely from my life, a decision which I've been very pleased with. I no longer receive a flurry of text messages in the night, begging me to talk him out of his depressive state, and no longer have to worry, when I miss a call, that in absence of my support, he may have committed suicide.\n\nMichael has always suffered from a variety of health issues, and a couple of months ago they took a dramatic turn for the worse. He can't stomach most foods, and the medicine they gave him to treat an infection gave him severe tinnitus (his ears constantly ring) and hyperacusis (he cant tolerate noise). The past several weeks, he's been posting on social media that he's become suicidal. Each time he posts, a different friend of his offers support, often going to visit him (at his home, almost two hours away from me) to keep him from being alone. While I think the sentiment is nice, and that the support is obviously effective, I don't believe a visitor every night is going to keep him from killing himself, in the long run. He needs help for his illness. He needs to seek REAL help from a PROFESSIONAL.\n\nHe's recently begun reaching out to me, begging me to come visit him, or just to talk to him again. I am still uncomfortable being around him, and have not answered any of his messages. Thinking about thrm fills me with so much anxiety I don't even open them, I just look at the first few words preview that I get in my notification bar. Yesterday he messaged me \"I just don't want to be alone at the end.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for not making amends? I feel like I should forgive &amp; forget, but I don't want to. I know the \"nice\" thing to do would be forgive him, but I feel like I don't owe him that anymore. I can't handle the guilt and anxiety and stress that comes from being somebody's lifeline, let alone for a somebody that I don't even like that much anymore. The few months between the end of our friendship and the onset of the mental health issues were honestly great. I felt better than I had in a long time, without the burden of somebody else's mental health on my shoulders. Should I put myself back in an uncomfortable position to try and help keep him alive? ",

      "description": "To get started, let’s call my housemates Ben, Fred &amp; Michael.  \n \n\nDuring the year, Ben has been secretive about anyone going into his bedroom. There was one instance when I was coming home from work &amp; saw  his bedroom light upstairs was on, so I went upstairs to ask if he’d  like a cigarette with me. He said no, I’d just woken him up from a nap &amp; he'd be down in half an hour. I figured  that’s weird but hey, he doesn’t want to see me right now that’s fine.  There are multiple other similar instances of him being in, me knocking  on his door to talk &amp; him giving some excuse for me not to come in. I told Fred about this, and it turns out the exact  same thing had happened to him all year too. So we planned that next  time he was out we would go in to his room.  \n \n\nAbout a week later, he went out to work at his hometown and was leaving  for approximately one week, so me and Fred went into his bedroom. What  we discovered was that he wasn’t letting anyone into his room because  it was filthy. Mould was even growing on the windowsill, possibly due to there being a mouldy bowl of food he had  left on his desk, that I remember seeing him take to his room three  weeks prior. Unwashed underwear and clothes scattered everywhere, empty  packets of food, the stench of sweat, no cover on the mattress.... that was the main elements to the disgustingness of  the room.  \n \n\nMe and Fred are quite upset by it because, although it is his room, it  is the best one in the house he picked for himself as we moved in and  our bedrooms are much smaller for the same amount of rent. He also has  the best bathroom next to his bedroom that he shares with Michael, that as we looked in, was filthy also. He had  left skid marks in the toilet, and hair in the sink. We spoke to Michael about this and he says this  has been an issue all year, and he has cleaned up after him because he suspects Ben has depression. This is  because he had also looked into Ben's bedroom previously in the  year and seen the filth, coupled with the mess in the bathroom, and so  has felt afraid to ask for it to be cleaned in case it upsets and embarrasses him and makes his depression worse. Whether or  not he does have depression is a mystery.  \n \n\nHe did come back again, but left to work in his hometown again. We  checked his room again and the mouldy food was gone... but knowing  something wasn’t quite right we looked in his drawers. And wouldn’t you  know it, he had hidden the mouldy food in his drawers.  \n \n\n Now here is why I’m asking if I’m the asshole in this. Because he was  leaving for a week, we felt it was unhygienic to leave the mouldy food  in his room any longer, so we threw it away. The bowl and fork  included. So, obviously, when he came back he would have seen the food had been removed.  \n \n\nNow because it’s embarrassing of course, he hasn’t mentioned the food.  But when he came back he packed up his things for the Christmas break  immediately and left without saying goodbye to anyone. In our opinion  (at the time), we removed the health hazard because it had to go immediately and we didn’t mention it to him  because, not only would it embarrass him, but we’d have to admit we were  in his bedroom without his knowledge. After some thought, I don’t know  if it was handled correctly. I am struggling to feel bad because I personally do not like Ben, I know it’s a symptom  of illness but the illness isn’t confirmed and the filth and smell was  repulsive.  \n \n\n AMTAH? ",

Sorry if the title is confusing, I don't want to make people uncomfortable but I mean fetish. My gf (27) and Me (f23) have been dating for 3 years. We don't do 'that'  that often but when we do she never asked me to do this. She told me she would like to Role play a little girl and me a man. I was confused but when a long because I thought it was one of those DDLG things. Long story short she starts screaming and crying. I ask her what's wrong and she says I'm playing a r***** and she's a little girl being *****. I got off her and told her I'm not comfortable with this at all. She knows my sister was in an abusive relationship for 6 months and was *****. (I'm sorry I don't feel comfortable saying let alone typing it.)\nShes good friends with my sister, and knows what he has done to her. I tell her I want to stop and leave the bedroom. She comes out a few hours later and tells me \"I'm no fun\" I tell her I'm not comfortable with this and she leaves to go to a bar I presume. She comes back in the morning around 5, (it was around 1 when she left) in an uber and goes to bed. Next morning I go to work, and when I get back shes still mad at me. I ask her whats wrong and she brings up that day. (This all happened about 6 days ago) I tell her some things that I wanted to do, but she didn't want to do and we didn't do them, and I respect her, and she should respect me. She rants about all the things she does for me, and I try to tell her that a love her and loves the things she does for me. She calles me an asshole and goes to the bedroom. We fight for about a week, and she starts screaming at me saying \"It didn't happen to you, so why can't you do it for me?\" I was mad and a break up with her. She starts to break down and goes to the bedroom. I go to work the next morning and she packs up what she has and leaves. (She only had a few things, about 7 small boxes.) She leaves. I miss her so much and I want her back. I want her to apologize for lashing out like that, but at this point I feel like if I apologize to her she'll come back. ",

      "description": "Right now, I'm seeing a woman in a fairly casual situation. I'm 27 years old and she's 25, and the incident I'll talk about happened on our third date.\n\nOn Saturday night we went to a gourmet burgers and fries place (think Pulp Fiction John Travolta/Uma Thurman car in the wall joint) for my birthday dinner. It was her choice and I thought it sounded like a grand idea, as corny restaurants are always a blast. A while after our burgers came the waitress paid us the typical \"how is everything\" visit, and stuck around for a short chat after. During the course of our talk I ended up mentioning that it was my birthday, and she told me that it was hers too. It was a nice little coincidence and we all seemed to get a kick out of it.\n\nEventually our waitress excused herself. After we finished eating we ordered a couple of shakes, at which point the waitress and I nicknamed each other \"birthday girl\" and \"birthday boy,\" respectively.\n\nOur check came, and to my surprise my date didn't make any indication that she was going to pay. I didn't raise a stink about it of course, and I didn't think it was exactly a huge deal. I thought it was normally for the non-birthday party to pay on someone else's birthday, but again, different people may be used to different things.\n\nI checked the bill and saw \"Happy Birthday!\" written at the bottom with a cute smiley face. I put in the cost of the meal with a standard tip, and we got up and put on our coats. At the last second I told my date to hold on a bit, opened the bill back up, and slipped in another $100. I wrote with the provided pen \"You too!\" next to her message. My date noticed this and gave me a sideways look.\n\nIn the car I asked what she wanted to do next, and she gave me the silent treatment, just kind of sighing and looking out the window. I figured it had something to do with the tip I gave the waitress because that's when she started acting like that. I asked what was wrong and she just responded by settling deeper into the seat. The next few minutes were completely silent and I just started heading towards her house.\n\nShe abruptly blurted out a bit later that I was wasting my money and she couldn't believe I was so irresponsible. I asked her what was wrong with giving $100 to our waitress for her great service, and she said that I should have spent the money elsewhere, or at least given it to a deserving charity. Again, I reiterated that I felt it wasn't a big deal, and couldn't get a decent answer out of her.\n\nI took her home and without a word she just stepped out of my car, walked to her front door, opened the door, and walked without even turning her head back. Last night she texted me saying that I overtipped the waitress and asked how I felt about giving the waitress $100 when I haven't given her (my date) a single gift yet. I haven't responded and it is kind of keeping me up. \n",

      "description": "Okay here's some more context because I don't think I'm too much of an asshole in this situation although my best friend always jokingly says I am. I'm 18 btw.\n\nMy bestfriend(Sam) invited me and our friend(Jennifer) over to his apartment for drinks in the evening. Jennifer brought her best friend (Joyce) along and Joyce and I hit it off really well. We got tipsy and started dancing and sang karaoke but then Jennifer and Sam both practically forced me to ask for Joyce's number before she left (even though they knew I was recently out of a difficult relationship) and so I did. After that day I was pretty hung over so I didn't do anything with the number but later that evening Jennifer asked me out to a movie and so I went along except when I got there Joyce and Sam was there as well which was weird but I didn't act too surprised. During the movie Sam and Jennifer were both shipping us really hard and asked us why we weren't holding hands and so Joyce grabbed my hand and I went along with it. I started flirting with her because at this point I thought whatever, she's cool and attractive I'll go along with it. The day after that Jennifer and Sam invited me to her house to watch a movie with them and Joyce and I said yes and pretty much ended  up hooking up with Joyce. After that, in front of both Jennifer and Sam Joyce asked me what we were and she asked if we were boyfriend and girlfriend and I just said Yes because in a way I didn't want to embarrass her. The day after that we meet again at Sams apartment and I had to get Joyce and on the way to his place she tells me that she's told her parents about me and asked me if I wanted to come for some family event with her to meet them. She also asked me about my religion among other things. Suffice it to say I broke it off with her the day after and because I \"hit it and quit it\" Jennifer stopped talking to me forever.  ",

This turned into him completely not listening to me and he began full on yelling. \n\nMy mom then says “you guys need a mediator” to which he FLIPS out and yells “I DONT NEED A GODDAMN MEDIATOR” and storms up to me from across the room and starts screaming obscenities in my face. \n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Even at an appointment with a counselor, he acted the same way and refused to listen or even try to understand my point of view. This has also happened countless times with my mother. To me it seems like he refuses to accept responsibility for any issues and forces blame onto any easy target, which lately has become me. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for refusing to accept this behavior from my father? Is there something else I can do?",

      "description": "My family was in desperate circumstances in the 1950's.  My father was sick at the time as a child and my grandparents couldn't afford medical treatment. Then a man overheard my grandfather speaking about the difficulty to his friends. He offered to loan my grandfather to pay for my father's medical treatments (he tried to give it as a gift but my grandfather was a proud man and refused that) \n\nMy grandfather bought proper medicine for my father and when he had enough money saved was ready to pay the man back.\n\nHowever, when he contacted the address of the man. It was a hotel and the man hadn't been living there for at east a year (he had paid cash and gave no location). My grandfather looked for him but eventually gave up.\n\nMy grandfather is dead and my father and I recently looked up the man in question. It is likely that he was a member of the SS. He had committed war crimes against Jewish populations and was a strong anti-Semite. He stayed under various pseudonyms (including the one he gave us) and moved every now and then before the authorities could gain a trace on him.\n\nI feel very conflicted on the one hand this man in question was known for executing Jews in particularly vicious ways. On the other hand my father might not be alive without him.  It is definitely the same person. \n\nI want to create a charitable trust in this man's name at some point. As I think it will be a way of showing that even very brutal people can occasionally do some good.",

      "description": "My brother is a great human being. Funny, smart, and just an overall great person. Growing up we didn't get along, like most siblings, but we attended the same university and I spent time with him and his friends more than anyone, so we became close like I've always wanted. \n\nSince college, I've realized I put in more effort to our relationship than he does. I would call, text, ask to hangout, etc., but if I didn't prompt it, we never would. A couple years ago, he moved to another country, and I tried to keep up the phone calls and text, but it just became more apparent how little effort he would give. \n\nSince we now rely mostly rely on his vacation time back in the states to catch up, that's what I would look forward to the most. So I would stay at my parents house when he visits (commuting about an hour to work) so we could try to spend more time together. But when he would visit, he would spent all of his time meeting up with his friends and our extended family that live nearby, but would never make time to spend with me. At this point, I feel like the time I do spend with him is wasted. \n\nLet me be clear, my brother isn't doing this maliciously. He just doesn't think about me or our relationship as being something he needs to work or spend time on. I'm his sister, always will be. And that's that. I don't blame him for his perspective, and I don't resent him for it. However, with hindsight, I could have put that time and effort into building other friendships or relationships, and instead I've tried over and over to be friends with someone who just doesn't want to be friends. \n\nSo I'm wondering: am I an asshole for wanting to cut contact with my brother outside of family gatherings? He is moving back to the states this year and I'm trying to figure out what is best for me.  ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to buy a house with my brother?",
      "description": "19F here. First time posting on a subreddit.. forgive me for formatting errors. Also this post is super long because I'm not even the slightest bit concise. TLDR at bottom. \n\nLast night my father was talking to me (mom in the room) about my plans beyond college. He started suggesting that my brother (24) and I buy a house together once I'm done with college. With my great credit (in a few years) and my brothers money, he thinks we will be able to get equity on the house and sell it to make a profit for both of us or that my brother and I could rent the house out and profit there. However, I don't want to go in on a house with my brother. A few years ago he got in a lot of trouble for a DUI &amp; drug possession. We helped him out of that. A year later we found out he was doing drugs like cocaine and meth. We had to take him to the hospital because he was being hyper-aggressive with my dad and eventually passed out. That's how we found out about the drugs he was doing. During this time, he ran his credit cards up, and is in debt of about $10,000, and his credit has suffered as a consequence. My parents kicked him out, but helped him find an apartment with a roommate, and there he was able to become financially independent and get his life together. He moved back into our house a few months ago to save money and my parents thought he was getting back on track. So far, he hasn't done anything bad. He has a good job now and is making good money. \n\nI currently have great credit, and if I keep it up for a few years, I will be able to buy a house or a condo on my own. I'm building my savings, too. I have my own plans beyond college to buy a house that I can live in and rent rooms to people to and eventually sell it if that's the right plan for me. \n\nI told my dad that I don't want to buy a house with my brother. He hasn't proven himself to me yet. My dad gets upset for a second about how I need to be there to take care of my brother and make sure he stays on track once they're gone. I tell him that I'm not planning on leaving my brother behind. But as of right now, I can't see myself buying a house with my brother.\n\nThis morning my mom is all mad at me. She's telling me that her and my dad are handing me my education on a silver platter, and that my plans to move out after college are selfish, when I could be helping both myself and my brother by going in on a house with him. I left her room because she told me not to talk to her about it anymore. Then she texts me a few hours later asking why I'm hiding in my room. I tell her I'm annoyed and don't think I'm being selfish right now. She texts me the following: \"Of course you don't think you are selfish. Who does especially when they are being selfish.\" Maybe I am being selfish. In fact I think I am being selfish. But I don't think it's so bad to look out for my own self interest in this situation..\n\nAlso, my parents have to pay out of pocket for my schooling because they haven't filed a tax return in years so I can't apply for FAFSA to get financial aid. This has made it harder on them because they're dishing out about $2000 a semester for me to go to school. They have constantly pushed me to go to school and get a degree because none of them ever got one. And I WANT my degree. They have seemed happy to be paying for my schooling because the payoff when I'm older will be great. AITA for thinking them \"handing me my education on a silver platter\" isn't such a bad thing? They didn't file tax returns. It's not my fault I can't get FAFSA. \n\nIt makes me so frustrated. My parents haven't even talked to my brother about whether or not he wants to own a house with me. I would assume he doesn't. I don't really understand how my education factors into any of this because my brother does not pay for my education.\n\nTL;DR My parents want me to buy a house with my brother once I'm done with college. He hasn't shown me that he can keep his finances in order for a long enough time to actually buy a house with him. Mom thinks I am being selfish because they pay out of pocket for my schooling. I don't think I owe it to him or them to buy a house with my brother to supposedly help him. AITA?",

      "description": "There's about a million things that could cause it, but I've never been able to deal with a lot of loud noise.  Generally I can function outside of home, because I know I can't expect the world to change because I'm one of those assholes from A Quiet Place but with less murder and more crying and wanting it to go away. I go through a lot of earplugs, and noise cancelling headphones have probably been one of my best purchases. But continuous noise stresses me out, and compounds on other stresses and even itself. \n\n\nI've always been like this, so my family knows, and nobody is under the age of ten. But they've never really been willing to quiet down. Any tkme I spend at home is a constant cacaphony of stomping, screaming, shouting, bickering, slamming doors, TVs turned up so loud it's a miracle nobody's got hearing damage, and it never stops. They even scream in the car, and it's a fight to get the volume on anything playing under 50. From 7 AM to past midnight, it's a constant barrage of pointless noise that makes actually spending time with family either very stressful or nearly impossible. I have approached family members asking them to please be more quiet, offering solutions and compromises, but I get told \"Well OP, the world can't change to suit your needs.\" And I get that, but I kind of wish that I could at least be met halfway at the family home where I am supposedly always welcome. Last visit, after a screaming match between my mom and my brother, I packed my things and left a day early. I told them I had stuff to take care of at home, job applications to send out, etc, but the real reason was after six days of this I couldn't take it anymore. \n\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for wanting my family to quiet down just a bit?",

      "description": "Hey guys, here's the deal: when I was a teenager I was involved in several relationships with several predatory adults. It made me develop pretty rigid standards for my partners in my adult life. Now I'm trying to see if I was too harsh by breaking up with my boyfriend for behavior that I thought was pretty disrespectful.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been official for a couple weeks. We got close pretty fast, spent a lot of time together on the dates we did have, etc.\n\nSince last week, we had plans for Thursday of this week. Backstory: his great-grandfather has been in the hospital for a little while. On Monday, his mother said that she wanted to visit him on Thursday. I was a little irritated, because we had plans and he could have seen his grandfather earlier/communicated with his mother that he would have preferred a different day. However, I ultimately decided it wasn't a big deal because it did involve a sick relative. We rescheduled our plans for Wednesday and I decided to let it go.\n\nWe also made plans for this Saturday morning (time unspecified). We texted for most of the day on Friday before he had to go to work. We normally text after his work too. I figured we would chat after his work to finalize what time he was coming over. I texted him, he didn't text me back. I was already kind of upset, but figured I'd call him in the morning and we'd work it out.\n\nHe didn't text me until 12:30 this afternoon. He told me he didn't mean to sleep in that late. I asked him if he was still coming, and he told me he couldn't make it because his sister surprised his family with a visit (he still lives with his dad). Sister lives about a 9 hour drive from here. I told him that I was disappointed with his actions and wouldn't be okay with anything like that happening again, and I'd need to think about it before continuing things. It sucks that his sister didn't give them more notice but he had plans. It wasn't cool of him to cancel. I asked him how long his sister would be staying, figuring that I would let it go if she was only staying for the weekend as long as he talked to his sister and asked for more head's up going forward.\n\nTurns out, she was staying for a week. I thought it was ridiculous that since she was staying for a week, he was unwilling to tell her that he had already made plans for today but would see her like, literally any other day. With that being said, I gave him an ultimatum: if he didn't come over, I was breaking up with him. He decided not to come. I broke up with him.\n\nWas my ultimatum too harsh, or was I justified? AITA?",

She knows that me and my soon to be husband are TTC (trying to conceive) Baby #2.\nShe was super excited for me since my previous pregnancy was an awful experience and so was my birth and I feel like with my next pregnancy I will be given a chance to enjoy it much more.\nWe are about a year and half in and drs have given me medication to help me a bit since nothing is happening. \nAnyway I told her we had already picked out names, She begged to know so thinking nothing of it I told her for a boy we picked the name Noah and for a girl we picked Maeve. Out of no where she just flipped a switch (which had never happened before) and started having a go at me for \"Stealing\" her future sons name .. I was a bit taken back and asked if she was TTC or pregnant and she said No but she has wanted to call her future son Noah for a year now.\nI kind of chuckled and said \"I am not stealing a name, It's a name so many people are called Noah?\"\n\nIn the end she hung up on me and hasn't spoken to me in a few days, Well I got a message today from another half sister saying \"She's really upset and how could you do this to her why are you being such an asshole?\"\n\nThe truth is I decided on the name shortly into my first pregnancy with my son and Almost named him Noah but settled on Joseph instead. I decided if I had another son I'd name him noah. (My son is 3 this year)\n\nNot going to lie, this whole situation is amusing to me and I cannot help but laugh. But thought you guys would get a kick out of this.\n\nSo AITA for already choosing and \"stealing\" the name Noah?\n\n\n\nTL;DR - Half sister is upset that I chose a name for my future son and Claims she chose it first.

      "description": "Guys I need help. Am I the asshole and if I am, what can I do to fix this.\nAnd sorry for my spelling.\n\nBack story:\nA friend of mine got into a shit show and we said she could come live with us as she had no place to go, and is now living with me, my husband and my 2 daughters. I'm currently on crutches so pretty much useless to the world, because if meds I cannot drive and this person has been my saving grace as much as we have been hers.\n\nNow the story:\nThis flatmate had written a cleaning plan up as a \"this is what we did maybe it will help you\" kind of thing last night and placed it on the fridge,\n\nThis afternoon I was reading it and noticed there was a \"don't spend anything\". Now, this flatmate was, as far as I was aware, asleep so naturally I asked my husband to see if he had any idea \nApparently, the way I asked was not the best way to ask and my husband has told me it sounded like I was mocking it. I was a tad offended at the \"do not spend\" as I've been trying really hard to make shit work money wise, and while it isn't the flatmates ideal, it works.\n\nAnyway, the flatmate was not asleep and heard everything and 5 minutes later stormed into the kitchen, ripped the paper down and stormed off.\n\nI was also making dinner at the time.\nNow her dinner hasn't been eaten, she's been in her room and not speaking to me.\nFine what ever.\n\n\nI apologized via text as I didn't want to desterb her and got no response.\n\n3 hours later I asked if I could enter her room and she said I could. So I went in, asked if I could sit and she said yes, then apologized again.\n\nShes throwing massive shade and saying I was talking behind her back and that what I did was super hurtful.\nSo I apologized again and asked her the questions I was asking my husband. She gave short, 1 word answers and so I explained why I was confused and asked for clarity.\n\nShe said next time you have a problem say it to my f$(-ing face.\n\n\nI walked out. I did the best I could. I've now slammed myself into my room and gone to Reddit for help...\n\nSo am I the asshole? What can I do? Help!!\n\n\nTldr asked husband questions about what flatmate wrote because I thought flatmate was sleeping.\nFlatmate was not sleeping and got super passive aggressive. Help.\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay for my step son's friend to come on our family vacation?",
      "description": "My husband, me, stepson John (13), my daughter from previous marriage (15) are all supposed to go on a vacation to New Zealand in a month and my step son's friend was supposed to accompany us. John been friends with this other kid Tom since they're 9. They are inseperable and do everything together. John is atheltic but does weird nerdy things with Tom like dungeon dragons and other role playing fantasy games. They spend a lot of money on guide books and just aren't interested in normal things. They both weird out my daughter who's more sociable and a normal teenager and I don't feel comfortable having her around Tom on a vacation. So when I found out that my husband wanted to indulge in those two kids' fantasy vacation in NZ with a Lord of the rings tour I wasn't happy. There isn't much to do in NZ for my daughter, and we'll just be going on boring tours. I was fine with this since they've been planning to go for years before I came into the picture so I knew I had no say. \n\nNow I just found out that Tom's ticket was paid by my husband which I think is wrong. Tom's dad was laid off recently and hasn't worked in over a month. My husband works his ass off at his business and makes good money to provide for us and is being taken advantage off.\n\nNow, I agreed to be a home maker and take care of things and to have a say in finances. My husband assured me that it is our money and we both have a say. So I told Tom's dad that he needs to pay for his kid's trip. He was upset but asked to give him a few weeks to come up with money which I know is a stalling tactic. He kept pleading that it was his son's dream (which WE have to pay for). He said that this is too sudden and is not comfortable dipping into his savings right now. I made a comment saying that he shouldn't be sending his kid on vacations if he can't afford it. This is where it got heated. My husband calls me furious saying that I was out of line and that he already budgeted the trip to include the kid. I told him that I'm part of the decision making and I'm not happy about it. He said if Tom can't go to NZ he will have to cancel the trip since he wanted this to be a shared experience for the boys. We'd only get back about 70% of our trip expense due to cancellation fees (plane, hotel, tours).  At least we'd get back a lot of money and we can go to Europe where there is a LOT to do for BOTH our kids.\n\nI put my foot down and said that I have to cancel this today and start booking Euro soon since prices will go up. John is now giving us the silent treatment and says that I'm not fair. He definitely blames my daughter. Try telling a teen girl to go to NZ to see a fantasy movie tour. My husband says he is shocked at my callousness. They're ganging on me making us the bad guy because I'm financially responsible. It's pretty much become two teams now and even though that's the last thing I need for my family shouldn't I put my foot down and look out for my daughter? ",

      "description": "So right now, I have 1 roommate in a 3 bedroom condo in a neighborhood with one assigned parking spot and not that much street parking.  If you try to park after around 6pm, all the closer spots are all gone and you have to park about 5 minutes away.  Generally not too bad but on cold nights or if your running late to work, it is a shitty walk as there is a big hill to go up and down.  \n\nNow my current roommate is a good friend so we've organically started to go back and forth with the spot every two weeks.  He'd take it for two weeks, I would take it the next two weeks, and so on.  It just sort of worked out very easily.  Now he has decided to move out and I am going to have to find a new roommate.  While doing so, I have decided to fill the 3rd room in the unit as well so I will have two new roommates.  Two strangers to boot. \n\nI was talking to my other friend about this and started to complain that I will have to make up some new system for the two new roommates and me to follow so we can all use the spot.  Maybe weekly?  Maybe first come first served?  He was like no I didn't have to do that.  I have been here the longest (about 2 years) and get to set the rules of how the place should work.  He says that I should say from the start that I get the assigned spot and they will have to use the street.  \n\nPersonally, I have never lived in a situation like that but he says he has so that's why I am here.  I'm normally the type of person that wants to share everything so keeping the parking spot for myself didn't even occur to me as an option.  But oh boy is it tempting.  That walk in the cold is BRUTAL and if I can avoid it I would love to.  But I also want to start off on the right foot with my new roommates.  Help me out here.  AITA if I keep the parking space to myself?",

So he’s quite well off and offered to pay for repairs.\n\nSo I was quite thankful and sent it to the shop. The shop told me they could repair it but after coming back multiple times to only receive a phone that works for 15min and then not being sensitive again, the shop finally told me they couldn’t repair it.\n\nSo being the millennial I am, of course I need a phone. So I told my classmate that I would pay for half the cost of a new phone. (He broke an iPhone 6, the new phone I’m getting is an iPhone 8(I even got the cheapest model) ). But since I barely knew him it felt kind of bad. He was ok with it but I’m sure not all people would be and he might have just done it because he was an acquaintance and not an actual friend. So am I the asshole for asking for him to pay half the cost? or does the price not matter and it’s a matter of principle? ",

      "description": "I got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an \"Appletarian\", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. \n\nI told them them all that I had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. \n\nApples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. \n\nFinally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.\n\nBut I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. \n\nThey were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. \n\nI thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had \"embarrassed her for a dumb joke\". \n\nIn my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. \n\nBut, did I go too far?\n\n",

      "description": " \n\nI've worked with this guy for years, we're good at work friends.\n\nMy wife gets along with his GF and they've done a few things together, keep touch on facebook, text, etc. \n\nHe wants to propose. I knew something was brewing when he talked about rings, but he had no plans yet. I can keep my mouth shut, although there was nothing to shut it for.\n\nThen yesterday I get a cryptic text \"what are you doing tomorrow\" - that means some open ended, can you watch the kids type text. I hadn't seen my wife in 2 days she was visiting step-mom and our daughter.\n\nSo i'd kind of blown off the idea of kid watching. He got on to play a game online and elaborates - he was going to propose. He insisted on absolute silence, don't tell anybody. Well, at that moment my wife sent me a snapchat. I responded and mentioned this. I knew she'd want to know. Of course she starts talking about things I can't tell him because I'm \"not telling anyone\" ... I know she's not THAT close to his GF and she can be trusted, but I want him to feel comfortable. The back and forth goes on a few with me in the middle, him hemming at details (GF may be sick, not sure if I'll do it tomorrow) and my wife tossing things around. All the while I'm playing.\n\nIn the end it was up in the air.\n\nThis AM. 10ish, I get a text \"I'm going to ask if you're OK, would noon work?\" Uh.. haven't heard from the wife yet (you'll see why) and uh.. ah.. no reason I can't - so I say sure. I send her a text and say \"hey, he's looking at noon, if you want to come help with the kids cool, if you want to avoid that, that's OK too\"\n\nI knew when I got \"whatever\" for a response something was way off.\n\nthe TL:DR part of THAT conversation was that I \"ignored all her suggestions on plans\" and I did not call her to say good night - well, we'd said good night about a dozen times at 8 PM and there were no PLANS. Now I'm being told that me, friend and GF can do \"our thing\" and she doesn't need to be a part of it. That I can do me and she knows how this goes, same old feeling where I don't care about her.\n\nHard to tell what's bugging her more, her not getting a good night call, me not planning with her.... she is pissed, wants no part of this.\n\nI KNOW I could have paid better attention,but I'm easily distracted. Obviously my relationship is more important, but I was preoccupied on several levels and didn't think I missed anything. I also was trying to be accommodating to everyone.\n\nAITA for not pulling her in more and be much more explicit or is she overreacting?\n\nTL:DR - friend wants to propose, asks for help watching the kids, my lack of paying enough attention/involving my wife enough has now turned it into me and them vs. her and she wants no part of me.",

I also didn't decide to sue since I enjoyed their company and if feel like a dickhead.\n\nAnd 3 days ago I went to their house to chill (specifically their shed) I started joking with P about the incident. We were there about an hour then N showed up to hang out. As soon as she walked in I said \"Look it's the fucking perpetrator herself\" and laughed about how my finger feels tingly.\n\nAfter that remark she burst into tears and ran out of the shed. P said that I had to leave since I upset her. \n\nI'm sure he felt what he did was right but after 3 days of hearing nothing from them I'm assuming I've lost my friend over a dumb joke. I've heard from mutual friends that N is a nervous wreck so I feel like shit about what I've done\n\nTLDR- friends sister broke my finger in an accident and felt sorry, 4 months later i made a joke about the incident, made her cry and got kicked out by my friend ",

      "description": "I’m 26 my wife is 23. I work about 50-55 hour weeks doing 2 jobs at a factory, desk and stocking soda machines, so she can stay at home and take care of our 11 MO son. I come home and decompress for about 30/45 min before relieving her if mama duties for the night. I feed him, play with him, change him, and put him to sleep every night and all weekend long unless my mom babysits. During this 2 hour or 2 day window  I want her to either clean or cook or do something. I don’t do regular cleaning around the home, but neither does she. I do laundry, dishes, trash. And all the difficult things with our son like clip his nails or clean his nose out (cuz he’ll scream bloody murder). I just want her to clean up more often too. She’ll only clean if someone she cares about is coming over.  What she does usually the entire time I’m home is watch videos on her phone or streamed on the tv. After the boy is asleep around 9pm I don’t want to do anything to else but rest but the home is a mess and it makes me restless. Tonight I went on a cleaning binge out being sick of it. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Okay, so, for some background, I (17f) am the oldest of two children. My sister (14f) is a good sister. We argue sometimes, but get along pretty well for the most part.\n\nI deal with some pretty serious mental health issues, including (but not limited to) PTSD, Severe GAD, Depression, and ADHD. These have caused serious turmoil in my house for as long as I can remember. Like, argue until 3 am with my parents, visits to the ER, and leaving the house in the middle of the night. My mental health issues have also caused monetary issues with my family (my parents are very vocal about this), as I see three different mental health professionals for different reasons. \n\nMy sister does not struggle with mental health, but she does struggle with her physical health. Three weeks before her 14th birthday, she had to get pretty serious jaw surgery (the recovery was rough, and six months later, her swelling is just now fading). She also has severe scoliosis, which requires her to go to a special center for physical therapy and wear a (very expensive, like $2,000 expensive) back brace. \n\nI have noticed that there has never been any discussion around the expenses of my sister's health issues, and it stirs up some of my serious anxiety. I feel like I am a burden on my family, but I know that in reality, her heath costs are double mine, yet for some reason, I'm the person who has to hear about the costs they cause the family. \n\nI don't resent my sister for getting treated differently. I know that mental health issues can be seriously hard on people surrounding me, but the parental reasoning is that \"your sister can't change her health, but you can work to get better\", it's really hard to see eye to eye. I feel like my parents are acting unreasonable, and it's obvious that my sister knows and is starting to take advantage of their obliviousness and sympathy.\n\nI haven't really said anything to my family, but AITH for feeling this way, and WIBTA if I chose to say anything?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: my younger sister suffers from serious physical health problems, and I suffer from serious mental health problems, but I'm made to feel guilty for how expensive my problems are, when in reality, they are about half of my younger sister's costs.

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay full price for my haircut?",
      "description": "Wednesday I called a local salon to set up an appointment. I asked for a full highlight and cut, and asked how much it would be. She said that both the highlight and cut would be $193 and I set up an appointment for later that day. \n\nI get to the salon and my stylists sits me down and says, “ok, so I have you scheduled for just a partial highlight, let’s get started!” I correct her and say I scheduled a full highlight and a cut. She says that the receptionist only scheduled me for a partial highlight and if I wanted to get my hair cut as well, I wouldn’t have time for a full highlight. This annoyed me but I smiled and said it was fine since my hair is already pretty light, not a big deal. I then ask the stylist the price (just so I don’t get swindled). She replies she has to go check with the receptionist because she has the price chart. \n\nShe comes back and just starts on my hair without a word, so now I can’t walk out if the price is too high. Ok whatever, I’m sure it’s the same price. Then when she’s almost done putting the product in my hair, she tells me it’s gonna be $223. I say the receptionist told me on the phone that a full highlight and cut was $193. The stylist is NOT happy, responds that my hair took more product than usual because it had been about a year since I’ve highlighted it and when more product is used the prices goes up, but she then says that since I was quoted at $193 she’ll give it to me for $193. I’m happy :)\n\nSo I get done with my hair, I love it despite not being able to get the full highlight, and I go up to the receptionist to pay. She hands me a receipt that says $155. I wanted to be honest so I told her that she had quoted me at $193, and I’m pretty sure it’s $193, and I ask her to double check the system. She checks her computer again TWICE, double and triple checked, and she said, “oh I made a mistake earlier, it’s actually $155, how nice!” So I’m pretty stoked, I give a goood tip, and I leave. \n\nLike 20 min later this receptionist frantically calls me to tell me that she had made yet another mistake, and that it actually was supposed to be $193, and I had to come back and pay the difference or give my credit card number over the phone. I told her that I’m super busy and that I couldn’t give her my card number because I was driving and that I’d call her back. At this point I’m SUPER annoyed. This receptionist scheduled me for the wrong styling, and the salon gave me three different prices! \n\nI forgot to call them back. They called me again today asking me to come in, and I told them I’d come in later this week, but I’m thinking about just going in and talking to the owner. I asked this girl to check the price TWICE before I paid, I wasn’t trying to swindle them. It was her mistake, and I don’t want to have to go all the way back there for it when I tried to pay the full amount while I was there!And I being an emotional asshole by not wanting to go back and pay?

      "description": "So this needs some context. Disclaimer, the guy I’ve been bringing home knows my ex exists and knows he stays at my place but I don’t tell my ex anything. \nSo the background is that me and my ex were together for 3 years, we have a child together, and overall I think he’s a good guy, he’s intelligent and stable so a month ago we moved out for the very first time to a big city in an apartment. Neither one of us knowing anyone in the city, knowing he’s from Indiana and I was moving from 40 minutes away, it was a dream to be in a city this big. \nHe works in food. And I get it, the time you come home always varies when you work a full time schedule and you close and work with shitty people. His job sucks and he works 30 minutes away so I try to not say anything to him when he comes home at 2:30 am. But when I would bring it up we would always fight because he has a history of cheating on me in the past multiple times so of course I worry and his argument is always “we just moved, I don’t know anyone here.” But then it kept happening. He’s a recovering alcoholic. About 3 weeks ago he went back to how he use to be in the beginning of our relationship. Every time he stayed out late he’d come home more drunk than the last night and I’d be worried sick about him. \nI’m not the obsessive type but I just can’t sleep until he’s home so I’d stay up til 3-4 am sometimes when I work mornings. I started a new job and that was the night he decided to come home at 2:15 am when I had to be up in 5 hours for my first day. It was a big deal. So I looked it up and his work closed at 9. So there’s no reason it’d take that long. I worried so much that I had this horrible pain in my stomach and ran to the bathroom and there was a huge amount of blood. Come to find out I had a miscarriage. So I texted him I was bleeding and in pain and he ignored it and said sorry that his phone was on silent and that he’ll be home soon. That was at 1:35 am so he shows up at 2:15 am. He said he was at a pub and that he was sorry and proceeded to ignore me and stumbled to the bathroom to get in the shower and then broke a shelf trying to get in and tripped and knocked all the shampoo in the bath. We had an argument and like every argument we’ve ever had in the entirety of our relationship it’s me trying to talk to him and then him turning into this person I don’t know. He’s been doing this new thing though where I get mad and his responses are “hm? WHat? I don’t know what you said” so I stormed into the bedroom and told myself I was over it and that to forget about it and go to sleep.\n I check Instagram and I’m nosey so I’m always checking to see what my friends are liking and I see he started following a stripper from a stripclub that is 3 minutes down the road from us. So I go back in the front room and confront him and he says it’s not important and that I need to go to bed and I’m the most annoying bitch he’s ever met. So all the nights the past month he’s been at “pubs” he was really at this stripclub. Granted I tried to let it go. He’s 22, he has the right to be there and drink. But going alone to a stripclub let alone talk to a stripper enough to get her instagram is a entire different story to me. \nSo we fought and he pushed me for “yelling” because he’s the type of person that thinks people are responsible for their emotions which is true to a point. \nSo fast forward to now. He never apologized or put some light on the topic. I’ve considered myself single every since that day and I’ve been going on dates with this guy. But my ex still lives with me. He comes home and acts like we’re dating and I made it to where I didn’t let him touch me or call me honey anymore and he slept on the couch for about a week before he came home drunk one night and came into my room and threw himself on me. I was really mad but I let him do what he wanted and then we slept together and the next morning I was happy. But I’ve promised myself I’m never going to date him again. \nMy best friend came over about 3 days ago and she knew everything and she hates my ex now. We were sitting on the couch so my ex does this thing where he’s a smug asshole and says we’re dating and expects things from me. He kept calling me honey in front of her and told me to be safe and have a good day with my other boyfriends and said if I didn’t stop being sassy he’d give me “a finger later”. Guy thinks he’s a total comedian. So he stood and stared at me while me and my friend were putting makeup on (I’m obviously ignoring him because he’s leaving for work and wants something) so he bends down to kiss me and I let him without looking. I’ve told him we’re not dating. And he says we are and he won’t move out so I play his game. I watch movies with him, I let him touch me, I let him do what he wants. But I’ve been going on dates with this guy I really see something with. I haven’t told my ex anything but I really want this guy to stay the night especially because he doesn’t have a tv and there’s some classics I want to watch with him but I’m scared of the outcome. My friends say bring him over and tell my ex to fuck off but they’re in college so I think they’re just being dark about the situation. \nAlso: the apartment is in my name I think that’s essential. \nAITA? There will probably be mixed answers but I expect it. ",

      "description": "In my English class, we have mini-group discussions called \"fishbowls\". For our unit, we got in groups of 3 for a total of 6 fishbowls throughout the unit, with the expectation that everybody would do 2 and only one person from each group would be in a given fishbowl. Everybody must do one from fishbowls 1-3 and one from fishbowls 4-6. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreat part was that we were given the dates and content of each fishbowl to decide ahead of time and tell our teacher. Only problem was that one of my friends in my group wasn't there, so my other friend sent her a picture of all of the fishbowls and told her to pick first. She saw all the info but didn't give us her answer before the end of class so we chose ours and gave her objectively the easiest fishbowls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer fishbowl (#2) is on Monday, and I just got a text from her asking to switch with me (I'm #3) b/c \"she has a lot of tests and doesn't have enough time to prepare\" (her words). i'm iffy about saying no b/c I chose the 3rd fishbowl specifically b/c it was the only one that matched with my schedule and much of my previous preparation would have been used in the contents discussed, but not at all in fishbowl #2. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nher follow up reasoning was that she was absent and thus didn't have the same picking advantage, so i double checked with her that the other group member sent her the info and then said no to her. i also offered to help her prepare by allowing her to bounce ideas off of me but she left me on read and is now talking shit about me to the other group member\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso... am i the asshole?

      "description": "My girlfriend started her second bachelors degree at university last autumn. We met while she studied for her first degree and see each other on weekends and holidays.  She is much happier doing this degree, she loves her friends and the course she is doing is a much better fit for her. She told me that even though it’s difficult and stressful she wouldn’t do anything else. \n\nWe are in an open relationship and have been for nearly a year now. Its half way through her first year and she’s going to parties, getting drunk, and hanging out with her new friends. I have no problem with this and I’m happy that she has the chance to let her hair down and do all the stupid things I did when I was at university, things which she couldn’t do during her first degree. (It was in dance so a lot more pressure on her physical appearance and health etc., part of the reason she didn’t enjoy it)\n\nBecause she has uni work, new friends and we don’t live together we haven’t been able to spend as much time together as we usually do. A few months ago we booked a show for tonight. We were both super excited and because she is a student and I work a reasonably well paid full time job I paid the £160 for the tickets.\n\nI woke up this morning to find a drunk text from her at 4am asking if I can go to hers tomorrow before the gig instead of her coming to mine as agreed because she will be too tired. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? All week she’s been saying how she’s been out every night to bars or drinking with friends which is fine. However I kind of thought that because we had a big night out tonight she would maybe not get wasted the night before. I imagine she is going to be pretty tired and hungover today which won’t make for the best experience at the gig.\n\nAnyway...thoughts? AITA here? I haven’t spoken to her yet, she’s still asleep.\n\nMy GF got smashed the night before an expensive date we were supposed to have and is now hungover for it.",

I thought I was so lucky to find someone like him. We moved in together after 5 months of dating. \n\nHe then became more controlling and posessive. He would do crazy shit like smash my phone against the wall, lock me in the house, flush my birth control, etc. He even became physically abusive, e.g restrain me, choke me, slap me, etc. \n\nI was scared to leave him.

He basically said “If you dont marry me you’re gonna end up dying alone.”\n\nAbout 2 weeks later, he got deployed. His deployment is 3 months in length. Currently, we are precisely at the midway point. With him gone, I realized that I was much happier being alone than being with him. I started going out with friends again and having a life outside of work. I felt more happy and live than I had in months.\n\nAfter a lengthy emotional talk with my family, I decided to break my engagement with my fiancé. \n\nWe had been chatting via Skype and messenger for the past month pretty regularly. He gets angry if I don’t text him everyday. The last few days, I haven’t texted him at all.\n\nThen, this evening, I decided to send tje following text:\n\n&gt; Hey. Sorry for not messaging you more this past week. I’m been really busy with work. I’ve also been thinking about us and I must admit I’ve had my doubts about our future together. \n\n&gt;To be honest, I do not think we are right for each other. I’ve been thinking about all the times you’ve disrespected me, treated me like crap, not listening to what I wanted. I don’t need that. Life is too short to stay in a relationship that makes me cry everyday. \n\n&gt;I’m moving my things out of the apartment tomorrow. You don’t have to worry about me, I’ll be fine on my own. I’m sorry if this was sudden. I think you are a great person and I’m sure you’ll meet a woman who you can respect and who can respect you. If you treat her better than you treated me, I’m sure she’ll stay. \n\n&gt;I love you and I will be your friend always,\nT\n\nI thought it was a pretty nice, respectful message. But then he responded and went mental, calling me a whore and a liar and threatening to “hunt” me down when he came back. \n\nI told one of my friends about this whole thing and she was shocked that I ended my engagement via text. She said it was a “dick move” and that I should at least call him or break up with him in person. I told her the reasons why I could not do that, but still she said he deserved better and that he’s probably heartbroken right now. She really made me feel like shit.\n\nAm I the asshole here? How could I have made this situation better?\n\nTL;DR: Broke up with abusive fiancé via text while he was thousands of km away. AITA?",

      "description": "As background, this is a dear friend who I met at college. He’s much older than I am, he’s around 36. He’s a hippie and doesn’t believe in steady jobs or money or savings, and travels around doing odd jobs and helping out with schools and farms. Recently, he took up projects close to where I live and has been traveling around this area. \n\nHe stayed over for 4 days the first time. I was looking forward to it, but I didn’t know it was going to be 4 days. He’s very disorganised, doesn’t book tickets, doesn’t plan ahead. Within a week or two, he came back to stay for 3 days because he needed a stop between two destinations. I wasn’t too comfortable with this. He’s very dependent on people for company and can’t really be by himself, so it got on my nerves a fair bit. I told him that he needed to plan ahead, and that I wasn’t comfortable with having people over that much, because I need many hours in a day to be by myself and recharge. \n\nRecently, he has asked to stay over for an entire fortnight. I flat out refused, because I don’t have the bandwidth for this. He said he’s sick and wants to get out of this project. I’m in a stressful in-between-jobs situation and just want to be left alone, and don’t want to deal with the added stress of a house guest. I said as much. He didn’t take it very well. \n\nAITA for refusing a sick friend shelter?\n\n",

      "description": "Context:\n\nI'm a female student who has a male friend, let's call him Ed. I also have a boyfriend who lives overseas  whom Ed has met and even got along with when my bf visited me for 2 weeks. During the time that my bf was in town, Ed did not bother me at all and acted civilly. \n\nMe and Ed have the same classes and sit next to one another and do homework together sometimes. \n\nHowever, some of Ed's behaviors really bother me:\n- He touches my legs sometimes (I told him I don't like it)\n- He looks at my phone or laptop and makes comments about whatever I'm doing (I also told him I find that intrusive). Or he'll laugh as if I'm looking up something stupid. \n- He looks for me around campus when I just wanna study alone without distraction. The last time he did it , he skipped class to find me . He then just towered above me without saying anything, and left. Then he came to my class to make up for the skipped one. \n- When I got new shoes, he asked if they're new. I said yes and that they're expensive and I had to save up. Then he grabbed my arm and started repeatedly stepping on them. \n\nI always forgave him but this past Friday all the frustration built up. After our class ended, he tried to snatch my lipstick from me after I was done applying it and I yelled at him \"What the fuck?\" And he just started mocking me by repeating what the fuck? What the fuck ?\" In front of everyone , even louder. I stormed out of class and ran to a bathroom to cry for almost an hour. \n\nAfter being consoled by my friend I told Ed that I was reporting him. I went to a school counselor and explained the situation. She reported Ed to the Dean of students and said that he will have a talk with Ed. \n\nEd texted me saying I ruined his day and that it's unfair to him that this will affect his record. I assured him that this is not on the record unless the behavior repeats. He also excused his harassment in text:\n\n - \"I never harassed you when I helped you on a test\"\n-  \"I grew up isolated and never got accustomed to the same norms as you\" ( he grew up in an all male boarding school)\n-  \"yes, there is always something new, but every time you told me you dislike it I stopped\". (Not true at all\n- \"I didn't try to snatch your lipstick, I wanted to see if you changed your lip balm\" (gaslighting) \n- \"Stepping on your shoes was a mistake, I apologized already\" (gaslighting, it was not a mistake, but very deliberate) \n\nI responded by saying I am not ready to talk and that I dislike his stalking me. \n\nOn Saturday (yesterday) he brought flowers and a note to my house saying \" we shouldn't be like this, let's talk when you're ready\" . I felt creeped out, especially considering I had told him that I'm not ready to talk and dislike stalking \n\nReddit, am Am I the Asshole for reporting him? I feel like I overreacted.  \n\nWhat should I do now? We take all classes together. \n",

His birthday party is coming up, and his parents invited me and some of our mutual friends to join in on a surprise party for him. \n\nThe party is on the same day as one of my first games, and we have already had 3 games cancelled dude to bad weather, I really don't want to miss the first one. The party is a long drive away as well. It's about 2 hours away from me, we live nearby but the party takes place far away. \n\nSo I'm stuck. I want to be there for him on his 18th, but I also don't want to miss my first game and drive 4 hours total. My original plan was to go and be there for him, then leave early to make the game, but the times conflict. \n\nWhat I'm going to try an do now is go take him out somewhere nice for his birthday, that way he still has fun at his birthday party, I'm celebrating it on another day, and I get to go to my first game.

      "description": "The title makes it sound worse than it is.\n\nThis takes place about 5 years ago. Some friends were talking about this guy recently and it got me thinking about this.\n\nI had a friend, been friends with him for the best part of a decade, probably about 7/8 years.\n\nI’ll start by saying, I knew he was gay, he confided in me, but he was really nervous about coming out publicly and generally. So I kept it to myself.\n\nI have absolutely no problem with people of whatever orientation, so long as you respect my decision if I turn you down I don’t give a shit what consenting adults do with one another.\n\nSo my friend tells me he is going to take the plunge and come out publicly. It goes about how I expected it to, his parents were like “We knew that” his other close friends were like “Took you long enough!” And so on.\n\nThis is the part where it takes a turn I didn’t expect. Previously, he was a guy who you could hold a conversation with, debate with, disagree with, play video games, have a beer with whatever. A couple of months go by and he becomes a totally different person.\n\nHe starts dressing more and more flamboyantly (who cares) he starts putting on “the voice” I don’t wanna start throwing stereotypes around but I’m sure you know what I mean (I still don’t care) but what really got my goat, was that he started using his sexuality as the basis for *everything* and he suddenly started trying to “one-up” everything that was discussed with him.\n\nFor example, we were discussing same marriage, which wasn’t legal at the time, I was all for it, I think people should be with who they loved regardless of genders or whatever. He would bizarrely, argue against my point of view. \n\n“You don’t know what you’re talking about, you couldn’t understand the necessity for same sex marriage **as a gay** I have a much better grasp of the issue”\n\nRight okay, if you say so.\n\nIt just got more and more ridiculous after that.\n\n“Ha, they spelt my name wrong at Starbucks”\n“They spell mine wrong every time I visit **because I’m gay**”\n\n“Some dick scratched my car!”\n“Someone slashed my tires **because I’m gay**”\n“Didn’t you get a flat because of some debris in the road? I’m fairly sure I helped you swap that tire?”\n“No, it was an attack against me because of my sexuality”\n\nIt repeats like this until, honestly, it felt like a chore talking to him. Everything and anything was always worse for him because he was gay.\n\nEventually I just stopped hanging out with him, he moved away shortly after that to the city and I haven’t spoken to him since.\n\nI feel like I’d have stopped speaking to anyone who constantly had to go one better regardless of what i said, but at the same time was a bit of a dick for not giving him longer to settle into his new life/personality/whatever after coming out?\n\nWhat do you think reddit?",

      "description": "Me and my roommate are both very busy college students who live in an apartment. We technically agreed to split all shared supplies 50/50 but it usually doesn't end up that way. We don't have anything in particular assigned, it's a if we need it and you go to the store, get it, kind of basis. He always asks for 50/50, while I usually just buy it even though he has loaded parents, and I pay for stuff with my internship. I don't care about bickering over $3 or tracking receipts, so it's easier for me this way. That doesn't bother me though.\n I cook for myself, while he has a dining hall plan, so I go to the store 3-4 times as much as he does. This ends up meaning I buy most supplies, which I don't really mind. We end up running out of stuff quite often, and I'm usually fine with just making due until it's convenient to go to the store next. One of the more awkward things we run out of is toilet paper. \nBecause this happens on occasion, I have a roll or two tucked in my closet for me and my girlfriend to use, which I take to the bathroom, and then hide again once I'm done, to ensure I always have some. Usually I'll go to the store within a few days and pick up a new pack when I go grocery shopping once or twice a month, but it's not really a high priority for me. \nRecently he confronted me about a number of reasons he thinks I'm a bad roommate and how he's frustrated. Almost everything was easy to sort into reasonable and unreasonable things, but for some reason I'm stuck on how he accused me of \"purposely allowing the tp to run out, and hoarding some to mock him, as i know it's a big deal for him to not have any\" (which I do, I just don't think it's my problem). \nI grew up in a household where my mother and sisters constantly bickered with me and each other over the smallest things, so I admittedly tend to ignore what I see as petty arguments, because I don't see purpose to them and don't want to spend a second arguing for no reason, as I spent 17 years doing that. Sometimes this puts me in the wrong though, as I ignore issues that shouldn't be ignored, which is why I'm stuck on this.\nHe has a car, while I ride the bus to shop. He has funding, while I'm on a tight budget. I feel like I'm doing him a favor by getting stuff more and not charging him for it, and I'm glad to do so. \nI really feel like I'm not in the wrong here but there's a little bit of me that keeps nagging that I'm being a jerk for saving that last bit of TP for myself, which makes him so angry.\n\nSorry for writing a book over something trivial, thanks!",

Obviously we end up being late which really bugs me because she knows I enjoy having  a chat with the other people before we start. \n\nShe's serially late for most things, including her gf, but I feel like 'bad timekeeping' is often just not really caring whether you're late. I feel like I'm allowed to be upset about her always being late, regardless of whether it's her habit, but she insists that it has nothing to do with not appreciating me/putting the effort in and is telling me that I basically just have to put up with it because there's nothing she can do about it.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "My friend and I are both in college, and both like to collect the figurines known as \"amiibo\" (link [here](https://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/) if you've never heard of these). He is much more into them than I am though (he has about 40-50 last I checked while I have about 10). \n\nWe both get monthly allowances from our parents (don't know how much his is or what it's designed for, but mine is for anything not school related, such as eating out, new clothes, etc.) He and I both know that his mom doesn't approve of him constantly buying amiibo, so he has been asking me to do it so his mom doesn't see where he's made purchases on his debit card. Every time I have made a purchase, he has paid me in full the day of, either with cash or Venmo. \n\nHowever, two days ago, he asked me to make a purchase again, but this time he said my payment would have to wait because he was \"broke\" and could pay me back later. Because he has a track record of being unreliable, I told him we would have to wait until he could pay me on the day of the purchase, as we had always been doing. (Example: Once near the end of last semester, I asked if he wanted to go for sushi to celebrate. He agreed until I asked if he could contribute to the Uber fare as the restaurant was slightly off campus, at which point he said he was broke). \n\nWe were discussing the purchase on the phone at the time, and when he mentioned being broke, I lost my temper and yelled at him to stop spending money on amiibo if he is. He promptly hung up the phone after that. I tried calling him today to apologize, but he didn't pick up and he hasn't called me back.\n\nDid I make the right choice?",

      "description": " TLDR:  On April 1st I wrote 'TRUMP 2024' with my finger in the dust on the  back window of my girlfriend's car as we drove around together, someone  forcibly stopped us in traffic to wipe it off making my girlfriend cry. I  feel bad.\n\nBackground\n\nMy  girlfriend and I live in west Los Angeles, near the Santa Monica area  which is famously liberal. It is the prius capital of the world  probably, and a good place to see bernie sanders bumper stickers. I  don't like trump and put myself in between socialist and libertarian... I'm a Georgist.\n\nTHE RUB\n\nWe had just eaten breakfast and were going to run some errands around the  west side, and in a moment of foolin' I decided to write 'TRUMP 2024\" in  huge letters in the dust on my girlfriends rear car window. She was  embarrassed and laughing and said she had to remove it before we had even left from our parking spot, simultaneous to a person driving by and booing it within minutes of me writing it. I assured her it was a funny  April Fool's joke and she, giggling but embarrassed did not press to remove it. Our drive was uneventful until some five miles and 15 minutes had passed.\n\nJust  after exiting the freeway a car aggressively sped up in front of us and  then stopped, blocking our lane. The driver got out of their car (in the middle of a busy 6-lane street) and walked back mumbling and took the liberty of wiping the politics off of the back of our car. As they  walked back to their car I said sorry and april fools out the window .\n\nThis  was kind of scary, and it was dangerous being stopped in the middle of  the street, and upset my girlfriend very much. We had to park and she was sobbing. I tried to comfort her by saying the guy was wrong to do it, probably thought the joke was distasteful and/or didn't  get it, and that everything was fine. It was not my immediate response to apologize for putting our lives in danger (though I later expressed this) since I was personally shocked more than anything at the time, not having expected such a dramatic response to my (admittedly distasteful) prank.\n\nI  sincerely thought it was just a bad joke, and being in the relatively  open minded area of west los angeles, did not think anyone would take  the whole thing seriously enough to do anything like that in response. I thought we would get some honks. I was not going to  leave the car parked with the message still on there, it was going to  last 30 minutes tops.\n\nIn  retrospect, the subtlety of insinuating Trump deserved a third term in  2024 could easily be missed, or worse, construed as evidence that we  were totally psycho Trump dictator maximalists deserving of aggressive \"putting in place.\"\n\nMy  girlfriend is not talking to me because she says I put us in danger and I knew she was sensitive. I feel awful and silly. I am probably an asshole, but how much of one?",

      "description": "Brief Background, I am in college as an engineering major. (Computer engineering to be specific). This issue takes place in math.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in a class that is pretty hard to understand, and I desperately need to learn the material from the professor because it is hard to learn on my own. During class, there is one student, let's call him Jim, that sits in the front. Jim is convinced that he and the professor are best buds and can complete each other sentences, thus he cuts in every other minute during lecture trying to be the first student to the punch, so to speak. It's extremely annoying and half the time he is wrong. This usually derails the professors train of thought, and makes it difficult to understand the topic because every word could be randomly cut off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is usually something along the lines of:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProfessor: If you look at the proof this way, you can use...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJim: (some blah idk)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProfessor: (Pauses) No, we have to use De Morgans Law for solving this \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt happens so often, I would say 10-15 times a lecture, and it just annoys me so much. He thinks he is the smartest kid ever and just ruins the lecture. Additionally, when he says stuff that is wrong, the professor has to derail his own lecture to explain why whatever Jim said is wrong, leading to inevitable back-and-forth's between the kid that thinks he knows everything and the FUCKING professor who is TEACHING the class. It makes lectures extremely tangential at times, and counter-productive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, the professor has done nothing all semester to address his behavior, even though this is legit some dumb middle schooler shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is: WIBTA for telling him off in any way. He is legitimately interfering with my ability to learn in the class, while also infuriating me and everyone in my class. It just displays a complete lack of self-control and self-awareness. ",

      "description": "Some backstory:\n\nMy sister about three years ago was constantly talking about having kids. Mind you, she was a junky and thought that a child would solve all of her problems and make her happy. She probably also lived with a serious mental illness due to genetics (runs in the family) and brain damage sustained from a car wreck. Well, her boyfriend and her were successful and their son, my nephew, was born about 18 months ago. \n\nFrom the moment she started talking about having a kid, my partner and I were very straight with her and told her to focus on sobriety and getting her shot together first. We were also very clear that if she decided to have a kid, we weren’t gonna be the ones raising the kid. \n\nAfter still struggling with addiction and being in and out of jail for the past year, she passed from OD about a month or so ago. Every other weekend my mom is supposed to have her grandson, my nephew. Of course the dad is shotty and not the most reliable person so this means the “every other week” plan hasn’t been held up. So even knowing my opportunities to see my nephew are slim, I still don’t want to spend my days off driving 2 hours to sit there and do nothing. Like I said earlier, I have no interests in being around kids or raising any. My mom tries to guilt trip me with the “it takes a village” shit but all that does is make me feel bad for not being an active participant in my nephews life. Additionally, I don’t even really want to see my mother ever because she only hears what she wants to and constantly projects her opinions as reality. \n\nAITA for rather staying home to play video games on my days instead of being an active participant in my nephews life?\n\nTL;DR \n\nSister was a junky, had a kid, OD’ed, mother tries to guilt trip me into seeing my nephew, I don’t want to and I’ve always been opposed to her ever having kids, don’t want kids of my own. AITA for not wanting to spend my days off traveling two hours to sit there with a 18 month old?\n\n",

We were sitting at a table and my friend across from me had her jacket hanging on the back of her chair. \n\nI see this guy come up, kind of stumbling and looking pretty drunk, and he grabs my friends jacket and starts looking through the pockets. Immediately in my head I am thinking he's trying to get her wallet or phone or something, so I stand up and yell \"Excuse me, what the hell do you think you're doing?!?\" He immediately backs off and claims he was just looking for his jacket and thought it was his. \n\n1. It's on my friends chair\n2. She is a very petite female and her jacket was tight fitting, no way this guy would've fit into it\n3. ASK us if you can look at the jacket\n\nI explain these 3 (to me logical points) to him and he absolutely freaks out telling me I am overreacting and to chill the fuck out. He eventually goes away. He later found his jacket (different color and material from my friends) but decides to come wave it in my face and call me a bitch. \n\nI felt I did the right thing trying to defend my friends property. The part that kills me is that my friends agreed with him. None of them were really concerned and said he was just innocently looking for his jacket and that I needed to chill. \n\nMaybe he really was just looking, but I've heard way too many stories of being being robbed, assaulted, etc and being too polite to stop it when they had the chance.\n\nAm I the asshole that overreacted?\n\nTLDR: drunk guy is looking through my friends jacket, claims he was looking for his own when I call him out.

The way I grew up is to be independent and always do things so it doesn't negatively affect others. So I am used to taking the bus and walking places. So when my girlfriend wants me to drive her every day for work I refuse, because I believe she should be independent. However, she always tells me that all her coworkers think I am an asshole because all of their boyfriends pick them up every day. Now a bit of backstory, I own my own company so I am often working from home, so she uses this against me, telling me if I am just at home, what is the big deal of spending 30 mins picking her up. I do pick her up a couple times a week, but I feel like I shouldn't have to be her butler and drive her whenever she wants. If she can take the bus, why should I be expected to drive her everyday?

      "description": "Hey everyone, sorry for the long post but I feel like this situation requires a fair amount of explanation to get the whole picture. Also, obligatory LTL, FTP, and this is a throwaway account because some of my family know my real account. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo as a little background, my dad has been in and out of work for awhile now, he just can't seem to find the job that's \"right\" for him so he's had several different jobs over the past few years. He's been out of work for about 2-3 months now despite the fact that he's been networking and sending out resumes like crazy, he's in kind of a niche market so jobs are NOT abundant, and he and my mom have been living with one of my siblings to save money.\n\nNow I love my parents, I really do, so when they mentioned that they might want to move in with me to give my sib some space again, and because I live about 4 hours away in a better area for the jobs he's looking for, I was cool with it even though I just got my own place a couple of months ago (I'd been living with a roommate previously). Again, I really do love my parents and actually our whole family gets along really well, so I had no problem letting them come and stay with me until my dad found another job and he and mom could get their own place again.\n\nSooooo, a few weeks ago, when they first mentioned the idea of moving in with me, I was told that it wouldn't be until after the new year, probably closer to February or March. Ok, cool. That gives me plenty of time to get my place set up, clear out a space for them, make a basic list of house rules (don't touch my stuff, don't rearrange the furniture, stuff like that), and just do general cleanup. Then yesterday, I travel 4 hours to where my family lives for Christmas and we have a great day until about 2 o'clock when my mom mentions that they'll be up on Friday with the moving truck...What?!?! So...yeah... apparently they made all of the plans, rented a truck, a storage unit, and movers to move them into my place with like 3 days notice.\n\nNeedless to say, I was very surprised. They had talked about moving the date up, and even mentioned that they might want to be in with me sooner than they'ed originally planned, maybe even before the end of the year, which is fine, but the last I heard was that nothing had been decided. I'm sure my surprise was obvious when they told me, and I admit to being a little snippy when I found out because not only were they giving me just 3 days notice, but that they'd made all the plans and reserved everything without telling me AND they'd planned to move in on a day when they knew I wouldn't be there because I'll be out of town visiting some friends. \n\nNow I'm an introvert, and my home is my sanctuary, my one safe place where I can just be, and breathe, and not have to worry about dealing with the world or other people; so while I had no problem with my folks moving in, I absolutely wanted to be there, go over house rules, and ensure that my personal space was not invaded on moving day. They seemed kind of irritated when I was surprised and I felt like they were offended and assumed I didn't want them to move in with me (my dad even said that they would cancel the reservations and move in at a different time). I assured them that it was fine, I didn't want them to lose deposits, and I just would have appreciated being included on the planning or at least being given a heads up that they'ed settled on a date.\n\nI left early to drive back and worked until like 1 o'clock this morning to get the house ready then I crashed only to wake up to a text from my mom saying that they'ed canceled all of the reservations and not to worry about them being there so soon, that they were back to a date of February or March. I called and was like: \"What the heck mom, I said it was fine and you were welcome any time?!?\", and she was like: \"Well u/MiddleMiddleChild, you didn't seem like you were prepared or interested in having us live with you so soon, so we've decided to wait and stay where we are for a while\".  I can tell they felt offended and like I didn't want them with me even though that's not the case. We ended up having a mini argument over the phone and now everything is awkward and irritating and I just feel like my whole Christmas/vacation is shot. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My mom and dad asked to move in with me next year then planned/reserved everything for Friday without mentioning it to me. I was surprised, they were offended and cancelled all of their plans after I stayed up all night getting stuff ready. Argument ensued, now Christmas is ruined. AITA?",

Jeff and his girlfriend Sarah were planning a vacation in my city and needed a place to stay. He asked if they could stay at my place for a week. I politely said no, but Jeff insisted and I continued to decline. He stopped responding eventually.\n\nThen it was last week. Jeff messaged me on Facebook again. He was asking for the address of my apartment. I gave him my address and phone number assuming he wanted to visit me.\n\nYesterday, I answered a call on my cell phone. \"Hello, this is Officer Dave from [country border force] at [airport], is this u/SpecialMinimum?\" He asked about Jeff and Sarah. I was confused. In this conversation I answered his questions truthfully: I knew them, I knew they were coming, but they were not staying in my apartment. He thanked me and hung up.\n\nApparently Jeff and Sarah got sent back. My family is pissed at me. Jeff spent so much money to make his girlfriend happy, but his selfish brother ruined it.\n\nI could have sacrificed my comfort to let them stay in my apartment. I could have offered to help pay for a hotel. I could have lied to the cop that called me. Am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA For Parking Next To A Car That Has A “Baby On Board” Sign In The Window?",
      "description": "Tl;dr at bottom, it got lengthy \n\nSo about two years ago I ordered food on my phone from Panera Bread. I parked my car (within the lines) in the Togo parking spot that has a ten minute maximum. The parking lot was really full as it was lunch time and this place is right next to a military base. I go inside, make my drink, grab my bag and head back out. There’s a woman putting in her baby’s car seat in the spot next to mine and she is blocking my way to the driver door so I just stand and wait. After a few moments she hits my car with her door, but hey she’s got her hands full and my car has been through worse so I don’t say anything. She hit it a few times just trying to adjust the car seat and get it buckled correctly. Then she looks up and sees me waiting. She tells me essentially that I am not allowed to park next to her since she has a baby on board sticker and that it’s my fault she hit my door because I should have known that. I told her I didn’t pay attention to her car when I was parking and that she could’ve loaded her car from the other side (which was empty) or she could park farther away if she needs more room (she was directly in front of the door) and that since I’m in the lines and did not exceed my time I did absolutely nothing wrong. In the end she argued a bit, flipped me off and I grumbled “fuck you too, lady”. I’m not sure if she heard me or not. I know it was unnecessary to say that it was just me being angry at how entitled and snotty she was. \nI assumed that since the baby was fairly small she was just tired and grumpy overall. So AITA? Do people actually not park next to people who have those signs. I thought those were just for emergency services in case of a crash. It’s been two years and I still think about it whenever I see one. \n\nTL;DL: Lady says I should not of parked next to her because she had a “baby on board” sign and I was blocking her from fully opening her back door even though I was in my lines. We argue a little and she flips me off so I said “fuck you too” AITA? ",

      "description": "Okay, so to start, my in laws host a “family gathering” at their house about once a month. While I won’t go in to all of the politics behind when they choose the date and who they pick, just know they do it strategically. This month it happens to be the Saturday after my daughters birthday which is when we have thrown her birthday party every year since she was born. Always the Saturday after her birthday.... Anyway, I had been getting along with my in laws reasonably well lately and was approached last month when they planned this and they said they’d love to have the party at their house and they’d pitch in for food and decorations and invite my family and only certain family members on their side as quite a few of them are drama filled, toxic people. \n\nNow less than a week before hand, I find out she’s invited 4 whole families from the extended family I had not agreed on. No heads up or anything, just invited them all. I don’t really have a big problem with most of these people, I stay out of drama and after almost a decade of being a part of this family, they leave me out of it. Now here’s the part where I might be an asshole. One of these families is my father in law’s sister. She has a history of severe depression and doesn’t have much family of her own in the area. She’s a lovely person, she loves my kids, and they love her too. She’s been very depressed lately and so my in laws invited her to the party. I like to keep parties small and wanted just immediate family and wouldn’t normally have invited her, but whatever, that part isn’t the big deal. Here’s what is: her new husband is hugely racist. Uses the N word frequently, says things like “people should keep to their own kind” referring to interracial couples. Reminisces of segregation, thinks only white male land owners should vote, etc. Also is VERY vocal on such issues. Most of my husband family chalks it up to him being “from another generation”. I think that’s utter bullshit and shouldn’t be tolerated from anyone no matter their age. I don’t want him there, ESPECIALLY after my mother in law invited my sibling who is in an interracial marriage and has three young children who shouldn’t be exposed to such hate at their cousins birthday party.  I understand this is their house and they have the right to invite who they want. So am I the asshole for insisting he not be there whether or not the aunt will come?",

      "description": "About 6 months ago my trusty 2001 Corolla was totaled in an accident. I was thinking about getting a different vehicle anyway so it wasn't the end of the world. After insurance finally cut me a check I went car shopping. My husband and I found a good value after a week or so and we decided we'd buy it.\n\nThis is when the first red flag hits: we call up our bank to get terms for a car loan and the interest rate is a few percentage points higher than we expected. When we ask why, we are told it's because my credit score is considerably lower than my husband's. I thought that was weird but figured it was because he uses his credit card all the time (and pays it off every month) whereas I almost never use mine. \n\nThe second and far bigger red flag came when I got a letter from a different credit card company letting me know my options for \"catching up\" on my payments. We don't have a card though this company so I called and let them know they were mistaken. \n\nUnfortunately for me, they were not mistaken. There was a credit card in my name with an address to my mother's house. It had a max of $2,000 and a little over $1,000 on the balance and most of the payments over the last two years were at least 30 days late, some were 90 days late. Needless to say I was shocked. The customer service person said if I wished to dispute it directly with them, I would need documentation that I spoke with law enforcement about it. \n\nLong story short, that's exactly what I did after my mother first refused to acknowledge she had a credit card in my name then finally acknowledged it but said she mainly used it only for special occasions. The infuriating thing is that she has the money to pay it off but the late payments completely destroyed my credit down to a 570.\n\nI gave the credit card company a copy of the report and last month I noticed the card was no longer on my account and my credit score jumped 200 points. HURRAY! \n\nLast Thursday, I received a call from my mother, apparently sheriff's deputies had been to her house and informed her she was being charged with credit card fraud. Now she's furious at me and told me that if she had known I was this serious about it she would have just paid it back.\n\nI feel bad now because obviously the rest of the family and her friends are going to find out about this but my husband says I did the right thing.

      "description": "I have a friend of 13 years who is like a brother to me let's call him T. T is married and has a 1 year old baby boy. Well T got into trouble about 4 months ago and ended up in jail. With my help in court his charges were dropped and should have been released last week but because he isn't a citizen immigration has him in another jail until further notice. Now these past 4 months I have been constantly in contact with T helping whenever I could. Recently T has been calling me at least 3-5 times daily asking me to spam call his immigration lawyer so that he works faster in getting T out of jail. He calls me while I'm at work and constantly asks for commissary money saying he cant eat the jail food and if I cant get something done for him he finds a way to make me feel absolutely horrible about it. \n\nNow I've been managing everything decently until yesterday when I found out that someone had called CPS on T's wife and they have launched an investigation on her. Now T and T's wife are scared to lose custody of their baby. And are constantly blowing my phone up with calls and asking for help and money. The reason T is scared, is because his wife is severely bipolar and lashes out in a violent manner often. She is also depressed and even attempted ending it all with pills when her son was 2 months old. On top of that T's wife is unemployed and does nothing but lay around and smoke weed all day. Today T's wife wanted me to buy her son a new crib because his old one broke and thinks it will add to the unfit household  part of the cps investigation she also wanted me to buy her a detox so that she can pass a drug test requested by CPS, but I said I was horribly busy with work so I couldn't help today (I wasn't busy with work I just needed a day where i didn't have to deal with T or his wife's issues) So AITA if I do little to nothing in helping T and his family in this new problem and also that I believe CPS should take away T's son because I do not trust T's wife?

      "description": "My school’s basketball team recently beat another school who lost a player in a car accident. We, along with every other school, offered our condolences to them as soon as we found out what happened.  They decided to forfeit some of their games after the incident because they felt they weren’t ready to play after what happened. We were their first opponents after the incident and they decided to dedicate their first game after the tragedy in honor of his memory. My school has not beat this team in 5 years as they are a very good team. We played a really tough game against them but we ended up winning. After we won we ended cheering and celebrating, yelling stuff like “YEAH WE DID IT!” we were all embracing each other after we won. A lot of the other people on the other team were crying after they lost. His girlfriend who was wearing his jersey was sitting in the bleachers crying alongside his family. \n\nOur head coach said we didn’t do anything wrong as they were cheering when they were beating us at the start and they would’ve celebrated had they beaten us. Our assistant coach said that given the circumstances we shouldn’t have celebrated. The response on their side was pretty negative saying that we were disrespectful and should be forced to forfeit the win. One Comment from one of their player’s parents said  that these kids were obviously not ready to play yet and would have “whooped our asses any other day.” For context every game we’ve played, the winning team does some sort of celebration be it their school chant, or just embracing. We didn’t mean any disrespect we were just happy to have beaten a tough opponent ",

If a man murders someone, and another robs a bank but doesn't kill someone, we still arrest both of them because what they did was wrong, even though the murder is more severe. Thats drunk vs high driving.

      "title": "AITA for wanting to cut off my friends for associating with my ex?",
      "description": "AITA for wanting to cut off these two people for being involved with my ex? \n\nJust a warning: this post is long and involves some context. \n\nSo there are three contenders in this story. My ex, Jacob, his best friend, Michael and my (former?) best friend Hannah. \n\nLong story short, my ex, Jacob, is a very manipulative and narcissistic person. We dated for two years in high school and broke up senior year. He was very controlling, he gaslighted me, manipulated my image to my family and friends and downplayed my emotions. I attempted suicide when we broke up because I felt like a husk of a person, honestly.\n\nIt’s been a little over a year and I have been making strides in recovery. I graduated high school and I’m going to my local university and making new friends. \n\nThe only issue I am currently juggling in the back of my mind is Hannah and Michael. Both have been close friends with me since high school and both were very important to me at one point. The conflict that brought me back to thinking about this was my ex visiting me at work. \n\nTo start, I met Hannah after I started dating Jacob. She’s pretty and smart, but really shy and private. Immediately, Jacob became infatuated with her and it was clear he had a crush on her. While we were dating, he would compliment her physical appearance to me and make “jokes” about having a threesome with her. She knew all of this too, as she was my best friend. At the time, she expressed disdain for his behavior. \n\nAfter Jacob and I split, he pursued Hannah and tried to guilt her into going on a date and such. She kept this hidden from me and even let it get in between our friendship! She ignored me for a few months and I had found out that it was because she was “Jacobs best friend”. I tried explaining to her that Jacob only wanted to get into her pants and she refused, saying that they like the same music and he had “never done anything to her”.\n\nNow onto Michael. I’ve known Michael longer than my ex, and we were very close as friends for most of high school. We enjoyed all the same things and had the same sense of humor.\n\nDuring my suicide attempt, he was very concerned and a listening ear, but ultimately his attitude has been “I know he’s your ex but Jacob isn’t the devil you make him out to be.” So we haven’t been as close since then, and it’s clear he prefers to be around Jacob now. \n\nSo I work at a seafood restaurant with my family. I’ve worked here since high school and Jacob and Michael even worked with me at one point. Jacob still worked with us even after our breakup, which my friends and therapist thought was odd of him. My mom refused to fire him and told me to just deal with it. Jacobs mom also told me that she wanted Jacob to keep his job. \n\nUpon graduation, I heard that Jacob enlisted in the military. I was very relieved hearing this, as it meant he would stop visiting me on my shifts. He would come in with Michael and linger around and talk to my family. He knew the days I worked and this didn’t feel coincidental. \n\nAnyway, the night before he left he came in to eat. He came in with a group of friends. \n\nSame story the first night he came back. He came in with a group of friends. \n\nMy issues with this is that he only comes in only when I work and he doesn’t even eat seafood. Jacob, Michael and all his friends don’t eat seafood. They all order chicken tenders. \n\nWith Jacobs recent, unexpected visit making me and my new bf uncomfortable, I question how Hannah and Michael feel about it. \n\nIn my opinion, it was weird of him to step off the plane and waltz into my work with full uniform and a smile. He didn’t go see his family first, he came HERE first. I have a new boyfriend and Jacob wouldn’t stop looking at him. \n\nHannah says it was weird of him to visit and that he’s been hitting her up the week leading up. This threw me off a bit because she told me he was a crappy person and that she felt sorry for what happened. Why would you allow someone like that to continue contact with you? \n\nI haven’t talked to Michael about it. He’s not accountable, but I think it’s odd to let your friend do that and go along with it. \n\nMy therapist believes that Jacob is manipulating them as well, and that I should lend an ear to them to hear their side. \n\nI’ve heard Hannah’s side and she was initially unwilling to let go of their friendship, which is fine. She later switched to being on my “side” and criticizing his behavior. But with this new event, she hides that she still keeps him in her contacts? I get a feeling she just enjoys attention from him, as she’s never had a boyfriend. \n\nWhile my therapist and others and even my family encourage me to continue being friends with Hannah and Michael, it’s too exhausting. I feel like my suicide attempt was real and how Jacob treated me was real, but Michael and Hannah don’t see it as impactful as I did. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting nothing to do with them anymore? \n\n(Am willing to provide more information, answer any questions, etc. also if this is an inappropriate subreddit, please let me know!) \n\nTLDR: my ex was abusive and I attempted suicide upon our break up. My friend Hannah badmouths him when we’re together but continues being his friend when I’m not there. My friend Michael is still his friend and goes along with his odd behavior post break up. \n",

      "description": "To preface, we have been together for awhile. Within the last year, I gave birth and experienced extreme post partum depression. It was hard but I took care of both of our children and could tell he was drifting away. He didn't want to engage with me or the children.\n\nI became so paranoid I snooped through his emails, and found one where he confessed to wanting to transition to female. I was two months out of giving birth, an emotional wreck and I tried to take all of my antidepressants. I ended up in a psych hospital and also got a diagnosis of PTSD from sexual trauma at a young age.\n\nWe got through it, I came home. I started using a different name for her, we got her makeup and different clothes. She seemed better for a bit, but we were financially strapped and could not afford health insurance. So hormone transitioning was out of the question.\n\nSO started growing distant again soon after, buried themselves in video gamed and got angry at me when I asked them to spend more time with us, or completely shut down. We had a fight while they were at work and she threatened to walk in front of traffic. The cops were called, a wellness check was done, and they gave her resources to go to therapy. \n\nMeanwhile, I had to cut back on my work hours as I'm having health tests done to check for arthritis and other inflammation, as I'm in a shit ton of pain. It's been hard on both of us. I've been trying to keep things stable and okay. I'm also trying to care for her.\n\nLately, everything I say, there's something wrong with. She's moody and angry at me, and doesn't talk or communicate with me. I have been having a really rough time, but have been effectively ignoring it to try and mend things with her.\n\nAnd then she gets fired for too many tardies and absences. Not rrally her fault, as most of the time she was tardy was because of our autistic daughter and having to take her to school. But it's a shitshow. We don't have the money for bills and I'm desperately applying everywhere to find better pay.\n\nShe's just given up. She'll barely get up in the morning, we're late all the time. Our daughter has missed school because she drags her feet, and I keep begging her to get into therapy but I'm tired. It's beeen this way since I gave birth. The most restful period I had was literally a week in a mental health facility.\n\nAm I the Asshole? What could I do to help?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my friend she is making things harder than they need to be?",
      "description": "I'm not a good student, I know this about myself, I scrape by. My friend is a very dedicated student. She takes hard classes, is a double major, and is upset with anything below an A on her work. She'd usually spend a few more hours doing homework than I would, and was usually the best student in class. We lived together for a few years before I got married and moved away. However, we still talk frequently and hang out online as we're both gamers. The problem is that because of her schoolwork, we hang out once or twice a month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand school is important to her. She picked a hard field and has been selected for a couple of great opportunities such as being a lab assistant and a few internships. I'm really happy she's enjoying her university life and doing what she wants to do. My problem is with her time management. She often talks about how busy she is and how she has no time to hang out or talk. However she often goes out of the way to make her work take longer than it needs to. For example:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) She often does homework while watching tv. Even if we had the same assignment, she would still take 2 hours more to do it for the same grade, because she'd get distracted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Opting into extra assignments she doesn't need or want. She had 2 internships and then signed up for 2 more, when she was already stressing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) When writing a paper with a set limit, She will write over the limit and then spend the next few DAYS cutting it down to the required length. When I say 'over the limit' I'm talking writing 13 pages on a 2 page assignment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3 is what our most recent disagreement was about. I understand everyone has their own method, and I know people write over the limit and then edit it to the length it needs to be. But writing THAT much more is insane. I asked her why bother writing it that way if it was just making more work for her for no benefit, and she freaked out and started yelling at me saying that shes sick of people calling her a \"tryhard\" and that this is just the way she does it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got irritated that she was snapping at me when I wasn't trying to attack her. I told her that if that's how she wants to do it, fine. No one can tell her how to get her shit done. But also don't complain about being overwhelmed when a 2 hr paper is instead taking you 3 days because \"that's how you've always done it\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know we see school work differently and I don't know if I'm just an asshole, or if she's being unreasonable and is going out of her way to make things difficult for herself and then expecting her friends to listen to her complain about the work she made, all while not spending time with us or talking to any of us more than a few times a month. I love her and shes my best friend, and at this point it's something I've accepted will be part of our relationship. I'm just wondering...AITA?",

They looked pretty offended when I said that and one of them text me after said I was being an asshole by saying shit like that.\n\nBut it's true??? That's how i felt.

      "description": "So there’s a bit of long context here which I feel is important, so bear with me.\nMy husband is in the military and while we were stationed in Japan we became great friends with a woman we’ll call R. R is also enlisted and dated a mutual friend for a while, and while they had a bit of an ugly breakup we stayed friends with both parties because we feel that whatever happens between them, baring any kind of abuse, shouldn’t affect our friendships with either. A little over a two years pass and we get a wedding invitation from R and we’re happy for her, but there’s some lingering concerns because she marrying a guy she’s only been dating for 2 months...\nFast forward a year later, my husband gets stationed near R and we meet to catch up since we haven’t seen her in 2 years. Since we just moved to the area, we don’t have our own place yet and staying at a hotel while we try to find an apartment is draining our finances quick, so R happily agrees to let me and our 3 pets (2 cats and our 5lb dog) stay with her and her husband while my husband stays with another friend until we find a place. I didn’t find out until the night I came to stay she didn’t at least ask her husband, just sprung it on him, but despite the awkward introduction her husband, T, turns out to be a really cool guy and we bond over video games and other mutual pop culture stuff.\nWhile I’m staying with them, I cook and clean up after myself, buy my own groceries, and basically do my best to not disrupt their daily lives; we only have one car that my husband obviously needs to get to and from work, so I’m pretty much housebound in a new town where the only people I know are R and T and spend my free time filling out apartment applications and playing video games.\nFinally, after nearly 2 months, we get approved for a place perfectly in our budget and have a move-in date. Two weeks before I left, suddenly R’s skeletons come tumbling out of the closet.\nDuring my stay, R and T got into a lot of petty fights over seemingly nothing, with R always instigating due to her having a short temper and it always made me super uncomfortable that they would do this in front of me almost every time. It had gotten to the point I was looking into staying with a friend nearly 5 hours away, worried that maybe my staying there was putting any stress on them, but when R found out she wanted to sit down and talk about it, asking what she could do to help me feel more comfortable. I was honest with her about my concerns, how I felt that she and T needed to work in their communication together and she needed to reign in her temper. Since they were already seeing a marriage counselor who had told her the same thing, she agreed with me and apologized and things were okay for a while after that, even T insisting they enjoyed my company and help around the house. R occasionally came to me for advice and I was always honest with her but did my best to word things gently so she wouldn’t feel like I was shouldering all the blame on her; at this point in our friendship I already knew she had some issues from childhood trauma that affected her behaviors and how she dealt with situations, and encouraged her to continue seeing their marriage counselor and to consider a personal one for herself.\nI had also noticed during my stay that she drank a lot of wine, even on nights she worked early the next day. Now I enjoy a glass or two myself, but it was concerning to me that she would drink nearly a whole bottle every other night and apparently had a few stashed upstairs that she laughingly said T didn’t know about, which was another red flag. One night when I tried to tell her I was worried, especially because she was taking medication at the time, she snapped at me and didn’t speak to me the rest of the night. T served her with divorce papers the next morning.\nR left two days later on a sort of deployment for a month, and I discovered through T’s sister (who had visited for Thanksgiving that I had cooked for everyone) that R had complained to her that I was “an overweight, lazy couch potato with no motivation” and it hurt me pretty deeply. I have clinical depression and have struggled with an eating disorder since I was 12, things R has known since we became friends, so for her to have allegedly said those things cut to my core. Rather than confront her, I chose to temporarily block her on social media, my reasoning being she was going through a divorce and clearly had a lot of her own issues to work on and I didn’t want her to feel attacked, deciding I’d rather talk about it in person so there wouldn’t be any misunderstanding over text, but that turned out to be the wrong decision as she almost immediately lashed out at my husband, telling him I was being petty and had no right to be angry with her. My husband gently diffused the situation, emphasizing that I was simply hurt by the accusation and for her to simply focus on herself and that we would get together when she got back.\nBut soon I had evidence via screenshots she’d said these things more than once to multiple people; mutual friends, one of T’s other family members, coworkers, even going so far as to tell them I was “a bisexual in a poly marriage” and to “not be surprised if she flirts with you.” Admittedly that may not seem like a big deal to some, but in the military atmosphere people can get in trouble for what would be considered adultery, and I never disclose my sexuality or open marriage to people I don’t feel comfortable with, so having complete strangers know these things made me extremely uncomfortable and worried about how it could potentially affect my husband’s career if someone took it to his command; most don’t care, but it’s not something I’m comfortable gambling with.\nAt that point I had decided I was done, that I didn’t want to talk to her about it because she’d repeatedly tried to blame everyone else around her rather than just owning up and apologizing, but yesterday my husband received a message from R that said, “Is Catsocks done being mad at me for something I didn’t even do?”\nSomething about that wording just feels so dismissive of my feelings, but am I really the asshole for stepping away from this friendship?",

He said something disrespectful about my mom (as a joke) and i lightly smacked him. lightly. he decided to slap me back, which it wasn’t hard but it for sure wasn’t as light as my hit which was supposed to be fake and “playful” if you will. I got really angry, told him that it was fake and i didn’t really hit him, so why did he feel it was okay to slap me back? it hurt a little bit. instead of being remorseful he argued back at me, saying whatever i do to him he can do to me. it got really heated and i’m still kind of mad. but i don’t know if it’s justified, because he hit me without the intent to hurt me.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So about two days ago, I was in my GF's dorm room, and we were just talking, half watching a show. She shows me a video of a mutual friend doing a backflip on Instagram, and says \"Look at this boy, he's going to go and get his neck broken\" but in a pretty southern-grandma-sounding way. Granted, she's from Mississippi, but doesn't have your stereotypical southern drawl at all. Upon hearing that, I burst into laughter and say \"Why are you so cringey?\"\n\nShe immediately gets defensive and is asking me why I would say that, what I mean specifically, etc etc. I do my best to explain that I thought she sounded like an overly concerned grandma, and coming from a 20 year old college girl that is a little bit cringe. This isn't the first time I've teased her either. It's something we both do and a normal part of our relationship. But now she's really upset with me and has been pouting and making comments about this incident for the last two days.  She wants me to take back what I said, but I refuse because I still think what I said was true. I have apologized for crossing the line but I had to make it clear that, objectively, what she said was cringey. \n\nAITA here? ",

Their relationship progressed quickly: they moved in together within a couple of months and got engaged shortly thereafter. All seemed well until Jimmy discovered that Porshia had cheated on him with multiple guys for pretty much the entirety of their relationship. They tried to reconcile, but due to further developments, split up permanently a few months later.\n\nTo provide some further background, all of Jimmy's serious relationships have ended due to his girlfriends cheating on him.\n\nSince the breakup Jimmy has been very active on Tinder. He seems to match with girls who want more than he does. Jimmy just wants roots, he will say whatever is necessary to obtain them, and then ghosts the girl afterwards. Whenever I call him out he is pretty apathetic, he offers no defense and says that he just doesn't care about their feelings.\n\nAlthough he won't admit it entirety, I believe that he is getting revenge on women.

      "description": "First time poster and on mobile so honestly just sorry in advance... for anything.\n\nAnyways, this story took place a couple of months ago but just popped back into my brain after I saw my cousins Snapchat post advertising his next concert.\n\nMy cousin is a sound cloud rapper who is in a group of rappers in the same area as him. Keep in mind I love the guy and I fully support him and his career choice. He’s not super big or anything but definitely has a fan base. He has had multiple concerts before which me and my brother have attended. My aunt (cousins mom) usually sends us a link to where we can buy tickets and gives us all the info, she’s great and supports him as well.\n\nSo I heard he was having another concert and my and my brother immediately went to the site we were sent and bought tickets. It was at a new venue which was about a 25-30 minute drive, no  biggie. We then made the mistake of not checking the date and going with what my aunt sent us which was the wrong date. \n\nWe obviously didn’t find out it was the wrong date until we had drove 30 minutes and no one showed up. My brother is very social and skipped out on friends to come and he was pissed. We went home and decided we wouldn’t go to the concert which was actually a week later.\n\nMy aunt found out we weren’t going and got angry as we had “rsvp’d” in a way. We then explained the situation again as we had already briefly explained a week prior and she said that was no excuse and it is only a 30 minute drive. She then called us unsupportive even though she didn’t attend any concerts herself, she just advertised it.\n\nSo you nice, maybe not so nice, people of reddit. Am I the Asshole for not wanting to drive 30 minutes to attend a concert I had pretty much already attended?",

They gave us each $200 and I wanted to buy a cheap laptop with mine so I could start making music which has always been an interest of mine. \n\nAlso let me just say that I've been looking for a job but have had no luck so I wanted to do music as a nice medium to help pay for bills and my own needs until I get hired.\n\n The  day we got it  my mom asked for money to send to my grandma who lives in a different country to help with Christmas stuff since $400 is a lot there so me and my brother lent her our $400 and she said she would pay us back in a week. \n\nSo at this point I'm ok with it and what not but  a week passes and I hear nothing on the money I ask what happened then she says my sister got robbed so she needs the money she was gonna give me to help her get her information back since they took her purse so I said ok I'm not gonna be mean when it come to my sister getting robbed. \n\nShe promises to pay me back the week after I say ok and then hear nothing so I ask again and she says my sister was gonna give the money but she never got paid so now I'm getting annoyed it's been almost a month at this point and I'm getting annoyed. \n\nIk she has 3 jobs and I haven't seen my stepdad help with bills so I'd assume it's partially his fault we're not good financially.\n\nToday I asked again and she went on a rant on how god is gonna punish me for pressuring her on the money that she doesn't have even though last week her and my stepdad got matching tattoo worth about $50-$100 each and all I asked for was my money to buy a cheap computer which I think if she can spend half that on tattoos she can pay me back at least half of mine so I can save it and then give the other half whenever she has it I even asked for $90 today and for a slow payment of 50 every week, I even told her I'd take 25 if she has it.\n\n\n\nTLDR\n\nFor those who couldn't be bothered basically I let my mom borrow my birthday money to help my grandma and she said she'd pay me back in a week but it's been a month and I've seen none of it",

      "description": "My FWB of 7 months recently told me that he grew apart from his friends and that the only person he hangs out with regularly is me. This came as a bit of a surprise because he is very sociable and I thought he had many casual friends. We text almost every day, chill out at least once a week (not just Netflix and chill) and eat together at school sometimes. He wants to meet and befriend all my school friends. I'm glad he wants to make friends but... can't he make some of his own? One of them actually makes more sense than the others because they share a class, but besides that it's kind of weird that he wants to befriend all my friends all of a sudden. \n\n He wants one of my friends to join us on our weekly activity and it just feels weird to me. I get it, I'm probably jealous but I know I shouldn't be cause all these girls have reasons why they can't even be with him (one is only 17, one has a boyfriend, the other is 95% gay). For context, he's 24M, I'm 19F, my friends are between 17 and 20 (male and female, but he only seems to want to befriend the female ones). The thing that bothers me most is that he was at one point convinced that there was something going on between me and his best friend and he told me 1) that he was jealous and 2) that I should leave him for him... and now this? I know he wouldn't like it at all if I decided I wanted to hang out with his friends one on one. In fact once his best friend invited me over so we could game just the 3 of us and he said he felt uncomfortable with it. I feel really conflicted about this situation and was hoping you guys could help me with that. \n\nI don't want to control who my friends are friends with so if THEY want to be his friend, who am I to get between that? But all those double standards are making me hella uncomfortable. AITA?",

      "description": "As a disclaimer, this did not happen recently but when I was in 8th grade so it’s more of a “Was I the asshole.” I’m just posting this because despite it only being a past memory, I am curious as to what you guys think or would’ve thought if I had discovers this sub four years ago.\n\nSo when I was in grade 8 I went to a birthday-sleepover party where all my close friends (of the time) were also. My one friend (who was 14) is not a fan of horror films and the movie we ended up watching was more so a thriller but basically a horror film, my friend doesn’t make a fuss and watched the movie in her sleeping bag like everyone else did. \n\nWe were about half way through the movie, by this point maybe a jump scare or creepy bit happened but I was a little bored so I was doing my own thing on my phone. I’m watching the movie again, but notice my friend isn’t in her sleeping bag, no big deal she probably just went to the bathroom. After a couple more minutes my friend is back in the basement, only she brought the host’s mom with her and she told us how [friend] was scared and that we had to turn the movie off.\n\nI was indifferent about it, albeit agreed with the others in being annoyed with my friend from getting the movie shut down. No one was really mad at her per se, just frustrated that she went straight to the parents without letting any of us know, because as far as we knew she was fine and we thought if she at some point didn’t like what she was watching that she would go I her phone.\n\nSince this happened so long ago and was not a huge deal, I’d be okay with being the asshole. I personally think my friend made it a little about her, but that’s up for discussion.\n\nSo, was I the/an asshole?\n\nTL;DR: couple years ago was at a birthday party, friend got scared while watching horror movie, went to the parents without telling anyone, and ultimately got the movie turned off and everyone got pissed at her.\n\nAlso probably not the case, but if anyone was wondering the movie was 2009’s “The Uninvited”",

      "description": "My dad and I  have had a very rocky relationship for the past few years of my life. While he lived with my mom he was very aggressive and would often beat her  to prove a point. This happened until my mom finally had the courage to kick him out. I've lived with my dad for 6 months with his new wife \"they married after 1 year of being in a relationship\"  I was kicked out after I accused her of stealing my 80$ I had for a school trip. I returned to living with my mom after that. From that point on I would only stay with him on weekends. \n\n\nBack in May I became a victim of my dad's violence. While I was at his apartment I had a mixup between his and mine Xbox and took the wrong one.  When he came to my mom's house he shoved the Xbox into my chest . I took it to the top of the stairs and placed it next to the couch. I went back down the stairs only to be met with his anger. He began throwing insulting me and my mom for a few minutes. I had enough and told him to get out as I slammed the door. Bad move. He kicked  the door back in and began to place me in a choke hold on the ground. I managed to flip myself over and kick him in the jaw. My dad got furious and began scratching and punching me at full force. While he had me on the ground he told me that he would have no problem ending my life right there. It took the neighbors and my mom to make him get off my body. We called the police and cps began and investigation. Like usual they returned with nothing and allowed him have custody over me. In September he \"apologized for his actions\". I didn't buy a single word of it. I felt like he was trying to set me up. \n\nLast weekend while I'm over there I find out he's getting married on December 1st. I then find out that I'm the best man.  My question now is AITA for not wanting to go to his wedding because of his past actions.\n(Sorry for my many grammatical errors.

      "description": "  \n\nFirst some background, I am a Disabled Vet with PTSD that manifests as anger, that is how I came by my handle. \n\nMy son who is in his young 20s, had his 1st car accident last week.  Ever since the accident, my wife and son have been taking the word of the insurance people over me. Case in point, I told them to request a mobile adjuster to come to the house, so we have positive control of the vehicle until we sign it over to them, did they listen, no it is sitting in the lot of a local body shop.  We got word that they totaled the truck last night, now my son and Wife want to me go to the body shop (because my son works during their business hours) and pull all the Stereo Equipment that my son and I installed for Christmas. When I asked my son if he remembers what all tools, we needed to get the stuff out, he said no. When I said, that if the truck was still here, he could do it when he got off work, and I would not have to drag half my installers tool box with me and work in the cold, I was called an Ass.\n\nThe final straw, was when we were going over vehicles for sale, and came across an ad for a 2013 New Beetle. He said we should sue them for false advertising. When I asked why, he said because the 2019 model is the new beetle. I told him that it was VW that calls that body style the new beetle, to which he wanted to argue with me. When I spun my laptop around to show him where Wikipedia shows every beetle made since 1998 was classified as a new beetle, I was called an ass and he walked away. \n\nAfter I calmed down, I decided that maybe, since they where not listening to me, I would just remove my self from the situation. Besides, they have asked my dad (who knows several people in the used car business) to help, this would be another stressor (not bad one, but one none the less), so I know they are in good hands. When I told my wife this, this morning, she said I needed to get a grip, that my son is going through something and I was just being an ass because I was not getting my way.\n\nSo Reddit, I know I can be an ass but, am I an Ass(hole) for wanting to remove myself from a situation that I see is full of PTSD triggers?",

      "description": "I got accepted into my dream school in another state. But my family was too poor to afford residence, and I was totally okay with going to a school in my city. But, my mom has a family friend who agreed to let me stay with her, RENT-FREE.\n\nShe's been kind of like a \"motherly\" figure to me in a way, while I'm away from my actual mom. She's 31, but looks way younger. I am grateful to stay with her rent free, and grateful to stay with her period. She's that bitch.\n\nI don't have a specified \"curfew\" but honestly I hav no business being out in NYC at 2am in the morning. It stresses us both out if I'm out too late, so I always come home around midnightish. She told me that she'd prefer if I was home by then, and I respected that. But it wasn't like a \"rule\". \n\nI told her that I was going to the library overnight to study for midterms. But I was actually going to a club for St paddy's, and I just got a fake. I didn't want her to know because I didn't want to deal with her lecturing me, and it's honestly not her business what I do on weekends. I don't even drink. I just wanted to have fun with some friends. Midterms are stressful and I miss my family so bad. \n\nLong story short, I ended up bumping into her at the same club. She was beyond pissed off at me for being there and lying to her about. I would have understood her being upset that I lied (it's not very mature), but then she lit into me about being 18 in a new state and how I was being \"dumb\". Then she told ME WE WERE GOING HOME. But I wasn't shitfaced or anything. I didn't hookup with anybody. I was totally sober and taking care of my drunk ass friends.\n\nI told her that she wasn't my mom and she couldn't tell me what to do. She told me that I was lucky that she didn't call my mom.  I was over it, and took a separate uber home and told her to stay. \n\nShe says that I'm still her \"responsibility\" and that if I'm living under her roof, rent free, I need to respect her \"rules\". But why is she upset that I'm going out to a club? Lots of 18 year olds go out clubbing? Some of my friends were still 17 at the start of the semester and they were clubbing. I just feel like, because I am an adult. She should treat me like one. Calling my mom on me? That's childish. \n\n**BUT THE GAG IS**\n\nI have a sister who's 25 and visited NYC last year. THEY WENT CLUBBING TOGETHER. So she can club with my older sister and get fucked up. But I can't? The only thing that's her saving grace is that it isn't legal yet for me to go clubbing and drink. ",

      "description": " ~ first off sorry for the grammatical errors ~\nIm 14 at the moment and me and my bff are in the same class. We are completely different but still somehow matched. The story got a start last year at the beginning of a school year, I was totally cool with her hanging out with others and that's not really the problem but after Christmas a stuck up boy \" the class celebrity \" started saying mean comments about me. Almost everyone was trying to be his friend but I never have a shit about him. Even my bff was starting to buy him whit food.\n\nShe usually just said No you can't get any food from me (we used to share n stuff like a bit from me bit from hers) and she just started throwing me off. Next moment I see her give the hole pack to the stuck up ass. I didnt get it at all, was someone who is a total arase acnologement better than actually caring for your \"Bff\"?\nHe does not even friend you unless you're under his armpit. \nI started getting jelous as you can guess.   \n\nA few weeks go by and this boy starts saying rude stuff behind me for example I'm a whore and that I wear clothes from my dad's old closet. (I don't and if I did they would be comfy as hell) wich I then just laughed off. She was the one to tell me what he did and I was pissed since I knew she laughed at it. She never stood up for me anyway. And today was just worse. \n\nThe first class started with a birthday boy being announced and we wrote in the card for him. Since j was before the \"bully\" I didn't see what he wrote. After the class had ended NO ONE SAID THERE WAS A MEAN COMMENT ABOUT ME! He had written im a slut on the  card and I felt so bad. My bff again completely NORMALY said that he had written that. ( I was never in his way ) \n\nMy best friend... is stucking up to a guy who is calling me Like that... she went to a trip and promised to bring me something(I wasn't expecting much) and she comes back with a kitty keychain (it was cute okay but defiantly something you don't bother to find) and to this boy she just brings a ton of candy?  (You guessed it I was jelous) she made me feel like she brought it to me out of pity and because I'm her \"bff\" not because she cared.\" \n\nI have started to become cold to her slowly and I feel like she wouldn't even care if I wanted to stop talking to her. (Considering I was litteraly bullied today next to her and she was silent)  I chose to talk about changing schools. She litteraly is leaving me behind and not inviting me anymore.\n\n Over a long time I won't cry if I'm being abused in any way more over I just feel like cutting my heart out. (Not just the mean comments)  and what hurts me the most is like she is pretending it's all okay. \n\n::: Aita for being jelous and mad over my bff for sticking up for my \"Bully?\" \n\n",

      "description": "(Throw Away because he would recognize my main)\n\nI (20 M) live with two other (20 M both). My one roommate, I'll call him James, and I have been noticing that the other roommate, Randy, has been getting more angry recently. A little background, we are all friends and share a room. So basically, Randy has always been moody, but recently it's been more frequently and more noticeable. In the beginning of the year, James got really sick and had a bad cough. Every time he would cough, Randy would let out an annoyed sigh. At first we thought it was just a coincidence, but after it kept happening, we realized it wasn't. We are in a group message and I sent a Reddit post that I found interesting. James and I responded back and forth and every time Randy's phone vibrated, he let out a sigh. His phone usually isn't on vibrate and we didn't think of it as a big deal. \n\nWhenever we go out, or have plans, we all have a set time to leave. James and I are ready at the time we specified, but Randy is always ready 10-30 minutes later than the set time. He gets angry if we stand up to leave, or say we are going to leave because we have work to do. Randy will get angry and say we have all day to do our work, even when James and I have to work. If Randy feels rushed he will get noticeably angry and just refuse to talk to us. \n\nOne example, we had a set time to go out to dinner and James and I were ready at the time we planned on leaving. Randy said he would be ready in a second after he finished his game. We said alright and let him play a bit, but James and I were talking with our shoes and coats on ready to leave. Randy got upset and said he would be a while. James and I looked at the game he was playing, and it was an offline game that could easily be saved and ended. After waiting 5-10 minutes for him I said something along the lines of \"dude you can pause the game, we won't be gone for too long\" and he got very upset and refused to talk to us the entire way to restaurant. \n\nSo Reddit, are we the assholes for getting annoyed by this?\n\n ",

      "description": "I've never posted before, so I'm sorry if I've formatted anything wrong. This might be a long post because a lot of backstory is required, but I just got into an argument with my brother over this, and I'd like to know your opinion of the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently a freshman at a college across the country from my hometown. When I was a junior in high school, my mom was diagnosed with a terminal illness. This disease includes the loss of use and control of limbs and basically all bodily functions, so it is a truly cruel way to die. In my opinion, it's one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. My mom only had about a three-year prognosis when she was diagnosed, so I am pretty sure she is going to pass away before I graduate from college. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my mom was diagnosed, my brother immediately transferred from the college he went to (which was about a 3-4 hour drive away from home) to go to the local college in order to help my dad take care of my mom as she lost the use of her limbs. I also helped out up until I left for school. When I was applying for college, my brother immediately told me that it was my duty to go to the local college and live at home to help the family. I was really conflicted, but, after my mom and dad told me to apply and go to the best school I could get into in order to get out of my extremely small, rural town and state, I decided to apply to a school I love across the country. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ended up getting into said school, which is literally across the country (like a 20 hour drive or a 5 hour flight) from my home, and, with my mom's encouragement, decided to go to the school and only see my family for holidays and the summer. My brother wasn't happy, but just last night he called me and we got into a huge argument about it. He called me a bitch and an asshole for abandoning my mom and dad and the needs of my family for my own personal gain, and he told me that I needed to put my education on pause to care for my mom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, if my mom had asked me to stay home and go to the local college I would have done it, without a doubt. Instead, she told me to go so that I could get the best education and, in her words, make something for myself, which I wouldn't be able to do if I stayed home. But with my brother telling me how selfish I am for leaving home in the midst of my mom's illness, I don't know if I made the right decision by leaving home. So, am I the asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot more to this story, and I've changed a few things and left a few things out so people I know don't think this is me, so if I have to update in the future I can.",

      "description": "So there's a lot of aspects to this, I'll try and cover them all. TL;DR at the end.\n\nThe reason I call her my sweetheart is because we haven't yet committed to a full relationship. I don't think either one of us is mature enough to handle a long-distance, but we've been talking over text and phone a lot. Both of us have broken out the L-word, so I have reason to believe it's a good chance this might develop further. I really, really enjoy talking to her.\n\nShe and I were in the same classes through middle school to the end of high school, so we know each other very well. In my final year of high school, I think she might have been romantically interested in me, but I had college applications and exams (we have those here, I don't know where else) so I never pursued the possibility. She's also way out of my league, so I always assumed wishful thinking too.\n\nI came to college in August, and she took a year off to prepare better. We got to talking in January, and discovered a lot of the relationship stuff shortly after. However we've decided to halt progress for now because of her imminent applications and exams, which are in May/June.\n\nSo my (engineering) college offers a program that's tailored specifically for her field (biology), and I have jokingly mentioned it to her a few times. She dismissed it on account of low future prospects and high college fees, but I have a few doubts about that. I did some research (because I'm insecure like that) and talked to people in my college enrolled in the course, and found a lot of paths that the course opens. She's also financially better off than me, so I found the fees issue strange at first, but I later reasoned that it's dependent on a number of factors I know very little about. However, I still think she hasn't thought this through as a viable career path and is dismissive of it. I won't deny that I have a selfish interest in this.\n\nTL;DR: She and I are engaged in a relationship in all but name, and she will be choosing a college these coming months. I'd like her to apply to a course in my college, but she doesn't want to on account of low prospects and high fees. After legitimate research, I found that she's grossly underestimating the prospects, and I'd like her to rethink this conclusion. I won't deny that I have a selfish interest in this.\n\nNow, I respect this woman in every way and stand by every decision she makes, so I will have no issues if she chooses to reject my suggestion after being aware of the facts. All I want to do is make her aware of them. She probably won't change her mind, but I'd still like to try.\n\nSo, Reddit. WIBTA for talking to her about this?",

      "description": "My wife graduated college last week, and I am supremely proud of her. I told her so, and showered her with praise, love, and encouragement that she’ll do well in her graduate program and in the job market. I took her to the next city over last weekend and we went to Panera to celebrate. It was meant as a day trip to do something fun to celebrate. We’ve been struggling lately and I’d bought her roses the week before, so instead of repeating that I decided to try to be sweet and take her to a restaurant I know she likes. \n\nShe told me tonight that she’s upset because a couple of years ago before I’d met my wife, I went to a female friend’s graduation who lived in a different state and brought her flowers for her graduation. She’s upset because she feels like the way we celebrated makes her feel, in her words, undervalued. I told her that while I understand her feelings, I feel like she’s being rude and ungrateful for comparing the two situations. I sincerely tried to be sweet and loving and celebrate with her, and I feel like it’s not her place to complain that I didn’t do more. \n\nSo be honest with me. Is she ungrateful, or AITA? \n\nScreenshot of her explaining her feelings:\nhttp://imgur.com/Sd099tV",

      "description": "I'm currently taking a statistics class, which requires me to collect data by asking X amount of people a question that can be responded to with a numerical answer. \n\nSince beginning the class, I've used Instagram and Facebook as a platform to ask my questions, with really good results. People have been quick to respond and I gather my data fairly quickly. \n\nI keep the questions really impersonal, like \"How many cars have you owned in your life time?\" \n\nMy recent project requires me to ask 2 questions and see if there's a correlation between the data. \n\nI wanted to keep it in my interest so chose to ask how often people purchased a prepared lunch at work or school in a week and how often they exercised  in a week. For the purpose of this I specifically defined exercise as 15+ minutes of a physical activity that is done for the sole purpose of improving your health or well being. I kept the bar pretty low in hopes it would get more people to participate.\n\nI really hesitated asking  this in fear that I would get accused of being fatphobic or of being insensitive, but felt that if people wanted to respond they would, and if they didn't they wouldn't. \n\nI got a few responses that kind of made second guess myself. Like someone prefacing their answer with \"this is sad but...\" And someone posting the classic admiral ackbar meme \"it's a trap!\".\n\nSo AITA or am I just over thinking this? \n\nI did realize that most people who don't exercise will probably not respond due to social shame, so I did reword the question so it's geared towards only people who do exercise, but I still feel weird.\n\nTl;Dr AITA for asking people how often they exercise, on social media, in order to collect data for my stats class.",

      "description": "I want to start this out by saying I never had a dad to be there for me. I learned that life is not fair after my sister hated me and my mother never cared for me. \n\nWhen I was 16, my sister moved out of the house at 18 to go to college, and I was stuck at my house with my mother. I was constantly depressed and my mother did not care about me. So I was basically living alone so I needed to get a job to support myself. I learned to not rely on anyone and that affected me in my adulthood. \n\nAs soon as I got enough money from my part time jobs, I bought an apartment in a far away city. I was hoping I was going to be able to get a life now. \n\nI got a wife and a child and moved into a bigger house. Then all the sudden my mom calls me. She asked me to visit her because she missed me. Keep in mind I have not seen her in years. I told her to fuck off and I wanted her out of my life. I cut every single bit of contact with her and my sister because she was not there for me. \n\nMy only question is am I in the right for doing this?",

      "description": "I haven't decided what to do here yet, and I feel like anything I do that is not outright fully supporting her in this endeavor will really upset her.\n\nSo my sister has three boys (two from a previous relationship and an infant son with her current husband), and also three stepdaughters her husband brought into the relationship. She always had said that she just wanted to have one baby that was theirs, but has not really been able to get past her gender disappointment that that one baby was, in fact, another boy.\n\nShe has always wanted a daughter. Becoming a bonus mom to three girls did not satisfy that desire. Another baby wasn't what she wanted, she wanted a daughter. So she has decided that she wants to have yet another baby but isn't willing to leave it up to chance this time--she has decided she wants to go the IVF route in order to select the sex of this next baby. She is not even remotely willing to consider that this not an entirely rational plan (let alone ethical). She is entirely unwilling to adopt because she wants to ensure she \"knows the baby's history\" and has what seems to be excessive concerns about behavior issues coming from an adoptive situation.\n\nShe's asked me to come along to the consultation with whatever fertility doctor she's found to help her out with his plan because she's concerned that her husband would not pay enough attention or help her ask the right questions/retain the information given.  I...am not sure that I am on board with this. I love her and will love a niece regardless of how she came into the family, but I really feel like this is not the right way to accomplish this goal of \"getting her girl\".\n\nShe and her husband definitely do have substantial financial means to comfortably raise an additional child and also to fund whatever method she would pursue here.  She had a pretty traumatic pregnancy and delivery with her most recent baby, right before that one they had a loss that was a girl (which she never really properly processed or grieved), and does not seem willing to believe that IVF is not just this simple thing you do once/that she might have a difficult time finding a doctor willing to go this route with her to begin with. \n\nSo...would I be the asshole if I wasn't all-in-fully-present with my support for my sister while she tries to find a way to have a biological daughter?",

To my surprise, my very unathletic parents said yes. \n\nThe GF had plans to get everyone a matching hat or something fun to wear.

I told her that I didn't think we should do this as GF might feel excluded. There are no immediate plans for GF to marry FIL.

      "description": "I work as a host at an arena during sporting events. In our club, which caters to hog paying clients, there are hosts and food services staff members. We essentially work together but have completely different managers. \n\nAs a host, I’m responsible for who comes in our club. We have been instructed that if people do not the have he correct ticket then they aren’t allowed to be there. Simple. \n\nEver since the season started, the servers have, on occasion, brought family and friends to eat in this space. (I should mention that dinner for one night costs nearly $80). At first I assumed they had some sort of agreement with their side of management and I didn’t think too much of it. They were so cavalier when it came to bringing them in I just assumed it was okay. It’s also my first year and wasn’t sure what the protocol was for previous years. Many of them have been doing this job for years and I wrongly assumed they were going by the book. \n\nA few nights ago one of the servers approached me and said her husband was coming and asked if we could write his name on the list. Still thinking it wasn’t really that big of an issue, we wrote his name down. Later that night our manager came down to our club. He looked at the list, as he usually does, and asked who this person was that we had written down. We told him and he immediately asks if they have the proper ticket. Of course they don’t, so he continues to grill us on why they are there. We try to explain that the servers told us that it’s okay... \nHe tells us that it’s 100% not okay and asked me to send him a detailed description of the situation so he could send that email to the other members of management. Which I did. \n\nHe later responded to my email and said that he had spoken to the food services manager and the staff was reminded about the policy. \n\nFast forward two days. We are all at work and one of the food services employees approaches me and says he has a bone to pick with me. He continues to question what I did and says that I’ve ruined the relationship between the hosts and servers. I told him that I wasn’t willing to put my job on the line for them and risk my reputation by turning a blind eye. He said “nobody would’ve ever known..” (which isn’t true. My manager looks at the list each night and asks us questions about the guests that came in). \n\nSo now they’re mad with us because they can no longer do something they knew they shouldn’t be doing. I apparently broke an unwritten rule and should’ve kept my mouth shut, even though this could’ve been something that could get me fired. \nAITA?",

      "description": "Let me preface this by saying I have upmost respect for everyone in this post. We're generally one happy family.\n\n\nTo begin, I made the mistake of moving relatively close to in laws. They promised privacy and basically stomped all over that promise for years. Husband wouldn't stop it. My child comes along and it became exponentially worse. This was meant to be a short term move. \n\n3 MINOR examples:\n-had a newborn and couldn't get any rest because in laws would constantly knock on my door everyday for a visit ( at least 10 times per day), or for something as silly as \"saying hi\". No call. Nothing.\n\n-certain people who constantly visit in laws somehow manage to walk over to our family home for a visit. No call. No notice. Nothing.\n\n-i spend 1 month in a local hospital when bub was 8 months, of which  in laws hardly acknowledged but they spent the whole month with baby at my house. Only 1 person visited / contacted. \n\nNow that bub is growing , I want to spend lots of time teaching them about the world, but here's the kicker, siblings in law find any excuse to drive to our neighbourhood on the pretense of \"visiting parents \" (who are unfortunately sick) and will basically take over a significant portion of my family's weekend. Every weekend. And they're super loud!!\n\nEven if SIL kids are around, they are still close enough that my child will hear them, and I've basically lost their attention bc they just want to play with the other kids. Essentially, between work and these constant visits, I have zero quality family time.  For privacy, I have to physically leave the house and that's unfair. \n\nHusband doesn't see an issue at all, he's turning a blind eye because it's his family and it's driving a massive wedge between us. For 6 years i have asked for him to lay privacy boundaries and I'm finally contemplating separation. He won't attend counselling, I've asked for years. \n\nNote 1: hubby is an amazing husband and father, he does defend himself by honing in on my so-called personality weaknesses. \n\nNote 2: My aim isn't to cut anybody out at all, but I want to reduce the frequency of the impingement to regain family time because these are a child's formative years and I'm losing time. \n\nAll I want is for us to have more quality family time and notice of these visits.

      "description": "I work at a legal assistance office, an entity that provides free legal care for people that can't afford it, and have an immediate need for some sort of action or consult. We have very objective (specially financial) parameters that define whether one fits into the definition of \"requiring assistance\". It's voluntary work and we deal mostly with people that have their financial and social needs barely - or not at all - satisfied.\n\nSo, come today, in comes a guy in his apparent 30's.\n\nNothing stands out about him, and his situation is rather interesting - for legal nerds, in comments.\n\nAs we spoke, some eyebrows began to raise. He was a very highly educated man, with a masters in microbiology (pretty much the right guy for the job), and a teacher. Unfortunally, grossly underpayed teachers are not a complete rarity in my country, and he stated he was completely supporting his mother who lived with him. And the free public higher edu is a partial reality here.\n\nThose parameters do take into consideration higher income people who support others, like family. It's not the point to exclude whomever, but to guide the service (that we already cannot provide to all that need) to those in most dire need.\n\nIn the end of the conversation regarding his case, as we were lining up what we were going to do, we started asking the regular questions like: \"do you have your tax declarations from the last years?\" \"can you bring us your bank statements?\" *and his answers were reaaaally shady*. \n\nWe're used to dealing with very poor people. People that don't have bank accounts, that have never made a tax statement in their lives, some that can barely afford to take the bus to the office. We do our absolute best within our capacity to be the smallest strain possible on those people, because, bottom line, **they really fucking need it**. But this guy starts saying things like \"but my older tax statements have bigger salaries\" and \"i have large ammounts (70k ish!!!) in investments\". This was a biig no no for me. Last week we were discussing a lady whose home lot was being invaded by her neighbor and she couln't afford to raise a small fence between their lots. This guy has thousands in money stored?!\n\n**We do not turn away people who had money, and became impoverished**. But *HAD* is the defining word in that sentence. In the past! Regardless of him supporting his (small) immediate family, to me he has absolutely left our criteria. He's brought us a paycheck from a job that would clearly put him inside that financial criteria, but that doens't seem to be relevant, considering he still has those large reserves.\n\nHe's returning next week bringing the documents we asked, his bank statements, etc, proof of his financial situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for recommending our supervisor that he doen't get aid, and we move on to other cases?",

      "title": "AITA for threatening to throw out my roommates dishes?",
      "description": "So, I’m a college student and I live with two other people in a triple room. In our room there is no kitchen, but there is a communal one upstairs. I can’t cook and mostly uses my meal swipes, and because of this I didn’t bring my own dishes, and the same goes for one of my other roommates. However the third person, I’ll call him M, did bring his own dishes from home and stores them under a nightstand next to his bed. Now he said the dishes could be communal and because of this I would occasionally borrow a plate for when I would reheat food, or a fork, or a cup. However I made the point that we should wash our dishes immediately after use in the upstairs kitchen, something M agreed too. \n\nNow flash forward in time, M rarely washes his dishes and lets them pile up, along with this neither M or the over roommate; A, are particularly clean people. In all fairness I am also pretty unorganized, but I definitely value cleanliness over both of them, and M is fine with out right messes, and because of this I end up doing 90% of the vacuuming and cleaning in the room. This is annoying, but I for the most part bite my tongue. However regularly dirty dishes are left about and I ask M to clean them, eventually I stop seeing them left about so I assume everything is fine. Now at some point I’m getting a dish to reheat food, and M tells me that that dish is actually dirty, and I find out that over the last few weeks I have been eating from dirty dishes (in all fairness I only used his dishes maybe 5 times in those weeks). See it turns out that M had been storing his dirty dishes on a bottom shelf near his bed, and his clean ones on the bottom of the night stand, and he claims I should have known they were dirty as they weren’t under his nightstand. However since he handn’t washed any of his dishes there were no dishes under his nightstand, so I just assumed he moved his dish storage to the shelf. Both M and A found this funny, but I was pretty pissed and I told him he needed to wash his dishes and I stopped using his all together. A ends up agreeing and says that it kind of gross that he hasn’t washed them. \n\nI mentioned this dishes in passing over the following month, but with finals I forgot. However now a month later they are still not washed and sitting next to his bed. Now the events that follow I think need a bit of explaining, but basically I am admittedly a hot headed person and there is one point of contention between M, A, and a I: Money. A’s dad is a moderately famous architect and M’s mom pulls in close to seven figures a year, while my dad is unemployed and my mom does newsletters for a church. Because of this I am regularly stressed about money going to a 4 year university, and do experience underlying jealousy to my roommates, especially M, who gets a school year allowances of $10,000 for recreation/ food, and uses it all, mostly on going out to eat regularly. I decided to treat myself the over night and ordered a pizza because I was pulling an nighter for a final. I put my leftovers in M’s mini fridge (which he said was communal), and left for class. Now according to M I left the fridge ajar, while I am indistent that I closed it, but either way he ended up throwing out my pizza because he believed they would have gone bad. (I should note that M and A have a history of leaving uneaten pizza out and I have yelled that them for this claiming they could get sick, but I have never thrown it away without asking, and normally they leave them on A’s desk which is directly across from my bed, which leads to my bed stinking of pepperoni, and being someone who keeps Kosher, it only makes it grosser for me. However door ajar or not, my pizza as in the fridge). Now I’m pissed about this, and I’m even more pissed because M ordered a new Pizza for himself while I was in class. He does offer me some, but it’s pepperoni so I decline. However I rarely have the money to go out to eat, so the fact that 20 dollars worth of pizza and breadsticks was tossed just puts me in a bad mood. \n\nAnd that’s what leads us to today, maybe it was the pizza incident, or just me being exhausted from finals, but it’s been over a mo Th since my roommate has washed the dishes, and they are still piled on his bottom shelf next to the bed. I ask him to wash his dishes, and he says he’ll get to it next WEEK, after finals. I loose my shit and tell him to wash them and it’s disgusting. M says they are his dishes, and we haven’t got bugs, besides I can’t see them from my bed (I can), so why does it matter. A agrees that it’s disgusting, but he also says it doesn’t matter. I again say it’s disgusting, and since M was playing video games last night he clearly has time to wash the dishes. He once again says he’ll get to them in a week, and that he needs to work. I end up grabbing his dishes and tell him I’ll go wash them, and he once again asks why it matters. I don’t know why, but I loose it and I tell him that I’m not going to continue to clean up after him and I’m throwing his dishes out unless he washes them right now. He screams at me that it’s his property. But I mean he hasn’t used them in weeks and they hav built up gunk, I also don’t say it, but like he has money to buy new dishes, so if he isnt going to care for the ones he has he can just get new ones. M calls me an asshole and again says it’s his property. I mention the pizza which he claims is an unfair comparison. He ends up angerly taking the dishes from my arms and takes them upstairs to th kitchen. He comes back a minute later, so I can assume he hasn’t washed them yet, and hasn’t talked to or A since. \n\nSorry for the long post, it’s my first time posting here, and I’m not much a of a writer, so I don’t know what is necessary information or not, but AITA?

I'm an artist myself and I understand that it's immensely important to value people's creative efforts and to pay for their time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, being an artist, I'm super fuckin poor lmao.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now (literally right now) I'm trying to start a digitally published magazine for poetry, photography, and short fiction. I am doing this entirely by myself, and I'm wondering if it's reasonable to reach out to people who I know are amateurs/unrecognized photographers and such to try to get a front cover photograph....without paying for it, at least for the first issue.  This would literally be one of those \"but the exposure!!\" kinds of things.  With just that, I think i'm the asshole, but there's some context for how these magazines generally work and how I will be structuring it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-submitting to a magazine with your work often requires you to pay $3-5 and does not guarantee that your work will be accepted and published\n\n\\-you often are not paid even if it is published for non-huge, nationally recognized magazines.  I've personally been published eight times and have paid a total of like $100 to submit everything and have not seen a cent back (though now it's on my resume, in my author's bio, and it's valuable experience).  \n\n\\-the magazine I'm starting will be partially devoted to charity (20-25% of all profits to a different charity every issue)\n\n\\-I'm planning to, if I reject submissions, offer critiques of the work submitted so that the submission fee doesn't feel like money in the trash\n\n\\-basically, the cover-art-submitter wouldn't be any less paid than anyone else in the entire magazine for the first issue. all accepted submitters get a copy of the magazine for free for themselves and their friends and family, of course\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? or am I just playing into an asshole system? Is there any non-asshole way to go about saying \"hey, you know that work you have put into this product? can I have it for free in exchange for publicity?\"   Is it non-assholeish specifically because reaching out to them and featuring their work is validation of their efforts?",

      "description": "Last night, I went on a night out with my best friend. After we’d been there a couple hours, she told me she was getting a drink, then never came back. \n\nI really freaked out and probably overreacted - she’s never disappeared without a word before so I genuinely thought she’d been drugged or something and I was really scared because I couldn’t find her at all. I called 111, which is like our non emergency service who directed me to apparently a non emergency police line. They asked what happened and I told them and they said they’d check her house. \n\nIt’s morning now, and she’s fine and tells me she just went home with someone, which I’m kind of angry with her for because she didn’t say anything to me at all and it was just us two out. She just left me and I waited for her for ages. She said she didn’t say anything to me because I ‘always get upset with her’, which is true because I’ve always thought it was a bit of a dick move to go out on the pull when you’re only out with one other person. That could be me being unreasonable though. \n\nIt turns out that the police woke up her entire house, removed and reattached her door, and changed her lock. She’s in a lot of trouble with her flatmates and her work and she’s really angry with me for getting the police involved. We both have bpd and we’re both fairly prone to having dramatic emotional reactions to things so I guess, did I overreact to her ditching me? Am I the asshole for getting the police involved?",

I've come to consider him a good friend and I told him I'd like to meet him eventually. He lives in the states and I live in Canada. My friends know about him and my boyfriend knows about him. They don't know much because it's a pretty casual relationship and there's not really any reason to talk about him regularly. \n\nAnyways I told him I'm pregnant today and he asked if he could send me a pair of sweatpants. I told him it was sweet but I wasn't comfortable giving him my address because I live with my boyfriend and I didn't want to explain to him \"yeah my online friend from Chicago wants to send me pants\" I know he wouldn't be comfortable with me giving someone he considers random his home address. If I lived by myself I'd be like \"yeah dude thanks.\"\n\nObviously it came off the wrong way because he said I've invalidated him and he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. He told me to enjoy my overprotective boyfriend and boring life. I apologized to him and told him I understand that he's upset but I can also see my boyfriend's side of not wanting someone he doesn't know having his address. I could have just said nothing to my boyfriend and just accepted the gift but I feel like that would be going behind his back. Not that the relationship is anything but platonic. \n\nI just feel like I've ruined our friendship over such a silly thing and I feel really bad. But I also don't think it was unreasonable for me to not want to give out our address. ",

      "description": "I've been dating a doctor for eight months. In that time he's told me that he used to casually smoke but quit, and I made it very clear that because of my asthma I wasn't able to be around people smoking or even second-hand smoke from clothes without coughing and having my sinuses clog up. He swore up and down that he was through, that it was just a phase, etc. and understood that I wouldn't have started dating him if he hadn't stopped. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYesterday I was supposed to meet him in his office and we were going to go out for lunch. I'm always early anyway, and because there was no traffic I arrived much earlier than even I normally would. And there he was, standing by the street and lighting up. I got out of the car and he had a the world's biggest \"Oh shit\" look on his face. I don't really know why I got out. Maybe it was so that I could see it for myself up close, but as soon as he dropped the cigarette and started walking toward me I turned around and got back in the car, telling him that he needed to leave me alone. At that point I was really upset, and the driver was willing to let me stay in the car for a few hundred feet so that I could get away from the crazy doctor repeatedly yelling my name. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe rest of the day he called me until I finally texted him \"Please stop calling me and don't drive by my house. I'll call you when I'm ready.\" His son has called me and texted me in that time and I've taken those calls. I just said that his dad and I were going through something and I needed some space. His son's concerned that we're going to break up and has flat out said that he doesn't want us to. But now I'm questioning everything. If he's willing to lie to me about this then what else has he lied to me about? This seems to be the type of behavior that addicts engage in, and I'm just not sure I can stomach it. It's doubly painful because he's a *medical doctor* and should be able to understand where I'm coming from and the health risks involved for both of us. On the other hand, I'm highly invested in this relationship. We've said that we loved each other, talked about getting married, and I obviously have a good relationship with his son. I don't know if this is a huge red flag and I should just break up with him now or if it's something that I should work try and work through. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm an asthmatic and my boyfriend swore up and down that he didn't smoke anymore. Yesterday I caught him smoking and am considering breaking up with him. ",

      "description": "I’m (male) currently working crazy shifts while my wife is currently on a week long spring break from nursing school. In the past 48 hrs I’ve worked 24, getting home this evening around 6pm. When I got home my wife was away visiting a friend. I texted her when I got home asking if she was having dinner with said friend, or if I should wait to eat so we could eat together...no response. I’m fat so I ate foods, I’m not super proud of the double bowls of Cinnamon Toast Crunch I gorged on but it happened. \n\nAround 7pm she gets home and asks “What do you want to do tonight!!?? Do you want to go out to eat? Or get food to go??” \nI tell her that I’d like to stay in since I’m feeling tired and wanted to watch a hockey game (I don’t watch much sports, but NHL playoffs are close and my team is close to making the playoffs).\n\nShe immediately shows displeasure in my response and heads out to get food. Before she leaves I try to explain that I don’t feel like going out and that I’d love to take her out tomorrow night since I get the day off. She proceeds to scowl and leave. \n\nAn hour later she returns in tears and tells me how disappointed she is in me, that I’d choose hockey over her. She then takes her food and eats in the bedroom while saying “it’s fine.” After eating she showered and went straight to bed without saying more than “goodnight.”\n\nI completely get that she wants to make the most of her week long spring break, I’d want to do the same. But she asked me what I wanted to do! And even suggested getting food to go and staying in! AITA for not going out with my wife?",

      "description": "One of my friends, let’s call her Sarah, asked me the other day to look at apartments with her for next semester. We live in dorms right now and in the fall we’re going to need a new place to stay, so I go with her. Sarah asks if I’d be one of her roommates, and I say yes, not thinking much about it.\nWhen I get home I start thinking if it actually is a good idea or not, and I start remembering all of the times her roommates complained about how loud she is, how she wakes them up in the mornings, has super loud sex, etc. I could probably deal with most of this stuff without causing issues, but both of our boyfriends are living together and I know it’s gonna drive me crazy if Im trying to catch a break at his place and she’s there.\nSo I call her, probably about 3 days later and say “hey I don’t think it would be a good idea if we lived together, I value our friendship and I don’t want it to suffer if we have any issues” I even put the blame on myself and told her how much my current roommates irritate me even though they do nothing wrong. \nShe took this surprisingly well, and even THANKED me for telling her how I feel. She said she agreed, and doesn’t want our friendship to suffer. \n\nWell, two weeks later my boyfriend gave Sarah and her boyfriend a ride and he told me she started talking mad shit about the whole situation. She was calling me selfish, that I should’ve told her sooner. I don’t know what all she said but for a good 5 minuets she was telling my boyfriend what an awful person I was.\n\nI don’t know what to do at this point. If I’m being a dick here I’ll go apologize and explain the situation better. But if I’m in the right- and shes still calling me names to my boyfriend, I don’t think I would want to be friends anymore. It seems a bit childish and unnecessary. I don’t know. I need to know I’m not being the asshole before I take any action. ",

      "description": "If context is needed, I go to a large university as a school, and while the usual model for students here seems to be to jaywalk whenever possible, I typically try to be as polite as I can to oncoming cars when they are in the vicinity. One thing that REALLY irks at me however is people who are on the phone when driving. I think it’s really unsafe and it consistently bugged me in the past when my parents did it, as I could see firsthand the effect it had on their driving abilities.\n\nSo I get to a specific intersection as I’m headed to class, a crosswalk where there is a yield traffic sign on a two way street, and as I’m walking across, I nearly have my body thrown into the air by a minivan that screeches loudly to a halt, barely staying behind the line to stay on their side, about 10 feet before the crosswalk.\n\nAs I took a glance at the drivers seat to get a look at my would-be murderer, I see a middle-aged woman, phone up to her ear, clearly looking as though she is in a hurry and couldn’t be bothered with my miniscule little existence.\n\nI felt like this was my chance to - teach her a lesson? - for a lack of a better term. I was still in a state of intense shock and sudden anger, so I made a big show of slowly waving at her, giving her my biggest smile, then putting an imaginary phone up to my ear, pretending to talk on it, and hanging it up, while fluidly turning the hung up phone into a middle finger directed at her. She gave me a look of intense rage and sped off after I completed the rest of my now fairly slow walk down the rest of the crosswalk. The whole thing took about 5-10 seconds, and I was going out of my way to generally waste her time/draw attention to her being on her phone as being part of a fearful experience for me.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Im thinking about breaking up with her because she is negative and depressed when I’m a relatively positive guy. We’re both in the 12 grade and she is always complaining about her future. I live in a 3 bedroom apartment while she’s in a mansion with rich parents and like 3 dogs. How can you be this gloomy when your living the good life? She’s also always threatening to kill herself especially when she wants attention because it bothers her that I talk to other people. She lets her friends walk all over her and when I tell her to be tougher she complains not to be that kind of person so if you are not going to do anything about it then why are you constantly goddamn complaining about the same shit!!!?\n\n I could break up with her later when we could see each other in school after Christmas break but wouldn't it be best if I just text her on her birthday as revenge? That’s pretty bad but bare in mind she is so annoying and she put me through all her emotional roller coaster meltdowns. She can’t let anything go, she would rather dwell on it and be sad about stupid shit. She is always talking about her troubled past. A lot of it sounds like bs because it all just seems like attention seeking and all her stories are a little too corny and played out like she took it out of a movie. \n\nThe bitch lacks self awareness. Let me give specific examples of futile “arguments” we have. I put the quotation marks on arguments because it’s not really arguments just her acting stupid. \n\n-We are talking in study hall about what career paths were gonna take. I bring up the fact that I might not go to state university I might just stay in community college because it’s cheaper and more convenient. She starts crying about how we agreed on Florida State Uni in the middle of class and makes a scene. \n\n-We are facetiming late at night when I fall asleep after she had been gone for about 1 minute to do something (I forgot). She comes back and finds me asleep. The next morning I ask her how her night was she completely over reacted and calls me a jerk and replies with “k” when she knows that’s annoying. \n\n-We rarely see each other outside of school because she lives far. I told her I can’t hangout with her that one time that she did want to hang out because I was going out to ball with the homies. She tells me that my friends “are dirt bags no offense”. She’s never met them before.\n\n-I don’t want to make this post too long so last point she tells her friends I am using her after I told her that we wouldn’t be together forever and this is just highschooo fun. I’m sorry to break it to her but I don’t plan on marrying her and having babies with her depressing ass. We friends tell me I should treat her better and I don’t know how lucky I am... She is the lucky one here and I’m the the one stuck with her. And this is just the tip of the ice berg with her.\n\nIt just feels like the whole relationship is me being a teddy bear she can cry on. We never even have any sex. She doesn’t send nudes  presumably because she doesn’t trust me (I know she has before). She’s always tired, or sad about a movie she saw years ago. I’m sorry about venting too long. So far I haven’t talked to her for 2 days I’m ignoring her texts and it feels liberating. I’m sure she’ll find another dude to torment. I’m just so sick of her shit. I don’t consider us together anymore but she thinks otherwise. I like her but I really hate her. Her birthday is today (currently 2:28 am she’s asleep). I don’t think breaking up with her on her birthday, after what she has done to me, would make me an asshole?",

      "description": "Abbreviations: CR cash register, SP supervisor, OM office manager, GM general manager. AD accounting department. AT accouting ticket. Sorry, long post.\n\nMy friend recommended me to the GM in a very popular hotels chain here in Mexico, so I took the job as a receptionist. At the end of our work shift we make a deposit to AD with the cash we charged that day. When we do the check-in to the clients, we ask for a warranty of 500 pesos (26 dollars), we make a ticket, we sign it and staple it to the bill, we return the money the check-out day. When a worker loses money, they make an AT and charge the money from the paycheck, they don’t ask for a cash reposition.\n\nOne day I checked the CR and noticed that $500 were missing, I didn’t charge in cash that day, so it wasn’t my fault, I talked to my OM he told me the missing money were SP’s fault, so she made an AT with SP's name on it. The next day I did a deposit to AD and checked the CR, it had more money than it should have, $500 to be exact. SP told me to save it on the CR, so I put a note with the date, my name and wrote SURPLUS money. The next day, SP told me the OM wanted to talk so we went there, OM was angry and yelled at me that one of my client’s deposit were missing and I needed to pay those $500, I asked how is that possible since I stapled the cash with the ticket and the ticket was there. SP said the AD called saying that there were $500 missing in my deposit, so SP took the warranty with my sign and sent it to AD to cover the mistake. I asked why and said that the money was from a client, he said the OM allowed it, I said I had a surplus money days ago and those were the $500 of the deposit, he told me he took the surplus to pay his missing money bc “the OM allowed so”. I told him it wasn’t ok, OM said “the surplus money isn’t yours, so I decided to use it to pay his missing money” I was angry but I calmed down and said “ok, do an AT and send it if you think it’s my fault”, she replayed “no, you must pay in cash”, “ok, I'll pay tomorrow”. The next day I didn’t show up to work, and I went to HR instead. I told to HR what happened, she sided with me, she was upset and called the OM to discuss the matter, OM told a few lies, but I called her out every time, she blamed SP about everything. The HR lady apologized to me and said that it wouldn’t happen again, I said “I know bc I want to quit right now”, she said they really need me in the team, but my decision was done.\n\nMy friend was disappointed because he never recommends people, my coworkers were mad at me for “exposing” SP and OM, the GM was angry bc I didn’t talk to him and skipped his authority, but in my mind, he would side with the OM. I feel like a quitting ass, but I don’t want to be on a place where things like that happens. AITA for quitting in the second week without talking to the GM?",

She doesn't go party too often, maybe 1 time a week or every other week.  I don't mind or care that she does party because  I do the same. The only thing that bothers me is that she wants to wear provocative/showy clothing. I don't want other guys looking at her boobs or ass.. She says that she does it for herself, not for others. At the same time she has clothes that she still looks hot in but it isn't showy (which I don't care) I don't care when she looks hot I just don't want her tits out. She also says that she's all mine, but yet she's showing herself off like that for other guys to stare. If I were truly hers why would she do that?   She's never worn clothes like that until college either. I don't mind when she wears clothes like that when we go out together because she says she does it for me.

So then she started to interrupt me, I told her to stop interrupting me because it's a pet peeve of mine and it's just manners, but she kept doing it, so eventually I snapped and yelled that she needs to let me speak because I was talking first, she said she doesn't care, so that got me angry.

English is my second language and I dont fully know to fully express what I'm trying to convey fully. \n\nSo my parents have been together for a near 25 years. And they've been good to each other for the most part. Yet for the past few years they've been getting into more and more fights one which had recently turned violent. So they've been talking about an divorce. \n\nSince I'm the current oldest one in the house they allowed me to be the final say in them being divorced. I said no. I understand that they dont want to be together anymore and would more than likely be happier without each other, but I dont want my younger sibling to deal with the stress of them being divorced. But I also have issues with their plans for after them getting divorced. \n\nMy father is a very high stress man and a perfectionist. He has extremely high expectations for my siblings and I. He throws fits when we dont meet his expectations. But he wants to move back to Mexico and take my younger sibling with him. My father is from a very rough place though and I do not want my sibling to live in that area. \n\nMy mother is someone who has used to take hard drugs and falls into depression alot. She now relies on marijuana a lot to get through the day. She also moves from one job to another alot and has trouble bringing in a steady paycheck. She usually leaves my sibling and I to our father. But if my sibling goes with her after a divorce I dont want them to be exposed to my or mother's drug usage. \n\nThere is also issues with money. Even with my parents combined paycheck it's very close with us living paycheck to paycheck. Both of my parents love my sibling and  I very much and I want my parents to be happy but I dont want my younger sibling to have a rough possibly emotionally/mentally abusive life with my father in a very rough area or to be exposed to my mother's drug usage and her unstable paycheck. \n\nI really just want the best for my younger sibling but and for them to have both parents but I dont my parents to be unhappy because I wont let them get a divorce until my sibling is old enough to take care of themself.

      "description": "I was driving my giant piece of s*** e250 van yesterday afternoon when I had to make a right onto a busy highway that went into a construction zone with only one lane open and had to immediately cross over three lanes of heavy traffic to get into the left turn lane to make a u-turn. People weren't being particularly cheritable in letting me over, so when I saw an opening that I could get into, I took it, and probably took it pretty aggressively. This did not sit well with the driver, who tried to close the gap and laid on his horn like it was the end of the world. This frustrated me, so I gave him the finger, at which point he swerved around me dangerously, got in front of me, slammed on his brakes, got out of his car, started reaching into my vehicle and asking me \"You want to get out of the car and do something?\" For the record, this guy looked like some roided-out extra that fell out of an episode of the Jersey Shore. I tried to calmly explain to him that the only reason I \"cut him off\" was because he tried to close the gap before I could get over, I had on my turn signal, and that we all had to drive here. He kept insisting that I get out of the car and do something and I assured him that I wouldn't do that, but that I would call the police and let them settled the issue for us, at which point he ran back to his car jumped in and cut several people off trying to get back into traffic. I know I shouldn't have flipped him off, but we need to be able to give people feedback sometimes, even if it isn't particularly constructive.",

      "description": "I was visiting a friend who lives in an appartement and has a medium sized dog.\nThey have a very large balcony where he is normaly kept when there are guests around because he always goes crazy when there are people he isnt familiar with in the house. I've been in that appartement a couple times before and once where the dog sat with us in my friends room without trouble, but my friend picked him up and let him smell me prior to that.\n\nAnyway what happened this time was that as i was leaving, my friend went to open the balcony door to let the dog out, (which was barking very loudly as he saw me leave)  and as soon as he opened the door, i heard the dogs claws hitting the floor and storming in my direction, (the elevator is inside the appartement, its like a penthouse) and i didnt know how to deal with that situation, so i ran to the elevator, smashed the buttons continuously hoping for the door to close before doggy gets to me. The door didnt close in time and the dog got to me, and i swung my leg with just enough momentum to \"throw\" the dog off me. My friend who was luckily just behind him running picked him up and went inside.\n\nThat was really awkward as i only knew the guy for like 4 months. I called him afterwards to apologize, he said he will take him to a vet to see if i damaged any of his teeth, which im pretty sure i havent because i didnt kick him hard enough to break his teeth. He said i have to pay if the dog needs any care. He didnt make any wheeping sounds when i hit him so i dont think he got hurt and besides i used to be scared shitless of dogs, but i got over it, still stressed me out when the dog was running towards me.\n\nShould i pay or is an apology enough ?",

He mentioned that there has been issues with roaches and over the months that I have lived here I have definitely seen it. I also have a BIG fear of roaches, like a full-blown phobia much the same way that people have phobias of spiders or snakes. I can’t even look at photos without feeling panicked of like I need a shower.\n\nA couple months into living here I happened to glance inside my neighbor’s apartment and saw a lot of stuff everywhere. I only saw a quick glance so I didn’t get a good look at everything that was there but it got me thinking that that could be where the roaches came from.\n\nFlash forward to today, I was frustrated because despite keeping my apartment incredibly clean I have had a significant amount of roaches in my apartment - mainly the kitchen. I called the complex and mentioned my neighbor’s mess and she said she would look into it. I immediately started feeling bad about it because my downstairs neighbor has some sort of mental disability and I’m not sure how capable he is of taking care of his apartment.\n\nSo, do you guys think I’m an asshole or is mentioning it justified?\n",

We have been planning for about 2 years and my sister accepted being my maid of honor as soon as I got engaged.  I had more bridesmaids than my fiancee has groomsmen.  About two months ago my fiancee asked my sister's husband to be a groomsman to help even out the sides.  My fiancee has only met him a couple of times and only put him in because we didn't have anyone else at the time.  Our bridal party also includes their three children.\n\nWe found out this week he has physically abused my sister.  He threw her to the ground and broke her hand.  I do not live in the same country as her so I do not see their relationship on a daily basis.  She has begrudgingly confirmed this happened but refuses to acknowledge it as a problem.  \n\nMy fiancee does not want him standing up there with us.  I do not want him standing up there with us.  My fiancee has since been in contact with an old friend who has come back into town and he would like to include this old friend and replace my sister's husband.  WIBTA if I called my sister's husband and and told him that we have found someone else to be in the wedding party?  And WIBTA if I was truthful about why we were removing him?  We would not be uninviting him from the wedding completely, just the wedding party.\n\nI believe there is a high likelihood my sister would refuse to come to the wedding meaning  the children would also not be there. It would also very likely cause additional drama in the family.",

I provide us a very good middle-class life (nice home in a nice neighborhood, decent cars, 2-3 vacations yearly, plenty of money for socializing, etc.).

She is always upset with me because she feels I should help her because I am just in the other room. \n\nI am upset with her because I feel that I am doing my job and trying to help with the kids which is affecting our income and my well-being. I usually stop working around 5ish and help her with dinner/bedtime and spend some time with the kids. \n\nI want to rent an out-of-home office. I can't handle this anymore I feel I am losing my mind. I know she is struggling too and we are looking into a part-time job for her with some daycare, but it will take a while. \n\nAITA for getting out of the house for 8 hours and leaving my wife with 2 screaming kids?

We were going to a party nobody had bought tickets for and we were pretty excited (and drunk). When we got there we couldn't get in (obviously) and so everyone got kinda sad...\n\n Except for me. You see, I don't know what exactly happens, but when I drink, I usually get every lever turned up to eleven and really can't stop laughing, making jokes and being jumpy in general. We had already gone out together a lot of times, but this was the first time something bad happened, and so they started getting fed up with me. After some time they all start treating me like an inconvenience, one of them almost got in a fist fight with me and the one friend who I was closest to yelled a lot of things at me.\n\nOf course this is the way I view how things passed, and since then I can't stop feeling like an asshole for getting on everyone's nerves, even though I feel that I acted how I always act when we go out and get drunk. I already apologized to everyone I've talked to since then, but I can't shake off this feeling.",

      "description": "I [26M] have been with my boyfriend [27M] for about 5 years. Over those 5 years he has gained a third of his initial weight. There's no denying that but I don't love him any less because of it. He has quit smoking and gained some weigt then, surpassing the 200lbs he already has. There's no denying the elephant in the room (no pun intended) because he has gained weight but in that moment it was reason enough for an argument. \n\nUp to this point his weight was never that big of an issue because he gained it very gradually. I love him and I'm attracted to him, emotionally and physically and understand that he went through a lot quitting smoking.\n\nYesterday during sex we were trying something new because we aren't the most adventurous in bad. The position we were trying out didn't work out much. He then made a comment and said, \"it's my stomach right?\". It didn't sound serious, he even laughed a bit. I grabbed onto it and said to him in a what I had assumed was an equally playful manner, \"yes it has grown quite a bit\". Now his stomach isn't easily to ignore, we cuddle I grab on to him and all that I love him and to me this wasn't different any different. He just about pushed my hand away, left the room and came back ranting. According to him I'm being an arse for rubbing staying in shape in his face and insensitive. We had the biggest argument we had in quite a few months. It was very upsetting because that wasn't my intention at all and because he barely allowed me to get a word. This was all yesterday night. What I have done from my perspective isn't any different from other instances, we joke around a lot and we say a lot worse things to each other than this. None of it is serious because it's all playful banter. I only confirmed to him what he said first. \n\nIn regards to me rubbing it in with my own weight, I struggle a lot with my own  weight. Differently than he does but in my teenage years all the way to my early twenties I have been dangerously underweight to the point I had to het hospitalised for it once and my old therapist constantly alluded to an eating disorder. I have an extremely fast metabolism and if it wasn't for a high calorie diet and a lot of exercise I'd still be a thin twink. \n\nSo, I'm at loss here AITA for confirming to him that he has gained weight?",

      "description": "Backstory:\n\nMy wife and I split up over a year ago. Pretty soon after, I reconnected with a “friend with benefits” from many years ago. Both her and I were in much better shape when we were first sleeping together, we’ve both gained a pretty significant amount of weight since then. The relationship this time has been heavy on the friends and less so on the benefits, though we do fool around from time to time. We’ve gotten really close, I’ve remained friends with her throughout several relationships (of hers) and been a confidant for her as well as her for me, and I’ve never tried to get her to cheat if she’s in a relationship. When she’s single though, I do make a move from time to time, and we occasionally knock boots. I love her, and tell her that, and she says she loves me too. I’m great with the friendship as is; I have no desire to be in a relationship. I’m enjoying being single for the first time in 6 years and have no desire to change that (not from a sleeping around angle, she’s the only woman I’ve slept with since my wife, it’s just the freedom to do what I want when I want). She’s made it pretty clear she would be very receptive to a relationship, but we’ve decided just to keep things the way they are. \n\nHowever, she recently had gastric bypass surgery and has lost a lot of weight. She looks amazing and is getting hit on like she was 10 years ago. She frequently complains that all these guys that would never give her the time of day are all over her and it frustrates her because she feels like everyone is treating her like she’s “just a vagina”. She makes the same comment about me when I make a move now. I’m a bit offended because I’m treating her exactly the same to her as I have for the duration of the friendship. I still go see movies with her, let her vent about work, friends, family etc, cook with her, call to vent to her and everything else, and we still occasionally make the double backed demon. Am I the asshole? Should I stop sleeping with her to show her she’s “more than just a vagina”?",

      "description": "My roommate told me about  two weeks ago that it makes her uncomfortable when I have the guy I am dating over sometimes. She said: 1. She doesn't like him staying on school nights (she's in college) because she feels weird getting ready in the morning when a man is in the apartment. And 2. She doesn't like him staying over on non-school nights because she likes to sleep in and her cat keeps her up all night, and this is somehow connected my bf? I am not really sure I understand that. But at the end of the conversation, she said to just give her a heads up on weeknights where I  am going to have him over. I think that's dumb since this is my apartment too, but I said I would do that.\n\nLast night I texted her on my way home from work and said, \"Hey I'm gonna have (bf) over later tonight. Just wanted to give the heads up since I  had him over this weekend.\" Her reply was, \"Okay np thanks for the heads up!\"\n\nI woke up this morning to get  ready for work, my bf stayed in my room the entire time while I made coffee and grabbed food for my lunch. Her door was cracked and I guess I  woke her up by moving around in the kitchen. She then sent me a text  saying that she didn't think it was fair that I had him over last night because I know it makes her uncomfortable, her cat kept her up all night, and that something woke her up this morning and this is one of  the few days she gets to sleep in (it's a non-school day). I replied and said that the cat keeping her up was not my problem, and it's not fair of her to tell me I can't be in the kitchen before I go to work in the morning, and that she had previously said it was fine that my bf stayed over.\n\nWe then proceeded to message each other back and forth while I was at work, and I honestly felt like most of what she was saying was contradictory. A lot of it had to do with  being woken up this morning (my fault, not his), and the fact that the  cat kept her up all night, which I still don't understand how that is  our fault? She then said she was just going to stay at a hotel until  finals are over in two weeks and I told her that she was being dramatic. She seemed to take offense to this but I refuse to apologize for any of  what has gone on.\n\nI know I am only giving my side here, but I really don't see how him staying over one  weeknight a week really affects much. The cat issue isn't on me, I can't avoid going into the kitchen before work, and she told me it was fine that he was over last night. I am at a loss for what to do, and seriously don't know if I am the asshole here for telling her she is  dramatic. AITA?\n\n\\------\n\n    TL;DR:  My roommate is mad that I had the guy I am dating over even though she  said it was okay the night before. I told her she was just being  dramatic and that I am not sorry she is upset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I do work but I don't want to work more than 15 hours a week so I still do alright at uni, plus my job is average. \n\nBut the problem is my parents are insisting I can't live at home anymore because I'm too old to live with them according to them. I sort of agree with them but I have plenty of mates my age (25) that still live at home with their parents, at least half of them do. Plus I don't know if I really have a choice because I don't think I'll be able to afford to live out of home. I think I'd only have to live with them for a year and a half assuming I get a scholarship for my PHD which I'd say I have a decent chance of getting. I really don't want to get a job when I finish my degree as I want to go into research and I study psychology and it's better to do postgraduate study usually.\n\nI don't know I'm sort of conflicted.

      "description": "I’m 16 and felt like cleaning the house again (It wasn’t that dirty because I cleaned it last week but I’m an anxious person and sometimes I just really wanna clean and listen to YouTube) so I was vacuuming and getting ready to mop.\n\nI was vacuuming the house and minding my own business when the vacuum stopped working. So I called my mom over and *attempted* to tell her that I just pulled on the cord so I might’ve accidentally pulled it out inside. She yells at me to let her talk and fixes it (it wasn’t what I thought it was) and she starts to go off on me about how I don’t know anything and I need to let her talk, even though I just was trying to say “Mom, the vacuums not working I think it’s because I pulled the cord too hard” but she was having none of it. I told her to “Go to your fucking room or something, just leave me alone. I don’t want your help I just wanna get this done with” then she started yelling that I’m a parasite. So I called her cute and left, meanwhile she kept interrupting anything I tried to say by yelling “PARASITE!”\n\nI sent her a text a few minutes later saying “When you apologize for everything you said I’ll continue cleaning the house. Until then I won’t take this abuse.” Which was probably dramatic but I was angry and feeling impulsive. \n\nIt’s a bummer because I actually was in the zone and wanted to clean, but I’m too prideful to go back down and let her think she got to me. She does stuff like this all the time and randomly goes off on me, usually for little to no reason. We haven’t fought at all today or had many interactions. I wanna clean but I’m kinda pissed that she treats me like this.  \n\nWas I being to quick to fire up? Too jumpy? Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I guess the title is pretty straightforward. Anyway, I (18M) started dating *early*, really early, although I'm sort of on a break from relationships as a whole. Either way I've had a few exes, none of which I have any contact with. Literally zero, the moment me and those girls broke up I sort of chose to fade them out of my existence completely.\n\nTo be brutally honest, I don't really acknowledge their existence. My closest friends don't even know the first names of any of the girls I've dated, bar one. I don't think I do it out of spite, it's just that they cease to exist or something in my eyes post-breakup. In my friend group this is weird, even the friends that had shitty breakups are still pretty friendly, the only exception is me. \n\nI physically can't understand having contact with an ex, let alone being friends, even though my friends think it's weird, and some have said I'm kind of an asshole for completely deleting my exes from my life, to the extent that I don't even mention their names. \n\nAre they right, am I an asshole for basically acting like my exes never existed the second we break up? I'm not hurting over any of these girls, it's just that they sort of faded into some random on the street after we broke up. ",

This is because there have been instances in the past where a girl he thought was “just a friend” was actually harbouring some major feelings for him. It truly has nothing to do with how much I trust him (I trust him implicitly) I just hate the idea of another girl thinking she’s being sneaky or pulling the wool over my eyes. I do not stop him from hanging out with other girls nor would I ask him to because 1) that’s simply not my place and 2) I don’t like that behaviour. He has said on multiple occasions that he has absolutely no problem with me hanging out with other guys one on one and that he doesn’t care because he trusts me. This frustrates me because I trust him but i am still uncomfortable. \n\ntl;dr: I feel weird about my boyfriend spending time with other girls that I don’t know alone.  ",

His ideas of them are from movies and his music. He also has ADHD and is bipolar.  \nAbout 2 years ago he asked me to read a story he wrote. It seemed like it was written by a 14/15 year old that just stumbled upon porn. He told me he wanted to animate it and put it on YouTube. He asked me to voice one of the characters. I turned him down. He was really upset about that. Like I had betrayed him.   \nHe also has been sending me his SoundCloud and asking me how good his music is. It's literally about fucking bitches and killing anyone who disses him. He is extremely tone deaf and has no flow when he raps. I let him know that it wasn't my kind of music.   \nThis past Christmas someone had the idea to buy him a $250 mic to record his music with. I told them that it's a terrible idea to let him think he is good. He can't handle me turning him down, why give him the hope when he's obviously going to get shot down?",

Now I had a seat on the bus for a while but as a student I give up my seat to other people as thats my schools expectation. But the entire time i had been on the bus this lady had been sitting in a 2 person seat by herself. Now when I get on its already full with many people normally standing and it really got on my nerves that this lady had the audacity to take up 2 seats. But when a lady who was deep into her pregnancy and her SO got on the bus it really annoyed me. after 2 or o minutes and no one had offered them or her alone i worked up the strength to ask her if she would get up and give her seat to the couple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats where i stuffed up. So i asked her politely if she would give up her seat so the lady didn't have to suffer with the pregnancy as badly. (Something along the lines of \"Excuse me ma'm would you mind giving up your seat so the lady over there could sit down so its a less unpleasant experience for her, if you could i'm sure they would greatly appreciate it) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently this was super rude and she got really offended and started shouting that i was 'fatphobic' and rude and that she would report this slight to my schools headmaster and get me suspended or expelled. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit AITA.",

I didn't know if I was in the wrong here so I decided to post on this subreddit. \n\nI joined this clan not too long ago for benefits, but got quickly attached to the community there as it had some very nice people, so I wouldn't say I'm too terribly new to the clan. But it all started when I was just talking to a individual there when the clan chat moderators decided to step in. (Clan Chat Moderator = CM)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCM: hey op stop spamming chat jesus\n\nMe: no :\\^) \n\nCM: bet\n\nCM: you have like 9 chat messages in a row\n\nMe: No I don't? \n\nCM:  jesus christ dude but you have messages with your name covered my screen thats spam\n\n(Keep in mind that i had like 3 messages with the other guy that I was talking to's chat messages on screen)\n\nCM: Keep it up op (I wasn't talking much at this time)\n\nMe: fuck off\n\nThis was when another chat moderator decided to escalate things and went to tell me \"Alright op, heres the deal, he asked you to stop spamming, so just consolidate your messages into one thought and sent it instead of splitting it into 3\"\n\nI obviously won't listen to something that almost everyone in this clan community did, just because only me and the other I was with were typing, so I went on to argue and that it shouldn't matter. This was when a third moderator that i was fairly close to stepped in and told me to stop. I kept on enforcing my opinion here until they decided to chat ban me for 1 and a half hours.  After this, the one i was close to went to PM me saying he was sorry. The other two, not so much. these two went on saying that I brought this upon myself and I just asked them if this was warranted for \"annoying the officers\". Then I was asking why it was annoying to them, and Their answer was \"Ignoring the fact you're wrong, if people ask you to stop, then you stop, is this such a foreign concept to you?\" and something along the lines of \"It's because we cant read anything else that other people post\" And I just snapped, like there was no other person in clan chat except us two and you decide you want to step in to tell me you're bothered because you can't read anyone else's messages? \n\nI'm pretty emotionally sensitive and I still regret talking back to the clan moderators, but I want to know if I'm 100% in the wrong here.",

      "description": "Sorry this is gonna be long! \n\nTLDR is basically in the title. \n\nSo a little background, my roommate loves my dog. He helps me out with my dog whenever I need it and in exchange I give him rides whenever he needs it (he hasn’t been able to drive for the last month and a half or so and we work in the same building at roughly the same time but i also give him rides to just do stuff like go to the store or do random errands). \n\nLast night I went out with friends for the first time in almost 6 months and I got pretty shit housed, spent most of the night basically herding drunk cats. So even though I had a fun night overall and everything worked out at the end of it, I was a little stressed and very very drunk. \n\nWhen I got home and walked inside, I didn’t see my dog who is normally right at the door crying for me, just my roommate (sober) who was watching tv on the couch. And then I heard my dog scratching at the back door (no big deal, I have a 40 ft leash outside for him so he can run around outside and go potty alone) but when I opened the door, there was no leash on him. We live right next to a fairly busy road. It’s one of the main roads in our neighborhood and my dog is light colored but pretty small, 20lbs. \n\nThen I started freaking out. I dont remember how i started yelling but I know he said “oops I left the sliding door open I guess he just wandered out” and next thing I know I was screaming at him. He said the dog was outside for maybe 10 mins (so i assume, he was outside alone near the road for probably anywhere from 5-20 mins)\n\nThe thing is, the day before, I had told my roommate that my dog is my best friend and has literally saved my life. I got him a year and a half ago, a couple of weeks after a suicide attempt as an emotional support and encouragement to stay strong and keep living and I’ve since really improved and am even happier than I’ve ever been in my entire life. \n\nAnd seeing my dog outside, alone, potentially abt to be run over or lost or dog napped or whatever the fuck, I had an extremely visceral reaction. It was made worse that I was very drunk and my roommate tends to have a very carefree attitude abt everything as a way to cope with his own anxieties I guess and I didn’t feel like he truly initially understood how betrayed and hurt I felt. \n\nI feel like my reaction was extreme, I was literally more mad than I’d ever been and i was really yelling, like at the top of my lungs probably, but I still feel sick abt the entire thing. Even though my dog is such a sweetheart, he probably didn’t even leave the area where his leash normally is. I’m so careful with my dog and mindful of keeping him safe and happy 100% of the time. The argument ended in my roommate hugging me while I literally sobbed. We haven’t talked abt it all day and i don’t know if I owe him a genuine sober apology. We’re fine this morning, i took my roommate to a bike shop and we talked like normal and he said he’s order a pizza for us tonight but never did. He’s really become like a brother to me and I care abt him a lot. \n\nSo.. AITA and do i owe him a real apology or should I just drop the whole thing and accept that it turned out fine and we worked it out, even if I was too drunk to really remember the details? ",

(I really enjoy independent European cinema.) But no problem, I care about him and appreciate his efforts to share his tastes in cinema, music etc. with me.\n\nHe said that people who haven't seen Star Wars are \"culturally uneducated\" because it's \"general knowledge\". He also claimed that \"those people are a little left out because Star Wars is a crucial part of the pop culture.\"\n\nI agreed with his second opinion but I said I was a bit disappointed that he just disregards the whole history of cinema and the great directors like Luis Bunuel, Kieslowski and Gaspar Noe.\n\nWhen I told him that he just called me culturally uneducated, his response was \"yeah you were, but I introduced you the series and now you're not\" \n\nThis has happened like a month ago. Yesterday he implied the same thing again. \n\nAm I the asshole for being upset? \n\n",

One of our (her) hobbies is drinking wine and making dinners when her dad goes out of town because my kitchen is too small to do so comfortably. Anyway, I’ve been drinking almost everyday since I graduated college December 15, so I decided I need to chill out this month as obviously all that drinking ruined a lot of my working out progress (I’ve never been overweight, but I like to be defined)\n\nShe thinks it’s super uncool of me to do this knowing her dad will be in Vegas for 2 weeks and that I shouldn’t do it this month and just start next month. After some arguing I finally caved and said “fine I will drink some but it will just be a glass of wine with dinner” but that was not good enough for her. The whole argument was over phone/text so now she’s just been extremely short with me and thinks I’m being ridiculous, while I think she’s being extremely selfish. \n\nAlso: I don’t think I have a problem with drinking, and that has no motivation for why I want to stop, I’m just doing it purely so I can start waking up not hungover and good enough to get my butt in the gym. My friends have also been nagging me to drink as well. \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole? Are are the people in my life assholes? ",

After confirming everything she tells me they are out of the dressing. I say \"oh man, my wife loves that dressing and is gonna be pissed if I come home with out it\" She says it will take them 20 minutes to make more. So i ask if they can compensate me in some way for not having the dressing. She walks to the back, comes back a moment later and says it will only be 5 minutes. I tell them that would be fine and I will wait. \n\nSo about 5 minutes later, second lady who I saw making the dressing in the back comes out with two containers of dressing. I walk over to pick them up, when first lady (who is now helping another customer) yells \"JUST ONE! HE ONLY GETS ONE\" to which i say \"well you should give me both for waiting\" I take only one and start to walk away, when i see second lady is still holding out the second one offering it to me. I decline, tell them to have a great day, and leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kind of feel bad, I wasn't angry or anything, but when I talk I use a lot of sarcasm, and my wife tells me I always sound like a douche. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: the restaurant was nearly empty, other than the one customer who had just walked in, and one person sitting down eating.

The jocks are nice to everyone, and the 'slutty cheerleader clique' (not slut shaming, just stereotypical names), were charismatic and wanted to improve the school. The only thing that sucked was the principals and some teachers.  \n\n\nA few people that I was friends with were (fake names) Ron, Ivan, James and Eva. They were the edgy gamers. I played Xbox with some of them and we always talked about new games coming out since we had some classes together.  \n\n\nWell, it's been 2 years since high school (fucking WOW, time flies). They invite me out often but I'm addicted to OT so I tend to say no. But 1 year ago, I said yes to Eva's party , and it went fine. I got high, played some overwatch. Impressed a cute guy from the popular group. It was nice. Nothing really eventful happened there, it was a chill hang-out.  \n\n\nWell some time passes, and they invite me to hang out again, I accept.   \n\n\nWell we went out to eat which was fun, Eva and I have always gotten along. Ivan and Ron were gossiping about games. But after dinner, we went to an electronic store, and they just kept saying the N word.   \n\n\nI told them to stop, they aren't black and they have no right to the word. They mocked me and kept saying it, but all around they were just goofing off. And I work security so I can tell the other security guards were hella sus, and watching us. It was so embarrassing.   \n\n\nThen we went bowling and James joins us. They kept asking me to be the sugar momma and to pay for all of it, and to pay for their tickets. But I'm not paying for anyone but myself.   \n\n\nI just feel like I have evolved from high school, I have my own apartment and a FT job. I just feel embarrassed to be around them in public now, and I feel like they just want me to pay everything.   \n\n\nThey invited me out yesterday and I made an excuse to not go, which made them cancel the plans.   \n\n\nAITA?",

He's attractive, generally very sweet and he does a lot for me (driving me places and helping with  homework and stuff like that). The issue I'm having is that, during sex, he's really into this type of dirty talk that I don't do well with. I have pretty low self esteem in general and it's stuff that's sort of degrading, and a few times I've actually ended up crying. He's really apologetic afterward and takes care of me, and has explained a lot that he doesn't actually *mean* any of that stuff.\n\nOn some level I really feel like I'm being too sensitive, because at the end of the day it's just talk and it's obviously not something that requires anything of me (like, it's not a sexual thing that I need to perform or something). And it's something that gives him a lot of pleasure. He knows that I don't like it but he's said that it's something to get used to, and that he does things that make me happy so it's a trade-off. It does seem kind of trivial when I think about it. So you can see why I feel like I might be an asshole if I make him stop completely.   ",

      "description": "So I got very drunk last night, and I went home with a friend of mine who was literally carrying me as I was blacked out. He put me in a roommates bed who I know and also consider my friend. There were no sheets on his bed so I slept on the cover. I woke up with a little puke on me and the bed, so I bleached and washed the cover to clean up. Did not really think much of it, but he just texted me he wants a \"50 bed fee\" for puking on his bed and not telling him. Am I the asshole for not paying him this? I understand I should have told him, and I apologized, but considering I have known the guy for 4 years and was put in his bed unwillingly, am I at fault?",

      "description": "I was out a few nights ago with a friend of mine (Paul) and his GF (Mary), both of whom I hadn't seen for a few months. We went to a gig, had a great time, and then decided to go to a club. We arrived there at about 1 am and had a fun time dancing amongst ourselves. Mary then became upset when she ran into Paul's ex-GF, who apparently gave a dirty look to her. Since she was distressed, we decided to go outside the club so she could calm down (now about 2 am).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI waited a couple of minutes for the two of them to talk things over. I then decided that I might join the conversation so that I assist in whatever way I could. I can't remember exactly how the conversation flowed, but I asked Mary if she wanted to go home or go to another club. She looked at me for a fraction of a second, disregarded that I'd said anything and then turned back to Paul. I was a little annoyed at this, so I repeated myself again with a raised voice. Perhaps not my wisest decision based on the circumstances, I will admit. I was a little bit tired, but I should have been more considerate. I never normally raise my voice towards other people unless I am trying to make myself heard if I believe I am not being taken seriously (which is still rare for me).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMary then raises her voice at me, saying, \"What on earth are you raising your for?\" Paul responds to this by saying, \"Don't talk to LifeCable like that!\" She walks off in a teary huff. Paul and I catch up with her. I start to apologise when she cuts me off saying, \"LifeCable, just stop, and fuck off.\" She starts to walk off again. Paul gives me a quick look of \"I'll try and talk to her, maybe it'd be best if you stay your distance.\" I agree, and sit down on a park bench, while they both chat close-ish by where I can keep an eye on them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey talk for about an hour, which I spend feeling conscience-stricken and talking to whoever happens to be outside the club. Paul then returns to no avail. We sit there silently, keeping an eye on Mary. After a few minutes, he mentions a few things that they discussed:\n\n* A conflict Mary and I had earlier in the year (which I thought we had forgiven each other for, but apparently she is still bitter over it).\n* Mary reading Paul's private messages in case he was trying to cheat on her (he wasn't, and this isn't the first time that she has done this).\n* How upset she was at how Paul had taken my side instead of hers.\n\nMary started wandering off again, which is far from unusual for her to do. Especially when she is unhappy and oblivious to what sort of bad conditions she could land herself in. By the time, we caught up with her again, it was 3:30 am and just wanted us all to go home. Paul tried to illustrate this to Mary, but she kept claiming that he was trying to change the subject from what they were angrily discussing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kept quiet, both due to fear and tiredness until about 4 am. By this stage, we had walked to somewhere where there nobody around, apart from the company of a street light or two. Then the three of us saw a white van drive past, do a U-turn, park right next to us, and opened its passenger door. We all looked at each other and ran for our lives. Once we got somewhere safe, Mary burst into tears, hugged and apologised to us for arguing over something so stupid. Honestly, I was glad we could finally go home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies for the mass of text, but I know this subreddit is keen on having as much info as possible. What I'm asking is that am I the asshole for causing all of this happen, and for turning what was a fantastic night into a sour one?",

He usually spends one day a week with her to run errands for her, housework, etc. Today he announces to her that she will be joining us. Obviously this is a sweet thing to do but I didn’t know that was the plan.\n\nA few hours passed and  I told him (in private) I wasn’t sure I wanted to go anymore. I really don’t want to spend a week locked up in a house with older people and overall his grandmother drives me crazy. I’d rather save my boyfriend the headache and not go. I know I’ll just get irritated and that will bother him/stress him out. \n\nBut now he’s not happy with me. I just really don’t want to go. I know it’s part of the relationship but I already went on a trip with his grandmother once and it was horrible. I had a panic attack at some point during the trip.\n\nIt’s really just babysitting for me. And I told him that I didn’t want to do this again. We are also going through a sticky patch ourselves. I told him it’s hard to want to do things for him when I feel like parts of our own relationship is being neglected and he’s not working towards that. ",

      "description": "So I'm part of a dance group. We are 9 girls and we get along great most of the time.\n5 members already left and the empty spaces were filled again because of trouble... and the trouble is most certainly caused by this one girl I'm gonna call V.\nV is 17 so by all means you would think she would take responsibility for the stuff she says and does but no. She is always the victim.\nEverything started with two members who already left. Y and C.\nWe had a live show and Y had a light fever and a 1 hour drive ahead. So we told her if she wasn't feeling well she should stay home. In comes V complaining her way was soooo much longer than Y's and so on.\nThose unnecessary fights continued to the point were Y and C were so fed up they left with a big fight  via Whats App Group Chat.\nSoon after V chose another girl in our group to pick fights with, I'll call her S.\nNow I thought we agreed, since she always started trouble, we were going to ask her to leave the group... but no. Her closer friends in the group, A and N suddenly backed out and just treated her like a child in the way of \"just don't do it again okay sweety?♡♡♡\"\nAnd everytime V picks another fight A and N jump in and support her in the train of thought that she is the victim and she isn't to blame.\nV said JUST HALF AN HOUR AGO \"I have personal problems\" and \"It's not my fault you are all attacking me\" no one was attacking her and guess what? Everyone has personal problems. That's not a reason to pick fights. (There was more but I am not in the condition to rephrase everything now I'm on the edge of another breakdown)\nI just asked her to pay her part of the rent for our dance-room to our bank-manager, since she already made me wait 6 months for a total of 92.50€ and I didn't want it to happen to the next bank-manager...\nAnyway... another fight, I was gonna tell her to please leave the group because I didn't want the fighting anymore, it stresses me to no end (also everytime she types into the chat I get panic attacks because I'm afraid she will pick a fight again). But in comes N to assure her it's not her fault and she is supporting her.\nI know I sorta chickened out there because I didn't speak my mind but I was already crying and I didn't want N to attack me in the end... \nI decided to our next training session I am going to tell the others if V stays I will leave.\nI know it's shit to make someone choose but... I don't think V will ever change, like N and A assure... I could just leave but I love the girls (excluding V) and I want them to think about V's behaviour because I know that 3 others think just like me and will eventually leave...\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTldr: Girl who always picks fights in the group gets her ass wiped off with cotton while I'm having breakdowns. Am I the ass for saying if she stays I will leave?",

      "description": "The last 2 weeks, I have had no appetite. I eat a couple of things throughout the day (smoothies from wotk, kind bar, snacks, and drink water) but I can’t seem to really eat more than 1/4 portion of a regular meal. This has happened before and I’ve intentionally taken advantage to lose weight. I’ve grown a lot and have developed a new frame of thinking about my illness so, I do try my best to reach out to people/supports/professionals, stay social, keep a positive air, and usually immediately notice these symptoms as signs of a developing problem.\n\nI have now not slept for 2 nights, we had late nights that lasted till about 2 and playing games makes 7am come quick. I’ve stayed up played rocket league and overwatch and before I know it she’s waking up and we just start our day and I feel as though I have slept, my mind is sharp (for now). This morning she was very upset that I did not at least lay down and “accept the boredom of lying in bed, because that would be healthy and proactively doing something about this unhealthy behavior” even though, I feel jittery, full of energy and know I’ll only disturb her rolling around. - I did talk to my psychiatrist 1.5 weeks ago, and I’m seeing her in a couple days to follow up, I am being proactive -  I’m not as concerned because, this has happened at least a dozen times in life. \n\nShe concluded our fight with “we have breakfast to go to in 15 minutes”. I am sensitive/feel guilty, and know I would be thinking about it the whole time. I thought it would be best for her to experience breakfast, a new setting, and not think about me for a couple hours.This just upset her to where she thinks I’m a complete asshole. I get that I bailed on breakfast plans with her roommates but, going and not eating would get me some looks and she would be further upset.\n\nI know she cares and wants me healthy but, She is furious over this tired of me always having ”something”.\n\nTL;DR: I’m having a hypomanic episode, of which I have had MANY,  I haven’t been eating much and it’s been hard for me to sleep 5-6 hours or to even sleep at all. My 4yr long girlfriend thinks I’m not trying to help myself and is using anger to relay her concern for my well being. In her defense, through therapy I found I may use not eating to “discipline myself”. I have done it a few times, a few years ago.\n\nWe fought 1st thing because I never came to bed. I thought it best to bail on breakfast with a group of her friends because I didn’t want to create an awkward situation or even be around the energy with company.\n\nSo.",

      "description": "This happened sophomore year of high school when I was 16 (am male).\n\nIt was the end of the day and I got out of class a bit late. The halls were mostly empty, but when I turned a corner to head towards the exit there were two people standing next to each other talking, a guy and a girl.\n\nI knew both of them. The guy I played football with, but he was a senior on varsity and I was a sophomore on JV so we didn't interact much. From what I saw of him he didn't seem like a very nice guy and I didn't like him very much. But again, I didn't interact with him, and I only really saw him during football practice where everyone acts like a jackass. The girl was also a senior and I shared an elective class with her. We interacted a bit in class but I wouldn't call her a friend and we never spoke a word outside of class.\n\nSo anyway, as soon as I enter the hall I see him playfully poke her in the stomach. I'm a ways away, but she looked uncomfortable and like she wanted to get away. As soon as she sees me her face lights up and she says \"Hi WeakAssShit!\" This really confused me because we absolutely never talked outside of that one class and for her to be excited to see me just weirded me out. I said hi and smiled and kept walking until my dumb ass finally figured out that she probably wanted a way out of the interaction with the guy.\n\nI was about 10 feet past them when I put two and two together. I thought about turning around and striking up a conversation with her, but I thought the conversation would be awkward and the guy intimidated me, so I didn't turn around and just kept waking. The farther away I got the worse I felt, but I still just kept walking.\n\nThe next day I see them talking to each other during lunch, and the girl seemed genuinely happy. She acted the same to me during class and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. This had me thinking that maybe I just misread the situation since all I really had to go off of was had facial expression when he poked her and her being excited to see me. Then again, at the time I did think she might be asking for help and still did nothing, so I'm leaning towards thinking I am the asshole.",

      "description": "Backstory- \n\nI was with my grandfather at Walmart to pick up some random groceries when we realized that my grandpa forgot his phone at home which he needs since he has his own “taxi service.”\n\nSo, my grandpa tells me to call my brother to get his phone and tells him to tell anyone that calls to tell them that he’ll be there shortly and that he’s currently unavailable. My brother spends his days playing fortnite nonstop, and when I called him he was pissed at me for calling and said a few curse words and speaks to me in a mean kind of attitude. Still, I ask him and while he sounds hesitant and doesn’t want to do it, he does but hangs up before telling me. Note that before this successful call I called him once and told him to wait since i had to help my grandpa for a sec (he uses a cane but was using the Walmart electric scooters) and then he hangs up. Three calls later he ignores when I call my mom to tell him, again three more ignored calls (probably sleeping) and when I call my brother once more we have the interaction we had above.\n\nBefore Walmart we stopped by BK to pick up food, I pay and pick some stuff up for my brother as a surprise. He doesn’t know he’s getting food, but after he was being an asshole to me in the calls I decide he’s not getting his food and either give it to my grandma or eat it later in the day.\n\nOnce I get home, I help my grandpa unload the groceries and then bring my food. My brother did get the phone, but I told myself he wouldn’t get his food. So, once I get the phone I tell him something along the lines of “Because you were being an ass to me, you’re not getting food I picked you up,” (again note he didn’t know he’d be getting food)\n\nOnce that happens, he gets off the PS4 after 3 and a half hours and then goes to my moms room where I knew she’d take his side. She did, showing clear bias towards him (numerous times she’d tell us that we have to show each other respect each other, I felt really disrespected so I didn’t give him his food to tell him to not be like that) and here she again goes on a rant and tells me to respect my brother, even though I told her he was being an ass to me on the call and that I was proving a point. She said he was waiting for the food the whole time so either my brother lied to her or she’s making shit up, and when I tell her it was surprise food she then moves to a different point about respect again.\n\nMy brothers reason for not picking up and being mean? He was playing fortnite and said that he’d rather speak to them than wait fifteen seconds for me to finish helping my grandpa out, outright saying he didn’t care.\n\nI’m sorry if this was confusing I’m just so mad about it, mom is pissed at me though I know my grandpa will take my side since he knew what was happening.",

      "description": "TLDR: Mature 16 year old daughter wants to date, I won’t allow it because as bad as it sounds, she’s a girl. \n\nI have a 16 year old daughter. She’s beautiful, does amazing in school, and is constantly  surprising me by how mature she is. \nI often ask her for her opinion in family matters she probably shouldn’t know about, but she’s always levelheaded and  gives pretty good advice. She’s only ever slipped up twice. I’m a devoted Catholic, and when she was 12, she refused to go to church and told us she didn’t believe in God. This hurt me and my wife deeply and I’ll admit, I yelled at her until she couldn’t talk anymore since she was crying. Not my proudest moment, but it happened. To this day she doesn’t believe in God, but the condition of her staying in our home is that she at least attend church with us. \nThe second time she slipped up was when she was caught shoplifting. The cops let her go and there’s nothing on her record, and she said it was like an itch and she felt so terrible about it. I don’t let her walk around alone in stores anymore. In her defense, she’d been dealing with severe depression and mental health issues at that time. \n\nNow, the other day she comes to the living and sits down. She says she has something to talk to me about, and that she knew I wasn’t going to get mad. It looked like she was about to cry, but she said that she had met this boy who she’d liked for a year. Apparently, on New Year’s eve, he’d told her that he’d liked her for a long time and he really wanted to be her boyfriend. \nShe said she wanted to let me know and that she really liked this boy. I generally am very strict, so my kids don’t go out much and aren’t allowed to date until I say so. Years ago, I said that the age when they could date was 16. She recalled this and said that she was 16 and she just wanted to get my permission first. \n\nI appreciate this, but I meant that my boys could date when they were 16. I love my daughter but she’s my only girl. I know she’s mature but women are easily manipulated and I just want her to be safe. I told her that I’m glad she asked, but it was a no until she graduated. I think she expected me to say yes, as her face dropped. She nodded but she’s the type to fight until the end to prove she’s right. \nShe brings up how her brother dated at 16, and how I’d let her younger brother date at 14. \nShe keeps this up until I am forced to say that it’s because she’s a girl. This clearly upsets her and she stands up to leave. But first she just says that she loves me but she’s disappointed. \n\nShe’s still upset but I don’t think it’s that much of a problem. I’m not trying to be sexist, I’m just protective over my daughter. I know she’s smart and mature, but men can be dangerous, and I don’t want to put her through anything. ",

      "description": "My girlfriend and some of my friends went to a birthday dinner last week at a restaurant (that becomes a club later in the night). The music was extremely loud (fact that was brought up by others too) and it was hard to keep up a conversation because of it.\n\nWe were all at the same table, but there was a clear division between my friend group, and the birthday girl's friend group. At some point, I decided to ask my friend (Matt) if he wants to go outside with me get some fresh air. I barely see him these days and I missed just chatting with him. He said yes.\n\nConversation with my girlfriend the other day:\n\nHer: It was really rude when you and Matt went outside, just the 2 of you, to talk. What did you guys talk about?\n\nMe: Nothing, just our lives, what shows we're watching, our jobs, etc. Nothing gossipy.\n\nHer: Yeah but it was really rude. My friends were asking why you guys just got up and went out in the cold.\n\n[ she thought we were talking shit about other people at the table, that Matt doesn't like, which we weren't ]\n\nMe: You regularly go with your friends for a smoke outside. In the same cold. What's the difference?\n\nHer: Yeah but when we go it's to have a smoke. We don't just go out in the cold for no reason.\n\nMe: Yeah but you guys could be talking about the same things just as much, much less gossiping also.\n\n[ she keeps insisting it's ok because they're smoking ]\n\nMe: Ok so if Matt and I were smokers [we're not] and went outside to smoke, that would be ok?\n\nHer: Yes.\n\nMe: Ok. Imagine the same situation, but eliminate the cigarettes from our hands. Are we in the wrong?\n\nHer: Yes.\n\nWe didn't argue about this. I love her very much. She loves me very much. I just want others' opinions on this.",

      "description": "I went through the rules, and I don't know if this counts as a validation post or not. I'm genuinely conflicted and I want to know because it's been on the forefront of my life for so long, and I can't tell if I am the asshole. I tried asking my close friends, and they didn't know either, so this is my last try for an answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[This is REALLY long, so I put a TLDR at the bottom if you don't want to read through all of this.\\]**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family's been making me uncomfortable for the majority of my life, from the youngest date I can remember, my mother and aunt used to touch me and tell me \"how much I'm maturing so quickly\" in a bit of a creepy way, I told them I was uncomfortable with it a few years back, and they thankfully stopped, but not after bouts of complaining and calling me oversensitive, especially since it's something that happens in the entire family. My aunt in particular didn't stop for weeks after I told them to, continuing to do it even in public when I was still barely a preteen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't had much issue about that since then, I understand where they're coming from, especially since they believed it wasn't too serious, but I still get extremely uncomfortable whenever they come near me, my brain automatically tells me that they're going to do it again, and it sends me into a panic. They noticed it pretty early on, once at a dinner table I had gotten the same panicky feeling before we came to eat, and my mind subconsciously told me to minimize my presence as much as possible to avoid them noticing me out of a weird fear, my mother noticed this and proceeded to bash me for it, calling me weak-willed and oversensitive, saying I have to grow up already when I was just around 10-11 back then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd not only that, they also constantly belittled me for multiple things, they were both insecure about their weight, so they started calling me fat and saying I shouldn't eat or I'll get fat and nobody will love me, I ended up having a period of fear that I was actually getting overweight, and my mother noticed this and claimed that if I dared to diet without her knowing, she'd make it one of the things I'd end up regretting most. After I had a breakdown because of it, my mother stopped calling me those things, but she still threatened me because she thought it was the only way to prevent me from becoming anorexic, claiming stuff like \"dieting and not eating only makes you fatter, so don't even bother.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe used everything I held dear against me, she would threaten me with closing all contact with my friends if I wouldn't do exactly as she said, going to the point where she would take away my only coping mechanisms as a way of making me listen to her. She would insult me for my choice in friends, saying that I only talk to Asians \\[mostly because we live in an area where there are many of them compared to other ethnicities.\\] and that I should go be friends with people from my country instead of the ones I've had since fourth grade just because of their ethnicity. I trusted her enough to tell her about my issues with mental health, mostly regarding how I viewed myself and how I felt. She would always ignore the problem, even when I was 11 and crying my eyes out because I wanted to kill myself. I told her twice before then that I wasn't happy with living and she never actually did anything. I stopped trusting her with my own thoughts and emotions because every time I told her about my interests or how I felt, I would always get backlash for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe ended up noticing how little I trusted her, and she blamed me for it too, saying it's my duty as her child to be nice to her just because she brought me into the world, and that she's always been good to me because of everything she's bought or said in the past. Even my aunt said these things too, one of my worst memories was during one of my breakdowns when my aunt told me I was being ungrateful and that I should be happy with my parents because they let me on the internet, even if they're constantly saying these things to me. My dad is much better than my mother, but during that period of my life, my dad was overseas for a family issue, so it was just me, my mother and my aunt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring this period, both my dad and my mom's health was declining, with my father having a genetic disorder that almost killed him and my mother having an issue with her estrogen production, because of this, she started practically begging me for support, hugging me constantly even if I told her I didn't want to \\[mostly because I was still uncomfortable with her touching me after the years she spent inappropriately doing it\\], I remember living most of my childhood in fear of her, whenever I did something wrong, I would instantly start crying out of fear that she would get mad at me and hurt me, despite how she never actually got physical with me. She did threaten getting physical to shut me up, but she never actually did it. She again noticed how I reacted whenever she was mad at me for something, since I was basically having a panic attack whenever she did get mad at me, and I remember one night where she tried to get me to argue with her by threatening me with my friends and my safety again, it ended up in me panicking even more, to the point where I could hear her call me slurs and names from the living room.\n\nThat last point in particular happened a lot, whenever I did something wrong, I'd run and hide in my room, but I could still hear her calling me a donkey or a little lying bitch  \"just like my father\", it was mostly in my native language, and it is hard to translate, especially since I barely have any recollection of the event because of how horrified I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all of this, it ended with me being extremely distrustful of my family and my friends, my mind was in constant fear that others would judge me or react to my issues the same way my family did, whenever someone got mad at me, I immediately buckled under the pressure and gave up trying to argue, even if I knew I was correct. My mother started getting all nice to me, saying she loves me and coming for hugs and kisses and giving me what I wanted, even when she didn't give me that attention through my childhood, yet I still can't let go of the mark she left on most of my childhood and preteen years. I can't quite let go of it, and it resulted in me becoming distant from them, she often shames me because \"I hate her despite everything she's done for me.\" AITA for not being able to let go of the things she did before?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: My mother and my aunt were both extremely insulting and demeaning to me, making fun of my weight, preferences and choice in friends, as well as physically inappropriate for my early teen years, with the addition of threats of physical violence, and it left a large mark on my life and perception of others, to the point where I frequently panic at the thought of people reacting the same way they did. Recently, my mother's been extremely nice and giving me loads of physical affection, even when she didn't do any of that through my childhood, yet I still can't let go of the things she did and said through most of my childhood and early teens, I don't trust her or have much love for her, ending up in me being more distant from them. AITA for reacting like this?",

Now everyone else outside has a coat on, it's winter the temperature is well known. I was not close to my coat when the alarm went off, but I made the decision to go get it because I didn't want to freeze. I understand in an emergency situation you should go straight outside but the building was not burning down around me so I took my chances. The part that made me feel like the asshole was that they mentioned to me the fact that I had a coat. Now I know my mother would have been disappointed, and I should have done the chilverous thing, but they were grown ass adults who made their decision. If it was my wife or a child then sure, but am i really required to give up my coat to this lady so she can be comfortable and I can be miserable?",

      "description": "Quick info - my slightly older cousin and I are spending holidays in Prague. Today at 2 p.m. we are coming back home by bus (10h trip) \nYesterday however we had a big fight. I just think we travel differently, I value being independent very much, she - to the contrary. Very often I travel abroad on my own and I don't mind being alone. \nComing back to the fight - it was over a very stupid and unimportant thing, but it escalated very quickly. We raised our voices and started to insult eachother. The worst thing is that we are (were?) very close. In this situation you simply know what to say, what to mention to hurt the other person. Afterwards I felt very bad, we didn't make up or arrive to an agreement. Each of us just went to sleep. Then I decided that I don't want to spend the entire morning with her. I woke up, put the tickets with a map on the table and told her that was going on my own and that we would meet on the bus. (In 5 hours)\nShe couldn't believe her ears, asking me if I'm serious and if I am really leaving her.\nShe is 30, I'm 25, it's not her first trip alone. I'm sure she knows how to read a map and will arrive safely. Come on - it's Europe.\n\nAm I the asshole. I know it must sound incredibly stupid, but I didn't want to sit in the apartament with her, watching her do her makeup for the next 2 hours. I just want to see the city, but I am almost sure that she is hurt and problably on the phone with her sister complaining about me and this situation. ('she left me alone here!')\n\nSorry for the length and mistakes, I'm sitting in a cafe, little shook-up.",

      "title": "AITA For considering breaking up with my BF because he ignores me for his autistic brother?",
      "description": "Note: My mother is paralyzed from the waist down, I also used to work with kids who have autism worse than his brother. His brother hates all women to the point that if anything touched by a woman goes near him it must be cleaned or removed. He is also very manipulative and abusive to everyone in their family.\n\nOk, so throughout our relationship my boyfriend's little brother frequently calls him in a panic asking for money or to get him things or take him places. This has gotten worse because he is back home for his last couple of semesters in college. Since he's moved back home his brother's demands have grown out of control where he runs out of my house to his brother's bidding. I used to (emphasis on used) go to their house every Friday to spend time with his younger sister and parents (his brother, like most autistic people, prefer to be alone), now almost every Friday they cancel or change plans on me last minute, I have ADD and anxiety so changing plans usually makes me upset but I also think that's a part of my personality.\n\nOne of the things my boyfriends family did to change plans on me last minute was decide to change plans, but not tell me and then alert me the day before around 10 pm (22:00) that I was to come to their house later because his brother wanted to go out to eat with just him, and it had to be Friday because Friday's are special. I just broke down at that point, my lizard was sick and I thought I was going to get to be with people who supposedly care about me. It was not my best moment.\n\nHis brother does a lot of things that I find really mean and rude. That says a lot because I worked with a girl who had violent outbursts and would curse at me but she never was malicious and his brother is. My heart hurts to see this 18-year old abuse their family like that.\n\nRecently I told my boyfriend that his brother's behavior toward his family specifically his sister and mother was too much for me to handle, I said I was especially horrified that my boyfriend wouldn't tell his brother that you couldn't speak to your own mother like that. I said I would not be returning on Friday nights indefinitely and would only see his family if it was a large familial event like a wedding or reunion (we are Hispanic so it happens a lot). I've confided to my parents about this who both work with disabled people since my mom is one and my dad works in a clinic for people with brain injuries. They said this was something I couldn't avoid if I loved my boyfriend and wanted to stay with him.\n\nMy boyfriend also wants his brother to move in with us after he graduates college (I want to go into a grad program so I'll still be in school). Because of this, I have considered breaking up with him.\n\nI know it sounds selfish but my heart is breaking. Am I a jerk for wanting my boyfriend to spend time with me that doesn't include changing everything around so that he can focus on his brother? I'm so conflicted and so hurt at the same time.",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to separate?",
      "description": "Very long, quick background;\n\nHusband and I met a handful of years ago through the internet. On one of our first dates, I got pregnant, and the usual ensuing panicked decision making happened that led to me keeping the baby because it was one of my only chances due to my health, and him sticking around to co-parent but just as friends. Further along the pregnancy he started dating another girl while i was living with him but in separate rooms cuz, ‘just friends, getting together for the baby would be stupid’ he said. After many months of the emotional toll that took, and shortly after the baby was born, i said I had enough and that he had someone so i was moving on. He panicked, didn’t want to pay child support or be ‘weekend dad’ so he dumped the girl and said he wanted me to stick around, but only if it could be an open relationship because he was worried he would need more than me to satisfy him. Young, dumb and literally no other support in my life I agreed to stick around. Few years later i found out i had cancer and another panicked decision was made to have one last child and get married. Thanks to the miracle of RSO, my cancerous cells were no longer there and my second kid was born healthy after our wedding. \n\nHere’s where things started to really kinda crumble. During our attempts for our second kid, we struggled immensely with having any sort of regular sex life that would help conception happen sooner than later. There were always excuses about how late he was working or how much effort it took to have sex with a kid in the house. Fast forward to a year after kid two and he admits that he’s not ‘into’ my body type and thought he could help me lose weight(I’ve never weighed more than 210) and he would never have to say anything, but my depression from some major family drama and my inability to lose weight fast due to PCOS and thyroid problems made him admit “I’m shallow, I just don’t find you attractive and I don’t think i ever will. But i still love you and care for you.” We went to couples counseling where the therapist proceeded to tell me to try to get passed the hurt and use it as a chance to motivate me to look better. I proceeded to put up with a lot of building resentments and anger between the both of us. This created a toxic dynamic where he held onto anger to mask every emotion. I literally only saw him cry once when he broke up with his gf he had when i was pregnant. His anger kept building and building; things would get thrown, doors slammed, hours and hours of tears while he yelled at me. This started to severely trigger some trauma from my past and soon i would sit in a puddle of tears shaking while he chewed me out for my “attitude” “not understanding him” “never forgiving him” “being selfish” and “broken beyond repair” any time he started yelling i would start bawling and he wouldn’t comfort me at all; no touching, no hugs, no apologies. I would literally have to leave the room sobbing and come back calm before he would even attempt to tell me again how i should have asked for comfort if i wanted it and how he needed comfort too and i didn’t give it to him. \n\n6 months ago, shit hit the fan and we had a sheriff at our door. This sheriff looked at him and told him as long as the kids were in the other room he wasn’t there to be a marriage counselor and didn’t care what was said or who yelled at who. This only led to him doubling down and every two weeks i was crying while he was yelling about something else i screwed up or hurt him for. I had enough. I packed everything i could and tried to find somewhere to go and came up empty. I got a job and started to get some confidence back. When i knew i could take care of myself i started to pull away. He could immediately tell and something snapped; this is officially where my ask starts. \n\nI told him I wanted to separate and give myself an opportunity to work on myself without the constant need to fix our marriage. It’s broken, it has been for a long time and he admitted that for a long time I’ve been the only one trying. Now, he wants to try, he wants to fix things, he wants to promise to give me all the things I’ve asked for for years, and it fucking stings. Why did it have to take years and me leaving before he did the right thing? He keeps trying to say he wants to know if him trying is wasted efforts, if I’m going to leave him fully anyways he wants to just call it quits right now and get papers, but he says that if we are going to work things out we shouldn’t even separate because he can’t fix things if i push him out. Thing is, i feel like if i take him back right away, what does that say about my own self respect? I know it would be easier, but i will always wonder if he truly finds me attractive or loves me because I’ve literally been questioning that the whole time. Because of our open relationship, i had a date a few weeks ago and truly felt the difference once again in how it felt to passionately be with someone who actually wanted me and i can still feel the difference and it’s changed the dynamic and he can feel it. He finally talked to his family about what was going on and he’s been owning up to how verbally abusive he’s been, but everyone is saying that because we’re married and have kids we should be working things out, but not separating and that I’m an ass for not understanding that all his anger was from stress and stuff and we made a promise to work things out no matter what....but i have been living literal years in a hellish relationship where i was not wanted, how do i take him back without that being addressed somehow someway? I don’t want to ignore all my years of pain, and does he really deserve me when I’m at my best when he didn’t want me at my worst? Am i really an asshole if i don’t ‘let him show me he can be better’ and give him a second chance? There’s so much more at play here and specific instances of where care should have been shown and wasn’t, and I’m literally all on my own with no fam or friends so this is literally the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. I do love him, but i need to love me too and i don’t know if he even realizes he’s never fully let himself love me. \n\nTLDR;\nMetaphorically speaking, pulled my husband kicking and screaming all along the way in our relationship for the past few years and finally had enough yelling and let go, only to find out once I stopped trying to drag him with me he was willing to do it himself and I’m being called the asshole for not wanting to give him a second chance right away. It’s literally been a week. ",

If she can accept my way of life and my (admittedly sometimes lacking) morals, that’s fine with me, but if I find that she wishes for a different kind of family life, I‘m out. When I told my best friend he called me an islamophobe for this. WIBTA if I leave her? (Not that it would change anything, but I‘m curious what the general consensus in society is).",

      "description": "Hey guys, I'm going to try and simplify this as much as I can. I just transferred colleges and left behind a lot, but it's better for my own well being this way. Last year I grew quite close with a girl but it regrettably never became anything serious because we both knew I was leaving after that semester. This summer she confessed that she really fell hard for me and I told her I felt the same and that I was sorry things couldn't be different. Flash forward to this semester, she is dating a new guy and I couldn't be happier for her. However, about 3-4 weeks ago she calls me crying and tells me that he's been abusing her both emotionally and physically and she doesn't know what to do. I tell her to cut him off, and that it's not worth it. She tries but he somehow drags her back in. Last monday I noticed she had deleted me on social media so I texted her asking what that was about, she says he made her delete me because he was insecure that she used to love me. While I no longer am in love with her, I still deeply care about her well being and tell her that he's crossed a line and that no one comes between friends like that. She tells me that \"he's trying to change\" and that \"he's made me realize I have my own problems too\". I think it's him manipulating her and I tell her that. It escalates to me saying (and this is a direct quote) \"Morally, I can't pretend he's good for you, sorry dude. And if you're going to pretend he's alright, then you do you, but I'm not going to do that and I'm sorry if that means you won't talk to me anymore but I'm standing by my verdict from everything you've told me\". Since then she hasn't said a thing, and has deleted me once again. I'd hate to lose a friend like this, but I stick to what I believe is right. Am I the asshole here?",

We are open to the public so policyholders can come in.\n\n\nFor the past 2 weeks, nearly every day, a kid about 18 comes in. He is severely mentally disabled. He has taken a liking to me. The first once or twice it was fine, I played it off. He asked if I was married, why I wasn't married, can I be his girlfriend, do I want to kiss him, where is my ring at etc.\n\nNo, I can't be your girlfriend, I'm engaged, I don't always wear my ring because I don't like jewelry etc.\n\nHe leans over my desk and tries to touch me or sit by me and it impedes my work and makes me super super uncomfortable. He doesn't smell very good and acts the way a small child would. He reaches for my hair, leans over me, asks me to kiss him etc. \n\nMy male boss has said something to him a few times along the lines of \"Hey buddy, thanks for stopping by but you need to leave so we can get some work done.\"\n\nNow, he still shows up but asks if the boss man is here or if he will get in trouble.\n\nSo the other lady up front by the window warns me. I grab my phone and run out the back until they text me it's OK go come back in. Sometimes this takes like 20 minutes because he wanders the office looking for me.\n\n\nI feel like a huge peice of shit for hiding from a mentally disabled kid. I don't know if he knows better or not. But I can't be spending a half hour a day being uncomfortable and not getting work done, or hiding.\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

I avoided homework, didn’t really study and all of that brought my GPA down to the point where I can only get to a 2.9 if I were to get straight A’s throughout the rest of my high school time.\n\nSo, I was thinking of going to a community college, to save money, and to bring my GPA up so I can go to a more competitive and “prestigious” school.\n\nBut Every fucking time I bring up any sort of college she says stuff like “your giving up” and “I hate your guidance consoler because she’s giving you the wrong colleges” and if I try to argue she gets really pissed off and will interrupt me when I try to say shit.\n\nThis resulted in a few arguments and now I’m going to apply to colleges without their help. And whenever my mom (or dad) brings up colleges I simply don’t reply and change the subject, because I want to make a choice for myself based off of what I think would be right for myself. And they’ve claimed that it’s sorta wrong and rude for me to not talk to them about this because they think that they will pay for it partially (I’m not going to let them). So AITA?",

After a few months of staying quiet, i broached the subject that I wanted us to be more active and made a lot of plans for outdoor activities, which means she has to get in shape to enjoy them. She got the hint and was enthusiastic in making plans but after a day or two of working out very lazily, she would just give up. This has repeated 3/4 times so far. Every time it's the same pattern. It has really started to bother me and we even had a fight the last time because I suggested she should go to the gym at least once a week. I am getting tired of bringing up the same topic (i feel like i am nagging) but not seeing any results. She is quite busy with work and travel. But it doesn't take too much to workout in the confines of her own home for a few minutes a day. I even got her resistance bands she can carry when traveling for work. I am really frustrated just thinking about it. Other than this, I love her. I also do not conform to the notion that if i love her i should accept her as she is. No. I want her to live a healthy lifestyle and not end up facing any health issues because of her lifestyle.",

      "description": "I married my current husband seven years ago. He has three children from a previous marriage and I have my daughter from a previous one as well. Two of his children are in college right now and one graduated in May, and my daughter is starting high school in August.\n\nI really want my daughter to go to a top tier school as my daughter has stated many times she wants to either go to John Hopkins, Stanford, NYU or Columbia. My stepchildren go to state colleges.\n\nYesterday, all of us were together for a birthday when I mentioned my daughter, M would start SAT classes. My eldest step son J remarked that he and his sisters B and R never took SAT prep and did just fine. This led me to discuss how M wants to go to a prestigious school that would demand a higher testing scores.\n\nThis led B, who for context purposes is always trying to start a fight even on a family occasion, to ask how M would get scholarships to go live somewhere and go to school at private colleges. Their father/my husband refused to allow his children (with agreement with their mother) to send off to private or out of state schools due to the high tuition.\n\nSo, it would not be that far fetched that now, with his children locked in their current schools that both of their parents wanted, that my husband and I would send my daughter to a nicer college. My ex-husband have not discussed yet what we would like for M, but my ex husband does have two kids with his new wife. I think my ex-husband would be fine if my husband and I paid for M's college tuition and expenses.\n\nB hitched a fit that it wouldn't be fair for her siblings and herself if M got to go out of state. I told her that paying for three children to go out of state would be a lot of money, but that just paying for one is not as expensive. Also, I reminded them that their own mother agreed that they should stay in state for the lower tuition. B argued that her mother is still unmarried and could not afford the costs, so I had to repeat AGAIN that three children out of state is a heavy burden compared to one.  I also said that her father and I share finances so sending M to SAT prep and other things is my right to do. If my husband had wanted his children to go out of state with our money, I would not have been mad, which I told my stepchildren. It's really a matter to discuss with their own parents; not me. B then called me an ass, to which I told her to not use language like that. \n\nB told me I was being inconsiderate, so I had my husband ask her to back off and calm down to which she refused. \n\nB, even though she's an adult, acts very immaturely with her stepsister and always has, ever since we got married. B is eight years older than M but acts younger. I am taking her comments with a grain of salt, but I would like to gain outside opinions on this.\n\nB and her siblings were quiet the rest of the evening, and B was probably trying to stir up more drama as it is. I'm getting tired, frankly, of how she is constantly undermining me in front of everyone when I'm really just trying to better my daughter's life. It's not my fault my husband and his ex-wife would not send their children out of state. His children act very entitled to our money but the way they conduct themselves causes me to doubt they really want a relationship with their father and instead just want our money. It's all about money to them. I know they are happy with their current education, but the second M gets something remotely nice they all freak out on me. \n\nSo, do I really deserve to be called an ass when it's not my fault they're jealous and acting entitled? \n\nPlease feel free to give any insight about this so maybe I can try to communicate with B better.",

Mike is really excited and saying its the \"start of our future\" but I don't feel the same.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not thinking of leaving him.

He makes me happy, he's sweet, all the good qualities but I don't feel the same rush of emotions, the butterflies, etc.\n\nI'm scared that I don't love him.

So naturally, I turned to my friends and confided all this in them.\n\nA couple of them said I an asshole, and that I shouldn't be leading Mike on. They said that I'm being a horrible friend/gf for continuing to date Mike, for making him think that I love him, when I don't know if I do. But am I?

      "description": "So a year ago my dad and I got into a fight. I never liked his girlfriend yet he tried to force her onto me despite it by inviting her to a family party around Hanukkah.\n\nWhen I found out about this I was made for two reasons. The first is that he knew I actively disliked her for a few reasons and the second is he was planning not to tell me but I found out by overhearing it. Moreover he was planning on inviting her daughter, again without my knowledge. Now as a child of divorce in general, I am not crazy about either of my parents partners (I don't like my moms BF either), but this case was especially bad since I hadn't even met her (my dad's GF) daughter before this. We got into a fight and I went to my mom's for a while.\n\nNow after this my dad and I made up temporarily, but the fight happened again and then we made up again. This cycle happened a few more times until it escalated. One night during a fight like this he decided to yell at me and tell me that \"I don't care about my family or him\" and that I should \"become less of an asshole\". Now at the time I was 14 and I was terrified. I immediately tried to leave his apartment and head home, but then the major incident happened. He tried to block my way from leaving, and then when I tried to get past him he pushed me, and I don't mean like a soft push, I mean an across the room falling down push (he was at least a foot larger than me at the time). I felt like I was in so much danger that I grabbed my bag and left without my laptop or any other possession there.\n\nI haven't been back there since.\n\nA week later he decided to pop in for an unannounced visit and this would be the last time I would ever talk to him. We argued again and this time he decided to tell me that if I couldn't accept GF and Daughter into my life then I was not welcome at his place. He did not apologize for anything he said or did, but he did apologize for how I reacted.\n\nI did not accept his apology.\n\nSince then he has tried to visit me a few times but I refuse to talk to him, he sent me a few letters and in one he basically admitted to trying to stalk me while I was at school, I no longer felt safe in that neighborhood after that.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for no longer speaking to my dad?",

She begs me not to make this complicated for her. I love her and I appreciate what she has done for me but why should I be uncomfortable so he isn't. I again tell her no I only have 3 pairs of jeans for when I  go out and I am not wasting them around the house (we have to go to the laundrymatt in town and at best we go once a week).

She said, \"What? Did you have plans already?\" I said, \"I just read about this game day on Saturday I was thinking about taking (my daughter) to and it wont interfere with game night you were talking about.\" This is where I feel things got unnecessarily heated. She became indignant and said, \"I guess myself and (her daughter) will just sit here and twiddle our thumbs.\" I said, \"well id invite you but you guys would be bored out of your mind sitting there for a few hours watching her learn.\" To which she replied, \"I like how you made plans and didnt even tell me.\" Im thinking really?? I just found out about it today and forgot about it. Then when you said Saturday, the light bulb went off and I brought it up.

      "description": "Throwaway for this because my normal account is fairly public...\n\n\nHi guys, I’m in a bit of a pickle. My now fiancé recently proposed! Yay! And now I’m in the throes of wedding planning (less yay) for summer 2020. Recently we’ve been budgeting, looking at venues, and talking about who we want to attend, and so on. We’ve got a few venues picked out to tour and a rough idea of how many people we want to invite for a fairly small wedding. I was talking to my step-mom about who from my family I was inviting. My mom’s side is pretty estranged from each other, and my dad’s side is fairly spread out. A lot of my dad’s side sent us save-the-dates inviting us to their weddings/celebrations and while I couldn’t attend (money, school) my dad and eventually step mom did (to a few). I would like to extend invitations to those counsins/aunts/uncles moreso in politeness than anything (and I’m making sure I’ve budgeted appropriately in case they do (and I would love them to)). My step mom asked about her side, and I was very honest that I didn’t plan to invite anyone other than her and not her nieces/siblings as I don’t feel super close to them. This was all I said to her but she’s taking it as an attack on her and her family which was not my intention. I didn’t think this would be a big deal. \n\n\nWe aren’t close. We met as adults. I didn’t grow up with them (unlike my dad’s side). I see them 3-5 times per year tops. She is taking this as an attack on her/her family. It’s not that at all. Additionally, I haven’t attended any weddings on her side/never have been invited including one coming up this year - the wedding itself is a destination wedding but they’re also having a celebration in our town. We just aren’t close and weddings are expensive. I would much rather have the space/budget to invite the people I have that closeness too. \n\n\nI’m a big jumble of emotion right now. Her argument is why bother inviting my cousins/aunts/uncles from my dad’s side if they likely won’t attend anyways and it’s been a long time since I’ve been able to see them. I still talk to them. We text/message on the regular. I don’t talk to her nieces or family like that :( \n\n\nTL;DR - Not close to step family, somewhat close to extended family, step mom is angry I’m not inviting them when I haven’t been invited to anything on their side :( Am I the asshole in this case?",

Now i really tried to understand and be there for her because shes still in her teenage years and constantly try to remind her that im there for her and that she can trust me.\n\nNow a couple of days back we made out and the next day she tells me how she feels im using her, how she doesnt trust me, and i took it very calmly because deep down i know im not the best person but what irritated me is how she thought im using her and how she doesnt trust me when basically everytime before touching her in a more intimate way (and dont worry i know shes under 18 so we didnt have sex nor really anything close to it) i asked her if shes okay with it.\n\nAfter that i found out the girl shes in love with is single now and she shuts me down completely.\nNow all of a suddem she doesnt like me and isnt interested in me when basically the night before she told me she loved me.So after that she told me she wanted us to just be friends to which i flat out told her \"No\" because i dont want to do that to myself.\n\nNow i really want to be there for her because she really is going through some very messed up things (and i mean very messy, from a family situation to mental illness, and more), but at the same time i have to consider myself and my feelings as well.\n\nSo AITA for this ?

      "title": "AITA for giving my wife a bad gift and getting upset when she rejected it",
      "description": "LTR/FTP - Throwaway Account\n\nThis Wednesday, my wife gave me my Valentine's day gift early. It was a gift bag with some candy, hand lotion, restaurant gift card, and a balloon. It was cute and thoughtful, although it was really just a few things she picked up the day before. Feeling appreciative, I gave her half of my gifts early. It was a cupcake/cookie carrier she had on a wish list, and I filled it with a bag of her favorite candy. I didn't bother wrapping it since it was a bit large, and it did have a cute card inside. She liked it and was looking forward to getting the rest.\n\nYesterday, I gave her a framed caricature we got two years earlier. Also I was worried that this wouldn't be enough (of a gift since she was acting so excited for it the day before), so I threw in a cash card that I had used to order the cupcake/cookie holder (but still had 70% of the original balance left). I also had an orchid that I had bought the day before. She hated it...\n\nShe hated the caricature. She told me that we had discussed hating it right after getting it, but I can't remember that. She also didn't like the cash card, since it was used and just a cash card instead of a gift card for a specific store. Finally, the orchid had gotten not into the best shape, and as I was taking it to our bedroom after, I fumbled it into the floor (although it was salvageable with just some mulch falling out).\n\nShe was silent, and I was honestly devastated. She started to explain the objections (listed above) but really just kept tearing into them. I got upset and she offered to cancel our dinner plans. I tried to keep it together, but she kept harping on the issues. It hurt because she had liked the other gift, and I had taken her out on an early Valentine's Day date (last weekend) that she had liked (and included other gifts). I just wished that as fair as her complaints were that she would just drop them.\n\nI cooled off, so we started to drive to our dinner plans. She went into it again that it felt like I hadn't put a lot of time into my gifts and that they were just grabbed last minute and that I might say otherwise that they actually had planning behind them but this is just how she felt and that it made her sad and frustrated that she had given me a thoughtful gift. I didn't say anything, and when we made it to the restaurant we were seated at the best table they had. The night went well after that. We had a good dinner, and we haven't talked about the gifts since.\n\nToday, she seemed fine going to work, but I've honestly felt spent emotionally. I had offered a cooking class as a makeup gift that she rejected (hoping to stick to our diets better post-Valentine's). I'm wondering what she is/isn't expecting me to do, and I'm just... like I said... spent. We had a fight two weeks ago (about a lack of intimacy from me) that had really just started getting over.\n\nSo, AITA for the gift, for getting upset, or otherwise?",

On Tuesday I decided to have a little fun so I sent him a sexy picture in the morning, a couple of hours later he responded so I sent back a flirty text, then he sent me a picture of his own to which I responded with a flirty text of my own. This was at 2pm. He did not get back to me till 9pm that night, and I was feeling sad and rejected so I called him out on it and told him you can tell a lot by a guys responsiveness on how interested they are. He said his job is busier and much more demanding than most jobs out there so I responded with how it doesnt matter and how he doesnt owe me anything since we barely know each other but a simple text telling my he is busy and we can talk later would have been enough. He hasnt gotten back to me since. So am I the asshole here?",

My freshmen year this guy with disability's walked up to me (Lets call him S for story) and said \"what's up Josh.\" I had no idea how he knew my name. Me not wanting to be an asshole I responded with \"what's good dude.\" I had no idea who S was or how S knew my name but I went on with it for the rest of the year. Halfway through my sophomore year S asked me for my phone number and so I gave it to him. S then proceeded to text me a lot and I went with it not wanting to be an asshole. But the it started to get weird and very uncomfortable. S would start texting me multiply times saying \" I miss you so much.\" \"Can we please have a sleepover just the two of us.\" S facetimes me every night and if I don't answer like I'm not near my phone he keeps on calling until I pick up or just stops after 20 times. (not exaggerating) Please help because I don't want to be an ass but it has gone a little too far and making me feel uncomfortable.",

      "description": "So, I’m a frequenter of subreddits like r/insanepeoplefacebook and r/vaxxhappened because I find them both entertaining and aggravating. I’ll even listen to reddit readings on YouTube while I’m doing other things. My mom happens to be a NICU nurse (for those who don’t know that means she takes care of sick and/or premature babies), so I’ve had plenty of discussions on this subject. However, I’ve only ever discussed it myself with people who hold the same opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I was browsing my Facebook feed this morning and happened to see that my childhood friend’s mom shared an article titled “What You Didn’t Know About the Aborted Baby Parts in Your Vaccines.” I was shocked because I hadn’t expected to see something that looked like it came straight out of an anti-vax subreddit video on my own Facebook, much less from someone I’ve known for 18 years, but there it was. I skimmed the article and, of course, found it filled with claims like aborted fetal matter being in the chicken pox vaccine, that you can’t be pro-life and pro-vax at the same time, and lots of religious overtones (I am religious myself btw).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI commented on the post, asking her to please not share “fake news” and concluded with “don’t fall into the anti-vax trap.” I was a little harsh in my overall reply, but not rude. After commenting, I decided to message the friend whose mom it was that posted the article. I opened with “your mom is sharing anti-vax articles on Facebook,” expecting a funny convo or at least an interesting conversation. I wanted to know how she felt about it, but her response surprised me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently, her mom has always been anti-vax and my friend hasn’t been vaccinated either. I wasn’t expecting this, and it threw me for a loop because I had assumed she was pro-vax and had started off the conversation with an already negative undertone concerning anti-vaxxers. She asked what I expected her to do about her mom posting stuff like that I told her that I didn’t expect her to do anything, I just don’t like that false and dangerous information is being spread so casually. I told her I just wanted her take on it and she said that it’s her mom’s business and even if she didn’t agree that she would appreciate it if I didn’t come after her about it. I apologized and told her that I just have very strong views on the subject. She tells me off by saying that even if I don’t agree with something, I shouldn’t come off so aggressively, especially since it has nothing to do with her. I apologized again, saying that I didn’t mean anything rude by it and the conversation was left at that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis exchange totally ruined my morning and I feel really shitty about the whole thing. I don’t regret commenting on the Facebook post and I still feel very strongly about vaccines, but I feel really bad about unintentionally involving my friend because I didn’t know she wasn’t pro-vax like me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation??",

Now I'm 11th grade and we don't see each other often because she goes to another school now. \n\nWhen she left, I was kind of relieved because she was not a good friend; she was extremely jealous of my success (e.g. good marks, etc), she was negative literally all the times, complaining about how hard her life is and how she hates everything. \nShe basically ruined my mood every day. \n\nShe also wanted (rather demanded) me to pay for her lunch. At first I was okay with that because I thought she didn't have much money, but that wasn't the case, she just didn't want to spend hers. If I didn't buy her lunch, she would be extremely upset and unfriendly towards me. \n\nAnother thing is that she did not respect any opinion other than her own, basically when I told her about my music taste, she just said how awful and bad it sounds etc. I respected her opinions all the times, because who am I to judge other's opinions on stuff? Whenever I confronted her about a this stuff, she denied and denied and I wasn't able to really talk to her about it. \n\nSo, to come to the actual point (sorry for the long text), she recently wanted to meet up with me for the weekend but I didn't really felt like meeting her. She texted me and sended me voice mails but neither did I listen to them nor answer her. \nI don't plan to ever meet her again because of what she \"did\" to me.

      "description": "So this all just happened but first some back story, my wife and i live at one of her grandmothers properties and we have 2 beagles, 3 cats and we just recently took in my childhood poodle because unfortunately my mom is struggling  (we hadnt told MIL). So my wife and i had plans to go to target and get dinner after she got off work at 7:10 at around 7:20 when her eta is about 10mins i get 2 calls one from her sister and another from her telling me that her mom, dad and siblings were going to drop by although its sort of last minute im cool with it. \n\nWife gets home and soon after her family arrives as soon as they walk in they all see my poodle and start saying hello and giving her love and what not, all except MIL who get visibly upset and goes to say hello to my beagles. My wife goes with her and i stay in the living room with everyone else.  i sit to play smash bros with her brother while her dad and sister give love to my cats and then i hear her mom start to complain and talk mess and then she lets the beagles in which normally is fine but not when she can visibly see that they're slightly muddy. \n\nSo my wife becomes upset and all MIL does is laugh and say ohh they just want love, i let it slide and keep playing with her brother and then she sits and starts talking and the conversation went like this :\n\nMIL: so did you already eat? \n\nWife : no, we were gonna go to the store \n\nMe: yeah we had plans to go to target and then dinner since its friday \n\nThen i jokingly say that they are always welcome but need to give us atleast a one day notice before coming over and then i laugh and she responds with no youre not joking and we're not welcome and she sits down and start complaining about how we have too many pets and that we'll never be able to move anywhere else even though she knows we have plans to buy our own place in the next year or so and follows that with why did you take in the poodle why couldnt someone else take her or an animal shelter. As soon as she said animal shelter i got so upset i just blurted out thats so horrible at which point she got so upset she got up grabbed her things, ignored my wifes pleas to please sit down and just continue to talk and told everyone it was time to leave. \n\nThey leave and of course that leads to me and my wife arguing about it because she thinks that i shouldve kept my mouth shut all together and i think that MIL needs to take criticism as well as she dishes it out. What do you guys think? Am i the asshole here? \n\nP.s sorry for formatting and wall of text. Im on mobile \n\n",

I feel like a complete asshole for doing this but I honestly cannot sit around and pretend this isn't happening. Being someone who wasn't originally vaccinated (when I was born there were quite a few vaccines that were proven to cause sudden infant death syndrome) and now is fully vaccinated, I understand where the belief stemmed from and also now know that it is a non-issue.

      "description": "TLDR: My sister backed into my car (no functional damage, just some minor denting etc.) and she can’t pay for the repairs, so I assumed my parents would be paying. \n\nBackground: \nI’m a college student, and just bought a car in August. It’s not new, but it’s my first nicer car that will hopefully last a while. I wasn’t originally planning on buying a car until after graduation. But a friend of mine got me a crazy good deal on one I really like, so I went for it. \n\nStory:\nI came home for the holidays pretty late at night because of my finals schedule. I parked in the driveway, where I always do, since there isn’t room in the garage. My younger sister, who has been driving for just about a year, had to work very early the next morning and ended up backing into my car as she was leaving.\n\nOf course her car is larger than mine so it wasn’t damaged, but my car took a minor hit. The area near the gas cap is dented in about half an inch, as well as part of the fender/bumper (sorry, not super good with cars), and one of the bolts that secures the taillight snapped so it is sticking out a bit. \n\nMy parents told me about it later and my sister apologized. I took the car to a few places and got quotes on the repair (~$1200). I told my parents about the pricing, and asked them if they’d be able to have it fixed before I go back to school. \n\nWell, my parents were very upset that I assumed they would be paying for the damage. They said after all they’ve done for me they couldn’t believe I got would let them pay. \n\nThis is the first ‘accident’ I’ve ever been involved in so I’m not sure how it should be handled. I’m pretty sure my parents wouldn’t make my sister pay for the damages, as she just recently got her first job and doesn’t have very much saved up. \n\nBut I’m not sure if I’m responsible to pay either. I don’t think I was at fault, however it is my car and I am the one who wants the car fixed even though it isn’t technically necessary. I still have a few years of college/housing left, so I probably wouldn’t be able to get it fixed anytime soon if I were paying. \n\nAITA for wanting them to pay?\n\n(Sorry for any formatting issues, I’m on mobile.)",

      "description": " \n\nI go to an online school now, and my aunt got a job there too. Receptionist I think. Teachers there are not required to put grades in as soon as an assignment is done, so completed assignments may go ungraded for 4-5 days. Near the end of each semester my aunt would get very pushy, and it was a little annoying, but still tolerable and understandable because from her end, she saw all these ungraded assignments. The really annoying part is that she would tell my mom, my mom would get mad, and then argue with me about how I'm lying to her. After a few more days, the grades would show up, and everyone would be happy again. 2 semesters in, I talked to my aunt about not believing the initial grade, and giving it another few days. Nothing changed for the next 3 semesters. This last one, she caused the biggest fight between my mother and I. That night I just took my daily and raced around some back roads for a few hours, came home, and stayed up til 1 am in my shop. Later that day I confronted my aunt, over text because she’s an hour away and didn’t feel like enough of a dick to call her during her working hours.\n\nMe: **You need to stop dragging mom into your disbelief of my grades. I'm sick and fucking tired of fighting with her every single grading period because you tell her I'm failing classes and not doing shit. I understand it's part of your job to let her know, but try doing what you said you’d do, and give whatever grade you're seeing a shred of doubt before you go getting mom mad at me. This is the fifth time I've dealt with this bullshit.**\n\n​\n\nHer immediate response: **Stop acting like a 7 year old so I don't have to and we won't keep having these conversations. Because u do have an F in math. And you are going to have to take it again. Your fine in English and I told her that too. Trust me kid, you ate not the only one tired of thessle conversations. I want nothing more than to let you go. Sorry that I don't want you to fail. It's hard to watch and I cry a lot when you do.**\n\n**​**\n\n**I have a better idea. I am done. You're 17, you have it all figured out. I love you and i always will, but I am not your parent and this has ruined our friendship. So I am done. If you want help you can ask. Things have gotten too complicated and messy.**\n\n**And I think that we shouldn't talk for the next week so we can both cool off. That's best.**\n\n​\n\nThe spelling is exactly as it was in the texts. And it may not be necessary information, but she is an obese and single 30 year old living in a house paid for by my grandma and spends her paychecks on The Sims and City Skylines. Drives a Hyundai Sonata bought using my grandpa’s money, and has an anxious dog that she feeds pot pills to. I work on a farm and own a mustang, sunfire, and continental and plan on buying and restoring an old run down house after college. \n\nThe only reason I put that in is to vent a little bit.",

This didn't work and has spread it onto the resin drive and I don't know if we will be able to remove all the stains. \n\nBoss has said that I'm not allowed to drive to work anymore &amp; however much it costs to fix it to the customers satisfaction (if he notices) will be coming out of my wage.

Fast forward about an hour, and the two of us are making out. Up till now, things are going fine. At this point, neither of us have spoken in a bit, and she slowly reaches her hand down to my private area and starts to unzip my pants. At this point I'm not really ready for something like this, but admittedly I don't say anything or express visible discomfort, but she also hasn't asked me if this is ok. Eventually she fully unzips and tentatively but softly grasps my member from the outside of my underwear, then slowly (I guess because I haven't protested) seems like she's going to reach inside. At this point I'm uncomfortable enough to state that I'm not ready for that. She stops for a second then apologizes, but at this point I'm pretty upset and I zip up, then I ask her to leave. She looks visibly upset for a second but then leaves. The next day she texts back to check in, and I'm sort of feeling bad. I tell her that I felt pretty uncomfortable with what she'd been doing, and she says that I should've said something. I reply that I wished she'd asked first and not just presume and borderline assault me. \n\nAs soon as I send that text I regret it. While that was what what I was in the moment thinking, I feel I shouldn't have sent that. She immediately gets tetchy and says that I should just be communicative and not throw around words like that. I argue that she's the one who should be communicative. Predictably the conversation derails at that point and she stops responding\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

I’ve gotten mad and shown him it really bothers me. It’s like he does it on purpose knowing it pisses me off, and then when I get upset he wonders why? And then calls me sensitive. This is becoming old very quickly. I don’t want to break up but I also don’t want to deal with that shit. It’s negativity that I really don’t need in my life.

      "description": "For the record, I have chronic pain. My daily average is a seven. For an idea of what I live with, my recent hysterectomy did not change my daily pain number at all. But even with the diagnoses of psoriatic arthritis I do not meet the criteria for pain control. It's so bad that some days it feels like induced labor hurts less. So I turned to medical marijuana (recreational just became legal, but I still get a card.) My husband knows what I live with, he's taken me to the ER when the pain was so bad I was screaming, and he had to practically carry me in. But now that he's back to work he seems bothered by the idea of me using it on the worst days. I'm trying to avoid it, but my options currently are excedrin migraine, CBD/THC salve, heat/ice, and dark rooms for the daily migraines. None of these are very effective, so I'm combining  them, but that brings my number down by one, if I'm lucky. When I can manage to get it down to a six I'm on top of the world, I can get stuff done, I feel great. But the tools currently at my disposal make it hard because they don't work as well as I'd like. Plus once I'm back on meds for the psoriatic arthritis I'm not supposed to take the excedrin migraine, which is also for my migraines, which I'm also struggling to get treated. I'm honestly not looking to get massively stoned. I'm looking to help get me out of bed on the days the pain is so bad getting out of bed to use the bathroom ten feet away makes me cry. Basically rubbing some salve on+a small bowl (think a monkey pipe) are enough to bring it down to where I can do that without crying. But my husband seems upset by this idea. Honestly now that the bad weather is almost done with it won't be that often. But I'm still facing this massive block with him where he seems to think I'm terrible for wanting to be able to do things with less pain, especially with him wondering how chores will get done now. So AITA for wanting to do more than lay in bed crying on my worst days, and be a semi-functional adult?\n\nTL;DR I struggle with chronic pain no one will treat, but my husband is acting like I'm an asshole for wanting to use mmj on occasion during the day when my pain level hits the non functional level.

I have stayed in my small town working a dead end job and going to community college. Not complaining about that lifestyle I just want to experience more while I’m young. My family is a disaster, pretty much always has been. My parents have always struggled with addiction and siblings as well. I’m the only one in my family who’s gone to college and wants to get out of our small town. \nMy dad was diagnosed with leukemia last year,  a month before I was supposed to leave for bootcamp. I’ve stayed another year helping as much as I can but the doctors say he’s on track to be cancer free by the end of the year. He still guilt trips me saying I haven’t helped enough financially and that I should take over his business (which I know nothing about). I am just struggling. I’m scheduled to leave June 4th. I’m going to do it, just really wanted to know if its me being selfish. \n\nSome of my friends support my decision and say it will be good for me. But I can’t help but feel guilt. I have a little brother and I want him to have it better than I did growing up. He seems to be going down the same path as my parents already though. I worry for him 24/7.

      "description": "We had a baby less than six months ago and have no other kids. A couple months ago, we moved out of my parent's home and into a different city a few hours away. About a week or two after moving in, he took up a full time job (previously self-employed) where he regularly works 8 to 12 hour shifts. He gets maybe two days off a week. I am currently self-employed and I can only work when he's off since we don't have anyone to sit for her. \n\nHowever, I'm finding watching her 24/7 to be exhausting. I have severe anxiety issues and recently went through some depressing events that have made it even worse. I feel somewhat disappointed in myself because this stage of her life should be easy, especially if I have nothing else to do all day, yet it feels like even doing basic chores is difficult. I've also been having anger issues that are out of character for me, and I get scared that I could end up hurting her even though I know I wouldn't do that. \n\nIf the baby is still awake by the time my husband gets off work, or on his off days, I beg him to watch her for a while. I feel bad for doing this knowing that he has worked all day, and I usually wait at least an hour or so for him to settle in and relax before I ask. A lot of the time, he'll usually point out that he's worked all day and I haven't, but I'm just so exhausted. I know he works hard but taking care of a baby on your own can be hard work too. I don't think I am expecting a lot, but I still feel guilty just for asking. (Personally, I don't think my husband is an asshole for not wanting to watch her after work.) AITA? ",

      "description": "So just to give everyone a bit of context here, my father recently passed away and had life insurance, but because he passed away in his workplace me and my brother received more money than that of his life insurance policy.\nThis was 3 months ago and its only recently we've received payments. \nSo after a huge argument with my younger brother about how it's getting divided(as he also wanted to keep my dad's house as well as 50%) we eventually settled on receiving upwards of £300,000 each and the house on both our names. \n\nGrowing up and through my adult life I have always been independent but not always financially well off (earn around £24k per year) so having this amount of money is new to me but ever since receiving the money my fiance has been very suggestive as to how it should be spent (holidays, house, cars etc) \n\nI agreed that some of the money should be spent on a house as that means I would not have rent or mortgage to pay in the long run, giving us our monthly earnings as extra income. \n\nSo whilst discussing this with my fiance of 2 years I said that I would only like the house to be in my name until we're at least married or have kids, but she totally freaked out at me calling me selfish and saying that I think she's a gold digger and that I don't trust her. I tried explaining to her that although it would be in my name she wouldn't have to pay anything towards rent and our cars so financially she'd have a lot more income from her work to support her, but she never wanted to listen. I tried again to reiterate to her and she hit out with \"I don't feel like I would like to have kids with someone who doesn't trust me enough to put my name on our house\" \n\nThis really got to me. \n\nBefore my father's passing we always had a mutual agreement that we would keep our finances separate as long as we both paid equally towards our rent costs and bills, So I don't understand how her views have changed now, even though she wouldn't have a penny to pay outgoings except for minor household costs she seems really persistent on being a joint owner of our house. \n\nIt's now 3 days later and I'm lucky if my fiancé has said 5 words to me since and is no longer answering my phone or texts. \n\ntl;dr before inheriting life insurance from my dad's policy we had separate finances, now that I have it my fiancé wants to be part owner of the car and house we buy, AITA for refusing to do this before we get married? \n",

      "description": "Pretty much title. Also sorry if formatting is bad, I am on mobile.\n\nSome background info: My sister graduated from high school last year, and I'm currently a sophomore in high school right now. She is pretty smart, and is on her last semester for community college. She then plans to get a masters in Biology.\n\nSo with this program at my high school, I'm able to take classes at my community college. Me and my sister decided to take a Chemistry 111 class together because I need it for the associate degree I'm going for and so does she. I just had high school chem last year, so everything comes pretty easy  to me, plus the fact that I love the physical sciences, while she had that class about 3 years ago, and hates the physical sciences.\n\nSo every time we do partner work, she always ask questions, and I try to explain. She never listens to my explanations, or says she doesn't get it. It's gotten fairly annoying, as every time I try to walk her through it, she gets mad and says I'm treating her like she is dumb. \n\nShe borderline threw a fit when I started working ahead because I didn't want to wait for her to finish. She constantly ask me, \"is this right?\", on like every problem, and then gets mad at if I got it wrong. And every time I try to tell her to just trust what she has and stop asking me eveytime she finishes 1 problem she gets mad.\n\nAm I being an asshole? Am I doing something wrong here?",

      "description": "We're a small software company, through 4 rounds of funding, but still relying on investments as we haven't been able to sign clients. The few clients we have, 30% are stable, 30% are going out of business quickly, and the rest are unhappy and looking at competitors. Our company is very top heavy, so out of the 10 of us, I handle 30% of operations. Our most senior engineer is leaving in the fall as his wife is pregnant and he wants a job closer to come.\n\n I'm having a lot of guilty thoughts about potentially wanting to jump ship to a more stable/less annoying job - most of my work is data analysis so I could leave my scripts to someone else to pick up, and write extensive notes on all operations to be used in my absence. I've been there a little less than 2 years, and our financial situation has been Rocky at best the entire time (at one point we didn't have an office and were encouraged to get paid in stock options). \n\nI feel some loyalty to this company because 1) they're so small 2) most people that are there were hired before me 3) they offered me a job after I was laid off a second time and wanted to transition to analytics, understanding that it would take time for me to pick it up (now I'm wondering if they simply hired me because I'm cheaper learning than someone who is experienced) 4) like I said, the most senior engineer is leaving in the fall so he's already started transcribing his work notes. \n\nI want to leave because 1) we are financially unstable 2) the benefits are bad i.e. I need therapy badly but can't afford it with the health insurance 3) the culture drains me - very quiet engineers cramped into a tiny room with no windows while I'm an extroverted female empath 4) my work doesn't interest me other than it can very occasionally be engaging 5) no room for professional development - I'd love to go to grad school or join women in engineer groups but I don't want to even ask because we're so broke 6) the morale is very bad lately -- we have been stuck arguing with some clients and it feels like that's all anyone talks about 6) one of the other engineer makes me very uncomfortable -- he literally screams on the phone when he is frustrated and no one says... Anything - it honestly gives me anxiety even thinking about it (had temperamental parents see therapy above ha) 7) one of the newer coworkers has begun harassing me and a couple other engineers because we didn't just March Madness in FRONT of management but nobody chimes in...\n\nDang I could go on, I apologize for ranting, I guess AITA for wanting out?

      "description": "Basically every single Sunday my parents wake up and wake me up so we can go to church. I’ve expressed my hatred for church numerous times. It is so boring, and I just straight up don’t believe in Christianity. I’m 100% atheist and they’re aware of this. I’ve told them before. For some reason though, every single Sunday, I’m still woken up at 8:30 and told I have to be ready for church in 30 minutes. \n\nHonestly I’m just sick of it. It’s been going on for months now. As a kid my family never went to church and it’s like 4-5 years ago they just decided that we’re a good Christian family now and need to go to church if not every Sunday, then at least every Sunday we can make it to. I didn’t really mind it untill recently because I have a job now and am out late most Saturday’s and lazy ass Sunday mornings with cartoons and cereal in my bed is starting to sound real nice. \n\nHonestly I don’t have anything against this church or even going to church on Sunday besides the fact that it’s a waste of a morning, I have to wake up extra early, and I just don’t believe in it. Every time I argue with my mom she always says “its family time church is one of the few times we’re all together as a family” which is just absolute BS. We eat dinner together as a family just about every single night, we do family game nights and family movie night, we go visit other family as a family together, we host parties and invite family friends over and spend family time together. We spend a lot of time together as a family. Not to mention that it’s church. We’re not going to go fishing as a family every Sunday. I wouldn’t be opposed to that at all because that’s actually fun and is actually spending time together. \n\nI hate her argument because church isn’t about coming together and spending time with your family. It’s about praising and worshiping a god I don’t believe in. She doesn’t make me sing the hymns or say anything out loud, but she’s expressed in the past that she’d prefer if I did, and literally doing nothing but just standing for 30 minutes straight there isn’t much of a step up from singing some stupid hymns. \n\nI’m just absolutely sick of it. We got in this argument yesterday where she basically decided that since I’m not 18, I don’t get to choose to go to church or not.  I think that’s a terrible way to do things. I don’t think you should force your child to come praise some god he doesn’t believe in. \n\nIdk. Maybe I’m wrong about all of this and I am the asshole. \n\nTL;DR: I don’t believe in god but my mom makes me go to church every week because we’re “spending family time” and I’m sick of it. ",

      "title": "AITA for getting mad that my boyfriend keeps giving our money to his siblings?",
      "description": "My boyfriend and his siblings have a great relationship. We all have a good time when together and I like spending time with them. He’s newly 18 and I’m 17. We’re saving up for an apartment, which has been difficult because for unrelated reasons we can’t get a job. But, we’ve managed to save quite a bit, enough to move out of my parents house. \n\nHe talks to his siblings everyday. We’re currently in his brother (20M)  and sister’s (25? F) town visiting. They don’t live together and both have partners. His brother recently lost his job and is being supported by his girlfriend. His sister and her boyfriend have three kids and neither of them have a job. He also has another brother (23? M) who has three kids and doesn’t have a job. His girlfriend does. \n\nSo long story short, most of them time he talks to them, they want money. Usually it’s for a good reason so I don’t mind as much, because I spend our money on random things too. \n\nHis sister often says she wants it for diapers, food, etc. Same with his oldest brother. His other brother doesn’t ask as much but one time he asked us for $25 everyday for a week straight. \n\nEach time we send money, there’s a $6.50 fee because it’s western union. So we’re spending $30-$35 every few days. Sometimes his sister asks for upwards of $60 which I really get mad about, because it’s just too much. \n\n Here’s the thing: every single one of them is a habitual weed smoker. They need weed everyday to function. It’s a terrible habit that even my boyfriend has. So when they ask for money for food and diapers or whatever, I usually don’t believe it. I think it’s for weed. Because 3.5 grams of weed is $25 where I live. Why would they need $25 exactly for food or diapers or whatever? \n\nI deal with it because I love his family and I love him, and I spend probably twice as much by ordering food or shit from amazon. But recently it’s just been really annoying and idk if I’m being an asshole or not. All three of them said they were going to pay us back for the most recent money we gave them. His brother said he’ll pay us when he gets his last paycheck. He just got it and we didn’t see a cent of it. He didn’t even offer giving any back. His other brother said he’ll give us some when he got his tax return. Guess what? Didn’t get it.. but here he is flaunting all of this stuff he bought on FaceTime. His sister swore up and down she’d pay us the $40 back when her boyfriend’s parents come. Guess what we got? $20 and a .7 of weed that we gave them.. \n\nI’m just fed up but second guessing if I’m overreacting. I don’t have a close relationship with my sibling as much so I’d never do this. Idk if this is normal, because when I express how they never pay us back and I’m tired of giving them money, he gets irritated and doesn’t want to talk about it. \n\nAITA? Sorry this is all over the place. Kinda ranting I guess ",

      "description": "So my friend who we will call X asked me to be one of his groomsmen for his wedding. I was happy to be as we had been friends for years. Now a short time after this X asks me and our other friend (who we will call Q) about going shopping soon for suits as X had a cheap suit he wanted us all to get.\n\nMe and Q were thinking it was a bit early for suit shopping and ended up asking, hey what's going on here? X told us at that point that the wedding would be in about 6-7 weeks.\n\nX then dropped it on us that we would be paying for the suits. Me and Q were a bit wtf at this point because he didn't ask us, just told us. But we at the time let it slide because the suits weren't that expensive that he was looking at and we both agreed we needed new ones anyway.\n\nNow when we went to have a look at the suits, they only fit one of us and they just didn't have any other sizes. So off we go on the hunt and eventually we get to a place that has suits that fit us, but were more expensive, which for me wasn't to much of a problem as I was working. But the groom paid for the other suits on the day and said Q could pay him back. I paid for mine and Q agreed he would pay back like $50 a week. While me and Q felt a bit off as again X had never once asked if we were happy paying this and just kinda forced it on us, we again agreed we could live with it as we both needed new suits. But we had been clear that we wouldn't be spending anymore than what we had just spent on the suits, we told this to X.\n\nThings progressed and X was suddenly bugging Q a lot saying he needs to hurry and pay back the money. Q is like wtf as they had agreed to a payment plan.\n\nX then starts adding more things that he has bought that we have to pay for (Shoes and such) even after we had said we were only paying for the suits. Me and Q have had enough and tell him that the suits were one thing but this is overboard now.  We told X we wouldn't be paying for the extra stuff he had gotten as he hadn't discussed it with us. X wasn't happy and said he assumed I would be paying because I have a job. This pissed me off and I pushed back on how that doesn't matter.\n\nBy the end after talking he agreed we wouldn't need to pay for the extra stuff and Q could just make payments and then he left. The next day while i was working he texted asking if he could come pick up some wedding things he had left at mine, I said sure. Later I got another text from him saying that it was his day and me and Q couldnt be groomsmen (but seems we could still come to the wedding) and had returned everything he had bought for us. That he couldn't have groomsmen that weren't going to pay as he needed the money.\n\nAfter this we stopped talking as X attitude during all that just tipped us over the edge and we were done with his selfishness.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to pay for any of this and getting annoyed my friend kept adding things so we owed him more and more money? Without any discussion with us.",

      "description": "The title sound like I'm a jerk, but please read for the full story:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy SO and I were hanging out with two other couples.  For background, all three couples live together in our late 20's, and intend to get married someday in the near-ish future, but no proposals yet or anything. But the main focus was one couple in particular who are good friends of mine.  I'll call them FriendLady and FriendGuy.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're all in a room chatting, girls having a chat, and guys having a chat slightly in our own corners, but can overhear each other's conversations.  FriendGuy starts telling my BF something about \"diamonds can be lab-made now and they look virtually the same as a non-lab diamond\".  FriendLady turns away from our conversation, towards FriendGuy, and states very aggressively \"don't get any ideas, they are NOT the same\".  FriendGuy just chuckled, and took it well.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriendLady returns to the girl conversation, and asks me \"so are you and \\[SO\\] getting engaged anytime soon?\" And I said \"I'm not sure, that's his call.  He knows the ring I want and all that, but I'm fine waiting and want to be surprised.\"  She wanted to know more about the ring I wanted, so I answered honestly.  I said \"I actually don't want a diamond, just a really simple 1-ct white sapphire is my preference.  I think the one I want is about $300, which saves us a lot of money.\"  Then FriendLady addresses this with FriendGuy and tells him not to \"get any ideas\" (implying she still wanted a big diamond).  FriendGuy was chill about it, but the whole vibe got weird.  It felt like she was pretty disgruntled with my opinion, and then my own SO piped in, with what seemed like him backing me up, gave me a high-five, and said something like \"and that's why I love you\".  FriendLady said, \"well, you're not normal\".  I don't THINK she meant this as a diss (I'm historically the friend in the group who doesn't subscribe to as many social norms), but it felt like I maybe pissed her off.  AITA for sharing an opinion I knew she disagreed with? ",

      "title": "AITA for being a bit upset at my SO's weekly use of PTO?",
      "description": "My SO and I are both in our late 20s and moved across country in order for him to have more work opportunity. He currently works a labor-intensive job with a typical 4-10 schedule most weeks and very few holidays. I work as a tutor, and I work six days a week with a lot of additional prep work between/after sessions both out and from home.\n\nMy big issue is our different kinds of work ethic, I suppose. He's a hard worker, and I respect him very much for the work he does. He's regularly trying for promotions and other means to better his position, in hopes to ultimately get a better job. That is by no means the issue.\n\nBut nearly every week, sometimes twice a week, he uses his PTO to just sleep in. And it isn't just at the end of the works week. He's using it today after being off for his three day weekend, likely because he stayed up too late playing video games. When I ask him about it, he says he just didn't feel good or was tired (well of course, you went to bed at 2am knowing you had to get up for work in 5 hours). Or he'll claim he was feeling unusually sick (conveniently for 1-3hrs). However it develops, his argument ultimately boils down to \"It's PTO, it's fine because I'm still getting paid.\" Then he gets mad at me for being upset.\n\nThis just doesn't sit well with me. Both of my parents run their own businesses and work easily 60+hrs a week. I've grown up with their devotion to making it work and dealing with working tired/sore/sick. Stayed up too late? Too bad, still need to go in. My work is much the same way. If I decide to binge games until 2am, I still have to meet that college student or have that online session with a student three time zones ahead. \n\nIn all those situations we don't get paid if we're not there to make it happen, and seeing him get paid to basically sleep in or not go at all just ticks me off. To me, that time is supposed to be accrued for when you're really sick and out of sick days, for holidays together, for a chance to go home and see our families that now live 2500 miles away. But instead he burns through it to sleep in and passes it off as okay because he still gets the same amount of money as if he went into work on time.\n\nI don't say anything anymore. I just suck it up and grumble, but it does bother me. I do legitimately believe that he's just abusing the system and selfishly using his accrued time.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for being upset over how my SO uses his PTO?\n\nTL;DR - SO works a labor heavy job and often uses his PTO to sleep in, even after having a weekend off. He thinks it's fine because it's paid. This bothers me because I grew up with a different work ethic and think PTO should be saved for important events like birthdays/extending holidays/seeing family. AITA?",

      "description": "My older brother is a 23 year old man living with autism (actually I’m  pretty sure it would be what most people consider Asperger’s, but that’s not a diagnosed condition anymore, as far as I know).  I have always been very defensive of him, since we are very close age and he has always been an easy target for bullies, but as we’ve grown up I’ve been both proud and surprised by his personal, academic, and professional successes.  He currently still lives at home with our parents.\n\nHe has several friends, and most of them are pretty cool, but there is one in particular, who we’ll call J.  J  is also an adult with autism, and he hangs out with my brother pretty frequently.   To give a little relevant background on J, he is working  on a book.  My brother emailed me a copy of the manuscript and it’s about on par with bad fanfiction.  J also perpetually wears a fedora and poorly fitting clothes.\n\nNow, I’ve been around them and J always talks to my brother with kind of a dick-ish  tone, but I had never heard or seen him do anything mean enough to my  brother to call him out on it, and my brother is very passive so he  never says anything about it.  That was until one time I was home from  college for a weekend, and my parents were both out of the house. I was  studying in the kitchen quietly.  I think J assumed I had left as well, because while he and my brother were in the other room playing a video  game I heard him call my brother a “fucking idiot.”\n\nAt  this point I was pretty pissed, so I call out “Hey, J.”  But he doesn’t  answer. I’m pretty sure he was processing the fact that I was still  home and heard what he said.\n\nI call his  name again, and he tells me he’s “a little busy.” Now I’d had it. I got up and went into the room with them, and I told him he’s not going to  talk to my brother like that, especially not in our own house.  He told  me he has no idea what I’m talking about, and “it’s not your house, it’s  your parents house.” Now, I’m beyond angry but I manage to keep my voice down and explain what I heard, and J calls me names and cussed at  me, so I tell him he needs to leave before I call the police.\n\nHe  gets up to leave but as he’s at the door he turns around and apologizes  to my brother for the way he was talking to him. My brother’s eyes are  on the floor, but he accepts the apology. I tell him “thanks for  apologizing,” but as I look over at my brother who is incredibly  embarrassed my blood starts to boil. So I look back at J and add: “but  just so you know, your hat is stupid, your shirt is too big, and your  book fucking sucks, so get off your high horse around my brother.”   After that he sat down on the couch and started crying.\n\nI  left a little bit later, and got a call from my mom who told me I might  want to tell him I didn’t mean that stuff, because apparently he stayed  for dinner and started crying again over it. Honestly I feel kind of  bad about it, but I didn’t ever apologize or take it back, because I  still think he deserved it. And my brother told me he was glad I stuck  up for him.",

      "description": "A week back, I was walking home from school, where an old man was stood, shaking and struggling to carry his things. I offered to take his bags and help him walk wherever he needed. It turned out he was on his way to the hearing clinic, a 2 minute walk away for someone my age and health. The trip ended up taking an hour, and we sat down every 5 minutes, so he could catch his breath - I didn’t mind, I was happy to help and talk with him about his life. On one of our stops, he begins telling me about how his wife died a few weeks ago, his house was broken into and the police took his license. I greeted this conversation with sympathy and let him pour out his feelings. \n\nOn one of our last little stops before the clinic, he asks my age, and I told him I was 18, he looked shocked and I told him I don’t look 18 because I don’t dress it (I look very young and wear no makeup, coupled with track pants and men’s shirts) he then laughed and said “how do you look when you’re undressed?” i brushed his comment off with a laugh and explained to him what I meant. This was the first red flag, I’ll mention we are on the main street of my city and there are MANY people around. He was also making very blatant racist comments and telling me how beautiful my fair skin is. \n\nAbout a minute later, he starts forcefully rubbing above the crotch area of my pants, I move away from him but he continues, I took his hand off of me and told him it wasn’t okay, with a laugh, out of nervousness and I didn’t want to hurt his feelings after what he’s been through, although he responded with “why isn’t it okay?”.\n\nAfter this I uncomfortably walked him the full way to the clinic and then left, I called my friend straight after and cried on the phone to him in public, not because of what had happened to me, but because this man had such a hard life, and that I don’t know who else would have helped him if not for me. I felt too ashamed and embarrassed to say he had touched me, and i don’t know if it’s my place to say anything. \n\nMy friend says to report it to the police, but the man has been so much recently, I don’t know if he was just grooming me, though. This man also gave me his address and told me to visit him. He was well aware I am still a student.  Will I be the asshole if I make a police report?  Am I the asshole for feeling like a victim? ",

I've been dating my girlfriend for the past year and a half and we love each other very much and have reached a point in our relationship where we are genuinely thinking about our future but I'm uncertain about our future due to how my family acts around the situation. \n\nI'm British born to Nigerian parents and unfortunately most of the time the attitude of marrying a non-Nigerian is still something looked down upon, when trying to talk to my parents about this I'm often met with discussion ending in how I would be disowned from the entire family should this happen and that they have no interest in even meeting her. It's all very disheartening for me especially when one of the few family who I felt like I could always find support in (one of my uncles) shared the same view, especially as I didn't perceive this to be that much of an issue when we started dating but I was sorely mistaken.\n\nI've talked to my girlfriend about this before and she understands it may be difficult but despite this she willing to still try. \n\nMy issue is I feel like eventually I will be made to make a decision between her and my family and it really gets to me. It's been causing me to have panic attacks at times and has been a constant plague on my mind. This has led to a few times where I've considered ending things with my girlfriend because as much as I love her the potential lack of support from my entire family that could happen has put some doubt in our future together.\n\nI'm at a loss here, I really do not what to do, I just wanna know if I'm an asshole for thinking like this.\n\nThanks for reading",

      "description": "Warning: very long post and backstory\nI made a Reddit account purely for this. You'll need some backstory for this too.\nMy father was violent and domestically abused my mum and I. His abuse towards my mother started when I was born and towards me when I was 7 and started siding with my mum. He had manipulated me to side with him and ignore my mum for the first 7 years of my life, therefore isolating her in a foreign country without any family to rely on and providing a daughter to hold hostage if my mum decided to call the police. (We had immigrated to the UK and all of our family was in another country. It took them 12 years to believe the stories my mum was telling them about my father) He was mentally ill but refused to receive any professional assistance; he knew of this fact too. His abuse worsend over the years and he was an alcoholic and eventually a gambler that wasted tens of thousands of pounds. This eventually lead to a restraining order and divorce. \n\nNow for a different story. My sister's. My sister ADORES my dad. If there was no restraining order, she would have left with him. He had masks which never cracked in front of others. A helpful, amiable mask for society, a funny, loving dad and then his true form. His masks were so good that the majority of our family friends think that it was my mum's fault. My sister is 9 years old btw. \n\nOne day, I was ill so I took the day off. My sister went to school. My mum was at work. At around 1:30pm, my mum called and said they were coming home because my sister's ear was hurting. We were slightly worried because she has had ear problems before and had to have surgery for it. Anyways, they went to see the doctor and were redirected towards hospital. I have a bug and a migraine at this point so I wasn't thinking straight. Calling my dad and informing him, who was probably working anyways, didn't even cross my mind. \nShe was discharged and life went on as usual. Two weeks later, my dad calls me to yell at me for not telling him. \"She is my daughter\", \"I am your father\", \"You don't care about your father\", \"You should have told me as soon as she was admitted\", etc. Calmly, I asked him why he hadn't called for 2 weeks and why he hadn't come to visit us even after the restraining order had ended 4 months ago. I handed the phone to my sister and had to sit down for a minute. \n\nOn New Years, I had gotten into an argument with him after he tried to drunkenly bully me over text after I had sent him a Happy New Years text. He had said quite a lot of stuff that was meant to hurt me. \n\nI have really been thinking over everything and I've started to see my faults. I should have informed him even if I had a grudge of sorts. Or I should have encouraged my sister more to call him.\n\nTL;DR AITA for not calling my abusive and neglectful dad about my sister's hospital visit due to a grudge?\n",

      "description": "I use a messaging app called Marco Polo for 90% of my communication these days. Think \"video walkie-talkie\" if you've never heard of it; you record a video message and they receive it, can be as short or long as you want, you can watch live or later, but you can't talk over each other.\n\nAnyway, my buddy has this annoying habit of sending these messages while he's eating. So he's talking whilst chewing and smacking his lips and pausing to swallow and take another bite, etc. He *never* does this in-person, but for some reason he does it a lot via Marco Polo.\n\nI think I'm a good communicator, so we've talked about it. I've let him know that it irks me. He's heard me, but he keeps doing it. I've gone from politely explaining that it's a personal pet peeve of mine and asking him to stop as a favour/compromise for a friend - to straight up yelling at him to stop being gross.\n\nI finally snapped the other day when we were in a group chat with him and my wife and he was doing it again. So when I finished his message, I responded by stating that I refuse to acknowledge or respond to anything he says while he's eating. I'd *previously* sent a much harsher message but I deleted it, and I'm pretty sure he didn't see it - but my wife did and she thought it was way overboard, and thought my altered version wasn't much better. Which led to this post.\n\nI get that it's a personal pet peeve of mine. I get that it's my problem and not his. It does not hinder my ability to understand what he's saying, and I rarely see the food in his mouth. But the *sounds* - my goodness the sounds are the stuff of gory horror movies to me. This app amplifies/equalises sounds like crazy, which is usually a very good thing. But I'm this specific situation, it makes me not want to talk to him on the app anymore because I don't know when I'll be affronted by his habit.\n\n**For context**; this us a very close friend who is now my co-worker. We're like brothers at this point - for better *and* worse. I have very few friends I'm this close to that I *also* \"fight\" with. I'm brutally honest with him when I feel it's necessary, because I know I don't have to play it safe seeing as our bond is strong enough. He's not as brutally honest with me because I'm a perfect human being who can do no wrong (/s), but he *does* take a lot of liberties with our relationship for the same reason I'm honest with him. As such, I feel like I've been coming down on him for various things over the last year that make me feel like a nagging parent, but at the same time I feel like he *needs* to hear that he's breaking a bunch of (what I consider to be) common decency/etiquette rules. I can give plenty of examples but this is awa already way too long.",

      "description": "In our High School we are fortunate enough to have a Gaming/VR Lab. We can go in there during Lunch/Resource and play games. The main attractions are Overwatch, League of Legends, Apex Legends, Smash Bros, and Fortnite.\n\nPersonally since I don’t usually have homework for Resource, I go and play Fortnite. It doesn’t have an E-Sport Team unlike Overwatch and LoL, but I just like to have fun. My teacher however, does not like Fortnite. I’d venture to say he hates it. And he hates that I play it.\n\nHe does like Apex however. And for the past 2 weeks he’s been pestering me about how “Fortnite is dead, Apex is better” and that I “should stop playing.” I’ve tried it. I think it’s an okay game, not my thing. I’ve said this to him multiple times, but never called it bad. But today he got on my last nerve.\n\nHe came over and said “Why would you wanna play Fortnite when Apex is on the computers?” I told him (again) that I enjoy Fortnite more. But then my frustration got the best of me when I asked him “What’s your issue with Fortnite? Why can’t 2 games be popular and people can enjoy multiple ones?” He looked back at me and gave me a weird look. Then said he didn’t mean to hurt my feelings. Which he didn’t, I just don’t like being pestered for the games I play. It’s not even the fact I solely play it either, I’ve played Overwatch and Smash, and even told him I’d try out for Rocket League.\n\nLater my friend says he told some of his class and a fellow teacher that I flipped out of him, when I didn’t. Sure I was frustrated, but I didn’t yell or try to be an asshole back.\n\nTL;DR - I like to play mainly Fortnite and some other games in our Gaming Lab, my Teacher likes to tell me Fortnite is trash and I should quit. Gotta a bit frustrated, and he told some people I flipped out when I didn’t.",

      "description": "AITA for ending a friendship/connection because I am gay and they secretly think gay people are evil?\n\nI was working on a computer problem for the mother of one of my good friends. She was having issues with her email not sending and was getting the \"spinning beach ball\" every time she tried to send. Her outbox folder was stuffed with messages and I was clicking through them trying to figure out if there was a huge attachment or other issue causing things no to send. \n\nWhat I saw instead was a diatribe about how she believed homosexuals are \"the spirit of the ANTI-CHRIST\" followed by snippets from articles describing how gay people are ruining society and displease god. There were lots of emojis like 🤢🤮 used to describe gay people - including youth - in the media. These were her own words, not a FWD. \n\nUntil this point, I never knew that they had negative beliefs about gay people. They had always acted like they love and support me, but finding out her true feelings crushed a part of me that thought we had a different kind of connection for all these years. They weren't exactly like parents to me, but they were an example of people who showed me love and acceptance (or so I thought) during the turbulent years where I lost a lot of family and friends in my conservative hometown.\n\nShe always asked about my husband, sent us both silly gifts like singing hats for the holidays, etc. But reading that email left me feeling like I never want to speak to them or see them ever again. I packed up the laptop and sent it back to her without figuring out what the issue is, and sent a note saying I had seen the messages in her outbox and didn't feel I could continue with our friendship.

      "description": "I work as a forklift operator in a distribution warehouse, and we have protocol for certain things that is pretty important in terms of efficiency. Managers, supervisors, and leads all say to call people out on not following this protocol. \n\nI have many responsibilities, and have full training in all operations that require forklifts. The operation that can be the most frustrating is replenishing pick locations for the jack pickers that are working on mixed orders. This means instead of picking full pallets of one item, they fill a pallet with various items, and I'm responsible for replenishing those pick locations. Some of those locations have two bays, and jack pickers are supposed to pick from one pallet until it's empty so that I can refill the empty location when I don't have orders to fill other locations. They never do this, they will literally take from two pallets until there is a few bundles left in either pallet.\n\n This means when I am \"batch filling\" I have to spend more time transfering the bundles to the more full pallet, and then remove the empty pallet when it isn't my responsibility. And it sucks for jack pickers too, because eventually an unlucky someone will need what's left in both bays and they will have to take both empty pallets out. Each empty pallet weighs about 30 pounds, and they're hard to manuever, because they're larger than standard pallets. And if someone leaves an empty pallet in a location and I go to replenish it that means I have to drop the pallet on my forks, get the empty pallet out, put the full pallet in the location, and take the empty pallet to the recycling location; and people bitch at me for taking so long, when most of the time I would be able to get things done quicker if they did what thet were supposed to.\n\nSo like my superiors encourage, I call them out on it over the radio. I name the location and item number, and whoever picked from that location last gets bitched at. \n\nIt makes me feel like an asshole, because I don't want to get anyone in trouble, and I know everyond is just trying to make their numbers, but at the same time they don't seem to realize their not following protocol eventually hurts everyone's numbers, even their own. Then I get to deal with people thinking I'm a dick because I called them out. ",

The two typically go hand in hand. \n\nI was walking down the highstreet from a food shop, and I was stopped by a young lady. Yeah she was pretty so maybe that contributed to why I stopped, but she also pretty much blocked my path and started speaking to me straight away, despite having headphones in and arms full of shopping. \n\nShe stopped me to tell me about a charity that helps families of people who are severely ill, now as a person who comes from a family with a seriously ill member, I can tell you that these charities don’t do as much as they promise. \n\nShe was telling me about the charity for about 5-10 minutes and then the sledgehammer came. We both knew it was coming, she asked for a donation. Now I don’t mind giving cash or coins because, for some reason, they don’t really feel like money, you know what I mean? I’ll give a couple coins to the homeless man or put a pound in the charity box, that kind of thing. \n\nBut no, she was asking me to set up a direct debit every month. Being a socially awkward male talking to an attractive woman, I buckled and said ok. She started adding my details and had a massive smile on her face and despite all this, every detail I added into the tablet she was holding was false, name, email, phone number. The lot. Then she asked to add my card details, I was gonna lie about those too, until she got the camera out. It was gonna be one of those ones where it scanned the card details. Fuck. \n\nSo I did what any sane person would do, I lied about not having my wallet and texted my flatmate to pretend like it was locked in my room. I called, put it on speaker and we performed an Oscar winning performance of ‘the missing wallet’. After that I swiftly walked off ashamed and guilty, but I also felt she was a bit unfairly pushy and trapped me in a corner. \n \nMy question is, AITA? ",

This dude has been walking in without anyone’s permission, staying over for days at a time, and generally having strange behaviours that make me uncomfortable (insisting I take shots when we’re alone, just general creepy vibes). \n\nI try not to have much against this guy, I’m just honestly uncomfortable when he’s around. Given this fact, whenever he’s not “invited” or “allowed” over, I’ve been specifically locking the door because he has a habit of walking in uninvited. Tonight, I locked the door due to this and the only one who stayed up late was my bf. \n\nAround 11:00pm, I was asleep in our room and my bf was downstairs. I was awoken by this dude in my bedroom knocking on the door while I was half naked asking to buy drugs off me. I was incredibly angry as this man makes me super uncomfortable and my bf let him in without letting me know or preventing him from entering our room in any way. I honestly leave the door open when I sleep because I trust our housemates completely,  but I have made it super clear that I do not trust this other man nor want him around me, especially in a vulnerable state. I’ve been sexually assaulted in my sleep before so this is particularly sensitive. I got very angry at my bf for letting this man in our house without telling me, as it was entirely his choice and the guys “regular” friend was already asleep. AITA for being mad? ",

      "description": "I sound like the classic entitled millennial, but hear me out! My parents have agreed to contribute $5k towards my wedding (I'm the bride). I had suggested $10K and want to ask them again if they would contribute more.\n\nIf they didn't have the money it would be a totally different story, but they are choosing not spend money on this because they don't see the the value in it. For them, if it's not a tangible thing that they can buy, then it's not worth spending the money on. I, on the other hand value experiences over material possessions, so we've always disagreed there. And this is becoming one of those disagreements. For prospective in the last 3-4 years they've built a $40K garage, bought 2 $50k trucks, a $25K camper/rv and a $30k boat. Not to mention a $100k home remodel when they downsized and endless yard projects on their 5 acres in the country. They're both retired, but in this time they've barely been on any kind of vacation. Mostly just to come visit me in the city.\n\nAnd it's not that they don't support this marriage either. They love my fiance! They just would prefer us to go to the courthouse because that would cost less and they wouldn't be forced to attend an event. They don't like celebrating anything (because it's not a thing) and they don't like large social gatherings.\n\nMy fiance and I have been together for 8 years and waited to get married to make sure this was really what we wanted. So it's not like they couldn't see this coming. We also aren't fans of big grandiose displays either. We're trying to keep this wedding conservative cost wise and keep it to $20k total. The Knot says the average wedding costs $34K, so I feel like I'm not being a bridezilla asking for more money to cover an elaborate wedding. I'm just asking for a little more help to pull off a nice event with good food, a few beers and good company. AITA here?\n\nTLDR: AITA for feeling jilted and thinking that $5k is a paltry contribution to my wedding when I know my parents can afford more?",

I try to be as honest with my professors as possible. Fall semester I maintained a 3.8 GPA. I honestly love school. A hiccup in life had me believing I would never attend college and now I am. I don’t want to jeopardize that.\n\nAnyway, my father passed away in January. Even though we weren’t close, it still effects me to an extent. I’ve always struggled with depression, yes, I’m on meds, yes I go to therapy. But because of yet another death in my life, my depression has been insanely bad. \n\nSo I’ve been missing school and I have confided in my professors about the recurrent absences. Most of them are pretty decent and understand that a death has happened.\n\nBut I have this one professor who legitimately told me I was at the last of my absences and that he would consider taking off a few and helping me out if I brought in a physical copy of my dad’s death certificate.\n\nWhich, of course I have, but I am extremely offended. Would I be an asshole if I approached him after giving him the death certificate and told him how unprofessional and immoral that seems? Or is this simply how things work in college and am I being over the top and too sensitive? ",

Just traveling through for the holidays I believe.  With her mother coming over of course (she’s over regularly no problems).\n\nAbout 2 years ago me and her brother had gotten into a argument after I got drunk and went fishing with my brother. I came home and he kicked me out of their moms house who I was staying with at the time. I was also paying bills and doing my part. So we just normally don’t talk to each other and have not a lot in common with him being more religious.\n\nThe problem is they come over and my girlfriend says they can sleep on our bed while I sleep on the couch. With her mom, our 2 year old and gf make a pallet on the floor for themselves. This is my first apartment I didn’t see that as fair, but seeing as she’d told them already, I left and went to my brothers apartment. I have never stayed the night at his house so idk if he lets them sleep on his bed or anything.",

I think he knows this as well because immediately after poking my forehead he stands up straight. He’s super defensive about it too saying I’m not getting hurt so calm down. But it makes me feel like a kid because of how abrupt it is when he does it. So the most recent occasion we were in an argument and he did it, he poked the middle of my forehead hard and I yelled back “don’t fucking do that anymore!” He rolled his eyes and we argued more. Usually I wouldn’t say something back like that because I’m non-confrontational.

He never leaves the house and he usually never responds to me on discord anymore because hes busy talking to her. We just got back from spring break yesterday and before it started he asked me \"next week is spring break right?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"I think Ill just skip the rest of this week and then start coming back after the break\n\nBut guess who didnt come back after the break?

That said, I understand that she's feeling much worse than I am right now.\n\nHer program is through our college, so I know most of the people on it, and they've invited me out to dinner and such a few times, but I haven't even brought it up to my girlfriend because I don't want to make her feel guilty. That said, I'd really like to get out a bit. I wouldn't go out all day or all night, but just for a few hours. I also don't have service in this country, so I wouldn't be available by phone. Her parents also didn't buy my ticket so I could go site seeing, they did it so I could support her. I'm pretty conflicted about it-- would I be an asshole if I proposed this to her?",

To make the post short I was with a customer on the phone at work and they said they were coming to my city for a celebration of life so me being a fucking idiot said \"oh congratulations!\" Being the immediate response as I posted above for my understanding of the term to which the customer said it's for my sons funeral. I was hit with the reality brick so fucking hard I saw stars. I apologized profusely and stated I never knew the term to which he said it's fine but I know he felt mad/uncomfortable to which he has every right to be. I finished the call and again apologized for my confusing and rudeness and that was it.\n\nRight now I feel more then like an asshole.

      "description": "My roommate texts us last night, asking if two friends can crash at our place last minute. On a long road trip, their plans in our city fell through, and they were scrambling for sleeping arrangements. Our city is about 2 hours from their final destination, so I figure they're rolling up pretty late, sleeping, and moving on.\n\nI'm an accommodating roommate, and I understand this is very reasonable. I know what it's like to drive tired; it's not safe. I work from home, so it's not ideal that two people are taking over my living room in the morning, but whatever.\n\nCue 6 pm; two girls roll in my house with my roommate nowhere to be found. They're having a grand old time downstairs drinking, putting their stuff everywhere, taking selfies and FaceTiming people, all while I'm trying to alternate between work and schoolwork in my room. I head downstairs to quickly talk to them, and I just see stuff absolutely everywhere, vodka bottles, and receive a comment about how strange my cat's name is (oh, but no \"thank you\"). It rubbed me the wrong way\n\nWhile the girls treat the living room/common area as their own private Air BnB for several hours, I start to get annoyed. My roommate is absolutely nowhere to be found. This isn't really what I agreed to. Furthermore, I now don't feel comfortable leaving my house to go to the gym with two complete strangers being alone in it. We live in a city, I'm a little jaded, sure; but I'm just not down with that. Lastly, it was the one night I typically have the house to myself to cook, watch a movie, and decompress after work/school. Again, I realize this is a bias as it affects me personally the most, but I still think my annoyance remains justified.\n\nI text my roommate that I really prefer he is here in the future for houseguests, last-minute or not. Or otherwise, they need to occupy themselves and keep themselves busy until he is here. He came back defensive of the girls, how tough the situation was and that he was being a good friend, etc. and that they are simply dropping off their stuff and leaving. I told him that they have been here for hours without him, drinking and smoking, and that now they are headed out to a night on the town. My roommate doesn't seem overly happy.\n\n**TL;DR: I want to respect my roommate, but I can't help but feel that his houseguest didn't need a place to sleep; they needed an intermittent stop to party, because they were bored. Their destination is only 2 hours away. AITA?**",

      "description": "I(26M) have been in love with my childhood best friend (26F) for at least half a decade now. We were inseparable. \nShe is intelligent, witty and breathtakingly beautiful. I sort of made a promise to be just friends with her in high school since everyone was just hitting on her and very few geniunely cared about her feelings. We were super close friends. Shared every little thing with each other and got accepted to the same college for undergrad.\n\nI got the opportunity to go study MBA at my dream school abroad, so I honestly just went for it. I was super busy during this point in time and she was doing her own thing too...so we unfortunately drifted apart. I knew then that I missed her dearly and had deep romantic feelings for her.\n\nI did receive a lot of offers, but I didn't go on any dates during this span of time. It's not something I am proudly saying or anything, I just geniunely wanted to have a future with her.\n\nLast last month, I finally got to meet her after finishing my degree. I took her to the beach, made her favorite food for her and just talked about how I was attracted to her romantically and would be grateful if she considered ever going out with me. I also said I was fine if we were friends too, I could handle it. Obviously it would sting but in the end just having her in my life meant a lot.\n\nShe didn't say anything at first, but then shouted at me saying I had betrayed her trust and broken up her promise.\nShe said it wouldn't work out and ghosted me.\n\nI honestly just...don't even remember the past month at all. I feel half dead. I blame myself for ruining something and feel like an idiot. I didn't know so much would have changed when I came back after doing my degree.\n\nWhen I barely started doing something productive yesterday, her girl friend hit me up on Instagram.\n\nshe told me that I had turned out like the person I swore to never be for her, sent me this paragraph long message of how I was just really toxic and obsessive.\n\nI feel really down again. I don't want you guys to go easy on me or anything, I just want the truth.  \n\nYour perspective would mean a lot.\n\n",

Anyway:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live at home and I'm in my first year of college.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I made dinner for my mom and sister last night because my mom loves when I cook. It was a somewhat time-consuming dish and I made a decent mess. I cleaned everything up right away afterwards, no one offered to help me clean and I didn't expect them to, no problemo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left one pan and one tray (cleaned) out to dry and forgot about them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, we're sitting around the table and my mom asks me if the tray and pan are mine, as in did I use them and leave them out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI actually forgot that I did use them, she reminds me about me making dinner and I realize I did leave them out to dry after cleaning them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say I'm a bit surprised that she waited to tell me to put them away instead of just putting them away herself, considering the fact I spent a decent amount of time cooking dinner for her using them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that it doesn't matter that I made dinner for everyone and that I need to \"clean up after myself\". I say that's fine, but if I was her I wouldn't be so hesitant to put away 2 dishes after someone cooked dinner for me and cleaned everything else up. In fact, about 10 seconds before this conversation I put away a pot my sister had used to make tea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I put the 2 dishes away of course, but tbh I'm kind of offended that she wouldn't just put the 2 dishes away and instead waited all day to ask me to do it lol? Especially after I made a recipe she wanted and cleaned everything up, just seems like she didn't appreciate it at all I guess!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being offended over this?

It was Christmas and she was drunk so when confronted she started crying about how she still loved my father and he just blocked her out of his life (long story).\n\nNow 4 months later my mom is engaged.  \n\nI know that a lot of things can change in 4 months but my parents were together for 30 years, I don’t think my mom there is completely over it and I don’t blame her.

      "description": "I'm 18 years old and would consider myself a very active person. This year my friends and I have been playing outdoors more than usual and have grown a love for playing driveway basketball. I personally bought two $25 dollar basketballs for me to play with and take to college with me in the fall. My little cousin who is only 9 noticed I play basketball a lot now (she is my neighbor and sees me outside) and has asked many times to play. When I am available I play with her and sometimes when I have to leave I let her play in my driveway and shoot on my hoop and I let her take the balls inside to her house. I noticed one of my balls (the better ball) was missing and later that day when she came over to play I saw she had written her name on it in sharpie. I contacted my uncle just to say along the lines of \"hey *blank* took my ball and wrote her name on it, it's not the end of the world but I just need to make sure I can get it back\" but my uncle told me that he already said that she could have it. I don't think it should be his call because as I said I'm 18 and am saving for college so the $25 ball that I am about to lose is kind of a lot for me. It isn't like my father bought me the ball, the ball is mine. I told my cousin she could have one of my old balls that I have had since I was her age but she refused to take it and insisted she kept the best ball I have. My uncle does a lot of favors for my family such as spotting us money and helping us pay our bills when we have a tight month and I feel like an asshole for not just letting his kid have my ball. AITA???",

      "title": "AITA for asking my roommate to stop touching my dog's waterbowl?",
      "description": "TL;DR at end... For everyone else, i.e., the masochists, I present the wall:\n\nOkay so my friend bought a house in another city about 4 years ago and needed a roommate. I moved in and things were going great. Over time, he started spending more time at his GF's place, and eventually moved in with her, leaving me alone in his 3 bedroom house. I work from home and had yet to make any new friends in the new town so I was getting very little social interaction. Needless to say, I started to get pretty lonely.\n\nI asked my friend if he minded if I got a dog. He very kindly agreed and so I browsed the local shelters online and eventually came across a 6 year old Cane Corso in a shelter about 2.5 hours away. I made the drive, met the pooch, and he instantly claimed me as his new owner. Fast forward about a year and things are once again going great. My dog has a few issues, particularly with separation anxiety, but for the most part, he's a great little compadre. \n\nOne day, I'm speaking with my friend and he says he'd like to rent out one of the other rooms in the house to a new coworker of his. My friend obviously doesn't need my permission so I appreciate that he event asks me if I mind. I have no reason to object. I've had roommates before and for the most part things went well. So it's settled that the new guy would move in.\n\nThis is the beginning of the end of my sanity.\n\nInitially, as with most new acquaintances, things are cordial and harmonious. But it wasn't too horribly long before the facade began to evaporate. It became apparent that the new guy, who we'll call Fuckhead, has a pretty shitty attitude about everything. He is witty, but very negative. At best, anything coming out of his mouth is a backhanded compliment. More often than not though, it's just negative comments and put downs. For example, one day I had washed and was waxing my truck. My truck and I have a lot of history and it is very important to me. He was walking back from somewhere and in passing said with a sneer \"Talk about putting lipstick on a pig\" and then went inside. Why? What purpose is there in saying something like that? \n\nOn top of being an asshole, he is a slob. The house was pretty much immaculate before he moved in. I wanted my friend to be happy with me as his tenant so I made sure to keep the house shipshape both inside and out. After Fuckhead moved in though, everything went to shit. He leaves all his crap everywhere. There's no room on the table to eat, no room on the counters to prepare food, the fridge has become a swamp full of his rotting leftovers and all the floors are constantly covered in the mud he tracks in every day. He has been here 3 years now and has almost never vacuumed, swept, mopped or done any yard work. I tried asking him to help with cleaning the bathrooms once. His response? \"I don't do that\".  It eventually came to light that he somehow arrived at the idea that I am the housemaid. \n\nOne time he had his equally deplorable girlfriend over. They had made a meal, and a mess in the kitchen. I was sitting in the living room and his gf started to put dishes in the sink. He stopped her and said \"Stop babe, u/babyProgrammer will do it. He likes to clean\" easily loud enough for me to hear. I damn near lost my fucking mind. I naturally blew my stack and yelled quite a bit. The only lasting impact this had though was that his abuses have just become more subtle. \n\nLiving with Fuckhead is like dying the death of a thousand cuts. No one offense is enough to be deemed \"over the line\", but every day he his wearing me down with his slights against me. I've asked my friend to help but to my disappointment he's been very hands off. He knows that Fuckhead is a shite worker and isn't at all surprised that things are equally bad at home. I can see that my friend is in a tough situation. I know that he abhors Fuckhead as much as I do, but he needs the rent money, and it would be pretty damn awkward on the job if he had to work alongside the ex-tenant he kicked out of his house. The final dingleberry on top of this human piece of garbage is that he is mean to my dog but I'm not going to elaborate on that because I will get too angry to type.\n\nFast-forward to this evening. Fuckhead has had his 16 year old daughter visiting for the holidays. Lets just say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. They've been making a royal mess since she arrived a week and a half ago. This evening, I had returned from going out to dinner with my neighbors and went to give my dog dinner. As of late, Fuckhead has been moving my dog's water bowl from its normal place in the kitchen to the backyard. I've brought it back in a couple times now so at this point it's obvious he's passive aggressively communicating that he wants the bowl outside. Fuckhead and his daughter are watching TV in the living room and their mess is still all over the kitchen and dining area. After I give my dog dinner, I very politely ask him to stop moving the water bowl outside. He asks why. I don't feel I need to give a reason, but instead of saying so and embarrassing him in front of his daughter I offer that it's easier to keep track on whether the water bowl is empty. End of conversation, I go up stairs. Fifteen minutes later, I get this text message from Fuckhead:\n\n\"Hey dickhead find a different place for your dogs water bowl. 1. You have never washed it! 2. Your dog immediately slobbers after drinking. Floor, couch, and legs. 3. The sound is fucking annoying! All this because you can't remember to check his fucking water?! You're a simpleton u/babyProgrammer! One more thing don't EVER raise your voice at me in front of my daughter.\"\n\nI was pretty blindsided by this message. I thought I had very nicely asked Fuckhead to stop touching my dog's water bowl. On top of that, I have been pretty damn nice about putting up with his daughter staying here. With the current living situation, I use the master bathroom. Fuckhead's daughter has been staying in the master bedroom meaning that I can't access my bathroom while she's in there. She's in there half the day and doesn't get out of bed till 10:30 at the very earliest. She's also been doing a number the bathroom. Anyway, I was fuming and responded with this:\n\n\"You're dumb. I don't need to give you a reason to ask you to stop touching [my dog's] water bowl. That was just a courtesy to prevent embarrassing you in front of your daughter. I don't know why you're so concerned with the water bowl when the tables, counters, and fridge are all completely dominated by your shit. Don't believe me? Go look right now. The counters and table have been covered the last week with your puzzles and cooking shit. I haven't said anything about any of it because your daughter is in town and I know this time is important to you. You are a hypocrite and a slob. Fuck you. I didn't raise my voice, but I'll go there if that's what you want you fucking retard. Also, tell your daughter to stop pissing on my toilet seat.\"\n\nIt's a very frustrating situation, and this is absolutely not how I wanted to start the new year out. I'm generally a pretty passive and peaceful person but I can only be walked all over so much. I know an argument always has more than one side, but in your opinion, AITA in this situation?  \n\nTL;DR:\nSlobby asshole of a roommate regularly leaves his junk and trash all over the house, to the point where spaces such as kitchen table are unusable. Lately one of the passive aggressive moves he's been making is to repeatedly move my dog's water bowl from the kitchen to the backyard. My dog and I have been living here since long before he moved in and nothing has ever changed about where his food/water bowls go. I politely confront him about him moving it and he later sends a nasty text message to me. I think he is being a hypocrite and hit him back with a venomous response. AITA? \n\n",

I said no thanks and she turned to the kid I was watching and said are you sure you don't want ice cream? I did not let kid answer, and said nope. 3 minutes later we are walking around and the same employee asked my kid the same thing. He is a great kid and did not complain about no ice cream but I said, \"could you please not ask my kid if he wants to buy something, he is six and does not have money. \" I said it in a polite-ish but pretty snarky way. I know the employee is a kid herself and was doing what her boss instructed, so I felt like a pretty big asshole for being rude, but I also find it rude as shit to ask a kid a question that is not theirs to answer. (I feel the same way when a waiter asks a kid if they want desert btw but have never complained).  I know the complaint would be better directed at management but I don't plan to do that because it's not worth the effort. So aita?",

We tried taking a break a few weeks ago but in the end we decided to end things. One thing she was worried about was this girl from my past. We will call her Lea. Lea and I were really good friends and quite frankly I was really really into Lea back then, but she ended up moving away about 4 years ago. Lea recently moved back in town and things went wrong fast. My Gf (now ex) said one night I said her name in my sleep and she has been sulky ever since.  I told her Lea was not a problem and at the time she really wasn't. I explained that we were old friends and I even kept Lea at arms length to help reassure my Bri. Bri and I have try to keep things civil and remain friends but she has been aggressive and really snotty to me recently  amongst  our friends and in behind closed doors.  I have ultimately decided that our relationship can no longer last in any form including friends. Since Bri and I broke up and we are not really friends I have been hanging out with Lea a lot as of late. All my old feelings for her are flooding back in. In the back of my mine they have been there since she came back. Now I really want to try things with Lea. I didn't cheat and for the most part have been truthful and honest but I can't help but feel as if I am still in the wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; AITA for wanting to pursue the girl I told my ex-gf not to worry about?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So my partner and I are currently on a getaway with our close friend for a few days. We went out to a yachting club for dinner and picked a seat right out on the water. We had ordered our food and while my fiancee went to the toilet our buzzer rang for our meals. My mate and I left the table to grab our food, and left all our drinks there for our 30 second round trip. A nearly full beer, a nearly full spirit and a half full can of Coke (it's the close friend's turn to deso tonight). \n\nDuring our short absence, a family had come over and taken our chairs and put a half cigarette I had left on the table into the can. We came back and I, slightly annoyed, had a yarn with the father, who had assumed we were done with the table and put the Butt into the drink and distributed the chairs. He apologised profusely when he realised what he did and I was all g with it-silly mistakes happen. \n\nI went to get my mate another coke and on the way in bumped into my partner on her way back to the toilet. I told her what happened, with not much in the way of a tone to tell her whether or not it was still an issue and already resolved- while I was at the bar I saw her come back in and talk to a staff member while pointing outside. I came back with the coke and she told me \"I've called security on them, I'm not standing for that.\" I go \"what? Why would you do that, it was an honest mistake. They probably should have seen the mostly full drinks and thought maybe it was still occupied but they apologised when they realised we were still using the table it's all good.\" she rebutted with \"well you're gonna have to tell the security guard when he comes out\" which I did. Crisis averted. \n\nShe told me on our way out that I should have clarified to her that it was sorted, to which my response was asking her why she was so quick to go and get security on people who made an honest mistake without at least finding out if that was required. If I hadn't seen the guard and stopped him he would have kicked out or reprimanded a family who had just mistakenly assumed that we were done there. She got quite angry at my logic and I ended up apologising. \n\nMy question is was I in the right or was she? The topic is already resolved, but I believe she shouldn't have been so quick to grab security without finding out more, especially since she wasn't there and was just working off of what little she had been told when I walked past her. I didn't give her a lot of information to begin with and my mate was with her while I was getting his drink so it would have been easy to clarify with him. She believes I should have told her everything to begin with, which I kind of agree with too but I didn't see a need to go comprehensive as the situation had already been resolved. \n\nAITA? ",

With that in mind, one must be aware that if you're going to sit at the very edge of these rows, people are going to have to pass by the very narrow and inconvenient path you just made in order to get to their seat. Anyway, I got to class a little before it started so there was still plenty of seating available, yet this girl still chose to sit at the very edge of the row I typically sit in the middle of. She was digging through her backpack when I got her attention and asked if I could pass through, which was apparently a huge inconvenience to her as she sighed when she got up. Unbeknownst to me, she left her smoothie on the very skinny railing between the seats which my backpack doinked off and spilled all over the floor. Her over-dramatic reaction and refusal to even acknowledge me frustrated me in turn so I shrugged instead of apologizing. However, I did help clean it up. Once her other friends got there, she whispered to them while eyeing me and they all got up and moved, making me feel like some sort of social moron. Am I in the wrong here? It was a simple mistake and I didn't think I deserved the public shaming that I got. Plus the room smelled like strawberries afterwards. They're welcome.",

      "description": "A little back story. I (25F) was in a toxic relationship and i barely had any energy to deal with people. I had started ignoring my best friend’s (25F) calls. Just so you know, i had been lagging off completely in life (Unemployed) whereas my friend, after a few failed attempts, finally made it so it was a pretty big deal. Now it was an exciting period of her life and in the beginning i was all ears. I used to be eager to listen to her stories.\n\nThen after things started going downhill for me, i finally told her that i need some time because i am scared i will become miserable and wont be able to be happy at other people’s achievements.\n\nI realise i was absolutely wrong and thats not how it works, hell i didnt even need to tell her such an elaborate version, i could have stopped a few sentences short. i also told her ‘it’s got nothing to do with my relationship with (now)exbf’\n\nAnyway she was confused and hurt and didn’t expect me to become like that. Then, tbh i really didn’t understand where i went wrong so i didnt feel apologetic either. She said she appreciates my honesty but she never thought it would come to this between us.\n\nA few days later, we spoke and i apologised. I opened up about my relationship (i had just broken up here) told her the details, i was crying and telling her about how i have changed since 2 years and i dont recognise myself anymore. In all honesty, i wasnt thinking about my actions towards her. And she goes ‘yea i agree, i hate to bring this up rn but what you said that day was so out of line for you, i dont feel the same way about our friendship anymore’ she also said something like ‘dont cry now, we will have to become ok if you cry now’ and i was honestly stunned and obviously couldnt cry even if i wanted to.\n\nAnyway i told her ‘i cant blame everything on my toxic relationship, i realise i went wrong and i can only apologise at this point’\n\nShe is also probably mad at me for taking so long to let go off this guy. Another thing that amused me was she going ‘you call exbf like crazy when things go south but you can’t do that for me’ which felt like another jab at this point.\n\nIt’s been a month now and we have tried to get to each other but the timing always seems off (long distance). I messaged her asking if i really screwed everything up and she replied saying no and that she will get back to me but we never really actually spoke. She could be busy but idk its not like her to not remove 5-10 minutes for a talk.\n\nam i the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: messaged asking best friend for space till i deal with my shit so i dont become miserable over her achievements.",

      "description": "So I met this girl and her boyfriend few weeks ago. Me and this girl became super close and we shared a lot. She told me she liked me back after we’d cuddle a lot and I told her, we also ended up having sex. She’s told me she kissed a guy before me and told her boyfriend that it was just physical so she’s cheated before. \n\nNow, she hates me because she accused me of sexually assaulting her bestfriend because we were all drunk and for a few minutes I slept next to her and her friend cuz they were passed out in my bed. This girl was vomiting the whole party so I was helping her but anyways I posted about that if you want the full story. So her and these other two girls in my club hate my guts, I lost my best friend and honestly she even told me she won’t break up with her boyfriend because she loves him and it’s just a rough part of their relationship.\n\nI feel bad tho for her boyfriend because he loves her and I know she’s going to keep cheating. Even tho I fucked his girlfriend I still don’t hate the guy, she wanted me to block him for some reason because she wants to protect him from me??? \n\nEven though this guy could probably kick my ass LOL so I “blocked” his Snapchat so she could see then unblocked him. Anyways, idk should I tell her boyfriend or not? They’re long distance so chances are she won’t ever get caught, even her bestfriend who doesn’t like her boyfriend hasn’t told her boyfriend she’s cheated. She told me not to tell anyone because she wants to trust me and she wants her BF to gain her trust back and she regrets it. But I don’t buy it, you can’t cheat on your boyfriend twice within two months then say you just want him to trust you. He shouldn’t trust her, I love her but I’d never date her for this reason. \n\n\nAlso, I know this is AITA so I want to clarify AITA for wanting to tell, I’m thinking I should. I already know I’m a dick for sleeping with another dudes girlfriend but when someone says they like you back you kinda think they may break up with their current partner. But I was dumb and horny.

At first everything was great, but now she's become really obsessive over him, and even pays his rent cause he somehow cant afford £300 a month rent, when he earns about £1000 a month. \n\nShe's also really changed how she behaves, and refuses to listen when me and our other friend tell her. She pretty much ignores us, which I understand when she's with him, but when she's in his flat and he's at work, she \"can't\" reply cause shes tidying his house (which i think is weird she doesnt live there). He's also downright rude to me; i tried to be friends with him cause that would be nice. At first he would talk to me and we get on in person, he asked to be friends ffs, but now he wont reply to any of my messages, and when my husband and i invited them both to hang out, they said yes then the boyfriend went 'to get coffee' and didnt come back. this resulted in B stressing over where he was (she knew, he was in tim hortons) and ignoring me the whole time. even when i was trying to help shed just grunt and turn away. \n\nI've tried to tell her the issues, but she just says 'its because you dont know him' or 'no thats not true' even though she asked me to tell her if anything was wrong. \n\nI don't know if I'm just overreacting, or if she's being a dick. \n\nSo, am i the asshole?",

We’re pretty closely knit, but I personally tend to be on the outside of the group. One girl, Z, recently has been struggling with depression. I won’t pretend to understand it because I’ve never had depression. She would come to group hangouts and bitch and moan and just kinda be a downer on the whole group. Later she wouldn’t respond to invites or would show up late to stuff, often barely participating. I used to speak to Z quite a bit but we were never really close.\n\nAfter all this I had a small party for my birthday and I didn’t invite her because I didn’t want her to show up just to complain about the store bought cake or whatever. \n\nI’ve been told this was a dick move by the other friends because the depression isn’t under her control, but I think it’s fine because she should still be able to control how she acts. \n\nShe has seen a therapist and we try to respect her as much as possible\n\nAITA",

      "description": "I have this friend, we went to the same high school and happened to attend the same university. She was a few years ahead of me and we became friends again once I got to college. She graduated in 2017 with a fine arts degree and since then we mostly talk on Instagram.\n\nI graduated last month and she saw my graduation pictures and congratulated me. She asked to catch up and we met for lunch. We made small talk and she asked me about my plans after college.\n\nI told her that I was a nurse and had found a job. I thought she would say congrats and that would be it. But no, she complained about how hard it was her to find a job after college.  she went on about how lucky I was to have it so easy, to be able to find a job after graduation.\n\nI didn't like where the conversation was heading and I tried to change the topic, but she wouldn't let it go and she went on about how she only makes like 25k a year. And she has 2 Jobs  (selling her art on Instagram and waitressing). She talked about her financial trouble, I didn't know what she wanted me to say and I felt awkward. The thing that annoyed me was that she kept on talking about how easy my life was.\n\nI snapped and made a snide comment about how easy she had it in college with her fun major. Of course she got offended,  a fight happened and we both left. I reached out to her to try to clear the air, turns out she blocked me. So over 6 years of friendship has been flushed down the drain.\n\nThe reason I got so mad was that my college career had not been \"easy\" at all and she knows that; I'm the first one in my family to have a college degree. I literally paid for every single thing with either scholarship or loans. I worked hard to graduate early and get a job. If anyone had had it easy it was her. Her parents were not rich or anything but her grandparents had a college fund for her. No one forced her to get an art degree and for her to simplify all my hard work to being easy or just lucky really ticked me off.\n\n\nAITA in this situation ",

And let me preface what I'm about to say next with this; I always tip 20% because I understand that servers don't get paid minimum wage and live off of tips.

When she finally saw us, she was visually surprised and even said to us \"oh my God I'm so sorry I forgot you were over here!\"\n\nUpon hearing that, coupled with the long wait time, I was frustrated and my girlfriend and I decided to not tip her at all. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hey reddit, there has been a person who's been a relatively new member of our college friend group for the past 2 years.  They have a tendency to brag about how much they drink and laugh it off a lot but in my mind they really ruin a lot of fun events and parties we go to.  I know this is college but they drink to this point every time there is alcohol available.  They just drink way too much and it always ends with one or two of us having to physically get them back to their dorm and wait with them until they fall asleep.  There is usually vomiting and crying involved.  I'll admit the first time the crying really got to me, it was something about a past relationship but we all stayed up talking through it with them until they fell asleep.  The person can be somewhat dramatic, one of their typical things to do is run away so the people who want to make sure they are ok have to catch them.  My friends don't seem to mind, they usually seem to think its funny which I think encourages the person.  That's whatever, its totally cool if they don't mind it.  It came up in conversation one day that I don't act particularly friendly to them or participate in the chases or the care anymore, and I mentioned that it bothered me that they had the tendency to do this.  It felt rude and not very considerate when people make plans to enjoy an event or a night out.  After this the person in particular got upset with me and some of my friends are telling me that it wasn't cool for me to judge their drinking habits.  I'm actually quite curious about responses to this, I try not to be a mean person but my friends are pretty staunch in their opinion that I'm in the wrong.  I'd like to fix this if possible.  Thanks for the help.",

We ended up talking for an hour, mostly me being surprised about the confusing history of theology and how it squared with her feminism/socially progressive ideas. \n\nI feel like shit for the “hate” comment, and I really appreciate her as a person, but I’m not sure if I feel bad for potentially being offensive or the fact that I’m kind of a bigot because I do hate the Mormon religion.

      "description": "So I saw reddit posts on this a while back actually. Some mom was doing something very similar and she was called an abusive parent. Just like some feedback for myself. \n\nI'm a single mother with 2 kids (12F, 15M) and the older one has had some issues with video gaming and internet use which heavily affected his grades. So now I have a system where the internet is always disabled right when they get home. They leave their smartphones downstairs and they have 2 hours after school each day to finish their homework. Once they're done, I reactive the internet and they can do as they wish. \n\nI thought I was being responsible with this. Before, I'd frequently find them both surfing instagram or social media while they claimed to be working on homework. Now I know they're working because they show me the work and I can at least be satisfied that some things are being completed. My younger daughter is ok with this system although my son has argued that I'm too controlling and even \"abusive\" for limiting his internet access. He says internet is basically a right and I can't restrict and isolate him just because I don't understand. But the thing is before I implemented this system he was making constant Cs in school. He played online games all night or would just chat with his friends. Now he's actually completing schoolwork. \n\nAITA for enforcing this rule? I was surprised when I saw similar situations pop up online and people saying the mother was abusive for limiting internet. Is this really the case?",

I'm 26, so there's not that huge a difference and as such he's kinda seen me as the cool uncle or whatever. He's a great kid, but I know he struggles with girls since he's shy and too nice, so I sat him down and gave him a few words of advice:\n\n* If she rejects you, move on. She means nothing and you're better off not having her around\n* Respect a no, and then block them\n* Keep multiple balls in the air, so you always have a fall-back, and a better chance of success overall\n* Don't waste your time or her's with games and friendship shit, cut to the point and conserve your time\n\nAnyway my nephew apparently took this to heart and told my sister about what I told him, and she is FURIOUS, telling me I'm teaching him to be a psychopath, and to not respect women. I asked her what *she* had told him and it was basically some \"make friends with girls and maybe, perhaps eventually you'll get a girl\" type shit, and I sort of laughed at the thought that this is what she told him. \n\nAnyway she's really pissed and a couple of our mutual friends think I'm an asshole as well. Am I the asshole? I was just trying to give him my truth, no pleasantries or timewasting bullshit or flowery words. I want him to succeed in life and with girls, he's a good kid and I don't want him to end up a wizard or a virgin or something.",

      "description": "I live in an apartment building in downtown Philly. I've lived here for more than five years so I'm used to city life and I don't expect it to be quiet. I'm used to the sounds of traffic, sirens, and drunk assholes shouting outside (mostly on the weekends) but a 24-hour convenience store and sandwich shop recently opened up right across the street from where I live and the level of drunk shouting and screaming has gone through the fucking roof. It's really bad, you guys.\n\n\n\nPacks of drunk assholes chanting Eagles chants at the top of their lungs for twenty minutes at a time and getting in the street, blocking traffic, making drivers trying to go past lay on their horns at two am is something I can handle on weekends because I don't have to work but its EVERY GODDAMN NIGHT and it's killing me.\n\n\n\nSure my apartment is in a somewhat busy area but it was relatively peaceful until that convenience store came in and attracted all of the people who left bars at closing drunk off their ass but who don't want to go home yet. I tried looking up the non-emergency police number but that number is basically only open during regular day/office hours. And I don't see what my apartment management or the convenience store can do about it because these people are technically not in the store when their screaming at the top of their goddamn lungs in the middle of the street.\n\n\n\nWhat I want to do is fill up a bunch of water balloons and keep them in a bowl in my fridge so they're nice and cold and throw them at the shouting people to try to get them to stop. Even if it doesn't get them to stop entirely, I have to think it would make them leave the area at least. I would only do this if it's past 1 am mon-thurs and I would use those mini balloons so no one gets soaked or anything, I don't want to damage anyone's property or anything, just give them a splash of cold water as kind of a friendly 'shut the *fuck* up, mofo'. I just honestly have no idea what else I can do to change the situation that will actually enact some form of change.\n\n\n\nSo if this is an asshole move, let me know but also let me know what else if anything I can do, I'm seriously at my wit's end.",

      "description": "So i met this girl on a dating app and at first we didn't really hit it off. Sending  messages every few hours. One night we began snapping eachother and had a amazing conversation (where i learned that she was a churchgoer and a virgin. After a couple hours of us making a streak we began talking about sex and well soon pictures started being sent. We had planned for her to come over that night but she got cold feet. And we both went to bed. The next morning while at work she texted me that she didnt want to talk anymore  and was ashamed of her actions the previous night. I told her that i really like talkimg to her once she opened up and that sex wasn't a  big issue we could have a relationship and i could wait. She told me that she felt it best if we stopped talking altogether and so we did. Until she messaged me a couple hours later apologizing  and saying she was just nervous so we began talking again. Fast forward to later that  night we made plans for her to come over again which she does (to watch a movie)  and we end up having sex.\n\nThis is where it gets TMI.\n\nSo before we  have sex and i start eating her out. ( full of hair) which is to be expected because  she a virgin) and as were having sex , i have her turn around to doggy style. Once she turns around it hits me. I get blindsided by the strongest smell of shit. Immediately have her turn back around. After i tell her to turn we continue to have sex. About 15mins later she asks me to stop and says it hurts. There blood everywhere. After we clean up she starts apologizing.  And i tell her its okay.\n\nAnyways she leaves and then immediately starts freaking out asking if i got her pregnant (we used condoms). But its still understandable its her first tine She chills out a bit but still asks weird questions like \"since i touch to condon and fingered her is she pregnant  since i got the  sperm on my hands.\n\n\nSo anyways the next couple of days ill admit ice been less inclined to talk to her and have been sending one word texts i personally want to stop talking to her but i feel bad because i took her virginity. But i also dont wanna keep leading her on. She has been trying to come  over and have sex again but i have been very hesitant and just  been making excuses on why im busy. Now shes on a mission trip for a fee weeks and cant text.\n\nI was very interested in this girl but honestly i cant get the smell out of my head. \n\nWould i be the asshole to just completely cut her off?\n\n",

I don't know, I just wanted to talk about it with some people who probably know way better then me.\nSM=Stepmok\n(I was born in 2004, my brother 2008. This is important later.)\n\n My mom and my dad broke up and got divorced around.... 8 or 7 years ago and in 2016 my dad got remarried to a lady who seemed ok. We all sat down and had that \"just because she's a new edition to the family doesn't mean you can ignore her, or treat her any differently\" blah, blah, blah, whatever, I played by my dad's rules.\n\nFast forward a few years, I was having a talk with my mom and she hands me a paper and tells me to read it. In short, it was a little autobiography about my dad's and my SM's relationship, (written by my SM's) this would be fine if the paper didn't say they met in 2004 and became a couple in 2008. \n\n\nAll I could really think was What. The. Fuck.\n\n\nNow, recently my SM makes me do things for her which I don't really mind, but when it's constant it gets on my nerves, (go to her work and bring back her purse, help cook dinner, go grocery shopping, help clean the house, little things like that)\nAnd my dad gets mad at me so easily now it's kind of ridiculous. I don't help my brother with his homework, he takes all my shit away and tells at me. (I think it's ridiculous cause it's not like it's MY homework to be doing anyway.)\n\n\nLike other teenagers, I like to have my space but at my dad's house neither me or my brother have our own rooms. (We sleep on the couch) and get 30 minutes tops on our electronics a day. \n\n\nI have stopped calling him everyday because more and more I think about how much it actually sucks being at his house and how much he lies to me. (I always go back to the question when him and my SM met and he says 2015) \n\nI just don't feel loved or appreciated anymore. \nAnd I think this not wanting to go there anymore might have been triggered by my SM and my dad talking about possibly having another child. I dunno, man. I dunno. \n\n(Also if anyone has an idea of what I can write for a TLDR that would be much appreciated)",

The guy told me and we broke up but I' m trying to make this work.\n\nHer father is a bit of an asshole, he makes really bad jokes about me or my girlfriend (usually food related stuff) and auto-invites to dinner. My girlfriend hated him but I tried to make things between them go better. I organized a lot of dinners-out with both of them and my mom, so we could all have fun together. They're becoming more close to each other and I'm happy even tho he's still an asshole.\n\nSo, I work as a Delivery Guy and I work A LOT so my girlfriend was sad because we couldn't stay together at Christmas and on the New Year's Eve.\nI manager to get a few days off to work (5 days) to stay with her (from 21/12/18 to 01/01/2019).\nI told her about a week ago and, two days ago, she told me that she wanted to stay with her father at Christmas. I got really upset, I kept talking to her but I was Stone-cold. We discusse about this yesterday and she told me I'm over-reacting. She told me that she always has to decide between staying with me and with her grandma/father. I told her that I too have to make some decisions, this Summer for example I declined a week at the beach at a four-stars Hotel (all free, my father offered me) just to stay with her. Note that, I been on a real Vacation for around 10 years.\n\nI'm thinking about leaving her for a lot of reasons, but on the other hand I still love her.\n\nSO, AITA for getting Angry at my girlfriend who wants to spend Christmas with her father?\n\n(sorry for grammar and typos, I'm using my Phone and I'm not a Native English Speaker) ",

      "description": "This hopefully won’t be a lengthy post and I’m begging for your opinion on this.\n\nI dated this guy for around 2 months when this happened. He was on vacation with his family and I really wanted to talk to him. I called him up a few times and he wouldn’t answer. Then finally he picked up but his aunt was the one who answered. She said “We are having an important conversation do not call again.” \n\nI know I shouldn’t have but I ended up calling soon after. I was furious in the fact that there was no other explanation and that my ex couldn’t just explain that himself. I’ve never even spoken to this women before that call. What followed the call was the aunt telling me how I’m too needy and annoying. My ex then blocked me on everything and only left me with a “We are over” text.\n\nI have spent that last week and a half trying to contact him to get an explanation on what happened. I’ve even sent him a screenshot of me texting my other ex telling him I don’t have a boyfriend. I still got no reaction. I am constantly trying to get a response by using multiple numbers and multiple social media accounts.\n\nAITA here because I still think I’m entitled to some kind of reasoning behind the breakup. Thank you for reading and lmk who you guys think is the asshole it is greatly appreciated :)",

      "description": "My friend, I'll say N, was telling me about a place she heard from her mother called Cat Island. We were then talking about like \"OMG WE *HAVE* TO GOOO\" and stuff, blah blah, blah. Then we decided, hey why don't we? \nWe researched how much money a trip to Japan would be as well as the prices of admission for other places we would want to go and figured out about how much money we'd need to raise in order to afford the amount for 3 people (me, N, and her mom who also really wanted to go and would be our guardian, of course [we're in high school]). \n\nN said we should make a GoFundMe and post it on FB so I did (probably won't get any donations because it's for no special cause, but it doesn't hurt to have it up I guess). We're planning to get jobs and sell things to get most of the money.\n\nLater, our friend, A, saw the post and got very upset. She she started writing gibberish in our group chat and saying how she'd wanted to go to Japan for years and that we knew this which made her ask me \"R U TRYING TO SPITE ME?\"\nShe kept saying how she's going to make her own GFM and do her own trip since N and I decided to do our own thing.\nShe messaged me in private and started saying how I'm inconsiderate and never consider other people. She said I destroyed her and asked why I'd make a plan without her. What's odd is she wasn't messaging N even though we were both equally involved in this plan. \nN was confused and tried messaging A but A wasn't saying much apparently. \nA kept insulting me for things unrelated to the situation.\n\nThe reason we didn't invite her was\n\n 1. because she's not allowed to talk to N or associate with her due to some legal drama that happened with their brothers\n (two friends were being reckless and got expelled together so court said their families can't hang out but they secretly message because N has 2 facebooks, one under a fake name)\n\n2. We weren't thinking about it, as we were hyping one another over the potential trip, though funding would take a couple years\n\n3. A wouldn't care to see cats or do any of the things we'd plan because she dislikes cats and doesn't care for Disney (we wanted to go to Tokyo Disneyland as well), etc. We planned and determined the prices according to what we wanted to do, seeing Cat Island being the main reason for going. \n\nWe offered to let her come if she can help raise money and gets parental approval from the start of her being upset but she said she wasnt mad about that..(?)\n\nA told me she apparently could talk to N so as to guilt me, i presume. I told her I didn't know since she'd tell me to refer to N as a different name to avoid getting in trouble when around her parents. When I said that, she said she didn't know if her mother would be okay with it. In which case, idk how she expected N or me to know if she didn't know herself and never told us after figuring she could.\n\nThing is, she couldn't..!\n\nN invited A to a carnival in hopes of making A feel better and A responded in saying to wait until the court drama is over (the situation with their brothers which prevents the families from associating).\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Some background: she and her friend had a fall out last year about some petty high school stuff girls fight about. Earlier this school year, Sheila(fake name) tried to reconcile with her. It didn't go over smoothly, but Sheila and her are at least on speaking terms.\n\nFast forward a few months, they hang out for \nlunch pretty much every other day. However, she tells me she secretly hates hanging out with Sheila, because all Sheila talks about is her(Sheila's) boyfriend and class. \n\nI ask why she pretends to be friends with Sheila. In my point of view, it's a pretty shitty thing to pretend you like someone, them trusting you, while you shit on them behind their back. All of this happened over text, mind you. She tells me because it would be \"awkward\" if she and Sheila weren't friends. I'm thinking, these two were best friends for nine years, had some feud break them up, and all of a sudden, their relationship is irredeemable? \n\nNow I don't claim to know everything about  the situation, but I know Not-Sheila holds a grudge like a bad judge. So I call her out on this. Why would you lead Sheila, who by all accounts is wonderful and incredibly pleasant, to believe you still want anything to do with her? \"You're just being fake and shady af\" I tell her. Oh boy...\n\nShe goes off on me, saying I shouldn't give my opinion on something I didn't go through, and how I could take Sheila's side when I know Not-Sheila better. I was tempted to remind her she wasn't a victim, but I restrained myself. Then she gets sad and says she's \"hurt\" and starts typing in all caps. \n\nShe is seriously upset. I don't want to jeopardize our relationship either, so I try to calm her down. I tell her I'm not mad at her and profusely apologize. I try to get her on the phone, to no avail. She doesn't respond for a while. After some personal reflection and some necessary crying, I write a huge personal and revealing paragraph, hoping to empathize with her. She responds with \"Sure apology accepted.\" Not to read too much into things, but I question if it's genuine. This girl really holds a grudge. \n\nThe thing that perplexes me the most is she posts a picture of herself teary-eyed on her Finsta, saying how her day is ruined and she's trying to be the bigger person, but she's still the \"bad guy\". \n\n*TLDR*: Call out a friend for pretending to be another girl's friend, but she secretly hates her. She gets upset, I apologise, she(reluctantly?) accepts my apology. \n\nWas I the asshole for calling out a friend for being fake to another girl, should I be the one apologizing, and would you do the same to your friend?  \n",

      "description": "Background: All of my friends are really close, and there are 4 of us. We've been friends since we were 14 and we're all mid 20s now. \n\nFriends A and B moved to the other side of the country about two years ago, and myself and friend C visited when finances permitted it. Recently friend A has moved to another state again, about a 12 hour drive from me, and she's getting married in that state. I'm supposed to be one of her bridesmaids. My husband and I don't make a lot of money (we have about $300 left over per month after bulls), so we had a very small wedding in our home state, but none of my friends made the trip home. \n\nNow, onto the issue. Friend A wants all of us bridesmaids to pay for a vacation as her Bachelorette party. Basically, we pay for ourselves and a portion for her. I quickly noped out of that, because I can't afford it and think it's inappropriate of her to expect it. I still planned to go to the wedding, but now that it's getting closer I just don't know if I can afford it. I would have to take a minimum of four unpaid days off, pay for food for those days, pay for a hotel, and pay for transportation. I'd also have to board my pets if I brought my husband, who was also invited. If I can afford it it will be just barely, and I'm really not in a place right now where I can afford all of that and not have to make a lot of sacrifices to do so. I would be more willing to do so, honestly, if she had come to mine, but since she didn't I don't really think I should have to put myself in such a dangerous financial position to go to hers. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole because I could probably afford it if I was willing to turn off my heat in my house and only eat rice and potatoes for the three months leading up to the wedding. I also know she's going to be mad and make out like I'm just closing not to go for no reason, because she's a person with very high expectations of those around her. So, let me have it, reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So basically I met this girl on Tinder, and we instantly had an amazing connection. I've met lots of people off the app and I can tell you, I've never wanted someone as badly as I wanted her before actually meeting IRL. Due to life circumstances getting in the way, we chatted non-stop for 2 weeks. Conversations about everything, our traumas, hopes and dreams, our childhood stories, our secrets... Needless to say, I was falling for her HARD and I was super anxious to meet up. The night before our first date I could hardly fall asleep, and she felt the exact same way about me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, it's worth mentioning that we had been sexting really hardcore for days before our date, and basically there was the assumption that we would absolutely ravish each other the second we met. She was really forward and sexually agressive in her communication with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to our date, and the first moments go exactly as I had been dreaming about those previous weeks. We're really into each other and started making out, and that's when I noticed she had a penis. I stopped everything and I asked her \"so you're trans?!\", and she basically said that we had such a special connection, she was afraid of telling me earlier because she didn't want to ruin things and that since I am bisexual, she assumed I wouldn't mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was instantly floored. Despite being bisexual, I am not sexually attracted by transwomen at all. It has nothing to do with not viewing them as real women, but there's something about the idea of a woman with a dick that's just offputting for me and it's totally not my thing. I then instantly made some distance between us, I was respectful to her at all times but I told her I needed to go home and process all this information before I could truly have any reaction. On my drive home I started getting really mad - if we hadn't been sexting, it wouldn't have been that big of a deal, she doesn't owe me anything. But the fact that we were obviously going to fuck, how could she hide something like that from me and not give me the right to know beforehand? I feel really stupid for having constructed this fairy tale in my head for 2 whole weeks because she didn't bother to tell me this obviously relevant fact. It was a terrible feeling, and to be honest, I'm still really fucking crushed about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got home and texted her, thanking her for the date but that I was disappointed  and pissed she didn't tell me before and that it wasn't going to work out. She then proceeded to get angry with me, told me I was being irrational and transphobic and what not. So tell me reddit, AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I have a friend of over 10 years. She lives abroad and I am going to visit her area by chance in a little bit. Of course I want to stop and say hello and catch up with her. She has been really there for me and we have matured together. She even hosted a very not super together me a few years ago... for three months. It probably saved me. \n\nAt the same time, her partner and I never got along. He is, in my opinion, spoiled, dismissive, abusive, and entitled. He has smacked my ass. He said “right, if we aren’t having sex it is time to go.” He slammed the door in my face for not being okay with him GPS tracking my walks. He said he would have kicked me out if it weren’t for his partner. I quit my job to go visit so I was working on a mock interview with my friend when her partner came from the other room to say “you’re too flitty to get hired.” He argues and controls dozens of things a day about my friend. I am by no means innocent either as I was going through some stuff and frankly spending a few months in anyone’s living room will cause tension. \n\n\nShe seems happy. Even if she isn’t, trying to drive a wedge between the two of them is only going to isolate me and have her choose him instead of both of us in her life and I want to be there for her if she leaves him. I know she was looking forward to hosting me and feels hurt. I also know that I have come so far with building boundaries that I cannot allow this man into my life even for a few days. \n\nSo AITA for not sucking it up and staying with them? For making my friend choose between her partner and her friend? For not putting aside my differences for the sake of my friend when she could probably use a friend? ",

He continued on for ages about how he wants me to do better and just wants the best for me but it really upset me that he couldn't just be happy that I found a girl I liked. He doesn't know the girl so doesn't have any hidden information about her or anything and purely based his opinion off a couple instagram photos. So I got pissed off and stopped talking to him and he doesn't understand why. Am I the asshole? Is he in the right here?",

      "description": "Okay all, I've got something that's been on my mind for a while. \n\nThis happened back in November of 2017. I was on a trip with my Finance club in NYC. This was when I was an undergrad in college. We were visiting big financial firms in the area, but this part of the trip we were socializing with alumni of our college who work in NYC. \n\nThere's a bunch of different alumni, and we're all just socializing and chatting. I'm talking to an Indian lady who is probably in her late 20's - early 30's. I've asked her where she's from, and she told me a major city in India. I ask how long she's been in the United States, and she said she's been here since a certain young age (I don't quite remember the little details of the conversation).  \n\nLearning that she is an immigrant and English *probably* wasn't her first language, I proceed to compliment her on her English speaking ability. I say something along the lines of \"Your English is really good!\"\n\nShe criticizes me for saying that. She says that I should learn that that isn't something I should say in a setting like this. Then, she doesn't even let me respond, and instead either walks away to chat with someone else or just moves her body to the side and starts a conversation with someone else.  \n\nI'm obviously taken back and quite embarrassed. I didn't know how to react (she really didn't give me a chance to). \n\nFor reference, I am an Asian-American. Both my parents are immigrants to the US and English is not their first language.\n\nAm I The Asshole for complimenting her on her English skills?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She moved into our 3 bed 3 bath apartment with us and we're now talking about our next steps for the next apartment lease. Our rent is hiking up a few hundred dollars and we think it's time to find a new one. The problem is our roommate and his fiance have 3 cats, 2 of which hate each other, and a third that vomits everyday. At our last apartment, because of the amount of cat urine and vomit, the entire apartment had to be re-carpeted. Also, whenever they open their door, we get this huge wave of cat-piss odor. We don't want another issue with our next apartment, so we felt that it's time for them to part ways but we haven't said anything about it yet. We recently had an apartment meeting where we talked about our needs and we decided to look for 3 bed 3 bath apartments/houses. We also indicated that there's a possibility that our group might disband and that we should be prepared for us to split. Initially, I said that my gf and I were thinking of splitting.\n\nOur other two roommates (M, 26 &amp; F, 23?) talked to me and my gf in private and let us know that they were thinking of finding a 2 bed 2 bath without the cat owners. My gf and I are trying to save money and although we want our own space we figured this was the best path.\n\nThe cat owners make a decent amount, but we don't think it's enough for a single apartment between the two of them. She just came here from a different country and doesn't have any friends or family. She also can't work for 90 days or apply for 90 days, so she's not generating income. He works the night shift 45 minutes away. He has a bunch of debt and has already spent thousands on his fiance's paperwork/permanent resident card. We think he should move back to either his parent's hometown, which is closer to his work, or to the city he works in to save money. We haven't brought it up and our lease is up in 2 months. We plan on telling him this weekend.\n\nAITA for dropping our cat owner roommates and not even bothering to look for bigger apartments?",

      "title": "AITA For Being Upset That My Mom Won't Let Me Have a Candle in My Room?",
      "description": "Listen, I enjoy the simple things in life. One of those things being ambiance. I love me the soft glow and flicker of a candle and its gentle wafting scent. But I digress. \n\nAbout a week or two ago, my German shepherd chewed through a few hundred dollars worth of blinds in my mom's brand new home. I completely understood her frustration, and offered to pay for the blinds, but she declined. Since then, however, she's been unrealistically paranoid about mishaps occurring in her home. One of those things being a candle. I asked her if I could get a candle for my room (as I still live with her while going to school), and she said no, because she didn't want me to burn the house down. You know, maybe if I were 10-years-old, I'd agree. At the tender age of nineteen, though, I think I can handle a small Glade candle. She claimed I am easily distracted, which offended me firstly because of the lack of trust, and secondly because she couldn't offer an instance where I've demonstrated an irresponsibility equivalent to forgetting to burn out a candle. Her concerns stem from the three animals we have, namely the cat. My cat is constantly knocking things over, as many cats do. I am aware that this is, of course, not great for having a candle, but I also have a rather tall dresser that she's not yet jumped on or knocked anything off of. I stated that I could either keep the door closed while I had the candle burning or just keep a watchful eye that my cat doesn't jump on the dresser, where I'd keep the candle. Any solution I offered was shut down with, \"accidents happen. That's why they're called accidents.\" Either way, it's not like I'd have a candle going in my room without me in it. But okay!\n\nAnyway, I get that it's her house, so it's her rules. She does a lot for me, and I'm super appreciative. At the same time, I think it's a little excessive to not let me use one small candle in my room. I realize a candle is actually a risk, but lots of things can be slightly risky. And yes, you should try to minimize risk, but to what degree is it too much?  I also get that it's not worth being mad about; most people would just say, \"dude, it's just a candle. You can live without burning a candle.\" But sometimes it's nice to come home after a stressful day and light up that delightful smelling ball of wax. I was really looking forward to getting one for my room. Lastly, I want to stress that I'm not, like, super upset at her or anything. More slightly annoyed. I love her so much, and she's an amazing mom, so this isn't something that'd affect the relationship or anything.\n\nTLDR; my mom is paranoid that I'll burn the house down by accidentally forgetting to blow out a candle, so she won't let me have a candle in my room. AITA for being sort of upset that she doesn't trust me and is being a bit paranoid?",

      "description": "Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile. First time posting, so sorry if I'm doing this wrong.\nI currently work an office job. I have been here for 9 months and it is my first office job. This job has a busy season (May through Sept/Oct) where there is almost an overwhelming amount of work) and a slow season (November-April) where there is sometimes a manageable/reasonable amount of work and sometimes less than that. I work a job that pays an hourly wage, where I am guaranteed 40 hours a week regardless of the season and expected to work 40 hours a week regardless of the season. We are allowed to work a little overtime during the busy season if we need to stay late to finish something but it isn't encouraged or required.\nI would like to work 30 hours per week during the slow season (the minimum required to still get benefits.) I would like to spend less time at the office and more time doing the things I enjoy. I am fairly certain I can afford this. I am fairly certain I can get all of my work done in 30 hours a week if I manage my time well and work as fast as I do during the busy season. I feel like I am subconsciously slowing down in order to make my tasks last longer because I know that even if I finish early I won't be able to leave early. If I work fewer hours, it will save the company money because they will have to pay for 10 fewer man hours each week. And if I can't finish all my work in time I have no problem staying longer. Sounds good, right? \nExcept... \n1. My parents don't want me to ask for reduced hours. They don't directly pay for my lifestyle ( I pay my own rent, bills, food, everything) but they paid for college, and the reason I can afford to work fewer hours is because I don't have to pay loans.\n2. I want to be a team player and leaving work early every day would make me less of a team player.\n3. I would be asking for special treatment whilst simultaneously admitting that I have been working slowly.\n\nWIBTA if I asked to work fewer hours if I can get all of my work done? At all of the jobs I've worked previously, it was common practice to cut people's hours when it's slow. And I would hate to be stuck in an office all day if I don't have to.",

      "description": "I left my abusive Ex years ago and have since moved on and am in a happy and healthy multi-year serious relationship. I am over my Ex emotionally, and have done all of the mental health work I've needed to do to heal and identify abusive patterns so that I never find myself in that position again. The problem is, my Ex's now-adult child still considers me to be their Step Mom. We were very close when they were younger and I was with their Dad, and I loved them very much. I didn't treat them any differently than I did my own kids, and was heavily involved in their daily life and upkeep emotionally, academically, and financially, in some cases way more than their Dad ever was. I still love them just as much today even as an adult, and I'm proud of the person they've become. They also consider my kids (no relation) to be their Step-Siblings to this day as well, and we've never discarded these connections over the years just because I broke up with the Dad. Additionally, Ex's kid hasn't had any sort of meaningful relationship with their Dad since I left him. They unsurprisingly left to go live with their Bio-Mom around the same time that I left. I wasn't the only person being abused by their Dad.\n\nToday, I still have a natural fear of my Ex and his extended family because I know what they're capable of, and have avoided crossing paths with them wherever possible. I fear being targeted by them for having a relationship with my Ex's child all of these years later. I worry that someone's going to get a bee in their bonnet and come after me or threaten me saying that I'm trying to interfere in this kid's relationship with their Dad because that's the type of people they are, and it's very likely that someone like me would be targeted vs. anyone taking responsibility for their own actions that alienated this kid and made the kid not want to have a relationship with them in the first place. I really don't need any unnecessary stress or drama in my life, and it's all very triggering for me as a victim of these same people.\n\nAITA for still maintaining the relationship with my Ex's kid? I'm big on the concept of chosen family, and this adult child has decided I'm family (as are my kids) and I'm NOT going to let them down if that's what they want or feel. They tell me they love me even as an adult, and I love them, I just worry because I don't want to aggravate these people. Is there anything wrong with what I'm doing? Especially now that this kid is an adult? If I do get pursued, I'd like to be able to say fuck off from a place of power and knowledge that I'm doing the right thing, but I'd like to know with certainty that I'm doing the right thing first. Thanks in advance.",

      "title": "AITA for giving parents cold shoulder after taking suing my father for maintenance",
      "description": "I apologize for the long post but a bit of background is necessary. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was three. From what I gather from other family members they were awful together. There was zero contact from my father's family despite the fact that both of our families live less than half an hours drive from each other. So I will admit to a bit of bitterness that I held against him. He never tried to contact me or anything. Honestly she wasn't the best either. She was an alcoholic and I was repeatedly raped by a neighbour because she would leave me, then five years old, all alone in an unlocked house while she went drinking. He eventually moved away but I have never been comfortable enough to tell her what had happened. She was also incredibly violent in her discipline. I can remember getting beaten so badly once that my arm was swollen for a week and I couldn't move it and getting in the stomach several times. Fortunately she never broke anything and has reduced her drinking to tolerable levels.\n\nAnyway when I was 20 and in my first year of university I meet him for the first time at her insistence. It was weird and awkward but mostly I feel my resentment. Fast forward three months with no contact from him and she announced that they were getting remarried. I was completely and utterly blindsided. I tried to tell her that they couldn't get married then because I still had some of the negative feelings to deal with and she basically said tough luck because it was happening anyway. I know it sounds stupid but I felt betrayed that they got to reconnect while leaving me completely out of the loop.\n\nA month later they were married and we are moving again so my half brother, his son, can move in and the entire thing is a shit show. He loses his job and sits at home for a year and a half. They are constantly fighting. He would say things like she kidnapped me and he didn't know where I was. Or she will say his brothers made him choose between me or them. They were equally vindictive. He once asked me to gather blind jokes for dinner. I was confused by the request but excited because it meant maybe we would have a calm night. Nope. It turns out her dad lost his sight to cancer before he died. Honestly I spent a year and a half in a tailspin constantly questioning everything crying because everything they did reduced me to nothing but an object. \n\nThen February this year he gets a job but it's too far to travel so he got an apartment there and was supposed to come on weekends. He didn't. In April his mistress comes looking for him. My mother flips but doesn't confront him. When he comes to fetch some stuff he'd forgotten she tells him to start helping pay for my university fees because my sponsor isn't helping anymore and if he doesn't she will take him to court. This isn't true but I shut my mouth because it's my hide she will skin.\n\nHe says he can't afford it and still doesn't know she knows. Two weeks later she drives to his apartment at 2 am. He won't let her in because the girlfriend is there and she goes completely beserk. She tells me that I have to take him to maintenance court as I'm over 18 and she can't sue on my behalf. I flat out refuse. This is not my battle and I don't want to get involved. I'm stressed out enough as it is and failing so she turns my life into hell. I won't go into the details but it was possibly the hardest month of my life and in may I filed for maintenance. He was furious. \n\nWhen we finally made it to court he lied about his expenditure making it sound higher than it is and I have proof otherwise but I felt bad and wanted it to be over so I don't point out the lies. She wasn't allowed in as I'm over 18 so when the maintenance officer asks how much I want I just say a $100 which is not bad because he can afford ten times that and he really is not supporting me. She doesn't give me an allowance in any way nor does he so this seems reasonable in my mind especially considering how much more the officer and judge said I could get. God I was so wrong.\n\nAs soon as we got out he railroaded me. He called me some of the worst names and said terrible things to me. I still cry when I think about it. It was bad enough that some of the security in the court told him to wait inside while they escorted me out. Either way he started paying every month without skipping. Then last month he pitched up and then they tell me they are getting back together. Again I'm fully blindsided once more. They demand I must apologize to him for taking him to court.\nShe has the nerve to say that no parent \nlikes being taken to court by their own child. Let me reiterate she blamed me for him cursing me out in the worst way possible for something she did. Furthermore he expected an apology for me doing something he knows she forced me to do. I was completely flabbergasted but I could see that look in her eye. So I apologised. \n\nBut I can't. I just can't get back on that emotional rollercoaster again. I don't have the strength for it especially because I'm so stressed I keep failing. I have gone radio silence on both of them even though I'm still living with them while attending school. If I could move out I would.\n\nAfter everything I have a long standing resentment against the two of them. The problem is I feel guilty because they are my parents. Religion, family and friends keep telling me that my anger is wrong but I can't help feeling that way. I'm trying , I really am but everytime I'm around them I can't help thinking of them as the man who threw me away for 17 years and can turn on me at a switch and the woman who cares about me so long as I'm on her side and doing her bidding.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting anything to do with them ever again after this? For not speaking to them the remaining two years until I finish my degree. \n\nTL,DR was raised by an abusive mother and absent father. When they had a falling out after remarrying, my mother forced me to take him to maintenance as revenge and my father knew it was not my choice. In spite of this he was verbally abusive to me even though I asked for a small amount. Both of them then forced me to apologize for taking him to maintenance court even though both of them knew she forced me to. Am I an asshole for not talking to both of them despite living with them.\n\n",

      "description": "Hi reddit! This is my first post on reddit &amp; on mobile too so sorry about any mistakes on formatting and stuff. It's quite short, I just wanted to see if people would think this would be justified if I did something in future if I ever see this girl again.\n\nFor context this happened in our sixth form working area - a pretty small space, just for the sixth formers to use. (I'm not sure what this would translate to for other countries, I think final year of highschool? Ages 16 - 18.) Not quite a library, no more than maybe 20 computers and a couple desks, arranged in what I guess you would call a U shape, with a big whiteboard at one end. It's not much but a good place to study/revise as sometimes our library is used for the younger classes. It can get quite busy up there and most of the time all of the computers are taken because of the amount of students.\n\nI got up there early today so I could work on some english coursework, at 8:30, twenty minutes before lessons start. I didn't have any lessons for quite some time today so I figured I'd work on the coursework for a couple hours before then. \n\nI haven't been up there long until another student, probably from the year below me, year 12, puts her laptop on the desk next to me and starts fiddling with the wires underneath the desk. She unplugs the school computer from the main socket and starts using it to charge her laptop instead. She just leaves it there and walks off, probably to go to her lesson. I never saw her come back and I was there for a solid two hours, although the laptop was gone after I came back from quick break. \n\nIt was a pretty expensive looking laptop, rose gold in colour, so I was pretty shocked that she just walked off, but I was also annoyed that she unplugged a school computer that someone else might need to use just to charge her laptop, which she could have done at home or some other time.\n\nI ignored it, I'm not really a confrontational person, but I felt like unplugging it and moving it elsewhere. My friend suggested opening it up and trying to lock her out of her own laptop by messing around with the password but I felt that was a bit over the top. I suppose if people really needed to use the computer they could have moved it themselves or gone elsewhere but I felt it was pretty rude of her, especially when there are loads of other places she could have charged it, like the common room downstairs. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I unplugged it if this happened again?

      "description": "I am a white female that attends a large public state university in the US.  I’d like to clarify that i am 100% NOT racist. I do believe in equal rights and treating people fairly. That being said, i have a very broad humor and will laugh and enjoy almost any joke. But that does not make me racist. \n\nIts starting to get colder outside so the university has cranked up the heat (thankfully) but, because of this- many of the buildings smell rather badly. \n\nI get to class early one day and sit in my usual seat and my other (white) friend comes in and sits down next to me. \n\nI say hey and we make some small talk and we talk about how the buildings all smell really bad \n\nHe says \n“Yeah it legit smells like currie in the [dorm]” \nAnd i go \n“Damn... haha really? That bad? Must be those indian international students.. never heard of deoderant” \n\nWe both smile and move on with our conversation. And then this Asian chick turns around and asks us if we dont think we’re being insensitive to the majority of the students in the class who are infact indian. \n\nThis kindof raises our eyebrows and confuses us. I go on and tell her “no.. because im not racist. We dont actually believe what we say— its just a stereotype. Its only offensive if you get offended” \n\nShe told EVERYONE in our discussion group how “racist” we are and how she hates “privileged white people making racist jokes” blablabla. Terrible things are funny because theyre not funny. \n\nAnd its not like we were talking to HER. She was listening in on our conversation and interjected it. \n\nI dont regret the joke because i am not ashamed of my humor. Its dark humor, and an acquired taste. \n\nAITA? \n\n",

      "description": "So, where to begin. So basically, I work a  lot - part of the time is delivery work, and part of the time is other  writing projects and game projects - I want to try and make it as a  writer. Part of that work is writing emails to industry people. I've  been taught to spend out a lot, to get out there and try to connect with  people, but writing to people in say the television industry takes me  some effort - to find emails, to cater the email to them, etc - and I  have to write a lot. So I set myself up a reward system - if I do 40  emails in a five day week, I get to go out and go to the cinema and grab  some food. This is where the trouble begins.\n\nWe  get to today and I've just about managed my goal - but here's the  problem with the reward system; I'm not sure I want to go eat and go to  the cinema. I have a problem where I enjoy things less because I should  be working in those times - which is part of the issue but also a side  issue, I guess you'll decide later. Anyway, I have the problem that I  don't feel like cinema, but the alternative (Buy a game to play) doesn't  feel right - I should be getting out the house. So I talk to my dad.  Annnnd... the conversation goes a little like this. Skipped to the  important bit.\n\nRob: Maybe I should buy a cheap video game and play that.\n\nDad: That'd be a waste of time.\n\nRob: Right. That's the point.\n\nDad: Why don't you help me instead?\n\nRob: The point of the time is not to work.\n\nDad: So you don't want to help me?\n\nRob: I don't want to spend my reward time helping repair cars.\n\nDad: So you don't care?\n\nRob: I can help you out during the week if you want.\n\nDad: You're working during the week. So you're not going to spend time with me.\n\nAt  this point I just ignored him and went back to the stuff I was working  on. And since then (about an hour ago) I've been thoroughly pissed off,  and yet...\n\nThere's some things to  understand about this. By 'helping dad out' he means help fix the cars.  Now, there's a lot of history behind this, the crux of which is this -  dad has some four cars, all in disrepair and all 'projects' for my dad.  This includes a gypsy caravan, a stag triumph with the roof leaking, a  car which was recently repainted and restored to a basic paint shell for  a STAGGERING amount of money - which has sat there since without . He's  close to a hoarder, only I don't call him that because I've seen what  true hoarding looks like. And the garage roughly reflects that -  everything is everywhere and it's a fucking mess. After I personally  cleaned out the last bombshell garage. That's another story though.\n\nAgain,  lots of painful history with the garage. I mean I would spend free time  with dad, but I'm extremely reluctant to help repair the cars anytime,  let alone in my reward time. I know nothings ever going to be finished, I  don't know what I'm doing and I don't like repairing cars - I'd rather  be doing many other things. Maybe I would be more willing if he was  making progress himself, if he was doing much of anything himself. But I  see no progress - many of these cars have been here for over a decade. I  live in a perfectly nice house with engine bits all over the garden.  Suffice to say I'm not my dad's biggest fan. There's a lot of backstory  stuff and sometimes I wonder if he's a narcissist. But then he's alone  most of the day and struggles to do much with his day thanks to sleep  problems, knee problems, back problems etc.\n\nSo, there you go. If you've got any questions feel free to ask. Really I just want to be able to talk to someone about it all.",

      "description": "When my mother found out I was very lonely, she sent me to a new school. There, I (14F) met my best friend (14F). We really hit it off.\nI was pretty ugly so dating was new to me (by that time, 15F). So I dated this guy (16M) who was my first kiss. I got tired of him and I kindly called it quits. I had to keep seeing him because we had English classes together.\nHe kept texting me. I didn't want to talk to him, neither to break his heart. Once, he even sent a 10 minute recording of him crying. I ended up not being able to feel anything for him.\nOne month after our breakup, I met another guy. I had planned to tell him about my new boyfriend (which is not completely necessary, although the less asshole option) the next time I saw him, but before that he saw a pic of us kissing.\nAgain, he sent recordings and pictures of him crying. I put on with this for some days, but then I saw he was too toxic. But due to my personality, I couldn't get rid of him. So I gave him my best friend's(15F) number, as she had a history of dealing with stupid guys (which she did in a fantastic way). Now, I know it was very stupid of me.\nI expected her to get rid of him for me, but I know how I was and why I did it, so I excuse myself.\nNow, this guy approached me after class and told me he wanted to date my friend and asked for my permission. My friend had led me to believe (and I may be wrong here, because you know, that's what I wanted to believe) she just wanted to play with him.\nSix months later, in her birthday, we were having a good time when my ex showed up. I could barely breathe. I left early.\nSchool started and I didn't feel the same magic between us. I didn't want to acknowledge it. On the other hand, she would give me hints about she wanting to kiss me.\nSo I decided to make a move on her and invited her to hang out (we barely hung out outside of school). At the time of our meeting, she sent me a recording. Laughing the whole time. \"He passed by my house, now we are going to his place\". I felt like she had played on me. She hurted me so deeply.\nI did some research in social media. They had been dating for seven months.\nWhen I saw her in school, looking at her face hurted. I didn't talk to her.\nShe used this to leave our group because she knew we disliked her boyfriend. She grabbed her stuff and left. I thought \"I hope he is enough for you now\". I was so sad I went to the toilet to cry. One of our friends came after me and said my ex best friend would come back when they broke up. \nShe did. One year later, she apologized. I'm not going to trust her again.\nWe hung out with some friends some weeks ago. We got drunk and she shared intimate details of their past relationship.\nThough I'm cool with how she lives her life (and it's not like my opinion matters), I can't be friends with her, it makes me uncomfortable. Let alone have some kind of affair, which I know she wants. There is a huge experience gap.",

Come to find out we work at the same place so get to talking and make out a few times, whatever typical party stuff. We end up talking for a couple months and spending time together on breaks and outside of work. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and I'm not sure how I'm feeling about it. I tell her one night via phone call I don't want to continue talking they way we were because it seems like we're different people and want very separate things from a relationship. For example; I want a stable longer term and in her words she wants an \"exciting fling\". \n\nI knew she smoked and drank and it didn't bother me but the last couple of weeks we were talking she got really really heavily involved and that got to me because it was almost everyday. I tell her this bothers me and the result is not good. \n\nA few nights after I break things off I get a Snapchat from her which isn't really a big deal but it turns out to be over 80 videos of her ranting I dropped her out of nowhere and addressing details about previous relationships of mine as well as some very personal details I gave about past abuse. She said something along the lines of \"no wonder that happened to you because you're a shitty person\" etc., \n\nI haven't and have refused to start any dialogue calling her a bad person or insulting her character but she still directs social media posts towards me. I've also gotten texts from her friends calling me names and stuff. \n\nTldr;\n\nI break things off with a girl I met and in trying to be respectful towards her, I get called names and borderline harassed by her friends.

So the daughter was staying with us at the weekend because her parents suddenly had to go away and one of my daughters school friends had a party on Saturday. The mother of the child’s who’s party it was had asked that no one unvaccinated come because she was worried for her Newborn baby after the recent measles outbreak. I asked the mom if my daughters friend could come to the party with her as we were looking after her and she said that was fine. I didn’t mention she was unvaccinated. It didn’t really even come to my mind until just before we were leaving and I looked at the invitation again, I decided to ignore it and take her anyone. The child is very healthy and had no signs of illness. We got to the party and everything was fine until about an hour into it and the mother asks to speak to me. One of the other moms who knew the little girl who was with us knew that her mom was anti vaccine. So she asked me if the child was vaccinated and I said I wasn’t sure. She asked me to find out for sure so I pretended to text her mom and then I told the mother that she wasn’t vaccinated. She asked us to leave and now she’s very angry at me for bringing her. My daughter and his little girl were very confused at why we had to leave and honestly I think she made a massive deal out of nothing. \n\nWas I the asshole or was she?

      "description": "I have neighbours that have been playing loud music every weekend until 4 am for the past 5 weeks. It is very annoying, but I try to cope with it with my earplugs. They block out some of the sound, but the heavy beat is still there. I haven't talked to the neighbours for several reasons: 1) I'm introverted and shy and find it very difficult; 2) Every time this happened, I thought it was the last time (like, how inconsiderate can one be to do this every single Friday and Saturday?); 3) I hate conflicts and I was afraid it would happen if I confronted a bunch of drunk people; 4) I'm moving out from this place very soon anyways. \n\nSo, this time they played it until midnight and then I saw them leaving. I thought I could have a nice and quiet time! I have been struggling with falling asleep recently. I finally fell asleep around 3 am and at 3.20 this motherfuckers came back and blasted some heavy beat rap. I jumped up from bed like a freak, my heart was beating maybe up to 200 times a minute and I was all shaking. I grabbed my robe, ran to the kitchen, opened the window and rang their doorbell (yea that's the way flats are arranged). Initially I was planning to talk to them politely, but once the guy came out, I was super mad and shaking. He knew immediately what I wanted and asked \"should I turn the music down?\" I said YEA THE WALLS ARE SO THIN HERE, IT'S BEEN 5 WEEKS IN A ROW, IT IS VERY ANNOYING! in a rude and angry tone. Especially emphasized on the word \"annoying\". He said they would turn it off entirely and apologized politely. I slammed the window in his face and returned to my bed. \n\nI kinda don't regret talking to them in that way because they have been plaguing my life for weeks now, but I feel little bit like an asshole for almost shouting them without any notice. I haven't asked them to turn it off or down for 5 weeks.  AITA? They are definitely assholes in my eyes. The question is, am I too?",

In one instance I stayed up half the night trying to help a teammate who was psychotic while he threatened to kill me. I spent my own money on a game for another teammate so he could play it with me. I always made myself available to practice with people and help them out. Basically, this was an actual friendship group around a game, not just some randos to compete with. \n\nI joined as a \"flex\" player meaning I was supposed to fill in for whatever was needed for the group's activities, but with a promise that when a slot came open on the A team, I would get that slot.\n\nNot long after joining, because the team was in desperate need of more people who played a particular role, I started learning it. I discovered I was GOOD at it. I'd previously mostly done a different role, but playing this role instead made me feel excited about my hobby again. Not only was I better at it, and it seemed to fit my natural skills more, but I felt like there was so much more possibility to improve since I knew exactly what I needed to learn. The team nevertheless went ahead and recruited someone else to handle that role, which was fine since I wasn't that good at it yet. \n\nWe had team practices regularly where we were supposed to learn and get better together. I got a LOT of negative feedback in my new role, and after getting bullied in my previous team over my skill level, I just wasn't really in a place to handle it. It seemed like almost every time we lost a fight, I'd be blamed, or told I was \"feeding\" (basically doing something so stupid that it helps the enemy), even when it WASN'T my fault. The team asked if I could handle criticism and I said yes, but most of the time I wasn't getting helpful notes about what I could do better - just being told the same unhelpful things over and over. We had one coach who had a lot of helpful tips, but he wasn't able to be there very often. \n\nMeanwhile, when I went outside the club and played with other folks, they were really impressed at how ridiculously fast I was learning the new role. I played as a sub, or in friendly informal matches, with teams WAY above the rank of me and mine, and did well. So I just chalked it up to our team's coach maybe being overly critical, playing favourites, or failing to update her opinions after seeing my beginner performance. \n\nI offered to make time to practice coordinating with some other people, but they never really got back to me about it, even after saying repeatedly that they would. \n\nWe had a big match as a team, which basically determined if we would stay in our tournament, and which I was super excited about because the matches are streamed/commentated and some of my friends watch me play. I was REALLY committed to practice before the match, and probably put in more work than anyone else. Then on the day of the match, they left me on the bench until the very last game - when we had already lost enough points that it did not matter, and it was just a show match at that point. \n\nI didn't really complain at that point though, as I was just relieved to have been allowed to play at all after how quickly I had picked up a new role. \n\nSome time after this, though, I figured out the reason why it seemed like only some of the people ever practiced and played with me. The management's clique basically had secret extra accounts and played in a secret voice chat, hidden from the rest of us, so we wouldn't be able to ask to join in. I only realised after someone hinted about it in the general chat, saying there would be team activities later for some people, \"you know who you are\", nod wink. After I confronted the team captain about it, she said that she had trust issues and did not want to be guilted into playing competitively with people who aren't as good as her and would cause her to lose.\n\nAt this point I was just confused about, if they thought I was such a bad player and didn't trust me or want to hang out, I was still technically a member of the club/team. Everyone I asked about it verbally reassured me that they thought I was great, saw potential, loved me and wanted me around... but the behaviour didn't change.\n\nSome time after this, the team started trying out new players. One of my good friends tried out for the team, and I really threw my weight behind advocating for the friend. It wasn't just that I wanted to be able to hang out with them, but I genuinely thought they would be a great fit for the team. They were on the same team I used to be on and I sort of felt a responsibility to \"rescue\" them from the kinda bullying atmosphere there. \n\nThe management rejected my friend, and instead brought on an old friend of one of our coaches, who played the same role as me. It was clear that he'd be playing that role in team activities and matches, meaning I would get to play much less. I made it clear as politely as I could that I was pretty hurt by this - both that I had been ignored about my friend, and that I was being replaced. I was reassured that the team still really valued/wanted me, and the new player was a replacement for the other guy, and my role wouldn't change. I still felt as though there was an element of cliqueyness/favouritism, with how the coach's old friend had been prioritised, but I decided to let it go. I kept just putting work in to improve my own game. \n\nBut definitely after that I was pretty hurt, and discussed the fact I was hurt by venting to someone who then told the entire management basically about all the stuff I'd assumed would be kept private. \n\nTime went by and basically nothing changed - people ignored me, the clique hid in their secret chat, I got told off at practice for the smallest mistakes, and I was not getting the play time I wanted. But I kept asking, and the staff (particularly the team captain) kept reassuring me that they wanted to be my friends and wanted me on the team. \n\nOne of the assistant coaches, the B roster coach, told me that I would be the first priority, A roster, player for my role if I beat the other guy in internal matches. I did, consistently. I've since learned that he basically did not have the authority to make that promise. \n\nI was done getting blamed, so I started saying stuff back. Nothing that seemed toxic to me, but if someone angrily told me that I had done something wrong, if I disagreed I would just say, \"yes, I know we weren't coordinated there, but I communicated clearly what I was doing and I don't know what else I can do\", or \"yes I know I died because I was alone, but I needed you guys to come to me, I couldn't come to you in that situation\". \n\nAfter one team night, the management dragged me into a chat with the 5 of them and me, and basically told me I was getting a warning for being toxic. I was shocked, and couldn't think of what I said, so I asked, again as politely as I could, what I had said that was hurtful so I could fix my behaviour. Our coach could not tell me. She went off on a rant about how I had been unacceptably angry, \"had my claws out\" (whatever that means), accused me of tearing into another player, etc, and I just asked her WHAT EXACTLY I HAD SAID. She couldn't tell me. At first she claimed she couldn't remember but it was right after she told us to stop arguing. I remembered exactly what had been said at that moment - the B roster's captain had criticised me for making a play without giving him sufficient up front communication, and I said that I couldn't have given him much more because I had a small window to pull it off in. Nothing toxic, just basically asking him to stop blaming/criticising me mid-match. Our coach just mumbled something about how maybe it wasn't what I said but the way I said it, then we dropped it... after she basically threatened to kick me off the team. \n\nIn private I mentioned to a couple of my friends that I thought that was pretty unfair.\n\nI also said something to the nicer coach about how I really appreciated all his help, but was frustrated at the head coach for saying stuff to me without thinking constantly. I said I recognised she was really trying and was often trying to solo coach the entire team, but I would just rather she say nothing at all than say things that just frustrated me. He ended up not replying. \n\nThe next few games after that, this same guy who'd accused me of being toxic (B roster coach) was ON MY CASE. Like the whole time he couldn't shut up about how badly I was playing. After every incident I asked the staff to talk to him about it, and they said it was handled, but then he'd act the same way in the next game.\n\nKept asking if the team was suuure they actually wanted me around. Everyone was like yeah definitely we want to be your friends. \n\nThe team captain said she had come up with an idea to help resolve the situation. I had been asking for more official practice time, basically so I could learn to coordinate better with these people and they would stop thinking I'm a bad player, and so everyone could be included rather than having the cliquey bullshit. The staff said they were too stressed and busy to organise any more events or activities, so I made it clear I would be happy to do so. They gave me a role as eve",

      "description": "On Monday I woke up at 5:30 AM and noticed my phone was not charging. Immediately went to go see if my charger was plugged in, and smelt something burning. Turns out, my charger was melting and my pillow was smoking, which I assume means I was minutes away from a devastating electrical fire. All is well, and the situation was handled. \n\nMy mother happened to text me later in the day and asked me how I’m doing. I said well, and then told her about what happened to me. She said that she’s glad I’m okay, and followed up with several questions about what I’m going to do about the situation (alert my building/landlord, charge my phone elsewhere, etc.). \n\nAfter we had settled those things l, I communicated to her that I felt lucky and that I must have good karma. She followed it up with, “that, and I pray for you everyday 😘”\n\nNow, for a bit of back story. She raised me catholic, and both of us have hit a series of crossroads with our faith. I’m soon to be 24, and have decided over the past 2 years that I’m definitely an atheist. Being raised in that environment, it always seemed like I could never mention that, so I attended church silently and never said anything about it despite my deep down feeling that it’s all bullshit. \n\nShe got remarried in 2010, and is incredibly involved in her church community. She is no longer Catholic, she just “reads her bible and tries to love people.”\n\nShe’s aware that I think religion is crap, however she refuses to have a conversation with me about it. Despite these facts, she continues to drop off comments like the one above, which I interpret as a deliberate attempt to have me force the conversation. \n\nWell, I wasn’t in a very good mood so I replied and told her that in a religion where being humble and modest are virtues, it’s incredibly arrogant to think that **your** prayers saved my ass from being turnt to ashes, as well as communicating that I can tell it bothers her that I don’t believe in God.\n\nNeedless to say, it didn’t go over that well and she didn’t reply to me after I accused her of trying to bait me into a conversation about it endlessly.\n\nReddit, do I need to apologize, and AITA for calling her arrogant?",

      "description": "Hi everyone, a few weeks ago my girlfriend invited me to return with her to China to meet her parents during Chinese New year.  Her work visa is expiring and she's leaving Amazon as a data analyst in Boston, and invited me to join her for 10 days. \n\nI'm working on a startup company and don't have any savings left, only about $500 in the bank.  I already have $50k+ in student loans and credit cards to pay off, and taking vacations is definitely not in the budget anytime soon.  I work as an Uber driver, but also just started a 3rd shift security position. She's always thought that my company is a waste of time, and I should begin a \"real career\".  Some months I had to borrow money from friends just to pay my bills, and she knows this.\n\nWhen I told her I didn't want to go because of the cost (she says it's only $500, but it's closer to $1500 due to lost wages, visa costs, etc), she accused me of not caring enough about her, that I'm not creative enough to find the money, and that if I don't go either her, she'll break up with me.  We live together and I didn't want to move back in with family outside the city, so I said I would find a way.\n\nI did end up finding a way to pay for the tickets, an air currier service called AirMule where they pay you $600 round trip for your checked bag space, which payed for the cost of both our tickets.  She put the money down for them, because I couldn't afford my own ticket.\n\nBut today I took a 4-hour bus ride to NYC to get a Visa, and it's going to cost another $250 to get it approved and mailed back to me.  The truth is, I'd rather break up with her and work those 10 days to pay off my debts, but our flight tickets are non-refundable (no insurance).  \n\nI don't want to pay her back the $600 ticket costs for a trip I didn't really want to go on.  AITA if I break up with her and don't pay for the flight tickets?  Should I just go anyway?",

      "description": "So I have been with this guy for 4 years now. Needless to say he is a total narcissist sociopath. Besides all the other dumb shit, there's one part that bothers me more than anything else. He has kept a \"friend\" of his hidden from me our entire relationship. He knew her before meeting me, but has always sweared up and down she is nothing more than a friend. She is a 40 some year old doctor about an hour an a half away from us. Long story short, he has countless times went to her house, including Christmas Day two years in a row of our relationship. One year even hand refinished an entire bedroom set for her for a Christmas present. Has many of times went there behind my back lying to do \"only work on her house to pay back debts\". (He owns a construction company thanks to her buying him a $20k Dodge Ram, cell phone plans, and giving him several credit cards to personally use on anything). Basically gives me some bullsh!+ about why he always goes there and basically justifies it in his mind so me being upset is almost pointless unless I want to fight a war I'm going to lose. Also have found texts back and forth saying \"baby, honey, I love you, etc.\". \n\nSo leap forward to where my question comes into play. The latest scheme I came across was a few months ago when he dropped me off at a job we had (I'm the lead painter at his company since I cant work elsewhere). He said he was going to work for some guy off Craigslist about 40 minutes away that day. He calls me a few hours later saying his car died over where he was working. Me not having my car that day couldn't go get him. He said he would have to find a way and call me later. Ends up having his mom go pick him up later in the day and they come get me. Afterwards, his story didn't sound legit about where the car was (apparently some dude he just met off CL to work for was so gracious to pay to have his car towed to his house nearby and keep it there until my boyfriend could come get it). I knew he was lying as he will not leave my side unless he goes to her house. \nIn the past I had many of times opened up to his mom when I needed someone to listen to me or hear my side of a story, and she always reassured me he doesn't want the other woman or she would side with me claiming to not understand his ways but always reassured me that she would \"never lie to any of his girlfriend's or cover up for him\". This time, however I was damn sure he was at her house yet again but I began to grow suspicious of his mom. I asked her first where he was at when she had to go pick him up; see how close their stories matched. Hers was a bit off from where he claimed to be (she said he was on the highway in our County and he said he was going for a drink on break in the next County over where he was \"working\"). \nSo as habit goes, he goes from seeing her a few days to disappearing out of her for a few months before continuing his bs with her. After the day his car broke down he stopped obviously going to see her and there were no traces of her being in his life at the moment (he tends to drop her periodically after sucking her financially dry). Having known his mom has talked to this woman before, I felt this overwhelming need to look at her phone as his phone was really messed up (being able to receive calls or texts) and I knew this other woman wouldn't be able to contact him so she was probably upset trying to figure out what was happening. \nAnyways, I ended up looking through his mom's texts on her phone. I found what I truly didn't expect: She had actually contacted the other woman in the first place via text! She was apologizing for her son's phone as it was broken and he couldn't reach anyone. Also how he truly wanted her and wants to \"work on his relationship with her\". The other woman went on saying how much she truly loved him and how was an amazing and kindhearted man but she couldn't deal with the back and forth he did to her over the last 4 years. So much more I took screenshots of it all. It left me speechless and shaking for over 30 minutes. I had to act like all was fine as her and I were out at the store. \n    I went hunting for the truth and would never have believed his mom was the one trying to make it work between them! I live with them both and leaves me with no way out!\n\nSo, AITA for searching through his mother's phone in search of her lies? \n\n",

      "description": "We're working in a shared office space and I'm no stranger to compromise. They recently redid the cubes so they are a bit smaller and there are 12-15 of us depending on how you look at it. Three of the cubicles are along one wall with windows and the people with the most seniority got to pick those. Those people are always getting cold and it may or may not be because it's colder over there. There is some problem with space heaters where they have been disallowed. When I get too hot I turn a fan on but this only makes me slightly less hot. During the winter it is understandable we are utilizing the heat but now it is spring and everywhere is usually room temperature. \n\nWhen the heat kicked on around noon today I asked for the heat to go off in a number of ways but I was \"outvoted\". Eventually I indicated to my boss what seemed a reasonable expectation at the time. 'If the thermostat is set to 68 and people are cold then either the thermostat is broken or those people have a personal problem that should be solved with coats and blankets.'\n\nI feel like it isn't fair for me to be forced to work where I am uncomfortable and I feel the animalistic desperation of being trapped in a cage when I am forced work in a hot room. I feel as though my agency has been compromised and I am very tempted to raise all hell until the heat is locked up at 68 and they throw away the key. As I reflect in the problem I empathize with these people who are cold and can't have space heaters and I'm sad to be in this desperate 'them or me' situation.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My dad lives abroad and has some newfound flexibility with his work schedule as he nears retirement. He wants to start spending more time with me, my brother, and his grandkids, which would be great... expect for his personal hygiene issues. There is no underlying psychological issue causing this but he refuses to shower, put on deodorant, and wash his clothes regularly. He is in his 60s and is physically and psychologically able to follow these social norms.\n\nThis was a big factor in my parent’s divorce and I had to send an email to him while he was staying with me and my husband telling him he needed to take care of his personal hygiene while staying with us. He said he would and then did the exact opposite for the rest of the trip. It was so bad my husband was making excuses to leave the house or hide in our bedroom.\n\nMy husband and I are in the market for a new house that will likely include extra bedrooms. He offered extra money for the down payment if we found a house with a finished basement/in-law apartment type set up. AITA for refusing this money and not even agreeing to let him stay with us?\n\nTLDR: My dad stinks and wants to stay with me for extended family visits. Can I say no?",

We keep talking and i notice he is still being flirty and I'm not sure how to describe it but he was coming off too strong and talking about my body which made me very uncomfortable which i didn't respond to at the time but like a day or two later he does the same thing and i basically just tell him I'm uncomfortable with this and he's response was kind of aggressive, he accused me of not accepting any compliments from him and that it wasn't anything special every girl gets that from him and i responded that i do not appreciate them and he said it's fine and that he won't do it anymore. We havent really had any meaningful conversation since I'm not sure what to do i like him as a friend but idk if it would be wise to continue being friends in this situation\n Am i the asshole?",

It’s also important to know that her birthday is tomorrow, and that’s her reasoning for getting it done today. \n\nHowever, I got mad at her, and explained that I had plans for us today, and I’ve been planning it for a while, and it hurt me that she decided to spend the day with her friend and doing stuff for herself. \n\nShe was very nonchalant about it, saying how it’s just a day, and we will have many more anniversaries, it’s not a big deal, etc. we argued for a while, and she’s now angry at me for making a big deal about it. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here?

I go to pickup the prescription with my wife and son, and the car is dead. I call her to ask her for a jump, she says she can’t do it. She says maybe my brother (who lives with her) can. I ask how far out on him she says “at least 30 minutes” indicating he would probably get ready and was not in a hurry. \n\nI tell her don’t worry about it. I’ll call a tow truck.

      "description": "I’m a young guy doing fairly well for myself and everytime I start going on dates with a girl I end it before I catch feelings too hard. Recently a girl threw my backpack out of her house leaving me with crumpled paperwork. I told her I couldn’t go on because I cannot fall in love then she said she knew she shouldn’t have started talking to me. The fact is that things either last forever or there’s going to be a heart break, divorce or even a split family. That kind of pressure is so hard. I want to love but it’s hard to argue with statistics. Every married man I know has ended up having to pay child support eventually or stay with their wife hating their life without balls to breakup. I’ve been called self centered, selfish, and an asshole about seven times now. I never gave her or any girls any signs of even hinting of ever becoming official but when I end things I usually get called an ass who’s scared of love. Which the second part is true, I am scared of love... but am I the asshole? Things never even end on bad terms on my part as far as trying to come off condescending. Plus I let this girl and every other girl know exactly why I can’t talk to them anymore. \n\n\nP.S I always let her know in the beginning that there’s no promises and most likely nothing serious will come out of this.",

I was fairly confident I was going to get laid, which would be the first time in quite a while. We went out to drinks, and she then invited me back to her place, at this point I'm almost positive I'm going to get laid. We get back to her place, where I get to sit awkwardly while she talks to her roommate, about how she's kind of seeing this guy who won't commit, but \"omg he's sooo hot\" and how Josh and Craig from class are \"sooo hot\", and he much she Instagram stalks them. Am I being unreasonable, or this this kind of a shitty thing to do to someone? When I asked her if she was interested in fooling around, she said \"I'm actually seeing someone right now, and he's a body builder\".",

      "description": "So, I met this girl from Berlin while playing a game of Counter Strike last year. We added each other to our friends lists and started talking almost every day for the next few months. We exchanged pictures (not nudes) and video chatted a little bit every now and then. Now this girl looked like an absolute 9/10. I started to fall for this girl’s personality and looks, also the fact she played my favourite game with me really helped. \n\nOver time one thing led to another and we started a long-distance relationship in early December. I booked a flight out to Berlin for the 17th until the 23rd to go meet the girl of my dreams. I was going to stay at her home, and she was going to pick me up from the airport.\n\nMy Dad took me to the airport and wished me good luck. Everything was normal that day, we had chatted all morning until I got on the plane. The wheels hit the ground at Berlin Schönefeld Airport, and I was ready. I get off the plane and text her to let her know I was here. I go through passport control and I'm stood outside the arrivals door knowing that the girl of my dreams is on the other side of that door, heart pounding, anxiety levels at maximum wondering if I'm going to be good enough for her. Nothing could have prepared me for what was through that door...\n\nI find the courage after a few minutes of calming myself down and I walk through the door. I look up and down the line of people, but she is nowhere to be seen. I start wondering if she had bailed last minute. All of a sudden, what I can only describe as the female version of an extremely obese Danny DeVito who had been hit in the face with a shovel comes waddling out of the crowd calling my name. My heart dropped and all I could do was smile and wave. The first things through my head were the fact that I would be having to live with this goblin for the next six days and make sure I don't break her heart because I needed somewhere to stay and a lift back to the airport. \n\nWe embrace in a hug as I devise my plan on how to make sure I don't completely destroy the mental stability of this already fragile girl. We go back to her house and she starts getting frisky. I don't like it, but if I don't go through with it, she will know something is wrong. Never in my life would I have thought, as a man, that I would have to fake an orgasm. \n\nI just have to grit my teeth and get through these six days then I can be back in the safety of my own home. Now obviously this girl was not the girl in her pictures. WRONG. She was, but she was an absolute professional at camera angles and lighting and somehow managed to maintain that perfect angle in all her photos and during our video calls. \n\nI got home and couple of days later I come up with some bullshit about how I can't deal with the stress of a long-distance relationship and that was my reason for breaking it off. She gets really mad at me, calling me an asshole and all that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So this weekend, me (M21) and my girlfriend (F20) spent it at my place and everything was going fine and dandy, until all of a sudden, on Sunday (I picked her up Friday and took her back home on Sunday) she starts giving off an upset vibe, so I asked her what was wrong, and she said that she was feeling tired/irritated with me. When I asked her why she felt this way, she said it’s because she can’t be with a person (not specific to me, but it still hurts nonetheless) for long periods of time (i.e., the weekend, so like 2-3 days) and that she needed time to herself, for at least like, 1-2 hours. This makes me noticeably upset because we live in two different cities 3 hours away (so I had to drive for a total of 12 hours this weekend) and I put in all this time and effort to get to see her and just be with her, but then she tells me that she needs alone time while we’re spending time together, which makes no sense because we already spend 5 days of the week apart from each other. I even offered to not see her for 2-3 weeks, thus giving her more alone time, but she said that it wouldn’t change anything and she’d still be tired/irritated with me and would still need alone time when we’re together. All of this upsets me but I just need to know, am I wrong for being upset with her about all of this? I get that she’s an introvert, but I don’t want to put in the time and effort to come see her if she’s just going to ask for alone time while we’re supposed to be spending time together…",

Whispering like I should be ashamed about it as she has often made me feel. \n\nI know she generally means well, but this is the woman who tells all her friends very personal details about my mental health as if I’m her best gossip (despite me politely asking she keep me out of her conversations) and said to my mother several times, and I quote, “What are we going to do about (my name)? She’s not right.” despite me being a fully functioning adult that is entirely independent. \n\nShe knows it’s a touchy subject but heaven forbid I be in a bad mood even once because I might be “going back to being not right again.” \n\nI feel like no matter how much I progress she will never see me as a “normal” person and when she makes that one particular comment it frustrates the hell out of me.

      "description": "My friend and I have know each other since freshman year (before she met my boyfriend), but they knew each other before I met him and we started dating. She has a rather naturally flirty personality, which I’d honestly rather believe than think she’s up to anything malicious.\n\nWell, he recently admit to me that he actually used to have a crush on her, which is understandable because she’s drop dead gorgeous with the personality to match and super charismatic. Pretty much everyone has or has had a crush on her. It had me feeling a bit insecure, especially since she’s a very affectionate friend towards everyone. Hugging, holding hands, sitting on their lap, all that. So I asked her to tone it down a bit when it comes to him to quell my irrational concerns.\n\nWell, her response was to invite him over to her house yesterday, (just them, the only reason I knew they met at all was because I saw it on her Snapchat) cook for him, and ask him to be her date for prom since she claimed she couldn’t find one. I’m not going to prom myself so it’s not that I’m upset he won’t be going with me, but I’m still upset that she’s not honoring my wishes and seemingly just paying him even more attention.\n\nI was venting to a mutual friend of ours and she said I was acting like an asshole for even making the request because our friend was not required at all to cater to my insecurities. She should be able to touch him and spend one on one time with him because I should trust that they won’t do anything.\n\nI feel guilty for being upset because she absolutely has a point, I guess the timing of it, and the fact that neither of them told me or invited me to hang out, was what really hurt me.

      "description": "AITA here? \n\nQuick note: I did just post in here a couple days ago, but my life is all sorts of whickity-wack ATM and you guys are helpful AF... \n\nSo.. I live in a 4 bed 2 bath house. Admittedly, we are living up to the (elder) millennial standards, and there is a roommate in each room cuz gentrification is so bad in our town and I/ we just cant freaking afford other options. \n\nI have lived in the house for 3 1/2 years and its crowded, always dirty, and kinda sucks in general. Recently, my sister and her kiddo moved in and are now sharing a room. Me and my sister are both going through a mountain of life problems and everything is hard right now. We had plans of getting a place together so that her and the kiddo can have more space. \n\nAs we are looking into other places, we are getting worried as every place we have looked into will be more than triple the amount of rent we are paying now. While also being a much smaller space, and being downgraded from the amenities we have now. \n\nIn the current place we live in we have 1 single female, also lived there 3 1/2 years, and a single male that has lived there for about a year. \n\nNow, the male roommate, lets call him George. He is not the greatest roommate, but also not horrible. He has NEVER cleaned, literally NEVER. He wont even take the trash out, and definitely contributes to the trash, and general filth (especially in the bathroom) \n\nGeorge moved to the upstairs, and i moved to the smaller room, so that we could give my sis the large room as she is sharing w the kid. George happens to be a freaking giant. He is 6'6 and about 350 lbs. He does not try, but he is LOUD! He also has a messed up schedule and gets ready for work at like 3:30 AM sometimes. He wakes me up EVERY night, and sometimes the other rommies. He smokes weed (we all do) but smokes to the point of vomiting on a regular basis, and it sounds like he is yelling into the toilet because he is just so large. I have never had any issues with anyone else living above me in these last 3 1/2 years. I have talked to him about it, and although I can really tell that he is trying, its just not cutting it. \n\nSo, I'm thinking to myself, why not just ask him to move. We really need the space, and beyond that he is depriving me of precious sleep, and NEVER lifts a finger to help out. Also hasn't bought TP, or dish soap, or trash bags the entire time he has lived w us. I asked the other female roommate (who also never freaking cleans) if she thought it would be messed up, and she got upset, saying that its a horrible way to treat someone, and didnt want to talk about it anymore. \n\nI get it might be messed up to ask him to leave solely because we need the space, but its a complicated issue. Im also not looking to throw him out in the streets. Like not a huge rush, take a couple months and look for something else... Are you just supposed to let someone stay forever, til they want to move? IDK, AITA?",

      "description": "My friend’s English is not terribly good. Nonetheless he got a fairly high tier job at this big company and he is required to report to his superiors in English when he emails them and so he asked for my help in writing them. Sometimes he would write a horribly written email which I then had to rewrite for him. Other times he would just ask me to write the whole thing for him. \nAt first I gladly obliged. It was once or twice a week. However it kept going on. It is now almost a year later And he still keeps asking me to do this for him as a favor.( he claims that he used google translate for all the other times he won’t ask me) this is making me mad at this point  and I have started to respond to his messages with bigger and bigger delays and with colder tones. \nWhat really bothered me is that every time he would critique what I have written for him which was more than good enough for what he needed but he just had to devalue it. what’s more is that many times he would just neglect to even send me a thank you message after. I would send him what we wanted and he would just either criticize it or just not respond at all until the next time he would need another email or we would talk by chance. \nAm I the asshole for being mad at him? I’m sure if I mention anything he’s gonna brush it off as me being a shitty friend because once a week isn’t an  unreasonable request and shouldn’t really be something that annoying for me as a friend to do for him.

Now I probably wouldn’t have minded if they deleted the video and then left, because she was scared I would send it to someone ( even though I had it for five months and didn’t send it ). But they were in there for three minutes , and I know it doesn’t take that long to find a video so no telling what they looked at. Anyway they came out I got my phone back and just left because I was super pissed and didn’t want to do something stupid. \nAfterwards she said sorry and I said fuck off and that was the end of it. \n",

      "description": "So, I don't really approve of the speed at which this relationship has gone, but I've kept my mouth shut about it because it's his life and he can live it how he wants. Basically, my brother (let's call him Brian) started a long distance relationship with this girl (let's call her Sandy) less than 2 years ago. Brian is early 30s and Sandy is late 30s and has already been married once before (in case that matters at all). Anyway, they would see each other probably twice a month for a few months (because the drive is something like 16 hours).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 6 months in and Brian decided to move in with her. Brian was living with our parents still, so I'm sure getting out of their house played a factor. Supposedly, their plan was to live out there for a while and then move back here together because they both like this area. My guess is they were doing it that way because she has a house and they would need to get it ready to sell first before moving over here. Well, then all of a sudden, Sandy's mom got really sick. Cancer. So, they decided that they needed to both stay there, which is understandable. But, they decided they needed a bigger house for some reason. So, they sold her house and bought a new house (which seems crazy to me if their plan is to move back here anyway).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey buy the new house, get all moved in, and suddenly Sandy's mom's cancer is in remission. I don't know anything about cancer and treatment, so I don't know, but it seems a little weird to me. And this has all been in the span of one year of him living out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, now here we are, a few months shy of a 2-year relationship and he proposed to her. And I'm kinda just feeling weird by it. It seems rushed. Also, she supposedly wants kids, so I get that her clock is ticking on that and that may be why this whole relationship is on the fast track, but I dunno. So, Brian texted me and our other brother about the engagement in a group text and I just ignored it for a week before finally summoning up a \"congrats on your engagement\" text in response with an excuse about being busy with life. But, I found out that he was actually really upset by the radio silence and talked to our dad about not being able to get in touch with me, despite having only texted me that one time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for not congratulating my brother on his engagement right away, despite feeling weird about it?",

      "description": "About a month ago my roommates brother left his new puppy (no more then a month or two old) cold and alone in my roommate's dark room all night. Nobody was home and we have no central heating in our house, it was freezing. The puppy was crying all night and peeing/pooping everywhere. I decided to bring the puppy in to my room for the night so he could warm up and stop crying. The pup ended up peeing on my textbook which was a rental and ended up costing me $120. I briefly mentioned that the pup peed on my textbook to my roommate's girlfriend without expecting any compensation more as a conversational piece because she was already complaining about the dog. She immediately apologized and said she would get the pup's owner to pay me for the textbook. I was surprised, but said OK that would be appreciated. My roommate ultimately paid me $120 and that was the end of it. Fast-forward to today my roommate blew up on me saying that it was shady for me to take the money because I decided to take the dog in on my own. Apparently he was under the impression that the dog wandered in to my room and peed without my knowledge. I never tried to give this impression. I thought it was clear that I brought the dog in for the night which is why I never expected nor asked for compensation. I only took the money because it was offered.\n\nTo me this seems more like a misunderstanding that can be easily resolved. I have no problem paying the money back and I already said I would pay him, but he's still pissed. So, am I the asshole for taking the money in the first place?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to get the kids any Christmas presents?",
      "description": "I know this was last month but it recently came up in conversation again.\n\nSo this is the story ( a little long sorry):\n\n I (25F) am married (29M) and we have no kids. My husband has nieces and nephews (4 nieces and 1 nephew). We are newly weds but have been together for 7 years now, so I have been around the kids since they were little. Up to last year there was only 3 kids, both siblings just recently had baby girls. His brother now has 3 kids (11 yr old boy, 7 yr old girl and babygirl) and his sister has 2 girls (11yrs and babygirl). Every year we give the kids a Christmas present and of course we give them presents for their birthdays as well. Every year his brother hints at us that we should get his kids something expensive or more than one present each. For example, his son wanted a hover board and told him in front of us \"don't worry your uncle can get it for you this Christmas\" or in one occasion he said something like \"I'll get my kids gifts but then you two can show up with even more gifts for each\". It seems like because we have no kids he expects us to spend our money on his. This past Christmas I was texting his wife asking her what she was going to get the other two girls (their sisters daughters) and her response shocked me a bit. She said \"I only ever buy gifts for the kids, MY kids\". Keep in mind their sister has only had 1 daughter for 11 years until she recently gave birth to the babygirl, so all these years she only had to buy one more present on top of what she gets her kids. Me on the other hand, have had to get 3 kids presents without ever getting anything in return. They have never ever in 7 years given us any kind of presents. Never for our birthdays, Christmas, or even a wedding present. I never noticed this until recently. I am not a materialistic person but I do think that the thought counts. A $10 shirt or some chocolates or cookies anything to let us know that they thought about us and at least had the intention to get us something. But they are not like that, they love to receive but never give. This is not just with us, its in general. They go to birthday parties for the free food, they throw birthday parties for the gifts etc.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk so this past Christmas after I asked her and she said she was only getting something for her kids I thought that I should do the same. My husband and I have no kids, so I decided not to get anything for his nieces and nephew. I told my husband this and he said the kids were used to getting something from us every year so they might be confused if we got them nothing. He also said that its not their fault that their parents are cheap and selfish. While I was out Christmas shopping for my mom and sisters, my conscious got at me and I ended up getting all 5 kids a small present each. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you might think how is she an a\\*\\*hole if she ended up getting them presents? Well after seeing how the kids reacted when we gave them their gifts my husband has decided to not buy them anything from this point forward. They came over to our house and the first thing his niece said was \"where is my present?\" before even saying Hi or giving us a hug. The 11 yr old boy said that he didn't want clothes for Christmas thats not a real present and the 7 yr old girl asked where are the rests of her gifts and why was there only one. \n\nSo my question is Would We Be A\\*\\*holes if we stop buying his nieces and nephew Christmas presents from now on??? AITA for putting that thought in my husband in the first place????I know their just children but I do kind of regret buying them presents this time. We don't have kids yet so maybe I don't understand them.\n\nAITA?",

Next day comes, i wake up and i got like 20 messages from this girl, we talked for a bit and decided to hit it off. Now comes the weird part, my friend that brought her with him was interested in her but she was not interested in him.\n\n Did i steal \"his\" girl or did i not ?

      "description": "I was with my girlfriend walking in a crowded narrow walkway when a family of four stopped in front of us. In order to avoid congesting the walkway behind, my girlfriend and I tried to overtake them by trying to squeeze through the small gap that they left on the walkway. This was when an elderly man came from behind and tried to squeeze through as well. He shouted \"hello\" loudly at me and just knocked me to get through quickly. \n\nI didn't do anything on the spot as I was too shocked to react, but I got so angry afterwards that I felt like catching up to him to confront him, only to be stopped by my girlfriend. \n\nI got angry because the walkway was so narrow that it was basically impossible to overtake people without pushing your way through. He had to push his way through lots of people before ending up behind him. It annoys me that people are so inconsiderate and impatient that they had to force their way through instead of waiting. \n\nI was also unhappy that he shouted at me as if it's my fault for him knocking into me. He pushed and forced his way through from behind and expects me to have eyes from behind to see him coming. \n\nI just don't understand the thought processes of such inconsiderate people. My girlfriend and I would try to avoid knocking or even touching anyone when we are out in the crowd because we don't want that happening to us. What goes through their mind that tells them it's ok to push people in the crowd? Was I wrong to get angry at people for being inconsiderate? And what would you guys do in such situations?",

Since we broke up she’s dated two other people, a  girl who was with her for a rebound, and a guy who actually just left  her around an hour ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe girl was mostly kind and honest, and to my knowledge never did anything explicitly wrong other than worry my ex, and broke up with her a few weeks before getting back together with her ex boyfriend that she was rebounding from, but that's besides the point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe focus of this post is on his and her  relationship since it just ended and she’s mad at me for saying that she  doesn’t need him because he was an asshole. He said he didn’t love her  and that he doesn’t think they’d work out  together so he left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this was all it was, then it would be a  less “dramatic” situation, but, unfortunately, life doesn’t always work  out that way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis guy, who we’ll call ex, constantly  abused her emotionally and sexually and took advantage of her dependence  and overt need to love him. She gave him everything she was, but all he  did was ignore her. Ex would constantly go  behind her back with other girls, has been caught cheating a few times,  ignored her when she needed him most, was active on snapchat and  instagram an hour after she told him that she really needed him mid  panic attack, reaching the lowest point of her life  where I genuinely was concerned for her safety and well-being, and he  responded by saying he was going to sleep, he ignored her texts and  calls, avoided her in public, and even had the gall to say “yeehaw” any  time she said she loved him. He kept her out of  his life unless he wanted to have sex or get high and do shit to her.  I’ve known this girl for years and not once had she ever even touched a  cigarette butt let alone dropped acid or smoked anything. He took her  virginity after she told him multiple times  that she wasn’t comfortable and didn’t want to before caving in when he  started to get upset and angry. She’s already struggling with anorexia  and he told her that he doesn’t think he’d love her if she wasn’t  skinny. He pretended to not know that she didn’t  like a specific other girl that he would always go to when he was  ignoring her or mad at her despite the fact that she’d had multiple  arguments with him about it. All he ever did was yell at her and get mad  whenever she said anything to go even slightly against  him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says I don’t know anything about him  and that I don’t know him well enough to say any of that, but when she  comes to me every day crying about something else he’s done to her, I  can’t help but speak up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe’s a good kid and doesn’t deserve to be hurt like that but christ she doesn’t want to accept it.",

It started with the stairs, she was confined to the main level but okay it’s decently sized, recently she has started falling on the hardwood floor, over and over. We have to put rugs out for her to try and maneuver. She can’t even make it up the 2 stairs from the garage to the inside. I think it’s her time to go, get quality of life is nonexistent in my opinion. My mom has just recently started thinking of the idea but my dad won’t even give it a thought, he sees the one time she goes down the two stairs to the garage fine and thinks it’s going to stay like that. But then next time she needs help. He watches her walk through the hardwood floors just fine once and forgets about the time she fell 6 times in one hour. Obviously I love my dog and it’s going to hurt like a you know what when she goes, but AITA for wanting to put her down...? \n\n\nTLDR: Old dog, dad doesn’t want to put her down, I think it’s time.

      "description": "This happened over the summer and everytime I tell the story people tell me I was completely in the right and others have told me I was an ass hole. So I'd like to see what you all think.\n\nSo over the summer I got married and during my wife and I's honeymoon we planned to visit family after spending time at the beach. While visiting my mother for a few days she started it off by bragging about her new boyfriend she met on instagram. I was super suspicious because the pictures of this \"boyfriend\" was a super jacked soldier stationed over seas and my mom is just starting to feel better after being sick for many years (and still looks fairly sick) so it made me suspicious such a fit and healthy man would be interested in my mom. She's super nice and I know she has a way with words so I kind of just passed it off as my mom landing someone out of her league and didn't put more thought into it. My younger brother who still lives with mom told me he was suspicious she was getting catfished and asked for help to search into who this guy is. \n\nMy brother and I the  search him up and try to find more details about him. We end up finding a dozen accounts with the same picture but all with different names. We then approach our mother calmly and told her she should delete the guy off her contacts because we were almost positive she was getting catfished at this point. My mother acknowledges that it was fishy and told us she would.\n\nFast forward a day and we find out that she confronted him about the alternate accounts and he told our mother that people kept stealing his accounts and changing his name. On top of this blatant lie he started asking my mother for money so he can buy a new phone because his got lost during a bombing attack. We tell her not to send the money no matter what and it was a ridiculous she was even considering sending him money after all the red flags my brother and I just discovered. \n\nThings then took a turn for the worst and we find out she sent the guy their address and was planning on going to the store to send the guy money (which she had already tried to but inputted the wrong email address). My brother only finds this out because he oversees their address in a message sent to the guy. My mom tried to pass it off as nothing and just a mistake. This is the point I blew up and yelled at her. I told her she was acting very immature and childish by ignoring my brother and I and purposefully not following our advice out of spite (she does things like this out of spite all the time. She doesn't like admitting she is wrong) I followed up by telling that I understand she is lo ely after dad left her but this wasn't the solution and there was other ways she could meet people. My mother got real upset and thought I was implying she needed my permission to date but I told her as long as it wasn't a catfish then I dont care who she dares right now. My mother got very upset with me after that I yelled at her but I told asked how else would I have gotten this message across because I had tried being very civil and warn her about the guy multiple times.\n\nI know a son should never tell at their mother and to a certain extent I'm fine with being an ass hole to a certain agree but I'm glad in the end my message finally got across and she deleted the catfish off her phone.\n\nTL;DR: mother gets catfished while I'm visiting on my honeymoon with my wife. My brother and I warn her multiple times after discovering multiple fake accounts.mother doesn't believe us and stubbornly sends the guy their address and almost 1000$ American so he could get a new phone.",

      "description": "I've been in a rough patch for awhile getting adjusted to a new job and trying to move up in life so I pretty haven't been checking my messages unless they come from my s.o. I know my friend (let's call her jess) has anxiety issues and if I don't check on her I'll get text messages asking if I still love her. It's been happening for years and it makes me feel like shit but I wanted her to know I was there so i shot her a quick text explaining that I had been very stressed and just focusing on work and sleeping (which is honestly all I can really do) she texts back that it's fine and asked how I've been. Wtf!?! Did she not READ the text? I've always been there for her even though she goes to therapy she expects me to reply instantly whenever shes upset about something no matter what it is and she'll get pissy with me if I dont respond in a timely manner. I'd never dump something on her without asking if she could handle it but I'm really starting to get sick of just being there because I treat her good and I'm the only person who's ever stayed by her. In the past when I stop wanting to be friends with a user I leave without explaining because confronting people is my absolute least favorite thing in the world but I've been trying to stop. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Dating two years, moved in together 6 months ago. As a single guy, I had piles of laundry, dishes, papers, etc but always got to cleaning them up on my first day off. Now it’s like a competition between the two of us as to how long before one of us is repulsed enough to do something. Here’s our situation:\n\nMe: I make twice as much money as her, so I pay for every bill for the household (rent, gas, electric, internet, etc.) and food every other week. I work 12 hour days 4 days per week with 3 day weekends.\n\nHer: makes very little money plus has some debt from college and bad decisions. Pays for food every other week. Works 30 hours/week, but usually only has 1 day off. Lots of split shifts and half days. Also taking online classes for a certificate. \n\nChores: We usually work together cooking the meals for the week ahead of time. The dishes are usually piled up until the next week when we need to cook again. I use the same 3 containers taking food to work for 4 days, usually paper plates and a water bottle and beer cans on my weekend. She comes home for lunch, leaves cups of soda out each night. What I’m saying is I think she makes more dishes.\n\nChores (cont.): She does laundry almost every day. She has required outfits for each day that definitely cannot go 2 days without washing. She throws my clothes in with hers because it doesn’t make much sense to wash just her outfit alone each day.\n\nChores that pile up: trash is overflowing before someone takes it out. Dishes pile up. No sweeping, dusting, or mopping so far except once for her family’s Christmas at our house and I did it today. Bathroom is never cleaned.\n\n\nTL;DR- Am I the asshole for expecting the person who doesn’t contribute financially (and probably makes more messes) to help around the house more though I have more free time.",

      "description": "So on my lunch break at school, I usually get a sandwich from a local deli who have all sorts of ingredients for sandwiches which cost a flat rate of £4. Being a student, I don't have an income to really afford this and a drink everyday. So I decided I would start getting the 4 slices of salami from the deli for 50p - £1 (it's weighed) and a drink and baguette from a local shop for 95p more so I could save money and have a nice sandwich. However, today when I went in I assume the owner must have caught on to what I was doing and when I asked to buy just 4 slices of salami his mood changed - he grabbed a fistful and asked 'enough?', then throw the bagged salami across the counter and when I went to pay with my card he huffed, exclaimed I was costing him money, then slammed down the card machine and off I went with a thanks.\n\nWhat's weird is the owner is a usually nice guy, so I'm not sure if he was having a bad day or I pissed him off by not spending as much as before or 'inconveniencing him' during lunch rush. But overall he was just incredibly rude and I can't work out if he was justified or not.",

We were in the line to go through security and some woman behind me grabbed my arm while I was talking to my wife and told me to throw her water bottle away since I was by the trash can. Since she grabbed my arm and commanded me to do something I was a little pissed off and told her she could do it herself. \n\nWe eventually get to the front of the line and there is one lane open for the luggage x-ray. We put our stuff in the containers and are waiting for more people to move down when they open another x-ray using a different lane. A different woman from behind us goes over to the newly opened lane and she is standing at the very end leaving about 15 feet of space in front of her. My wife and I go in front of her since there is so much room and by the time I'm done putting our bags on the belt this woman is saying that I cut her. I calmly said she could go ahead of us if she wanted, then she said that she doesn't want to move her bags around us and called me an asshole. At this point I'm still pissed off from 5 minutes ago then this happens and all I say back is, \"Sorry to inconvenience you, princess.\" That was the end of it but I was wondering if I was an asshole for not throwing woman 1's water away and for us going in front of woman 2.",

People frequently stay at this house, and often in groups. They've got a lot of crash space. \n\nNow, he had some tattoos and some items of clothing that fall into the neo nazi, alt right, confederate, fascist type of thing. He goes to the house every now and then - referred to it as his sanctuary away from home. \n\nHe's younger than the rest of us, around 20, and we're all late 20s, early 30s. No one else at this gathering (around 12 of us) have ever expressed sympathy or leanings towards that kind of politics. I want to make that clear. It wasn't an all white gathering, if that changes the context at all. \n\nThroughout the evening he makes a few remarks and using derogatory language against different groups. Frequently without context or prompting. The group tended to ignore these remarks as if they hadn't happened. I made faces. Long periods of conversation would go on between these remarks. They were not constant or anything.\n\n One of the hosts is a very good friend of mine. They're Jewish and said that he was just young and immature and that they had spoken to them at length before about their views and that I should just leave it. They also said that this person had always been very friendly towards them despite what you might imagine. \n\nThe guy is very chatty and is very friendly and open. Even towards none white people in the group. I tried my best to avoid him for most of the evening and the morning after. I won't be contacting him outside of social obligations. \n\nI felt very upset and offended by these remarks. I even had to leave the room at points to clear my head. But... I didn't challange them. I told myself it wasn't my house or my guest. I didn't want to ruin the evening by challenging him. (Was a special occasion). I feel like I should have spoken up. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? And if I ever see them again how should I respond? \n\nP.S. I really would appreciate not having the other people there judged or insulted. They are my friends and have been for years. They haven't come here for judgement but I have so please try to limit it for me.\n",

      "description": "I'm really sorry if this story is petty. My boyfriend bought me an Adidas hoodie from the local Adidas outlet for Christmas (he also gave me a gift receipt). As I hinted at gym clothes, I was super appreciative that he was on point there.  Being honest though, the style wasn't bad, but it wasn't my favorite either.  It happens -- gift giving, especially in the \\[somewhat\\] beginning (1 year together), can be tricky, especially with something as personal as style. I'm not sure if price is relevant, but it was on sale for \\~$20-25. Anways, I was shopping today, and saw an Adidas style I LOVED, and decided to exchange the hoodie and get this one I really liked instead. I told him about this not too long ago and he was very upset. After listening to his side, these were his arguments: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. \"The sentimentality of the gift is gone\" -- other words of his paraphrased: I picked this out for you, and when you see it/wear it, you'll think of me and remember that I got this for you for Christmas. Now you can't do that with this new one. It means literally nothing (I don't think this is true at all -- I thought this was really out of line).  \n2. \"Why didn't you keep the one I bought you, and buy the one **YOU** want with your own money? You can afford to buy it. -- Now, the one I wanted was more expensive, so I just paid the modest difference in price between the two. He also knows I don't have any extra money to be spending friviously on clothes. I'm on a super tight budget -- I'm a full time MBA student + working 2 jobs (50 hours/week) just to bump my savings.  \n\nI tried explaining how I feel, but he's pretty stubborn about this. He continued to make me feel really bad for doing this and ended the phone call with, \"Whatever, you do you. Next time, I'll just give you cash instead, if this is how it'll be.\" AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My daughter, like me, has fine, thick, wavy hair. You know how they say that the grass is always greener…? Well much like I did at her age, she hates her hair and wishes it were straight. When I was young, there were no Brazilian hair or Keratin treatments to make it straight. These days there are a lot more options, and they are very expensive. The semi-permanent technique can last between 3 and 5 months, and puts you out about $150 to $300 per treatment. Several of my female friends and family members seem to think that I should do this for my daughter. Every time the subject comes up, I feel their disapproval about the fact that I am denying her this. I might actually consider it, if money wasn’t so tight. I’m a single mother who works full-time, and have no other income. AITA for thinking she’s too young and/or that my money could be better spent? My daughter does have some bad hair days, but overall her self-esteem is great. ",

      "description": "So this will be the second time this month this occasion will have happened. A few weeks back, we celebrated another similar occasion but for the other side of the family (a side of the family, mind you, that they don't even care for). So it already felt particularly pointless because coming from my own family, if we don't get along, we don't try and act like we do, so we wouldn't have even gone. But alas, I trucked with them and spent my entire Sunday over an hour away just sitting there making small talk with people that hardly know me, or even want to for that matter.\n\nThis Sunday, we're doing the same thing for the other side of the family. What's more frustrating is that I just got done working a nearly 60 hour week and my weekends have become almost sacred to me. I won't get home until 7-8 on most nights, so I've had very little time to myself. \n\nWhile this side of the family likes each other and we're more conversational, they tend to spend the entire day with one another, often not leaving until well after sundown. I don't mind showing up and being conversational for a few hours, but they're the type to just exist in the same room together and it's expected that you be there, too, regardless of how much is going on. They'll be playing a card game together (that only 4 can play), while others will be talking about some gossip that I have absolutely no hand it, while some others will be lamenting about family drama. \n\nI understand that I'm marrying into this family, but their social practices go well past my patience or even involvement for that matter, because I don't feel involved. I don't know or care to gossip about their family. I can only catch up with what they've been doing for so long, and playing card games only entertains for a few rounds. I hardly want to spend that much time consecutively with *anyone,* let alone extended family of my fiancee. \n\nIt's a classic case of the in-laws I suppose, but in the context of the previous work week, I told my fiancee I would go and participate, but would not be staying as long as everyone else, and would be leaving when I felt comfortable. \n\nAITA?",

He picks up the ingredients, and lets me know this by telling me I “owe him $18.50.” \n\nI’m flabbergasted. I don’t see the difference between buying ingredients and bringing a dish yourself and buying ingredients for me to put together. Apparently the fact that he won’t actually be there is the difference. \n\nHe now feels I’m in a bad place financially, not being honest with him, and should have just asked for cash if that’s what I needed. \n\nI just think any rational human being, who happened to be my boyfriend, would “donate” $18.50 to this event without thinking twice.\n\nNeither one of us is hurting for money, by the way. \n\nI can’t see his point.

      "description": "I feel like this issue is one of the least significant posts on here, with problems relating to family, life, death, career floating around, I almost feel embarrassed having to ask this, but this is a rare instance where I really cannot make up my mind whether or not I did wrong. Help me, reddit.\n\nSo for more background information, I entered into a draw on a website. The draw will happen on April 5th which has not happened yet at the moment of posting. Their rules are that if you win, they will charge you after you win, and if you don't get what you want, they charge you nothing. No transaction occurs.\n\nAs you go through the buying process, it makes you check a box, and I quote: \n\n&gt;I understand that if I win the draw, the product will be dispatched and I will automatically be charged the price of the product plus shipping. I also understand that once my card is charged I cannot cancel the order or return this product as ALL SALES ARE FINAL.\n\nI entered the draw, and decided to back out yesterday, April 2nd. I emailed them insisting to withdraw me from the draw, but they insisted that all sales are final and that they cannot do it because \"the inventory has been locked in\" or something like that, I didn't quote exactly what they said. I know for fact that my card has not been charged like the box checked, and I get that all sales are final, but this sale hasn't even gone through??\n\nFrom my point of view, it's almost as if I had something in the cart, ready to order. And they have my credit card information. When I remove the item from they cart, they won't let me do it and say that I must purchase because it's already in my cart, and I think that's stupid.\n\nFrom their point of view, maybe I really am just an irate patron that didn't spend enough time reading the fine print (even though I did) and asking of a great inconvenience of them to remove the order and complicate their drawing process. If someone has worked in a similar environment, I would really be keen to hear about your experiences as well. Is it really that big of a deal? Am I overreacting to making a decision too rashly that  I should really just own up to?",

So what can you do with a jailbroken console?\n\nM: Download games to it, add cheats, do some other cool stuff that I've only read about but not tinkered with yet, etc, etc\n\nF: Oh wow!

No. 56 or are we in the triple digits now?\n\nF: Fuck this, I'm out *Grabs his stuff and heads for the door*\n\nM: *Still sitting at the table working* Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, I don't need it pulling a Houdini \n\n\nTo this day he still hasn't forgiven me for the comments where as I've forgiven him but it still weighs on me: Should I have bite my tongue and just done it or just declined nicely?",

      "description": "1st time posting, long time lurker. So I'm Chuck, 28M, DJ/MC from LA. My friends call me Chucky, ChuckDizzle, or just Chuck-EEEEeee... depending on the situation.\n\nThis situation is about me and my FWB Kelly. We have been chillin since college. Nothing too serious though. When either one of needs some company, the other one is there. That's pretty much how it's been since the beginning. Kelly is the sister of my friend Hyun. We have pretty much the same circle of friends, and we are all really close. Our \"relationship\" was never really a secret to the group, but we never officially announced what we are.\n\nOur other friend Vi was getting married this weekend, so we all went to vegas to celebrate. Turns out that Kelly pregamed too hard, and by the time we got too the club, she was already sloppy drunk. Somehow just because we sleep together sometimes it became my responsibility to take care of her. That meant I couldn't really party, and I couldn't hook up. Was pretty pissed.\n\nAfter the club we went to get tacos. Kelly suddenly screams that she had an announcement. In front of everyone Kelly says that she texted her boyfriend and broke up with him. Then she said that her and I had been sleeping together(except more explicitly) since college. She said that she was in love with me. She had been in love with me for years. She tried to fight it, I am a douchbag and an asshole, a mysogonist, broke, lazy, no future, etc, etc. And her parents hate me. But no matter how many times she has tried to find someone better than me, I am the only one in her heart. Then she tried to kiss me.\n\nI stopped her from kissing me. everyone was stunned. They didnt know whether to laugh or not. I could tell. Hyun is just like, WTF bro? I'm just like, 1st of all, she is drunk, And we hook up sometimes, but that's it. So I'm really pissed at this point. I am talking louder than I mean to, and I tell Kelly that she is drunk. She probably doesnt know what she is saying. Even if she did, she knows I dont want that kind of relationship. I am trying to focus on my music. Plus I am not trying to settle down. Even if I were gon a settle down, Kelly wouldn't be the one I chose. She cheated on every single boyfriend she ever had(with me). And if she would cheat on them, she would prolly cheat on me too. Plus why would I wanna be with someone who thinks so lowly of me. I need somebody who supports my dreams. So no, we wont be a couple. And that whole FWB thing is done too.\n\nShe started crying. They all took her side. I took an uber back to the room. This morning I got a text talking about I should apologize. \n\nShould I Apologize? Should I give her a chance? Am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR Long time FWB confessed to me drunkenly, I turned her down now everyone's mad at me.",

So one day he got out of a relationship and somehow miss trashy found out and wanted to get back together, they broke up because she got her boyfriend (while she was dating my friend) to basically attack him over text, saying terrible things to him that was uncalled for. But she wanted I’m back because he guy she was dating cheated on her. So we where talking and he said he might get back together with her and I said “ don’t, she asked me out just yesterday” and it worked. He didn’t get back together with her, for like a week. But apparently he had been talking with the girl and she said she never asked me out and I guess her word against mine because everyone exploded. Saying “YOUR NOT MY FATHER” and “I CONTROL MY OWN LIFE” and stuff like that, we haven’t talked much sense ",

Our four year old wanted a kitten.  He took her to the shelter and let her pick one out.  We are now back at two cats.  A year or two later he gets tested for allergies because he is always sick.  One of the things he is allergic to, among many other things, is cats.  Not violently allergic, just sniffles and sneezes, etc.  He begins taking allergy shots because he is allergic to almost all molds, pollen, grasses and tress as well as cats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe fight almost daily about the cats.  Our daughter is an only child and calls her car her brother.  My husband hates that cat. It has peed all over our dining room and is now kept out with baby gates.  The cat hates everyone but our daughter and bites everyone but our daughter.  Hubby wants to throw the cats out of the house, like just put our spoiled, declawed (they were that way when we got them) cats out in the snow.  Every fight he threatens that and my daughter cries and hugs the cat.  I think he is being unfair making her choose between her dad and her cat.  He thinks I like the cat more than I like him.  Am I the asshole for not getting rid of the cat that my husband picked out for our daughter but that he is allergic to?",

      "description": "He had been complaining about an employee who would close early and have her boyfriend in and hang out with him on the clock. \nSo one night, I’m working and her boyfriend is there during her whole shift and she shuts down the register 30 minutes early. \nI messaged my fiancé about it. I attempted to send him a picture of the employee not doing work because she was standing around talking to her boyfriend. Not my finest moment, she saw me taking the picture. \nDuring my conversation with him he said “okay, thank you for letting me know. We will work on getting a replacement.”\n\nI felt like this was unfair since they had never spoken with her about it and offered to talk to her. Which he responded with “Please talk to her.” \n\nI told her that it was inappropriate for her to be closing early and to have her boyfriend there. She immediately got defensive saying that she was trained to close a half hour early and I explained that had never been the policy. She then began to throw all her co-workers under the bus. \n\nShe was overreacting and kept saying she felt the need to talk to his parents about the problem. I told her that was a terrible idea and that she should see my fiancé as HR and that you don’t go talk to the CEO of the business. I explained that just because they owned the business did not mean they have managerial skills and that if they did, someone would have communicated with her before. She began panicking that she would be fired and I told her I thought she was friendly, beautiful, and hardworking and that was not going to happen. That it was all just a miscommunication and to just do her best in the future.\n\nThe second she leaves, she sends my future mother in law a text saying “call me ASAP.”\nI go home and explain the situation to my fiancé and he tells me I did nothing wrong.\n\nThe next day she sits down with his parents and tells them I said she was horrible and that I made fun of her nose. His parents are angry at me for speaking with her. And suddenly he is angry at me too. \n\nHe talks to her the next day and says that he doesn’t intend on firing her because (this is her first day back) “she was doing a lot better”\nShe also told him “I like helloiamtrash- but she’s being weird” and talks more shit to him about her fellow coworkers. \n\nWhen he gets home he asks me about the photo I took of her and I explained that I made a mistake, but that I was trying to show him that she was slacking off. He’s extremely hung up on this and keeps telling me how wrong it was. I get that; but I also do not feel like that makes what she did okay.\n\nI’m upset that he does not plan on letting her go after she disrespected and betrayed me to my future family. I’m also upset that they had every intention of firing her until Now. He wants me to just “let it go” and I don’t even feel comfortable going into a business I feel I helped build. \n\nAITA? I just want to feel supported by my SO and future in-laws.",

      "description": "I have a kindergartner, and about a month ago the teacher called me and said my kid called another classmate a name and the parents wrote the teacher a letter about it because their kid was upset. So the teacher tells me she read the letter to my kid and he was required to apologize to the classmate and write an apology note. He apologized at school and had the option of writing his apology note at home or school. He chose home. \n\nI picked him up from school that day and the teacher reminded me about the note. I asked if I could see a copy of the letter so I could make sure we addressed all the concerns of the other parent. The apology note would be a lot different if the note was “my kid was upset and embarrassed and doesn’t want to be around this other kid anymore” versus “what little jerk called my daughter a psycho and when can I expect his head on a platter”. Teacher said I could not see it, even with the other kid’s info blacked out. She told me she read my kid the letter, but refused to let me see it.\n\nI went to the principal and got the same answer, so I took it to the school board, then superintendent, and the district superintendent. All of them have maintained that it would be a breach of confidentiality to let me see the letter. I believe the confidentiality was broken when the teacher read it to my son, which she now denies doing, of course. So the story hit our local news and I did the bad thing and read the comments on the story from the trolls. At the time I felt like I was doing the right thing, holding them accountable for reading a letter (from a parent to a teacher) to a kindergartner and then telling me I had no right to see/read/hear the contents. Now, it’s blown up and I’m doubting myself.\n\nAITA for taking it this far? Should I have let this go and just moved on? ",

      "description": "My brother and I has always been close, even with his multiple girlfriends in the past. We share multiple hobbies like gaming together and we have a great relationship.\n\nAbout 6 months back, he got a new girlfriend and ever since then, I have been spending lesser and lesser time with him due to his girlfriend’s obvious displeasure with me spending time with him. Do note that I have not done anything that offended her, she’s just really attached to my brother. So, everytime I start chatting with my brother, it never last more than 5 minutes because she would just be sitting beside quietly and showing a face of displeasure. When she’s at work and my brother gets to game with me, she expresses displeasure when my brother doesn’t reply her in time. Due to this, we hardly game now as she limits and complains about his gaming time. (Which is usually only 2-3 rounds?)\n\nLook, I understand that couples have to spend time with each other and all, but they are literally stuck at the hip 24/7.  She’s always hanging around my house and has been really incosiderate to my family but laughing and talking really loud even at night. (She has a really high pitched voice.)\n\nThere has been instances where she was rude to my parents as well. One instance was that she walked out of the room in anger when my mom said something that opposed her views.\n\nUsually, I am quite a amicable person and don’t like to pick up fights, but this is really getting out of hand. So WIBTA if i call her out on it?",

      "description": "He is my mother's boyfriend's son. We are both 21. We both have our other parent's house so he does have where to sleep if I lock him out. Legally, this house is 100% my mother's.\n\nEvery time my mother and her boyfriend travel it’s the same thing: I’m the responsible one and the sole guardian of the house. My step brother has one of the two keys but I can double lock the house and I’d be the only one to have the second key apart from my grandma.\n\nIt sounds nice having the place to myself while mom and her boyfriend are away, but it also carries many responsibilities: I’m fighting a pest problem, I have to wake up early to walk the dog, wash my clothes, do the dishes, tend to the garden (tomatoes, onions, spices), buy groceries, make sure the dog is not left alone for too long, on top of that I work and study. This is a big house so it’s very difficult keeping it clean on my own when there's normally five of us.\n\nMy step brother does absolutely none of these things. He is usually at his mom's house but will come home with very short notice very late at night. After many years of him kicking the door to wake me up until I opened the double locked door, he has finally learned to send me a message (never earlier than 10:00 pm) to let me know he is coming that night. He arrives late at night, sleeps all day, will not help if there's an issue, will leave dirty dishes on the sink, and wet underwear on the bathroom floor.\n\nI try not to cause trouble with him because his dad will not let me say anything to his kids directly. So I usually let things like him coming on short notice slide (meaning I let his dad know but don’t push the issue when nothing happens). The only thing I ask of him is to clean up after himself.\n\nThis week he had already left his underwear on the floor twice, and I’m handling a lot more stuff than usual I’m very stressed, so he finally got some scolding. The thing is, he reacted screaming on the phone to my mom that I’m leaving the kitchen in a disgusting state and how dare I ask him to clean up when I’m such a pig. It left me in tears.\n\nI have been doing SO much stuff, that yes, I cooked and left some dirty dishes in the sink for a couple days while I solved some big issues at work. So here is the thing: he does not use the kitchen and doesn´t clean, so the only one who has to clean two-day-old nasty dishes is me. He only leaves his room to use the bathroom so he only sees the mess on his way there.\n\nI’m reaching my breaking point and nothing will be done apart from asking him to pick up his underwear from the damn floor. I invited him to give me a hand with the cleaning so that I can keep up with the chores and he won’t.\n\nHe has just left to his mom's, next time he tells me at 10:00 pm to leave the door unlocked for him I won’t, and pretend to be sleeping. And I will keep doing it until my mom is back. He will have to go all the way to his mom's an hour away in the middle of the night to sleep. WIBTA?",

I want to be able to expand myself as a person and take on as many opportunities I can. I want to be able to take advantage of whatever I’m allowed my hands on. I’ve already gotten offers for a bunch of prestigious summer programs and internships that would be highly beneficial to my portfolio. I’m in the process of completing my applications for them as well. In fact, I’m waiting to hear back on one of them soon. \n\nHowever, this morning, my mom told my dad&amp;I out of nowhere that we were visiting Vietnam this summer. There was no mention of this trip prior. My dad was just as surprised and objected as much as I did. She refused to take no for an answer, even though I explained to her that this year would be the only year I’d reject. Any other year was fine, but this year was too important to me. She wouldn’t hear it though. So, I snapped and definitely told her that I wasn’t going. She would have to drag me out in order to make me go. \n\nWas I too harsh? ",

      "description": "I'm an 18 year old student and currently living with my parents because I can't afford not to.\n\nRecently, my parents and I have moved to another country. Due to citizenship issues, my dad is currently living in our old country, and unable to be here. He has the car, neither my mom or I can drive.\n\nThe issue is we were unable to move my bed from our old house to our new apartment. So we got me a manual-inflatable air mattress (pump with your hands) as a bed, and my mom has a very specific idea on what she wants \"my\" bed to be. Since I'll be moving out as fast as possible, she wants to buy a certain kind of bed for guests and etc. Before my dad left, they went to an Ikea a couple hours away to look at beds, and asked what kind I wanted. I said I didn't care, I personally was fine with my air mattress, and honestly this is probably my fault for not pushing them to get a bed.\n\nThey didn't get a bed, my dad left for my old country, so now I'm just living with my mom with no car and pretty much out of most cheap delivery ranges. \n\nMy air mattress started deflating. It would fully deflate within an hour of me laying on it, I can't find any holes, so now I'm basically just laying on the floor unless I manually pump it. I already have hip issues so it doesn't help I'm laying on the floor, and I didn't want to bother my mom about it and give her the stress of getting a bed all the way out here somehow, so I'm sleeping on the couch in the living room.\n\nHere's where the AITA comes in. She gets up at 5 AM every day, makes her breakfast, and watches TV during it. There is a chair in the room, and I won't wake up if she watches TV (that's been proven) , but she finds it incredibly irritating that I am asleep on the couch and gets pissed off at me for it. She finally snapped this morning, texted my dad, and they both made me wake up and get off the couch.\n\nI fully understand why she's mad. This is pretty much the only time she has without work or me. And I'm there. So I'll be moving back to my room (while stealing a couple pillows to put under me lol) to leave her be.

      "description": "Five weeks ago I had a bad fall, and I saw my new doctor four days later. As of today, I can slowly limp 100m before I need to sit, and can probably do 500m on crutches if there's an emergency. My doctor refused twice to give me a temporary disabled parking permit. The second refusal was today, just after he gave me the results of my MRI (prepatellar bursitis). He said that it would be at least a few months before I'm fully recovered, but that he'd rather have a surgeon decide how long would be appropriate for the permit. I even asked him for an extra short (two month) permit just to tide me over, but he refused. The consultation ended and I went straight to the staff, quite emotional. I definitely used the \"malpractice\" word. He came over, his boss came over, he filled out the paperwork (with the assistance of the office staff), and then he stormed off.\n\nI fully believe I'm \\*entitled\\* to a temporary permit, given my condition, the short-term prognosis, and the requirements for the permit. If I put too much weight on my leg, I'll collapse like a sack of warm truffles, and extended periods of standing/walking cause a sharp, grinding pain. I suspect he simply didn't want the hassle of filling out paperwork (he asked the staff what to write, line by line - English isn't his first language and the form was unfamiliar to him). It's not like I was asking for opiates - I'm not a bad patient - all I wanted was some relief from the pain of walking through parking lots for a short while. However, I worry that I've messed up my relationship with my new doctor. Going to the clinic staff when I didn't get what I wanted wasn't nice. Saying the m-word may have been a mistake. On the other hand, my chart does say \"bipolar\". Sigh.",

      "description": "For some context, I’d been texting with this guy for a long time and we’d been really flirty back and forth. He invited me over to finally get together, and I accepted. I’d had a huge crush on him in high school (all of ten years ago), so I was really excited to get to see him and possibly reconnect. He was the one who invited me over, and had expressed how excited he was to see me again. \n\nSo for our first get together, I went to his apartment, and right away I could tell he smoked. His clothes reeked of weed, and his eyes were bloodshot/he kept having to blink. And I mean way more than someone without severe allergies would. On top of this, he was squinting at me the whole time we talked despite it being 7 or 8 at night, and lost track of conversation topics in the middle of talking. It made the conversation fall short and there was a lot of awkward silence, followed by him asking what I’d just said when I hadn’t said anything.\n\nI finally confronted him and asked him if he was high, to which he responded “how can you tell?” I told him all of the above, and he only denied the smell, stating he was on edibles and there shouldn’t be a smell. As a major note here, marijuana isn’t legal in my state. I wasn’t sure how to proceed without coming off like a huge ass, so I had a friend call me and claim an emergency so I could bail. \n\nI don’t want to make some big thing over weed itself. Most of the time, it really doesn’t bother me if people smoke in private and don’t get in trouble for it. This time it just got to me, if only because this was something we’d planned for a while now. Plus, if this was how he wanted to act after not seeing each other for ten years on day one, I didn’t want to see more. \n\nSo AITA for bailing on a shitty excuse and cutting contact?",

      "description": "This happened a bit ago, and I've always been curious  So, I matched a guy on a dating website. We planned to meet on a Saturday morning, before work. He told me he would text me at 10am, to let me know where we would go. I had work at 3pm. \n\nI got up, got ready, and waited. Nothing. I text him. He tells me he's sorry, something came up, can we do tomorrow. Fine. It happens. Except now I'm up, showered, dressed, made-up for no reason, and nothing to do till 3pm.\n\nSo, Sunday rolls around, and this time, I get up at the agreed upon time, but this time, waiting for the call. After an hour, screw it, I go back to sleep. \n\nDon't hear from him all day. Monday afternoon, he texts me asking about next Saturday. I say, something along the lines of, how he was rude, didn't call, didn't text, nothing. Just ghosted. That was rude. He tells me, and I'll never forget, \"Texting works both ways.\"\n\nMy response? \"It's not my job to chase you down for a date you asked me on.\"\n\nHe called me a real bitch. Told me I was entitled, that's not how it works. That he really dodged a bullet with me. Good luck with my impossible standards. \n\nIt was my first (or supposed to be), actual date online. It really shook me. And, I just wonder, *am* I wrong? I'm NTA here, right? I've mulled it over so much. I just need to know an objective opinion.",

      "description": "We'll set the scene here. Last night at around 6:00 PM, my girlfriend gets a text from her sister asking if she can babysit her niece. Immediately my girlfriend agrees (we had just babysat her probably 4-5 days ago as well, which I didn't really mind). She's asking if my girlfriend can babysit from 7 to 7 (12 hours total for those who don't want to do the math), and my girlfriend tells me (not asks me, TELLS ME) that I'm coming along too. Her sister has no food in the house, and will likely not be paying my girlfriend for this, which we don't normally care about because she's family. I have slept about 4 hours due to issues with my insomnia (which she is aware of). She is currently at her sister's house, pissed off that I don't want to come. I get that she doesn't want to be alone all day babysitting her niece, but I wasn't the one who was asked, and she just assumed I would do it. She's calling me and sending me angry texts because I won't come over right this second to help her. AITA?",

      "description": "(sorry in advance, my native language is not English and I'm on mobile)\n\nThis is a story about my ex and I in the summer, and I have had multiple fights about this with her and after ending it a week ago, I now wonder if I was the asshole.\n\nSo, my (now ex) girlfriend and I had a wonderful relationship with each other, until the summer of 2018. We are both teens and live in Europe, so we had about six weeks of summer vacation before we had to go to school again. Both of our parents had plans to go on vacation, but she was going to be going to Ecuador for three of the six weeks of vacation, and beforehand I went to Austria, which lead to about a month of not seeing each other and a big time difference of about 6 hours without a lot of places with wifi.\n\nWhen I came back from my vacation in Austria, she had just left and we couldn't really speak due to her being on flights and time difference. This meant for me that I didn't really have anyone to talk to, because most of my friends didn't really like meeting up or were on vacation theirselves. There was one (female) friend, however, that was home. I didn't really know her that well, having only really having a friendship for a few months, but she had a friend from America staying over for a few weeks. First I didn't really do anything with them, but at some point my friend had to go to work and I suggested I could take the American of a little tour of my city centre. I did this, with my girlfriend knowing it and she didn't mind at all, no this is just the beginning.\n\nAfter a few days of me meeting up with my friend and the American, my ex started to complain. We didn't speak that much and she felt lonely, and I now also think that she was jealous of me being able to meet up with friends and she wasn't. So, after that I started to be a bit more careful about telling her about my time with the two, because I noticed it kinda hurt her, and we fighted a bit over nothing at all. She also made a few rules for me, for instance I wasn't allowed to enter my friend's house and I was not allowed to ever meet up with only my friend.\n\nSkip forward a few weeks, my ex is on her way of coming back and the American left to go back to America. This meant I automatically wasn't allowed by my girlfriend to meet up with my friend anymore, because she didn't want me to do anything with my friend like I said before. \n\nMy friend was feeling very lonely and very sad, she basically really needed me. So I decided to tell my ex that I was going to my friend's house to say a final goodbye, because I wasn't allowed to meet up with her. I instead went into the city together with her, to buy gifts for my ex and then we went into a park and sat on a bench with a meter between us eating cheap donuts and a drink. It was pretty enjoyable tbh.\n\nLike I said before, my ex and I couldn't really talk to each other due to time difference and the lack of wifi, but a lot of the talking consisted of fighting. I was obviously pretty sad about this and with my ex being so far away from me, I was already considering breaking up with her when she came back, and so I send my friend the message: \"Sometimes, I would like even you to be  my girlfriend instead of her\" to show my feelings. It was a joke in a sense, something like: \"haha nobody will like you\" but my friend was used to these kinds of jokes from me. I never considered this as a good thing to do, but it was a in the moment message. I didn't like my friend in a relationship way, so I never considered actually having a relationship with her.\n\nMy ex came back, and we met up, and it was very good. I really liked that, but she slept over at my place at some point and when I went to my bathroom to put in my lenses and making breakfast for her, she unlocked my phone and started to read my conversations with my friend. Mostly it was full of jokes, but at some point she found the message I talked about earlier. I then admitted every lie I told her. \n\nMy ex forced me to block my friend on everything, I wasn't allowed to say anything to her anymore, no possible contact. She told me I cheated on her, while I never kissed her or anything. This obviously made my friend very sad and it made me sad too, I was just forced to block her and say nothing. I tried talking to my friend multiple times but my ex stopped every attempt.\n\nAbout 4 months passed and I broke up with her. I now am talking to my friend again and she is doing pretty good, which I am extremely happy of. My ex made me feel like the asshole, and that she wasn't jealous at all. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here?\n ",

A lot of the times I don't have extra funds to go out with them because I have bills to pay. Rent, Phone, Car, Car ins, Credit card, groceries, etc. and my job isn't very lucrative. Well Steven on the other hand is currently in school and is in the position where he doesn't have to pay bills.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlmost every weekend Steven will message the group chat to go out and more often than not I'll say \"sorry guys budgets tight this week\" and steven hits me with the \"I gotchu\" and every time he says that I am extremely hesitant. For whatever reason when people spot me or give me money I get extremely uncomfortable but every time he always convinces me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course I am very courteous and grateful that he does this. I always order a dish that costs less than his meal, I only order 1 drink, and I always try to be the one that tips the waiter so I feel like I'm contributing somewhat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell recently he made a snarky comment that put me on my heels, he said in the group chat \"Am I gonna have to pay for StromboliMans night out.... Again?\" I'm sure he was joking because that's just our group, we give each other shit for shits and giggles but for some reason that really irked me. Like it felt as if it was super passive aggressive and it just made me feel like a mooch/asshole. This was one of the nights where I had some extra funds and wanted to buy a round of beer and shots for my homies but that comment made me feel miserable so I flaked last minute, so I just need to know...

      "description": "Good day, I'm new here so I hope I get this right.\nSo, I'm a very awkward girl with people I don't know, I don't have a lot of friends mostly because I always make a barrier towards new people. I tend to overthink a lot and I overthink my actions before I do them because I don't want to seem rude with people I don't know.\n\nSo I've been in a long distance relationship for almost 7 years, and the more we talk about our every day, the problems kinda begin to bubble up.\n\nIt all started almost 1 year ago, I had classes that ended at 9 pm and since I don't drive, I had to wait for my brother to come pick me up, while I was waiting for him, a guy approached me to make some small talk since we were both waiting and I decided to respond because I also thought that that might be the last time I'd see him, I was still carefully answering some of the personal questions he asked until my brother finally came for me. He didn't strike me as a weirdo at first, just some bored guy trying to talk to make the wait less annoying.\nSo, the next night, he's back and tries to make small talk again, I'm awkwardly trying to answer while listening some music, I was reading a conversation I had with a classmate and this guy started saying things like \"Oh, you're talking to your boyfriend?\" and \"you're probably asking for help\" stuff like that, I tried to brush it off like \"hahah, okay..?\", my brother finally shows up and I thanked the heavens.\nThe next few days some classes ended way earlier because it was the beginning of the semester and since I was there for only half an hour I didn't want to annoy my mom (she drove me to school and then she went to visit my aunt who lives a few blocks away from the school) so I decided to just wait for an hour more, took out my laptop and tried to make homework but ended up watching videos, BIG MISTAKE, I should have gone somewhere else because there he suddenly appears and had a look that he wanted to stay forever there making crappy small talk about videogames (I have a The legend of Zelda backpack), at this point, I'm starting to get more annoyed but still wanting to be polite, until he begins to make weird \"jokes\" saying \"You have some nice shoes, what would you do if I took them off and start running away with them? would you run after me?\" and started to say the same about my backpack. I was really uncomfortable and trying to smile at his \"jokes\" while saying \"I'd run towards the security guard and make you get expelled\" but since I'm an awkward dork I couldn't get it as aggressive as I wanted and he took it as nothing, he also tried to tip off my laptop from my legs and insinuated I add him on facebook. I was at the point of getting annoyed and scared when my mom shows up out of nowhere and I ran away as fast as I could.\n\n\nOf course, I had to tell everything to my mom and my SO, my  SO felt really bad because he couldn't be here to protect me but this experience lately turned into a \"you have to start to be assertive and push them off the instant some weird person starts to be disgusting with you and stop trying to 'laugh' or lead on their 'jokes'\". I understand what my SO says, I know what to do but not how to execute it since I overthink my actions. This has gotten to the point where my SO says I don't respect him for not being able to put my foot down with the weird guys.\n\n\nAm I the asshole? How can I change this part of myself?\nThank you guys for your time and attention.\n\n\nTL;DR: I'm awkward, I got stalked(?) at school and now this is a problem in my relationship because my SO thinks I don't respect him or our relationship because I don't defend myself.\n",

      "description": "I'm 21 and in college, my brother is 26, and has recently become a police officer. I'm pretty left and he's fairly right and we both sort of have always had an unspoken pact not to discuss these things around each other because both of us have strong disagreements. I've heard him some stuff I'd strongly disagree with over earshot, but nothing that a super large chunk of the country doesn't also believe in.\n\nMy older brother and I used to be very close and we have drifted a bit, mainly due to the way we view each other as people. I came out as gay a little way ago and am sort of naturally very soft-spoken and effeminate and he's a \"macho guy\" stereotype in a lot of ways, not to oversimplify. There are a lot of \"small\" issues I've had with him on my frequent weeklyish home visits. We get along better on the phone where we talk once or twice a week, basically entirely about baseball, our only real shared interested.\n\nOtherwise, he says shit I find gross, he can be condescending/paternalistic, he has pulled me over three separate times as a \"joke\" as I was driving back home, scaring the shit out of me each time.\n\nIn truth though none of these are the \"real\" reason. Last time I was home we were playing a family game of rummikub and basically he told a story about how he pulled a guy over with his wife and one year old child in the backseat, basically scared him into agreeing to let him search the car, and then arresting him for an absurdly low amount of MJ. (like, a joint's worth, if I understood correctly). He went into great detail about how the guy and his wife were both sobbing while it happened and trying to tell him how it was medicinal and he (my brother) said the whole thing with this great smile on his face. \n\nI don't want to sound dramatic but it was so fucking crazy. I kept thinking that it sounded more like a fisherman talking about catching a fish than a human being. He laughed and threw in jokes about and mentioned that the people were visibly poor (shitty car), and he still did it and didn't sound remorseful. It wasn't like \"oh, i don't agree with it but it's the law, sorry\", it was \"lol then I took them to jail, I managed to trick him into agreeing to the search, I win the game! fifty points!\".\n\nI have never smoked but I have a good friend I met in college who has a chronic physical condition and who smokes regularly and says that it has basically allowed him to live. I kept thinking \"man, you'd do that to my friend, you'd do that to anyone\". Like he's fine with totally ruining lives over nothing.\n\nI haven't spoken to him in two weeks without an explanation beyond \"I don't want to talk rn\". I feel completely disconnected from him as a person and I honestly don't see how I could reasonably separate what he proudly does for a living while giggling and him as \"my brother\". It's so shitty and blatantly evil. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Prefacing the actual story, I suffer from ADHD and sensory processing dysfunction. Whenever sensory overload occurs I tend to react extremely irrational. I also want to state that I made my friend aware of that shortly after we met a year ago or so. Still, my condition does not stop me from attempting to get into situations where sensory overstimulation may occur (such as a party/club), after all, I cant just crawl into my shell all day long everyday.\n\nYesterday, I was in such a situation. My friend and I decided to have a night out at a local club to celebrate her newfound job (shes been jobless for a few months) and just to have a good time in general. Things started out well. Shots were poured, laughs were had and stories were shared.\n\nAfter about 2-3 hours of fun, she suddenly decided to get a cig. Unfortunately, she didnt bring any herself. Instead, she decided to simply go into the smokers area and ask around if anyone was willing to share. She asked me if I would join her, but as an non-smoker I decided against it.\n\nSo she left me to my devices and went for a cig. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, 20 minutes. Slowly, the effects of my last shot were fading away and I started to realize how full the club had become. Music started to appear louder to me, people kept shoving past me and I just felt left alone and sensory overload started to creep in. I felt anxiety and nervousness take hold of me. \n\nI started contemplating trying to find her and tell her but I decided to suck it up and stay put. Dont ask why, but for some reason I didnt want to disturb her smoking session.\n\nJust as about 25 minutes had passed, she suddenly returned. With a guy in tow. She offered him drinks and asked him to join us. I politely shook his hand, but my brain somehow percieved him as just another load onto my already overloaded brain. I also didnt want to put up with being third wheeled that night either.\n\nSo thats when I snapped. My brain was in full fight or flight mode. When she turned to the bar to order new shots, I simply grabbed my coat and walked out. I eventually reached a bus station and got a ticket home. Only when my anger and panic started to fade the realisation crept in that I am probably a massive asshole and moron for leaving her alone in a club at 2 AM. I quickly messaged her, apologizing profusely but trying to explain I acted purely on instinct. She was pretty drunk so she was just confused.\n\nHowever, as I woke up this morning I tried to call her to talk it out and she just snapped at me for not telling her that I felt unwell and accusing me of not trusting that she would understand. Instead I left her alone in town in her, lets just say, \"attractive\" outfit with no way home. Which is totally fair, thats exactly what I did. I just hadnt thought about any of it while in full flight mode.\n\nShe rightfully lost all trust in me while I have to come to face with the realisation that I didnt trust her either, since I didnt expect her to understand that I was feeling unwell (hence why I didnt tell her). But am I really the asshole in this situation, or should she have been more considerate?\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nTL;DR: Had a sensory overload-induced panic attack in a club, got third wheeled, both of which caused me to get up and leave my friend behind without a word. She is now mad at me for not telling her that I needed to leave. Am I truly an asshole?",

      "description": "Hello Reddit! I'm new to making posts and English is not my first language, so I'd like to apologize beforehand if I make mistakes or things are hard to follow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm a 20 year old female and I'm a full time student  so I don't have much money, but I'm fortunate enough to live in my own apartment. We have been in a long-distance relationship for about 7 months give or take. There's 6000 miles between us so the distance is pretty rough for a student. Because of this my boyfriend is the one who visited me and is currently living with me.\n\n  \nHere is little background.  I'm from a small and relatively poor country and I'm used to helping around the house because I was raised by a single parent who had to work full time to support me and my siblings. Even though my childhood wasn't the easiest, since I didn't have an adult around due to my mom being at work all the time, I'm still grateful that I learned how to take care of myself from a young age. But my boyfriend on the other hand is from a rich family and hasn't really had to worry about anything in his life. His parents pay for his bills, education, insurance, etc. Before coming to live with me he used to still live under his parents roof although he is already 23 years old. That's all fine with me I'm happy that he had an easier time in that regards than me, but what irritates me is that he can't do any basic household chores and expects me to do everything because I do them better. \"Well I don't know if I should cook because it's never going to be as good as your cooking\", \"oh I don't know, you should probably clean because I can't read the labels and you do it more thorough\". \n\n  \nHe also has lied to me about things that weren't a dealbreaker to me but still really shitty thing to do especially for someone who says that they hate lies more than everything and could never be with a liar. He lied about his age and liking cleaning and cooking. But that's not where it ends. He visited me first once before he came here to live. Between those we broke up for a brief period of time because he wouldn't take a no as an answer so things happened that ended up violating me. Due to that I ended our relationship after he went back to home. He didn't take it well and started guilt tripping me and insulting me like crazy because he knows that I have hard time to standing up for myself. But this time I didn't give up and said that the relationship was over. I ended up having to block him because he would not leave me alone even though I asked many times, so I had no other choice. He still made a new account on a messaging app and started bombarding me with messages telling me that that his parents are kicking out, because they got tired of him not doing anything (he wasn't working/studying at the time he'd just sit in his room all day playing games and  watching anime, so he was a NEET pretty much) and now he needed to find his own place within a week. And he told me this a day after the break up. I still stood my ground and said that the break up is final. I still kept talking to him to make sure he is fine, but TWO days later he already made up with his parents and wasn't going to get kicked out anymore. They even promised to pay for his tuition, although just TWO days ago they were ready to cut all ties with him and absolutely would not pay for his school or even help him find a job. At this point I was getting suspicious of everything he has told me about his parents (who I haven't ever met or even talked to) is true. He would always tell me how his parents are horrible people, but nothing he ever told really made any sense considering he talks to them daily and they are really generous are to him. \n\n  \nI didn't want to take him back but he insisted that he wants to come back just to talk things through and since he is going back to school he won't be staying. I didn't really agree to it but he still came and I end up taking him back. Whenever I would ask when he is going back he wouldn't give me a straight answer, but one day he told me that he is doing online classes so he wants to stay here with me I was so mad. Never did he ever say that he was even planning to stay here. He even said many times before coming that he is for sure going back due to school. I was livid but still just accepted it knowing he can't stay here for long because he only had a travel visa so he could stay for 3 months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe had bought me a ring and propose to me. Initially I said yes because despite all I do love him and things were going great for us. He made promises that he is going to help me more and make my life easier. I thought he was still settling in but nothing changed. He still keeps being childish, picky and doesn't want to help me unless I snap. And he keeps complaining almost daily that it's too dusty because of my cat, although I vacuum almost daily at least every two days. And he keeps telling me that I should have a pet with no fur instead. He keeps pushing my cat away and won't let him sleep on the bed. I would be fine with not letting my cat sleep on the bed, but he is a senior cat that I've had over 10 years and always has slept next to me. I feel especially hurt when he does that because my cat is my baby and I love him more than anything.\n\n  \nI let him meet my family, but my mom doesn't speak English, only my siblings do. Even with having a language barrier my mom didn't really like him although I tried to make him seem really nice and loving. He acted childish and picky around her and even threw a fit at a grocery store when my mom was offering to buy us fish. He said that he will absolutely not eat anything with the skin still on. I just brushed it off and told him that I will eat it then and he can figure out something for himself. This was not the first time he acted childish and picky in public embarrassing me. He has way too expensive taste that I can't afford and I'm saying I can't afford it because he doesn't help paying for anything except food every once in a while. I pay for the rent, electricity, water, internet and food. I have my own bills to pay and I need to get books for school almost every month and he doesn't even help me pay for birth control. I'm getting really tired of taking care of him and I want to focus on school and myself instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still love him and I enjoy spending time with him. He has made me laugh more than anyone else and I never get bored when we're doing something, but I don't know if I still should stay with him. By no means am I perfect either I have hard time being open with people so I can't communicate until I've had enough and I have bad anxiety and depression so I might see things differently than he does. I've still tried to tell him how I feel but there hasn't been any changes. So am I the asshole for wanting to break up and take time for myself?",

      "description": "This happened about an hour ago, and he’s still crawling around the grass trying to find them. The backstory...\n\nTypical Wednesday night at college - we’re out drinking and having fun when our crew of friends decide to move on to a different house party. We’re about to walk there when my incredibly intoxicated buddy, let’s call him Steve, demands that he drive instead. We all try to get his keys peacefully, but when he decides someone will have to “fight” him to get said keys, my other friends just say screw this, it’s your funeral, and walk off to the other house. I used to wrestle in high school, so I did a quick double leg takedown while Steve wasn’t paying attention, and grabbed the keys. \n\nSteve decides to take a couple drunken swings at me, but he’s off his rocker and just flails around a bit before realizing he’s not going to connect, and starts begging me for the keys back. The house we were partying at backs up to a town multi-use field, so I did my best “fake throw” possible (hell, it works on my dog), and he goes bounding into the field like a goddamn golden retriever in a frantic search.  \n\nI’m looking at him right now, desperately searching blade by blade - I think he’s crying - but he just screams “FUCK OFF! FUCK OFF!” whenever I get near him.  A few minutes ago a couple of the same friends we were with earlier passed by us on their way home, and told me I was a total asshole for taking his keys, it’s not my business and I should just give them back to him right away.\n\nThe thing is, I’m pretty sure he’ll just jump in his car and speed away, drunk as all hell. So, I’m the asshole here?\n",

      "description": "AITA if I was being heckled by a so-called \"nice old guy\" at a trivia night?  \n\n\nI was participating in a trivia night. You answered questions then handed your answer sheet to another team to mark. There were 5 rounds, with a 15 minute break between round 3 and 4 (so they did rounds 1-3, marked them, then break, then rounds 4-5, then the final marks). We had completed all rounds, and the other team was marking our card. A question came up in which there was some debate. I grabbed my phone to look it up, seeing as I had no way of changing the outcome of the game, nor could I change any of my answers since the other team had my card. While I'm holding up my phone to say the question was inaccurate, some older guy across the way starts yelling at me claiming I am cheating. I asked him how am I cheating, but he didn't answer, and continued to shout that I was cheating. When I asked if he was playing (he was not), he said yes and that I should be disqualified. So I told him to go f himself when he wouldn't leave me alone. I then ignored him. But one of the waitresses came over and gave us a warning about swearing in the restaurant, and though I said he was being rude and obnoxious, she just said she gave him a warning too and that we had to get one too. \n\nWhen I went over and apologized afterward, she claimed he was a nice guy who owns a salon (like that was supposed to make me believe he couldn't possibly be a jerK) and that when he drinks, he gets \"opinionated\". This actually really made me angry, since he was the one to start harassing me for something he wasn't even a part of, yet I'm treated like I'm the problem because I used swear words. All I got from the woman at the bar is that he's a nice guy so I shouldn't have reacted that way, and \"sometimes our frustrations rise come out in other ways\". I just said sure, and walked away, regretting my apology, since it was obvious, because he was a regular, that he was getting the benefit of the doubt. It sounds to me like he's an asshole to people when he drinks, but that's excused because he is a \"nice guy and owns his own business\". I wanted to tell her to go f herself too.",

Emma is actually very popular at school, but has stated to me before how she dislikes the way she treats the other students.\n\nThat day, Ms. Johnson was handing back tests, calling people up one by one. She called 3 popular students in a normal, nice way, then a Chinese student. Ms. Johnson said, \"Hurry, hurry, hurry. Why are you all being so slow?\" to this girl, who was coming from the back of the room. Then she called another Asian student, rolled her eyes, and this time said, \"Geez... being slow AF again...\" (not \"as fuck\" but literally spelled out the words A F.) \"Hurry, hurry, runnnnn.\" At that point, my daughter, who sits in the front of the room said to her, \"Why don't you try running back there?\" At this point, Johnson got flustered and angry and said, \"that's rude\" and Emma asked, \"Why? Why are you making people run if you don't do it yourself?\"\n\nAt the time of her telling of the story, I didn't know what Johnson looked like. When I got to the school, I saw that this teacher was a big lady, so I immediately understood that she probably took it as a jab at her weight. The school is retelling me the same story, but this time, Johnson turns it to say \"Emma said I needed to go running sometime. Hey, I don't get offended easily, I'm a big girl but-\" and that's when I kind of snort-laughed completely by accident. I apologized and said that Emma shouldn't have interrupted or made unnecessary comments. Ms. Johnson seems completely displeased by this and rolled her eyes at me very obviously. \n\nLater in the car, I asked Emma if she was intentionally making a fat joke and she said no, she was just annoyed with her attitude towards the 2 other girls and it had nothing to do with weight. She also said she never said \"you should go running sometimes\" and that was a complete lie. \n\nWas I an asshole for laughing? I felt kind of bad, but her whole attitude towards me kind of revealed the big picture to me... this was not a fair and kind person. AITA anyway?",

      "description": "Firstly, some background information: \n\nMy husband [27m] and I [26f] have two kids- an eight week old and a five year old. \n\nSince I am on maternity leave for a year(thank you, government of Canada !)I am the primary caregiver and homemaker in our household. Most of the time I take care of all the baby and child tending and all of the chores, and my husband takes care of whatever he can when he’s home. We’re both adults and we both contribute to this household in different ways, so the expectation is that if he’s not working he needs to be helpful. However I don’t think he’s ever been alone with both kids, and he’s definitely never been in charge of the baby for more than an hour while I grocery shopped, slept, or showered.\n\nDuring the winter, my husband does snow removal. This means he can get called into work on an hours notice and be stuck working for up to 20 hours at a time. It also means he can go four or five days without working. The sporadic and long hours can be really hard on a persons mind and body, I’ve been sensitive to this recognizing how much it can really burn him out. When he needs rest, I leave him alone. Even though I generally get 4-5 hours of sleep a night myself. (Yeah, I might be a little bitter about that). \n\nOn Monday night he got called out to work at midnight (after being awake all day) and worked until around 7:30am Tuesday morning.After that he slept from from the time he got home until 8:30 this morning with a couple of hours here and there of being awake. So he slept for like 20 hours if you take out the random stretches of being awake. He didn’t do anything to help with the kids or the house in the time he was up. I let it go, I let him sleep. \n\nSo when he woke up this morning having been called into work, I asked for just a few minutes of help. The 5 year olds school is closed due to the weather and I’ll be stuck at home in a storm with two kids who need a lot of attention. I just asked him to switch the laundry into the dryer for me, but he said he was in a big rush and didn’t have time. Fine.\n\nI made a pot of coffee for him to take to work with him so that he wasn’t spending extra money on takeout. On his way out the door I reminded him that I made him coffee and not to buy any, and he said a co worker who carpools with him was going to buy him a coffee so he didn’t need it. Suddenly he had time to stop for coffee, but not to quickly switch the laundry on his way out. And that left the coffee I made go to waste. This pissed me off too, but again I let it go. I didn’t want to have a fight first thing in the morning.\n\nSo here’s the part where I need judgement:\n\nHe called me about 10 minutes after he left the house because he was at a gas station and stuck there because he didn’t have the keys to re start his car. He has a button starter and left the keys in the wrong jacket when he started the car to warm it up; he drove away with out his keys. He just wanted me to bring him his keys a few blocks away. \n\nAnd I lost it. Rescuing him would’ve meant I had to pack up both kids in the middle of an ice storm and drive out to him in dangerous road conditions. I said “figure it out”, hung up the phone and haven’t answered his calls or texts. He’s mad cause he now has to walk home to get his keys and is going to be late for work and thinks I’m not very nice for not helping him. He said if it were me he helped me, and I laughed. He doesn’t help me when I ask for little things, but seems so confident he’d help me here if the roles were reversed. \n\nSo, AITA? ",

      "description": "Okay, so this has been weighing on my conscience. I guess I’ll start with some background. \n\nIt is my senior year of college and I am getting ready to graduate in the spring. Although exciting, it is also very stressful and chaotic. I have also recently had some serious family issues that have affected my mental wellbeing. Anyways, about 2 months ago I matched with a girl on tinder. I had been following her on instagram for years, and we even met in high school (there was a mutual attraction then, but we never acted on it). Our relationship started out awesome. We connected really well, had great conversations and after about the third date had sex. We ended up going to events around the city, going to dinners and spending nights with each other. \n\nA couple weeks ago, I told her that I wanted to start thinking about a relationship. She told me that since she had just gotten out of a relationship a few months prior, she wasn’t ready to put a label on ours. I agreed and told her that there was certainly no rush, I just liked spending time with her and talking to her, and she agreed. She did however make it **clear** to me that she wasn’t seeing anybody else, or talking to anybody else. \n\nLast night I invited her to a party at my buddies house and she agreed. The plan was to drink, go to my friends, party, and crash at my place. \n\nWe went to the party and it was pretty fun. She seemed to enjoy herself, and I was having a good time too. At one point in the party, I decided that I wanted to go sit next to her and talk on the couch. She was snapchatting throughout the entire night and when I sat next to her I noticed that at the top of her best friends list was a 12 day snap streak with another guy. She saw me look and she immediately knew what I was thinking, and she began to look flustered. We went back to my house.\n\nWe went to my room, and I sat down next to her. I wasn’t angry, and I didn’t yell or call her any names. I asked why she lied to me, and what her relationship with this guy was. She told me that they had been talking before we met, and that I meant more to her, and even admitted that she screwed up. The more I heard her talk, the more uneasy I felt. After talking a little bit more, I told her that I couldn’t spend the night with her because I felt betrayed. Had she told me that she wanted an open relationship or to be fuck buddies before, I would have reacted differently. But that lie made me feel very suspicious and was a huge red flag for me. With the stress of school and family problems, I felt crushed. I couldn’t bare to stay with her. I told her that she could sleep in my room since she had been drinking (her car was at my place and I didn’t want her to drive). I said she could have anything to eat from the fridge if need be. I met up with my buddy who was at the party and took an uber to his house.\n\nAITA for leaving her alone at my house? And am I being unreasonable caring about the other guy? Should I still try to talk to her? \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 9 month. About 1 month ago her ex boyfriend died of a drug over dose. I never met the guy and I only know about him from what my girlfriend said about him. Basically they had been friends for years (since their freshman year in college) because they were in the same small program and dated for about 2 years before they broke u. They had been broken up for 2 months when we started dating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently he had issues with drugs for a long time but she thought he was clean when they started dating but then he started them again during their relationship. Initially she tried to be supportive and help him through the addiction and help him get sober but it was too much strain on the relationship and he started becoming emotionally abusive so they eventually broke up. She kind of a goody two shoes type girl who is super studious, who doesn't even party much and it kinda seems this guy was her \"bad boy phase.\" Again I've never met the guy, this was just the impression I got from him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway he sadly died 1 month ago from an accidental overdose and my girlfriend was devastated. His parent invited her to the funeral which I thought was a bit odd but I was supportive of her going. It seems she blames herself partly for his death. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoweverI am getting annoyed at some of the things she keeps doing she has posted 5 pictures of him on her instagram since his death. I get she was mourning but I don't think all mourning has to be pubic on social media and that was even more pictures that we have together on her social media. I think it unnecessary and disrespectful to me. I told her this bothers me and she kind of brushed it off and acted like I was over reacting but said she would stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen yesterday i found out she got a tattoo of a guitar with his initials on it. The tattoo i about 4 inches long.   Her ex was an avid guitar player. Obviously I was really mad. She didn't even consult me or check with me if it was okay and just got a permanent reminder of her ex on her body. This obviously wasn't a spur of the moment decision either.She only has one other tattoo which honours her late grandmother and her own parents hate tattoos and were mad she got that one. I confronted her and told her she obviously has no respect four relationship about it and she said it's her body and she didn't think she needed to consult me and I was acting like a controlling asshole and acting jealous of someone who was dead.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here?

      "description": "First time posting long time reader.\n\nOkay so it's a bit long set up but I think some details will help with understanding where I'm coming from.\n\nSo last night I reached out to my friend of over 20 years and ask him how's he's doing ( we're both working and he just had a baby so we hardly ever talk). I have been trying to set up a day for us to catch up and so I can meet his son. He responds and ask what I was doing I reply \"working\" but I follow it up with a conversation asking about he and his son are doing. I get no response. This is odd behavior and think something must be up ( he's usually quick to reply). As soon as I get home I reach out to him to make sure he's okay and he replies  pick me up. I call him and he's drunk and tells me to pick him up because he's been kicked out of his home and he need someone to TALK TO. So I drive to his place and he gets in the car with a tall beer can. After a small conversation about how's it's been so long he says we should head to insert name of bar. I tell him I'd rather not as I don't drink alcohol like ever and I'm keeping myself on a budget, what with bills to pay. He tells me not to worry, he says \"don't worry about anything I got you, I'll pay for everything\" \n\nWe have a little back and forth, I try telling him that I don't have any money to spare right now and that it's probably best if we head to my place and watch some movies and talk. He reasurres me me that he's \"got me\". We get to the address he gave me and it's a topless bar. I have never been to a strip club and honestly it wasn't what I'd hope to be doing on a Tuesday night, I again raise my concern about him spending money here and I again tell him I don't have money. He says I got you. \n\nWe get to the door and the bouncer verifies I.D and ask for the $20 cover fee, my friend gives him money and he looks to me to also collect, I look to my friend and he's occupied getting frisked, I don't like awkward situations so I pay the fee to get in. When we get inside we get close to the bar and insist I drink and not to worry about anything, I tell him and I don't drink and he orders himself two Coronas. While we're inside we try and and have a conversation or at least I am but he keeps on side tracking the conversation and keeps telling me that he's going to to get me a lap dance. \n\nSo we're there for 20 mins and the performers are working so they come up to us and keep trying to get us to buy a lap dance. I keep saying I'm okay. This one beautiful chick walks up to us and starts dancing on us and she says that it looks like I need some company I politely say I'm okay but my friend starts having this conversation with here so I start scrolling through Reddit and next thing I know this chick grabs my hand and she's leading me a to a booth, he's smiling and giving me the thumbs up. So I go and she does here thing. Were three songs into this and I realized that I don't think he's paid for this so I say I'm good and she tells me it's 60 bucks. Again I don't want to make a scene so I got to the ATM and pay here. \n\nWhen I get back to my friend hes smiling. I ask him if he had already paid the chick and he says naw you got this. I'm livid but I don't say anything. He kept trying to get girls to dance with me but I kept insisting we leave because it was late. We didn't leave until 2 am and he only left begrudgingly and on the car ride home he kept saying we should have stayed longer. I dropped him off at home safe and sound I won't ask for the money because it's pointless. So my question is am I the asshole for getting upset for paying for the lap dances even though he said he was going to cover everything.\n\nTLDR drunk friend ask me to take him to a bar that turned out to be a strip club and even though he said he would cover all the expenses he didn't.",

      "description": "A few weeks ago, my ex (23m) and I (22m) started to talk again, and since we’ve done very “daty” things like flirt, I went to his family’s thanksgiving, we FaceTime daily for up to 2-3 hours, etc. \n\nWe made plans to go to a concert together for New Years and then share a bed. Last night, he confided in me how he’s had feelings for a guy who broke things off with him because me ex didn’t want a relationship. \n\nTo say the news stung would be an understatement. My friends are all saying that he’s an asshole for leading me on, but let me say I don’t believe that. I’m not mad at him or fault him for it. I’ve probably done the same thing; if anything, it’s just a miscommunication of desires between us. \n\nBUT, I told him that I didn’t think it’d be good for us to be friends (or go to the concert together) because I didn’t think I had it in me to not have feelings for him. I’m in my last year of college and the last thing I need is to put myself in a position to be hurt. \n\nHe turned it around on me saying things like “this is why I can’t have guy friends. Someone gets feelings.” And “why can’t you be friends with me without expecting more?” \n\nAITA for not wanting to be friends?  \n\n",

      "description": "My wife and I are in an open relationship, and for the most part it's great. She feels safer and able to be more open with me, and that's not something she's had in the past.  \n\n\nThe thing is, while she's an open and adventurous person she isn't really willing to be open and adventurous with me. We talked for a while about \"christening\" our car, but when we actually had an opportunity to she was always afraid of getting caught. The closest we ever got was off to the side of a lonely road at 4am, but even then she didn't want to go all the way. Flash forward a couple months, I find out that she fucked a friend of hers on the way back from the airport in the middle of the day along side a MUCH busier road. We'll go to parties, everyone will get drunk or high and she'll get really grabby with whomever she wants that night but just kinda leaves me to my own devices. She'll try to hide some of her wild nature from me, and I'll find out later that while she won't even have regular sex in the same room as the window of our 3rd floor apartment, she got completely naked and fucked a FWB next to the open window of his 1st floor apartment. She's had sex just out in the open living room at a party, but barely wants anything to do with me there because of PTA. Whenever I try to talk to her about it, she just gets really sad, says that she wishes I was okay with being her safe space because she's never had one before and then she'll start saying things like \"It's okay, I can be a sex object for you. What would you like to do?\" or \"I thought I was more to you than that.\"  \n\n\nAITA for wanting her to be as wild with me as she is with others?",

I ended up getting everyone really sick to where they all took off for a couple days at a time and the boss had to close the shop down, missed deadlines and probably lost some clients as well.

      "title": "AITA For wanting my sister to return the Christmas present she got me?",
      "description": "To give everything a frame of reference, my sister is 2 years older than me. She is currently 27, and i am currently 25.\n\nGrowing up my whole childhood, my sister and I have never gotten along. We would fight often, mostly because (according to what she's told my parents) she's been jealous of me her whole life. I have never been able to understand why she is so jealous of me. \n\nHere's a little background about my childhood:\n\n* I've had relatively serious medical problems ever since I was young. As a child, my bottom jaw grew in 2x as fast as my top jaw, causing all sorts of dental problems. Because of this, I was teased all throughout elementary and half of middle school, constantly being told i look like a monkey. (For reference, I'm white, so it wasn't a racially charged insult, just kids being assholes) Who was the chief instigator of all of my teasing and insults? My sister. She would constantly call me a monkey, which lead to all the bully kids in school picking it up, and only calling me that.\n*  I've always been smart, to the point where i graduated second in my class in high school and held a 4.0 gpa my first year of college (until i got depressed and became just an average C student). By 2nd grade, when all my classmates were learning to add/subtract, i would be doing my sister's multiplication/division homework at night for fun. This also lead to me being teased, once again led by my sister. She would refer to me as Jimmy Neutron (first name is James) in a condescending manner and any time I would try to talk about anything science related, she would hum the theme song because she knew i disliked the show and it would make me mad. \n* In high school, I got jaw surgery to correct my problems and in turn it made me significantly more attractive (so i've been told, i still don't see myself as attractive). And since then, the comments switched from looking like a monkey, to how its unfair how i got all the good looks in the family. (which i don't understand. i literally had to have surgery to correct a deformity. how is that natural good looks?)\n\nHere's a little background about my sister's childhood:\n\n* Growing up, my sister was allowed to get involved in any and every activity she wanted. She did horseback riding, gymnastics, ice skating, all at a relatively competitive level. My parents went so far as to buy her a horse so that she could practice more constantly. All this time, while i was a young kid, i was dragged to every single event, every single practice, every single meet. Each time, never having anyone but my gameboy/the arcade games at the rinks to play with. Which is a HUGE source of the social anxiety i deal with today. \n* She has struggled her whole life to maintain friendships, constantly flying off the deep end at people for no reason. For this reason, she had a new friend group like every 2 months growing up. \n* Despite my parents doing/giving her everything, my sister still turned out to be a nightmare. At 15, she had her first of several abortions. At 17, she started using hard drugs (coke). At 18, she moved out of my parents house, into quite literally a crack house, just to spite my parents. At 19, she had her first of 2 kids with 2 separate fathers. (and for the record is no longer with either of them)\n* Also at 17, she became such a loose cannon that one night, she became so belligerent and violent and aggressive, that my parents asked me to call 911 while they restrained her so that she could be 302-ed (admitted against your will to a psych ward/rehab facility). Because i was the one who called, while she was being taken from the house, she looked me dead in the eyes and told me that i was a soulless monster and that she would make sure i suffer forever for forcing this on her and then spat on me. She decided in her mind that i was the one who decided to 302 her, not my parents. I understand she was on drugs, and doesn't remember/didn't mean what she said, but that doesn't make it easy to forget...\n* She has 2 kids with 2 separate fathers, and is no longer on speaking terms with either of them. My niece and nephew however, i hold no ill will towards and every chance i get, i go out of my way to spoil them to the extreme.\n* Part of my medical problems allowed me to be approved as a medical marijuana patient at a young age. Because of this, despite my position always being a firm, hard NO, she forever asks me if i'd be willing to buy her weed. She since evolved into asking me for money for diapers/food/etc for her kids, which immediately stopped once i found out she was using the money i was giving her to buy weed.\n\nWhen i turned 18, i decided to shut her out of my life until she could prove that she had changed for the better. About 4 years ago, my mom begged and pleaded with me to reconcile with my sister, swearing up and down that my sister had changed, was on medication for her obvious bipolar issues, and was in a stable relationship. So, against my better judgment, I rekindled my relationship with my sister. Everything was going swimmingly, to the point where, at one point when i lost my job in another state, she let me stay with her for several weeks until i could work up the courage to talk to my parents about it. (my dumbass got fired from my dream job with insane pay and perks for breaching contract cuz i was a dumbass fresh outta college). She even set me up with one of her friend's sisters and we dated for about 2 months. Until...\n\nOut of nowhere, my then-gf called me flipping out, calling me every name under the sun, with her reasoning being that my sister sent her a text conversation that \"happened between me and my sister\" where i allegedly told my sister how i had no interest in my then girlfriend and (this is a direct quote, i can't make it up) that i was \"only using her as a cum dumpster until i could find someone more attractive\". I have never once talked about anyone that way in my life, not even to my male friends in private as a joke. That's just not me. But my sister fabricated the entire conversation and convinced my then-gf that i wrote all that, and nothing i could do/say/show her would convince her otherwise. Now why did my sister do this you ask? Because i didn't put the stick in the backdoor after going outside to smoke and then leaving and going over a friends house, despite the fact that her AND her boyfriend were both home and likely went out shortly after me to smoke as well. Ruined one of the best relationships I've ever been in, all because i didn't put the stick in the door (which by the way, it was extremely common for her to be the last one home, leave the house, and leave the stick out of the door).\n\nSo, after that, I decided enough was enough, and i cut off ties with her completely, with no intention of ever rekindling the relationship, unless i see SERIOUS LONG TERM change. This was fine for the last 3 years, as I lived out of state and was easily able to avoid her/have minimal contact with her at family events. We even made an agreement (mainly because she has no money) not to buy each other Christmas gifts. This arrangement worked out perfectly, until this year, I was diagnosed with an incurable autoimmune disease. It's not serious and won't directly be my downfall, but one of the side effects is that (even with using a c-pap machine) i could stop breathing in the middle of the night and essentially suffocate myself in my sleep. So, because of this, I have a service dog that is trained to try and wake me in the middle of the night if i stop breathing, but he is also trained to enlist someone else's help if he alone can't get me up. Therefore, for my own safety, I can't live alone anymore. This caused me to have to move back in to my parents house until i can get to a stable situation where i can live on my own with a rommate/gf. \n\nMy mom, being the extreme pacifist she's always been, has been constantly pushing on me to rekindle my relationship with my sister, so that we can be one happy family. She even went so far as to give my sister money this year so that she could buy me a present in the hopes of using it as a peace offering. (I know she did this, despite my mom insisting my sister spent her own money on it, because my dad told me this was the case). And now my mom is telling me that i need to buy my sister a gift in order to be polite, since she is getting me one.\n\nAm i an asshole for not wanting the gift from my sister, and at the same time not wanting to buy her any gifts? It feels like a fake/hollow attempt to throw a rug over a hole in the ground and expect like thats gonna somehow fix the problem. For the record, in the last 3 years, i have seen NO improvement whatsoever in my sister. She is still jumping from bed to bed to bed (she has a new boyfriend every single time i see her at family gatherings), makes no effort to consistently stay on her medication, and has just generally done nothing significant to make herself a better person. I don't hate my sister, and at the end of the day I only want her to succeed and turn her life around, but at the moment i just feel empty towards her. ",

      "description": "My GF and I are breaking up.

I don't think it's anything but lust without it, but she's way more wrapped up in the fact that we simply don't ever have legit, and fairly consistent, makeout sessions. Just that in particular though. Nothing to do with sex per-se. Strictly that the regular day to day kisses we have are too brief and should involve tongue and full on making out.\n\nOpen to opinions obviously.

We all live in a small town and I don't want anything to do with that person because ultimately it just turns into drama.\n\nAbout a year ago my brother's girlfriend left him less than a month before they were suppose to get married and claimed he had cheated. My brother told me he didn't, I believed him, found out this last fall he actually did and he just lied to me about it. He was the one who ultimately admitted it to me so I guess there's that....\n\nNow they are back together (have been for about 6 months now) so I have been fairly distant with them. While I don't appreciate him lying to me because we were super close before, I have kind of gotten over it. However, the person he is with I am very certain is lying about certain things and also happens to be friends with my ex (they met because they were dating us brothers). So naturally they talk about everything and it causes drama. I recently started seeing someone else, well guess who found out about it in no time and started asking around and creating drama.\n\nAnyways, my brother and his girlfriend are moving out of town about a half hour away this weekend. I told them I would help them (because that is what family is for). However, I basically plan on cutting them out of my life after the move. \n\nAITA for cutting them out of my life because I don't want any drama and as long as he is with her and she is friends with my ex no matter what I say or do it is bound to create some sort of drama?\n\nThere is a lot more to the story but I was just trying to keep it short especially because it is just a bunch of drama and bs lol\n\n",

Because of that I’m not really comfortable talking to my parents about relationships and dating. I’m the youngest and both of my sisters are away for college and work, so I get all the attention, positive and negative. Part of that attention is my mom nagging me to do my homework. I feel like 80% of our conversations have been my mom asking me about homework or telling me to do homework.  \nToday at dinner I was just chilling and eating my food and then my mom starts talking to me about the next school dance coming up. She asks me what I would say if a girl asked me and I said idk because it kinda depends on the person. She tells me I should think of responses so I’m ready because there could be some girl who likes me or something. She keeps going on to the point where it feels like a lecture and at that point I just wanna eat my dinner. My dad joins in the conversation and after a few moments he detects that I’m a little annoyed by the conversation. Then, he says (in what I think was a joking tone) “do you enjoy our company?”. I then replied in what I thought was a joking tone “depends”.  After that he said “that hurts”. Am I an asshole for saying that?",

      "description": "Oh God.. this has been on my mind for so long. Ever since I cut off contact with him. I'll explain our friendship in full.\n\nSo, we met around.. two years ago. At the time I was trying to recover from depression and was going to therapy.  I was 13 years old. My only friends before that were people I met online, usually over games and such. I was really close with them and they encouraged me to try and make friends in real life, since I was really lonely here. At that time a new family moved in our building- a mom and a guy who went with me to school. I knew him from some kind of art class we used to have in school. Even though I considered him pretty annoying then I decided to try and befriend him. We'll just call him K.\n\nK was an interesting person from the start. He obviously had a lot of family issues- his parents were divorced because his father cheated on his wife with someone really young. We became close quickly, and I even opened up to him a lot about the things I was going through. Anyway.. he wasnt the most supportive friend when I look back at it. He did care, maybe, im not sure. \n\nWe got pretty close, and at some point I realized something. He had a major crush on me. I was oblivious to it at first but the guys from his class told me about it. He started to flirt with me a little. I was incredibly uncomfortable about it because I had a crush on my internet friend, and plus only saw K as a friend and nothing more. But I didnt think much of it. I barely even reacted. He started to take more drastic and weird measures to get me to like him back. He started talking a lot about porn and the kinks he had (we were both 13.... ew), started talking about my body and how ''hot'' I was, things such as that. He even told people at school that I was his gf????\n\nOne night I decided to come over at his place, which is like an apartment above me. It was all after school btw. Everything was fine at first. We decided to watch a movie and he already had one on his laptop. It was... a sexual movie. I was raised in a very conservative family and the entire time I felt so uncomfortable but didnt say much. (We were home alone btw.) After that I dont really remember much. I remember that he was messing around and being silly and making me laugh while also trying to touch my body. I kept not reacting to it much but I was uncomfortable. It slowly started to get worse. He kept trying to get me on the bed and things like that and I started realizing what was going on. At one point he started trying to pin me and kept saying how desperate he was. Me, a dumbass, still not even showing that I said no, decided to text my mom to call me to come home (she knows I get tired from people quickly so..) as soon as she called me I left immediately. I never explained to K why I left or anything..\n\nI feel like I never really explained that I didnt want to have sex. I was uncomfortable, but tried to show that I wasnt because I was just so confused about the whole situation. We stayed in contact actually, only over text tho, since I didnt come to school the next week and that was the last week. We didnt go out or anything. I switched schools and we still kinda stayed in contact, never mentioning what happened. But he kept trying to get me to come again, saying that his mom wont be there. It all stopped until my internet friend finally convinced me to tell him to fuck off.\n\nI feel like I was a huge asshole. That I didn't make it clear enough that I was uncomfortable. \n\nThis event truly traumatized me and confused me.",

      "description": " \n\nThrow-away account. English is not my first language so please excuse the grammar.\n\nMy husband and I have been married for 12 years and we have two young daughters. We've had a good marriage overall. The last year, I've been struggling personally.\n\nAfter a three month dry-spell, my husband asked me to either go to couples counselling or pursue an open marriage. I was tired and down on myself and in that fog, I agreed on to an open marriage. I felt so undesirable and so off-putting that it made sense to me to allow my husband to pursue another woman. Despite my reservations, I went along with it with a few agreed upon ground rules:\n\n1 - he must use condoms. Not any sort of other protection (he's had a vasectomy), but condoms because I am a mom and I don't want anything to jeopardize my health (or his)\n\n2- cannot be away for more than 2 nights per week and can't infringe on family time\n\n3 - cannot develop feelings for other person or must stop relationship\n\n4 - any one partner can veto this arrangement and we go back to the way things were without any judgement or resentment\n\n5 - cannot expose our kids to this and must be held private and not disclosed to family or friends\n\nSo, my husband disclosed to me that he will be pursuing a 23 y/o co-worker who works long hours and doesn't want a relationship.\n\nHe started working out as well, and they would actually sometimes go to the gym together before work. He was more energetic, a more focused dad, and more present at home when he was here. \n\nUntil one day, I had a migraine headache at work, and I left early and accidentally walked in on them having sex. And, the sight of it was one of the most revolting things I ever had to witness with my own eyes.\n\nI freaked out, started to cry and ran out of there. But,I also did notice that he wasn't wearing a condom. And, I also learned that he violated a few of our other rules, because he was actually seeing her a lot more often - they saw each other during lunch breaks, before work, and probably saw each 2 to 4 times per week and not 1 or 2.\n\nHe told me that if I was fine with it before finding out those things, and that I was the one who gave up on the marriage in the first place by agreeing to the open marriage rather than therapy. He told me that the girlfriend is interviewing for jobs hundreds of kilometers away, and it will be a matter of time before things fizzle out naturally, so why not let it end and we can go back and work on our marriage. \n\nThen I realized that my husband basically couldn't tolerate a three month dry spell, and when I was at my lowest, presented this twisted deal to me and I agreed. I asked for a divorce, and he thinks I'm being an unreasonable asshole.\n\nHe broke the rules, so all bets are off, and I essentially have PTSD after this experience. AITA?",

I’ve been dating a guy for nearly three months now and he’s still insisting that we ‘take things slow’ and ‘see what happens.’ We had a chat last weekend about where things are heading and he said he’s not seeing anyone else but he said I am single and I can do what I want, although he would be annoyed if he found out I was dating other people. \n\nThe thing is, he has a tendency to blow hot and cold on me and gives me mixed messages so I never really know what he’s thinking. We only see each other at weekends too as he is busy during the week but when we are together it feels quite ‘coupley.’ He does however make bold statements like ‘IF I were to get into a relationship with someone...” which makes me think it’s not going to be with me. \n\nI’ve recently been approached by another guy who said he would like to take me out. Would IBTA if I went for a drink with him? I mean, I’m technically single but morally is it wrong to do that when I’m seeing someone else? ",

      "description": "This one is sorta complicated, but I’ll try to explain this the best I can.\n\nI was early to check in for my flight from Manila to Tokyo, and an older gent (about 50s) who came early too started a conversation with me (I’m a 19F traveling alone). He was friendly and he started talking in Tagalog (I understand tho don’t speak it well) to me about his daughters and life after we both found out we were from California. He was nice, but I’m naturally kinda introverted/socially awkward so I did feel sorta awkward, but I always try to be polite to older people. \n\nThen the check in line started and this is where I felt sorta pressured I guess? He said that we should sit together on the flight from Manila to Tokyo, but I had already chosen my seat in advance online because I love having the window seat. I was first in line and went to the counter, and he came right behind me. I didn’t want to come off as rude or confrontational, so I didn’t say anything (my fault I know). And he told the lady at check in that we would be sitting next to each other as we handed in our travel docs. However, it turned out there were no seats left that were right next to each other, so I thankfully still ended up with my window seat and he got the aisle seat he wanted. \n\nWe ended up sitting together at the gate for boarding, with him starting some casual conversation (sorta like a forgetful grandpa vibe lol) and I nodded along and tried my best to not feel awkward lmao \n\nThen the 4-hour flight came and he caught up with me as I was exiting the plane and we walked through immigration together. On the way there he kept saying I should lead him to the capsule hotel I was staying at in case his family in Japan couldn’t pick him up for his layover. I told him sure and that I’d see him by the baggage pick up. I got through immigration before him and I was sure he was right behind me, and I waited a while, but I couldn’t find him anywhere? \n\nI even stayed by the baggage claim for our flight for a long while until it was mostly empty and I didn’t see him anywhere. So I went ahead, went through customs, and found my way to the capsule hotel because I was tbh exhausted and needed a long, hot shower. \n\nAt the time I thought “I already waited a long time, if he doesn’t show up I’m not gonna waste anymore time”. But now I’m feeling really bad about it and I feel like I could’ve done more idk \n\nWe only got each other’s first names too so I can’t contact him or anything. I’d just like either reassurance that it wasn’t that mean a thing to do or some harsh words and criticism so I know not to do this again lol \n",

      "description": "I'm not going to get into all of why, but my best friend and I have a very rough and toxic relationship. We have for a year. It's mostly her and certain mental health issues that she refuses to change that she knows are hurting me and causing her to not hold up her end of the relationship. This is probably the fifth chance I've given her and every single time she's told me she's going to change she's just let me down again.\n\nShe was doing okay this time but we had a nasty fight recently and I'm still constantly feeling anxiety, dread, and shame in our relationship. It pains me to say this because when things are okay we really do have a lot of fun and I don't think she's a horrible person but I'm starting to realize that everyone who has told me to leave our take a beak, including my therapist that I saw for 6 years up until a couple of months ago, is probably right.\n\nBut her seventeenth birthday is on February fifth, a month before mine, and I always give her a gift, especially a drawing of some sort, and I also have a Christmas present I still haven't given her which at this point with all of the shit that keeps happening between us I'm considering keeping for myself because we're both artists, but it's art supplies, and I could get use out of it. I was also planning on visiting her at our school that I left but clearly I won't be doing that if I take a break.\n\nIt feels like a really shitty thing to do because she already often doesn't enjoy her birthday, and this is possibly the first year in a while that I could even see her in person on her birthday and I would be ruining that, but we're having another fight right now and it's literally been maybe two or three days since our last one, which was really nasty and painful. I think if I'm going to break it off and ask for time apart, I need to do it *soon* like tonight or tomorrow and bite the bullet while I have the courage. ",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to break away from some of my friends?",
      "description": "First off, I want to break away from four of my friends, all for different reasons. I’ll split this into four parts so it makes more sense.\n\nFirst friend:\nThis friend, I’ll call him Jacob. I’ve known Jacob since we were in the fourth grade, after he started following me around because I was nice to him. I was fine with this, but it became a bit annoying when he wanted to be with me in all group activities. This wouldn’t be a problem if it weren’t for the fact that he would not contribute anything to the group work. He would pull the whole team down in Physical Education, and would not do any work if there was a group assignment. I ignored this at first, as I don’t like to get angry at people for small things at first, and he was my only friend at the time, as I had just moved to the area. This continued through the grades until 8th grade, where it got even worse. He became somewhat obnoxious, and would keep other people away because this behavior. He was constantly loud and talkative. Also, he would constantly complain about getting bad grades, and how it was his parent’s fault for not being nice, or how they wouldn’t get him a new  phone (he already had an iPhone 6+ or whatever the bigger model of the 6 is called), because he wasn’t responsible enough. He almost never did any of the class work or homework, and broke an iPad screen before. I am afraid he is pulling me down academically, and will only become a problem in the future, as he constantly tries to talk with me during class. I have worked hard to get into the highest level classes I can in school, and don’t want distractions to get in my way. Also, he keeps other people away and kind of gives me a bad reputation, as nobody really likes him.\n\nSecond Friend:\nI’ll call this friend Alex. Alex was one of my first friend after Jacob. We’ve been through a lot together, and have had several ups and downs. Alex was never really the nicest person, but he was kind and generous to his friends, including me. He once gave me discord nitro, and has given me and his other friends candies just because. He is more obnoxious than Jacob, but is more likely to get work done. He will do more on group assignments, but will still hold the group back, as he is easily distracted. He has ADHD and a couple other things, and he is more disliked than Jacob. He is constantly mean to others who aren’t his friends and will sometimes play cruel practical jokes on people because he thinks it is funny. Also, though he is more helpful in group projects than Jacob, he gets nearly nothing done in class. We were doing something in class for community service that was a requirement for graduating, but he just sat there drawing the whole class. We were once not friends, as we fought twice and he isn’t on the best of terms with my brother, even now. He knocked my brother’s tooth out in a fight with him at a pool. He also insulted me a couple of times and gotten me in trouble just because he could. People hate Alex more than they do Jacob, but I am still not sure if I should keep him as a friend. I feel like he might stray from the path of what is right and might drag me with him. Alex also doesn’t get along with some of my other friend very well just because he doesn’t like their personality.\n\nThird Friend:\nI’ll call this friend Daniel. Daniel is somewhat quirky, and never gotten along with people well. I knew him before even Jacob, but he is the one I am most on the fence about. He doesn’t really get along with some people very well, as he has serious anger issues, and has led to some conflicts. There really isn’t much to say about him, as the main reason I am considering not being friends with him anymore is because he has gotten into fights with some of my other friends over some of the smallest things. The other day, one of my friends was trying to jokingly talk to him when Daniel started to take things way to seriously. He slapped my friend across the face and started screaming about how what he is doing isn’t right (according to me and the rest of my friends, this friend did nothing wrong). Later, my friend got in trouble for hitting Daniel even though he did nothing to him. Also, Daniel never respects my wishes. Once, I tried to go to a different lunch table at my school to meet some new people and told my friends that I wanted to be alone for a bit, as nobody really likes them very much for things they’ve done. Daniel decided to come along anyways. He did this for the next couple of days even after I told him to stop following me.\n\nFourth Friend:\nI’ll call my final friend Steve. The only true reason I don’t want to be friends with Steve any more is because he constantly tries to talk about furries and other things relating to them. I have asked him politely to stop talking about it to me and to stop sending stuff related to it to me. He never listens, and constantly makes me feel uncomfortable because of the things he is saying that I have specifically asked to not hear about.\n\nSorry, I know this is probably a bit of a long post, but I needed a second opinion, and I didn’t know if I was the bad guy here, so Am I The Asshole?",

      "description": "I’m 15 and can’t drive yet. On Tuesday nights, one of my parents drops me off at my youth group, and my younger sister off at her dance class. \n\nThis youth group is currently my only recurring club/social obligation that doesn’t take place within school hours. (Yes, I need to get a life, but that’s a different story.) I have a bunch of friends there, and it takes place once a week.\n\n My sister, however, is more serious about her dance. She has classes 5 days a week for anywhere from 1 to 4 hours, and she’s pretty good at it. For her to miss a class means she would miss a crucial part of practice or changes in blocking, whereas for me to miss a meeting means I don’t get to see my friends until next week, big whoop. So it makes sense to me that her dance classes would be considered marginally more important than my support group.\n\nBecause of this, I try to be understanding whenever I’m late for my group or miss it altogether because of her schedule or the needs of someone in the family. However, it’s gotten so that I am late to almost every single meeting, and miss maybe 1 out of 5 altogether. This is usually either because she’s not ready in time or because my parents can’t find a stopping point in whatever they’re doing for work in order to get us out the door on time.\n\nI also understand that my parents’ occupations are the highest priorities because they keep everyone fed, and that it’s not always possible for them to drop everything to cart us around. But this is currently my one planned social activity, and I’m almost always late to it, whereas neither of my younger sisters have problems being on time to their respective activities. I should note that I absolutely hate being late to anything, so I can’t think of any times that I’ve made either of them late to their activities by any fault of my own.\n\nI’ve asked my sister and parents respectfully many times if there’s any way they can get out the door just 5 or 10 minutes early, and they say they’ll try, but I have not stopped being late. I hate being late and disrupting the space I’m entering- there’s a rule in the rule sheet we read at the beginning of every meeting that discourages lateness, and ironically enough I often arrive just as they’re reading it about 5-10 minutes into the meeting.\n\nWhen I get my driver’s license I will very likely be driving my sister to dance and myself to my meeting on Tuesdays, and I will expect her to be in the car by 6:00 out of respect for my obligations. \n\nAITA or am I being unreasonable? I just want to get to my support meetings on time out of respect for the rest of my group.",

      "description": "I live on a quiet street in a town pretty far outside the city.  There are about 25 houses on my block and its not dense (maybe an acre per house).   My neighbor across the street has a disabled child and they have a caretaker come five days a week to watch the kid.  Because of the way the caretaker drives in, in appears the easiest thing for them to do is park right in front of my house and then cross the street to the house they work in.  She does this every day, 5 days a week for the past 6 months.    \n\n\nI know its a public road and that anyone can park on it, but it's the only car that ever parks on the street and its always in front of my front door.  It really does annoy me, but beyond the actual annoyance it doesn't really harm me.  AITA for asking the caretaker to stop parking in front of my house and to spend the extra 20 seconds to park in front of their employer's house?",

      "description": "I have been with my boyfriend for over two years now, over seven months ago we stopped having sex. \n\nTo give some background information, we started the relationship as teenagers and were eachothers first. We waited 7 months the first time to have sex because we were both too nervous about buying condoms in case our parents found out. Before and after this we were constantly being sexually active, everytime we saw eachother and got a minute alone, we were getting off. After I went to university and had a busier schedule, our sex life died down a bit, but we would still have sex almost everytime we saw eachother.\n\nFlash forward seven months ago we went away with a couple of friends and rented a place to stay. We started getting hot and heavy, but he couldnt get it up, i chalked it up to him being tired and not feeling well. We tried again the next day, but same thing, so i thought it was just because he was sick. Over the next couple weeks we would try again and the same thing would happen and he would tell me its because of the anxiety meds he is taking and that he is going to the doctor to fix it. We try again in the next following weeks and its the same thing, I am understanding when it comes to his anxiety, but I am getting annoyed because he knows he cant get it up, but tells me he can and then when it comes down to it we have to stop and I'm left with the female equivalent of blue balls. \n\nHe finally ended up going to the doctor to change his meds and he can get it up now, but everytime I try to initiate he just shuts me down. I have had this discussion in the past with him and he always tells me he is willing to try, but when it comes down to it, he turns me down.\n\nI have asked a couple of friends and they keep telling me to stick it out and my boyfriend just needs time, so im a bit conflicted.\n\nSo AITA for wanting to break up over lack of sex?",

Ive even developed a huge crush on one of them that i let my original friend know about.\n\nAlmost a couple weeks after telling him my friend started to act differently. He inserted himself into conversations i was having with these two girls, started to speak to them alot more which i was conpletely fine with. Then his behavior changed even more. He became very white-knighty trying to do everything their way and really just trying to get their attention. It was nice in the begining but its developed into a huge annoyance when he goes out of his way to please them or to be liked by them. This personality he puts on in front of them isnt his real self, its completely fake and its really difficult for me to see him act fake in front of our mutual friends, or to try that hard to be likeable and not the person he is in reality (which is the guy ive been friends with and know since we were 4.)\n\nRecently ive thought about confronting him about the situation and explaining what i feel is happening but i dont know if im just jealous because of one of the two girls or if everything is as i make it out to be.
