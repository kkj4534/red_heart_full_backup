      "description": "I'm trying to keep this as vague as possible because my partner is a reddit user.\n\nWe've been together for two years now, and since we've started dating, it feels like my SO's struggle with mental health has gotten worse. They used to go to the gym every day, met with a therapist regularly, had a very active social life, did well in school, and work went well for them. Now they don't go to the gym or see their therapist. They only go out with friends if I am also joining. My partner's even being lazy about going to work even though it's so laid back them and other employees will play video games if customers aren't in the store. They did graduate from university though, which is great!\n\nThis past month it just feels like I'm putting my all into the relationship and my SO isn't anymore. I visit them after I'm done with my day's obligations, but they keep cancelling when we decide that they will visit me instead. This especially irritates me because they say they miss me, but they don't even want to visit me.\n\nI know mental illness is hard and depressive episodes can last a very long time, but it feels like my SO isn't even trying to work through it anymore and it's really grinding my gears. Am I being an insensitive asshole?",

      "description": "I'm 23F and I'm quitting my miserable office job today to go back to the art studio i was assistant managing.\n\nMy family lost our health insurance back in late January because my mom left her job. We ended up getting normal health insurance now which is costing my parents a lot of money. At the begining of Feb i got into a car accident which wasn't my fault and my car got totaled. We took out a loan and bought a used car and my car insurance went up. I am paying for the loan monthly and my dad is paying the insurance. \n\nMy dad was counting on this office job for me to get my own health insurance, I have been at this job for 2 months and I've become more and more miserable. I was crying constantly because I missed my old job which I loved and I worked there for 3.5 years. Yesterday I called out of work sick and cried all morning to my old coworker 45F about how much I hate this job. She gave me a big talk about how if I don't want to end up like my parents I have to get a degree. I have to have goals and do whatever it takes to get there. I went to the college I attended and switched my major and found out that I need 7 more classes to graduate and then I can go to the state university to get my bachelor's to be a teacher. I also called my old bosses and got my job back starting next month. When I explained my plan to my dad it didn't go well, he was absolutely fuming telling me that I had basically \"kicked him in the teeth\" and that I was selfish. He said he went out of his way to help me and I screwed him over. He told me I should stay at this job and go to school at night which isn't really possible since I get up at 5 and get home at 6:30 depending on traffic. So in the end it would take me unnecessarily longer to complete my asscociates degree. I understand that he feels betrayed and I tried to explain to him that I didn't want to be in the same struggling situation as he and my mother are in. I told him I'm miserable at this job and I can do better and he said sometimes that's how it is and I need to suck it up.\n\n(I was paying for my car loan, my own medical bills, for my own food, and also giving them 300$ monthly. My dad was paying for my car insurance and my phone bill.)\n\nSo i'm moving in with my boyfriend's family. I'm looking to get my own car insurance and I'm switching to virgin mobile for my phone. I will also likely be without health insurance until I go to the state college. I no longer want to be a financial burden on my family. I had believed for a long time that I cannot afford to have goals and I would have to live like my parents but now I know that I don't have to if I truly don't want to. I have the support from my boyfriend and his family. I feel like my dad is controlling and only cares about money and not the long term of things. I personally feel like I will not be able to gain independence if I stay with them and they will continue controlling me and my money. AITA?",

      "description": "Hello! I feel a lot of guilt for this because I do not know if this was the right thing to do or not. I was walking my dog and came back from the dog park ( I live in the lower west side of NYC). I came across a dog tied up to a bike post, and I have never came across that before. The leash was long enough for her to walk into the middle of the street, and I was nervous of her either: getting hit, being stolen, running away, or if someone just abandoned her. I didn't see any tags on her either, so I decided the best thing to do was wait. I had my dog sit on the other side of me about 3 feet away from her, I did not pet or feed her because I did not know the dog. I waited 20ish minutes. I was willing to wait the entire day to see if she had been abandoned because I am a student and it was the weekend. Then a woman came out of a grocery store that was on the other end of the street and looked really mad at me and asked what I was doing. I told her that I was worried if she would get hurt or abandoned so I wanted to wait for a potential owner. She got really really mad and told me to leave and that her dog was fine and that I was stupid. She looked really angry at me. My mom and sister told me to never leash dogs outside because they could get stolen or hurt, and my friends have told me that they have found abandoned tied up dogs. I would never hurt a dog. Should I have not done that? Or should I mind my own business?",

I ended up doing a little coke (which we are both ok with) and didn't want to wake him so texted him \"I'm staying at my place tonight\". I then realized I didn't know where my heater was so I went to my friend's place, a guy, and crashed on his couch. In the morning bf showed up at my place with coffee and saw I saw not home and started texting me, accused me of lying because I didn't update him and tell him I was staying with a friend, or tell him we were doing coke. Additionally he was not ok with me staying with a guy friend over night. My view is he should trust me and I should be able to stay with whoever I want and he is being jealous and insecure.",

      "description": "It all started as a joke but then it got really annoying. We had a nice talk before this even happened and he brought up why I didn't like taking pictures. I told him that I don't want to. He keeps asking why and I already gave him reasons. He got out his phone and pretended to take a picture of me. I was okay with it because I took it as a joke, but then it went on for more than 20 minutes. Needless to say, I was really through with what he was doing. Even followed me down the hall taking a video of me, and even had the nerve to follow me to the car to take a photo. I'm pretty chill if the joke is done once, twice or thrice but it still went on even after I told him multiple times to stop. I told him if he didn't stop, I'm going to have to report him to the principal because it's getting too much already. Didn't listen.\nI went down the hall and he ran on front of me and grabbed me by the arms. Hit my hand against the wall too. -_- He even grabbed my arms, which were sore from weightlifting (I told him they hurt before this even happened). He blocked me from going upstairs or in the hallway. Kept running on front of me so I can assure him that I wouldn't tell the teacher. I even told him that I was going to go home and I meant it. He was a top student, so I assumed that this was just out of panic and I let him go, but before I did that, there was plenty of cursing coming from me because his first reaction really shouldn't have been to grab. I gave him a little lecture of how people have limits. It seemed that he understood well. I didn't tell the teacher about it, because I felt guilty and there were quite some overreactions from the both of us. I still feel really guilty. AITA?",

      "description": "I’m gonna start off by saying that she is now my ex because I found out she cheated on me. However, that’s a story for another day.\n\nAnyway, this all goes back to May of 2018. We were both Juniors in High school at the time. I’m guessing I was at work since I wasn’t able to intervene in the situation. She had invited one of her two best friends to her house to play video games and watch a movie. Let’s call these friends Sara and Kyle. \n\nI never really had trusted Kyle because he was the very definition of a man whore. While he is a very charismatic guy, he typically uses it to get girls into bed with him. He has also bragged about it to me. Even though I didn’t trust the guy with women I care about, I let it go because I trusted my GF. \n\nAnyway, after awhile, all of them are pretty tired and decide to take a nap. Sara falls asleep pretty quickly but Kyle and my GF are still awake just laying there. At one point, Kyle starts seductively rubbing her stomach. She is concerned but thinks he is just asleep. Then he starts to grab her boobs and she gets out of the bed and cries in another room.\n\nThat’s where that story ends. This was all 6 months from when she did eventually tell me. We are now in August of 2018 and she tells me this story plus the fact that the person that helped her through it most was this other guy friend of hers. I will say she has known this other guy friend longer but I was her boyfriend. She had told the other guy friend shortly after it happened.\n\nMy GF would later go to therapy for this (she had told me it was to help her overcome her fear of heights). When she did tell me that August day, I was slightly conflicted about how I should respond. Admittedly, I did tell her I was kinda hurt that I was just learning about this but I decided to do whatever I could to comfort and help her through it to which she told me there wasn’t much I could do now.\n\nNow that we are broken up (and don’t take her cheating later into consideration with your responses) I’m looking back on the situation and wondering if that was a red flag or if I’m just turning her traumatic experience into something selfish now. \n\nTL;DR: my (now ex for outside reasons) GF was sexually harassed by a friend she had known a long time and didn’t tell me about it for 6 months. Looking back, I feel conflicted about how she went about it and if I should have thought differently.",

I’ve always been against it &amp; shut down the conversation whenever it comes up.

He has terrible seperation anxiety, and he wouldn’t sleep the whole night he stayed over a friend’s house who has a dog while my boyfriend &amp; I were on vacation.\nLast night, he mentioned Louie will be going away to the dog trainer for 2 weeks and i flipped out and blocked his number and left. I’m mad because he knew I was against it, and he went over my head and signed up for a trainer anyway. Am i the asshole? ",

She has cheated on multiple boyfriends, strung one poor guy along for a few years, cheating on him the entire time. She lives at home, pays no bills and even maintains an expensive hobby that her family pays for. She's also a compulsive liar and my partner and I have caught her lying multiple times. Until recently I've just ignored her, I'm 27 not 16 I don't give any real shits about this kind of high school drama, but recently this has changed. Some poor sap got involved with her long distance, and has now moved across the country to be with her. Seeing as he has no friends here I figured I'd be nice and go out for a few beers with this guy. He's as nice as they come, I'm straight and I'd be lying if I said even I wasn't a little smitten. Total sweet heart but painfully naive. I can tell she's up to her usual bullshit but I have no idea how to warn this guy, or if I even should? It's not my business and I prefer to avoid these situations but I feel like he's pissing away his time with this girl, and the fact he's from out of town is letting her manipulate him easier. I'm afraid this guy will get an STI from this girl but I have no clue how to approach the situation, or if I even should. ",

Anyway here goes. \n\nBefore I (22F) left for college, I inherited a house. A family friend and their partner moved into my house and took care of it while I was in college. After college, I moved back in and they stayed living at the house. \n\nI knew it wasn't going to be a permeant setup for them to live here but wasn't sure when it would end. Over the course of the next several months, I tried my best to be accommodating while also being incredibly frustrated. I had to ask permission for friends to come over. My SO wasn't allowed over while they were here. Dishes left for more than a few hours would get me in trouble. Eventually I just stopped trying. I'd say hi when I saw them but wouldn't go out of my way to say hi or have a conversation. I'm a naturally quiet person anyway so I didn't always have much to say. \n\nI tried to act like a roommate around them but I think they interpreted that as that I don't care. Eventually they said that I was being mean to them. I started buying small meaningful gifts in hopes that would send a message. They expressed some gratitude but I don't think it helped our relationship. I also became more intentional about spending time together (ex: let's setup dinner once a week rather vs I see you around). Eventually they decided to move out cause they felt I was mean and didn't want them here. I do like my space but this whole thing is about more than that. I had roommates in college and loves it.

However, I told him I won't have much time to study because I have work until 7, so he knew that our time was precious.\n\nFast forward to today, he snaps me asking me to come to GameStop with him after I'm done with work so that he can get something for the smash game (idk anything about it but it seemed like he was serious about this game). I told him no because we don't have a lot of time. He responds saying with \"we can just study in the car\", and I again I say no that's inefficient use of the little time we have to study, and that he should wait until after the test to get the game.\n\nHe then tells me that he's not going to be able to study in the car if I'm not there with him, and I again say that I'm not going because it's a waste of valuable time, and that he needs to get his priorities straight. He proceeds to tell me to fuck off and I just don't say anything back.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: Friend is struggling in class and asks for help, don't have a lot of time to study, but he wants to spend part of that time to go get a video game",

      "title": "AITA for pretending to be a lesbian to get a guy hitting on me to go away?",
      "description": "A preface: normally I wouldn’t use a throwaway, this isn’t a huge deal even if I acted like a jerk during it. I’m just on a discord server with a lot of reddit users and if I posted this on my main they would roast the fuck out of me. \n\nSo, to begin with, I’m a straight, cis high school girl. I’m not bi or trans and as the post title states, I’m certainly not a lesbian. But I am very progressive and have a lot of LGBT friends, one of them being a girl I’m just gonna call BFF for now. She *is* a lesbian and we aren’t in a relationship (she has a gf) but we’re super close friends. Since she’s out and we’re so close, a few years back there was this huge annoying rumor circulating about how we were dating. We weren’t. We couldn’t convince anyone we weren’t, as hard as we tried, and it died out naturally. I am on kind of frosty terms with my BFF’s gf because of it though, who’s not possessive, but she is paranoid. I like the girl and all but considering her dislike of me I wouldn’t really be friends with her.\n\nSo. It’s junior year last week, all the shitty dating rumors evaporated a while back, and me and my BFF are in the hallway just chatting before school ends when this guy I’ll call Kevin (courtesy of the infamous Kevin meme) struts into our zone.\n\nImportant fact about Kevin: He’s an asshat. A certified dickprince. He hits on girls constantly unaware of just how much they loathe him, and he’s been eyeing me up for a few days. I knew this was coming, but I was just hoping to ignore him.\n\nHe begins to try and put the moves on me with a bunch of stupid comments about my face and butt and how we should copulate. Infantile and dumb. My BFF and I try to walk away from him, but he keeps following us. Finally, out of frustration, I blurt out at him “I’M A LESBIAN!” In hopes that he’ll leave me and my BFF the fuck alone. He doesn’t immediately, makes a bunch of dumb comments about how he could turn me and how we should make out, but it’s obviously pretty discouraging and he leaves like a minute after I say it. So I’m standing there, pretty smug and self-satisfied at how I handled the situation, and then I notice my BFF is frowning at me. I can’t remember exactly what she said but to paraphrase, it was something along the lines of “That was kind of dickish of you, Kevin’s going to tell everyone that you’re a lesbian and they’ll all think we’re dating, [her GF] will get pissed-“ (my BFF and her GF are in all different classes so it’s not common knowledge that they’re dating) “-we’ll have to ward off all the rumors again, and if you date guys in the future that just gives people more reason to think that lesbianism is something that can be changed.” She also went on about how calling yourself a lesbian isn’t a get-out-Of-being-hit-on free card. \n\nInitially I thought she was overreacting, but after reflecting on it I can see why she’d be mad, and I think it’s possible I was a bitch. So how about it Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "Me and my boyfriend play dungeons and dragons with a couple of friends form uni. We are all in our final year apart from one guy (lets call him Joe) who is doing a sandwich year which means he started in the same year as us but is currently doing an internship this year, and will graduate next year. He actually lives closer to his work but makes an effort to come over for parties and dnd, and usually ends up crashing on our couch.\n\nNow our dungeon master (Lets call him Bob) is a great dungeon master but a kinda control freak in all aspects of his life. I've never really seen eye to eye with him but my boyfriend is good friends with him. The one thing he hates is people last minute cancelling plans, which I 100% understand most of the time, but I also know that life happens and sometimes not everyone can make it. Joe has actually always been pretty good with coming. He has had to cancel a couple of times but was able to give notice and we rearranged for a better time.\n\nYesterday I woke up to see a mess in our group chat. From what I can gather, Joe had to cancel for a last minute work trip. They are flying him out to the US today for a week, and he had just found out. He was estatic, however this meant he obviously wouldn't be able to make our session, and Bob lost his shit at him. Partly due to the last minute cancellation but I feel like something else might have happened because he is not normally a super angry person. Joe even said he was happy for us to play without him but Bob was not having that. He doesn't like people missing out on his story because he works hard on it.\n\nAnyway, I tried to defuse a little in a different group chat with everyone and a couple of others in, just saying how happy I was for Joe because I knew he wanted to go for a while and stuff, but in the original Dnd chat everyone else was kind of aggresive and taunting saying things like \"Ah, we're going to miss you Joe.\", \"We had a good campain, your character was fun to play with\" and stuff like that as if its already established that he would no longer be welcome at these sessions. I tried again to calm people down saying it was just one session and it was a pretty good reason but people were like \"Nah, if Bob wants him gone, hes gone.\"\n\nMy own boyfriend who was right next to me admitted it was a bit harsh but said there was nothing he could do, but I wasn't taking that. I argued with Bob for a bit longer but he wasn't having none of it. He in the end said something along the lines of \"If you want to go play with Joe, then go. No one is making you turn up to these sessions. You're just the eye candy anyway\"\n\nThat last statement made me mad. The boys have always been super respectful to me playing with them. I really don't think siding with Joe was the wrong thing to do. He has done nothing wrong in my eyes. But seeing as not even my own bf will side with me I'm really sitting back wondering if the other guys have a point, or are they all just sucking up to Bob?",

Someone contacted me that they were interested in buying it and wanted to come over to see it. I work 9-6 Monday to Friday and but he only worked evenings so our schedules didn’t mesh but he wanted to see it ASAP. My girlfriend does not work on Wednesday's and usually spends it studying at home for an exam she’s taking soon so I figured that she could show the guy the couch and if he wanted to buy it take the money for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I told my girlfriend - she was angry and said that I should have asked her first (I admit I should have but I knew she was going to be home anyway- she’s a homebody). She said she refused to be home alone with some random guy I found on the internet and that anything could happen. I thought she was being a bit ridiculous. For example, she was home alone one time when someone came to fix our internet . She insisted that was different since it was through our landlord and it was an official business but this is some random guy she doesn’t know and that “strange men” make her nervous. I still thought she was being silly but she flat out refused and thought I was being insensitive. I had to contact the guy and say the day didn’t work anymore. He got annoyed and kind of lost interest in the couch after that - much to my disappointment and now I'm still trying to sell the couch.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don’t understand why she was being difficult but she insists she did nothing wrong and was just looking out for her safety.\n\nAITA here?",

      "description": "Hey Reddit.  So I posted a similar thing on r/advice a month or so ago when this actually happened, but I’ve started thinking that I was kind of a dick. I don’t remember everything since I have pretty bad memory, but it should be enough for you all to make a judgment. \n\nHere’s some background information. I am a 13 year old girl. My dad has had 5 or so previous relationships (that I know of) prior to his current one. I hadn’t met his gf before this happened, and I only spoke to her for about 5mins on the phone. \n\nSo my dad basically says that, 2 days before xmas, we were going to his gfs on boxing day and I would go to my mums from there. I basically said “Well, no. I don’t even know this woman and you’re asking me to stay at her place?”\n\nHe started to get really mad at me and was like “You’re ruining my Christmas” and “If you don’t come with me, you’re not seeing your mum”. My blood began to boil at this point. I kinda just started shouting that I didn’t want to go because I don’t know her I wouldn’t feel comfortable (my dad would be there, but still) \n\nHe started saying things like “You’re a disgusting child” “Piece of shit” “Selfish bitch” and, again “You’re ruining my Christmas”. I started crying and he said “You’re staying on your own” (I ended up going anyways but that’s not the point). \n\nI think I said something like “You’re just being and idiot and you’re probably drunk” and went to my bedroom. He does have a bit of an alcohol problem, and he sounded like he has been drinking, but I don’t know. \n\nI ended up crying for a few hours and I just felt bad about shouting at my dad, but I just wanted to get my point across. \n\nI understand that he wanted to see his girlfriend and wanted me to meet her, but I don’t think he understood that I wasn’t keen on spending xmas with a stranger, even if he would be there. \n\nTL;DR, I feel like I was an asshole to my dad because I didn’t want to go to his gfs with him since I didn’t know her. \n\nI don’t know... even if I don’t like his gf, I still feel kinda shitty and like I did something wrong. I feel like a dick. I mean, I did shout at him and call him an idiot. And I was being a bit selfish, admittedly. But I don’t know. ",

We’re all vegetarians but being that my sister and I grew up in America, we have differing values. A few years ago my sister started dating a White guy. He seemed nice enough and I kept her secret from my parents. Fast forward to last year, my sister decided to ask one of my relatives for advice on how she should bring it up to my parents if she wants to move forward. They ended up telling my parents about it and they both reacted horribly. It ended with a lot of crying and fighting. Fast forward, my family doesn’t talk about it because it only ends with arguments and no development. This was two years ago. Last year, during a visit to a cousins, me and my sister drank a little with her. This cousin decided to disclose this information to the same relative who ended up confronting me and my sister about it on my sisters bday in front of my parents. They told my parents they were gullible idiots for not knowing this about their kids. They berated us for drinking ever and called us uncultured and spoiled. They also brought up that my sister was still dating that guy and started yelling at her for it. I defended her and they started yelling at me too. Keep in mind it was very awkward as they were visiting for the entire winter break so me and my sister pretty much stayed in her room the entire time. After the relatives left, things got a little better as we had time to think it over and my dad told my sister he overreacted a bit. I’ve never been one to talk out my feelings or be emotional so me and my dad have never been very close. My sister is much more social and expressive. Up until this incident I was always the one to try and fix arguments and keep our family close but I have since lost motivation to do so. Things seem to have settled down but I doubt they will still be okay with my sister ending up with a white guy. I have not been able to live at home the same since. I can’t talk to my parents because I feel like I don’t agree with their values and I want to live my own life. My sister is a doctor and is financially successful and we’ve talked about maybe moving out at some point. She has started talking to my parents again. My parents both grew up in india and I can understand why they have their values but I do not agree with them. I don’t like having these rules on my life and I don’t like feeling controlled. They’re amazing parents and have always been caring but I feel like we have a fundamental disconnect in values. I want to move out but I know this would be selfish because it would be like I’m giving up on saving my family because I don’t want to deal with it anymore. My ideal plan would be to become financially stable and start paying them back for the expenses they wasted on me. I’m sorry if this was a jumbled mess I kinda just wrote what I thought. AITA? ",

      "description": "Ok this is my wife’s friend, she is a very bad driver. She scratch her car up pretty bad parking her car in her garage. She went to the repair shop to pay a grand to fix the car so her dad wouldn’t be mad at her when she returned home from school. She picked it up after the paint job and drove out the repair shop and immediately hits another driver and totaled her car. She and the other driver arguing about who is at fault, but I have seen her drive and It isn’t a stretch of any imagination that she caused it. She has hired legal representation and is claiming she got hurt (I am thinking she is milking it and refuses to admit fault). Also My wife even said she felt unsafe as her passenger before. \n\nAnyway she went home for Christmas (another state) and won’t be back for several weeks until school starts up again. She needs us to go to the dealership to take out a bunch of junk in the trunk and car and hang on to it for several weeks so insurance can get the car. We have seen the interior of her car it is total mess. It’s raining and cold out and I have zero desire to clean up her crap and organize it for her and take up space in my home. Shouldn’t she have thought this through before leaving for break when she suspected her car was totaled ? Or at least organize it better? Anyway wife is getting upset about my lack of enthusiasm for helping in this task. ",

      "description": "My mother and I never got along. I moved out of my parents house when I was young due to our toxic relationship. I'm now 29, and my husband and I are expecting our first child. This will be my mom's first grandchild. \n\nLong story short, we don't have a mother-daughter relationship. We don't respect each other, and we don't agree on things. Because of that, and to maintain the peace, I've put up boundaries that exclude her from the highly personal aspects of my private life. I dont confide in her, or look to her for any type of advice or emotional support.  When we do talk, it's just to get caught up. I tell her how work is going, and she updates me on the rest of the family.  Sometimes I borrow money from her. Sometimes she bums rides off of me.  We're just friends. \n\nBut now she seems to think that this pregnancy changes things.  She doesnt respect these long established boundaries, nor does she respect my decisions, and has no confidence in me what so ever.  \n\nI know she's just excited to be a grandmother, and wants to be involved. She's all sentimental, feeling like it's her job to be there to guide me with her wisdom. But I like the boundaries, and I would prefer to keep our relationship as it is, because it works. I'm just not ready or willing to assume the role as daughter in a mother-daughter dynamic. I don't feel comfortable showing her my vulnerability, let alone look to her for support. I also find it very disrespectful with how she talks down to me like I'm an idiot who hasn't bothered to learn about pregnancy, labour, delivery, or parenting.  It reminds me of why those boundaries are there in the first place. \n\nShe assumed that she'd be in the delivery room when I gave birth.  I literally just said \"no you're not. It's just going to be me and (husband)\".  She doesn't respect that decision, and assumes I'm going to want her there.  She started questioning whether or not my husband will be able to handle it.  I've been with him for 10 years, she hardly knows him.  I just wanted to tell her to fuck off.  It's not up for discussion. \n\nSo, am I an asshole because I dont want a close mother-daughter relationship with my mom, causing her to feel left out and deprived of part of what she thinks being a grandma is supposed to be? \n\n",

My cousin (F13) just moved next to me and she moved to my school. I (M14) really didnt want her to move here because shes not fit for this school, and it turns out I was right. Until 2 weeks ago everything was fine, but one day I found out she started smoking and drinking alcohol. I didnt snitch on her because thats not what we do. After a few days I found out she started sleeping with guys (sexual intercourse) and I was pissed, I was afraid that people will start calling her a whore and will bully her, so I told my parents. After she found out (my cousin) she started yelling at me and telling me I ruined her whole life... AITA? Thanks.",

      "title": "AITA for becoming closer with my friend's brother than my friend over the past year?",
      "description": "Tldr at the end \n\nLittle background; Ive (F 23) known my friend, we'll call her Jane, since we were in kindergarten. We were best friends up until about 2 years ago when our lives took different routes and our paths sort of diverged. Ive known her brother, lets call him John, for just as long. Basically I grew up around their family. Jane is my age, John is 2 years younger. Over the past year, John and I have become increasingly closer, arguably closer than Jane and I. John and I had never hung out as adults until a little over a year ago. Growing up, we knew eachother. Or, to put it better; we knew OF eachother. I'd see him when I went over to go hang out with Jane. But in our first 20ish years of knowing each other we exchanged maybe a total of 500 words. He was just Jane's little brother to me. Flash forward, to October of 2017; we ran in to eachother on our college campus and started talking and hanging out; movies, coffee, college parties, etc. pretty harmless stuff. It was all very platonic. I may add this was about a month after I got out of an incredibly toxic 5 year relationship and the male companionship made me feel comfortable and desirable so I naturally gravitated towards him. He's one of my best friends now. We still talk every day, we had a 150 day snap streak, he helped me move in to my appartment, we go see movies together, I party mom'd his 21st birthday, I tell him everything and he tells me everything.\n\nA little background about Jane: Jane is recently engaged to a man she loves very much (lets call him Mark). They are incredibly happy together but Mark is emotionally manipulative. Jane has burned multiple bridges with multiple childhood friends for various reasons, all of which stem from Mark. Jane lets Mark's insecurities dictate her actions and she does it with a smile because she is absolutely head-over-heels crazy about this guy. Obviously this put a strain on Jane's relationship with me, John as well as the rest of their family. \n\nI was losing a childhood friend and John was losing a sister so obviously we comforted eachother and talked a lot of our issues out. \n\nLately John and I have been becoming a lot more... erm... physical. I struggle to say 'romantic' because at the end of the day he's my friend above all. Nor do I want to say sexual because we haven't ACTUALLY done the deed yet. We're both very attracted to one another and I feel it was bound to happen eventually.\n\nI may add that I've been the one to make the advances. Its not that he's sexually inexperienced or that I'm being predatory, but I could tell I was going to be the one to make the first move. So I did. And let me tell ya; it felt great. We were out drinking with some friends and we kind of just ended up kissing once at a bar which turned in to going home and staying up till 4am necking on eachother. \n\nJane found out and she was less than ammused. She feels betrayed by me and I can see where she is coming from. I cant tell if she is more bothered by mine and John's close friendship or more bothered by the thought of one of her close friends hooking up with her brother. It doesnt help that John was the 'boy next door' for vurtually every girl we went to high school with. She has been bombarded with comments about how hot her little brother is for as long as I can remember. \n\nI feel like the asshole. I know Jane wouldnt have expected this from one of her best friends. Sure Jane hasn't been the greatest friend to me, or the greatest sister to John but thay doesn't make me value her feelings any less. At the end of the day she is still a childhood friend of mine and I can't help but feel like I'm going behind her back. \n\nTLDR: am I the asshole for becoming closer and hooking up with my friend's brother amidst her becoming increasingly distant from her friends and family due to a controversial and arguably unhealthy marriage?\n\nDo your worst, reddit. Make me feel like the brother-fucking slut that I know I am.\n\nThank you for listening.",

      "description": "So, some context: I've made some pretty big changes to my life recently, and I'm feeling pretty good about myself. I'm currently traveling, have a decent haircut, a bit trimmer, and dress a lot tidier than normal. So. I met an old spark while abroad, we had some drinks, her friend was there, and they went off to a show while I hung out in town and waited for them to finish up. A few hours later and I catch up with them at a bar, and the friend opens the door, and looks super happy to see me, and seems quite flirtatious. She's much prettier than I would normally feel comfortable flirting with. Anyway, we head inside, and I meet up with my old spark, we hit it off, and go back to hers. \nAbout a week later, I've added her friend on social media and after chatting, mention that I felt like she was flirting with me. I figure it would be nice to know, I'll likely never see her again (having left the city and living a long way away), and it'll likely make me feel good about myself. Old spark is told about it, and is told that I was making a pass at her friend, decides that we had a one time thing, and that she's lost respect for me, which hurt. I don't know if there is much potential for anything else with old spark, but there's certainly almost none now.\n\nAITA?\n\ntl;dr\nAsked friend of girl I slept with if she was flirting with me which was taken as a pass AITA?",

      "description": "**TLDR: We told MIL she can't watch our son alone because of parenting style/abuse/drinking. SO &amp; I came to this conclusion before our child was born, but neglected to tell her right away &amp; it blew up in our face.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have been considering posting this for a while &amp; am genuinely curious to see what you all think. Even though I'm leaving out a ton of details this is still going to be long, I apologize in advance.\n\nMy MIL is a normally sweet woman in her late 40s, but there have been problems with her that I feel can't be overlooked. \n\nWhen my SO was a child/teenager she used hard drugs &amp; was physically/emotionally abusive. As my SO grew into young adulthood she got off hard drugs, but continued drinking heavily. At this point she has abused alcohol for a number of years &amp; everyone considers her to be an alocholic that will not change. She holds down a job &amp; can function in society, but if she isn't at work she is getting hammered.  While drunk she comes out of her shell &amp; is very gregarious &amp; loud to the point of being sloppy. Falling down, passing out, a usual drunks behaviour is par for the course.\n\nIn the past she's alternated between being openly apologetic of her treatment of my SO to joking about the abuse, thinking certain incidents that are brought up are funny. My partner doesn't feel much attachment to her, or a need to pursue a closer relationship so generally we only see her at family holiday gatherings.\n\nThat is until we had her first grandchild. Then she was wanting to visit once a month. No problem, we were always there supervising any/all contact she had with our son. While I was pregnant SO &amp; I both agreed that she should probably never have alone time with him for all the obvious reasons. Now here is where we I think we messed up: we did not tell her this before our son was born. \n\nSo over the summer we were visiting &amp; got into a conversation about childcare/rearing. Our son was not present so we had a few drinks with dinner &amp; MIL was already drunk when she'd arrived. She proceeds to go on about how kids need to be spanked/slapped so that they don't grow up to be ENTITLED. My SO goes a little quiet. I engage her saying that we do not believe in that form of \"parenting\" &amp; won't allow anyone else to do that to our son. She argues a bit so (this is where I messed up again) I jokingly say \"Well MIL that's why you won't be watching him alone ever then.\" My SO backs me up, subject is changed, dinner is eaten, &amp; things calm down.\n\nThe next day she leaves, cutting a weeklong trip short. Obviously she is pissed. I get a text that basically says she feels disrespected, she want's nothing to do with either of us, &amp; hey have a nice life. I respond with sorry you feel disrespected, not really an apology I know, but although the conversation didn't happen the way it should have both SO &amp; I still meant it. Then she goes NC with us for a number of months. \n\nEventually she texts SO &amp; they have the same conversation. We do not want her watching our son if she will hit/slap/spank as a form of punishment. She then says that she is not here to punish/enforce rules with the kid, just love. My SO questions her though, do you still believe it would be okay? You say you won't do it, but you think it's alright? Yes, she does think it's alright, but promises not to. This is when my SO brings up the drinking, saying in effect well how can you follow our requests if you are drinking/drunk? Can you watch him without drinking? \n\n**This is where she gets mad &amp; states that she has another grandchild arriving. She will have another grandchild to love, to see whenever she wants, &amp; THAT SHE DOESN'T NEED OUR SON ANYMORE.**\n\nAt this point we are done. We're so glad are son is too little to understand what was being said about him by his grandmother. She reached out via text very briefly over the Christmas holiday, but other than that we have not dealt with her. Now she has not seen her grandchild in over 7 months. \n\nI have this nagging doubt that this is all my fault. I feel very guilty because we didn't outline our expectations in the beginning. I also feel bad because I don't want to ruin my SO or my son's relationship with her. I come from family that has a lot of members NC/estranged &amp; I don't want that for my son. Please tell me what you guys think. \n\nI'm really conflicted &amp; want to know AITA here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I'm 53, my daughter is 30.\n\nMy daughter was born with hydrocephalus, a brain disorder. Not necessarily a mental disorder, more a physical one. She wasn't affected mentally beyond missing long stretches of school for surgeries and illnesses. I stayed at home while my husband worked at his request.\n\nWhen she was 17, she had a routine surgery which went awry. After dozens of brain surgeries without any complications, this was the one that caused damage. She developed epilepsy and never really developed mentally beyond 17. She tried to maintain a healthy life but you could tell she never really became an adult, even to this day. At least it was 17 and not 12 or something like that. In some ways, I think she might have regressed to a younger \"mental age\" over time. I became her primary support giver until she moved out at 24 with her boyfriend.\n\nSince then, my husband and I divorced and it was a particularly nasty one. I won't get into details but if you were looking at it as a \"this party was right, this party was wrong\" thing, he was in the wrong. Why I bring this is up is I'll probably have to work until I die, and I work minimum wage due to being a SAHM my entire adult life.\n\nBetween then and now, she had two children, both with similar disabilities (one has a missing/partially missing cerebellum and is low functioning autistic, one has hydrocephalus but is otherwise \"normal\"). CPS was involved from the geto and basically forbid her from being alone with her children due to their disabilities. My daughter could have a seizure and be out for hours at a time, if she even wakes up. She has refused fulltime nurses and instead relies on her husband.\n\nThis leads into a week ago. My daughter's boyfriend allegedly broke a few ribs and had to go to the hospital. She phoned me and asked me to leave work early and stay with her for a few weeks because he was out of commission as a caregiver role. I can't, I told her, and she blew up at me. I conceded and said I could maybe come visit once a day to check in (I live two hours away each way) but I can't essentially quit my job to be her caretaker. I could lose my house. She said that CPS is going to know he broke a few ribs and cannot provide fulltime care and will take her children away. I stood firm in my decision and was hung up on. I haven't spoken to her since.\n\nAITA for not quitting my job to ensure my daughter keeps her kids? I don't even know if she'd lose them, she might have been overreacting or jumping to conclusions. But I can't give up my job of six years to be a nanny fulltime for a few weeks.",

      "description": "I have a friend who loves league of legends and spends a lot of time playing it. Our relationship hasn't been that good for the latter half of this year, but he was wonderful to me for the first half. We mostly communicate online. I know holidays are a pretty shitty time for him due to apathetic family, manic depression and a slew of other issues, so for Christmas, I wrote him a heartfelt message and sent him some art of his favourite league of legends character. I don't play league and that's something that he gets upset about, but I try to compensate by listening when he talks about it and being attentive to the characters and lore that he likes.\n\nAfter reading my message and seeing the art I made he responded 'thanks' and went right back to playing league with his other friends, which he proclaims are better than me because they actually play the game with him, which translates to them caring more based on previous discussions. He didn't even wish me 'merry christmas'. There was no further appreciation, no nothing. I worked really hard on that art and it was tricky doing the research since I don't play the game. I know he's having a rough time and I'm not owed any gratitude by any means, but I feel so hurt to be shoved to the side and given bare minimum after I worked so hard for him. I honestly can't even be bothered to communicate this to him since I already know he'll just say 'k' or ignore me entirely if he's feeling down, and only respond when he's at an upswing. \n\nWIBTA if I ignored him next time he contacts me? I feel like such an asshole but this feels like the final straw somehow. I KNOW he can show more gratitude than that, I made him a very similar piece of art a few months ago and he was falling over himself with thankfulness. He's being so closed off this later half of the year and I don't want to let myself get sidelined and have him put in zero effort even if I already know it's all down to mental issues and situational stuff with family... I'm sure he didn't mean to be short with me but it still really hurts.",

      "description": "TL;DR I met a creepy dude on a bus. I switched buses, and I saw him trying to catch my bus. I didn't tell the bus driver to stop because I worried he was following me.\n\nI (17, F) was on the bus to the mall, not for the mall specifically, but because there is a bus loop of sorts there, so I could go on another bus. There's a street in my city in which all the buses you can get on lead to the mall, so I just took one of them.\n\nEventually, this dude gets on, clearly older than eighteen. I didn't think much of him until he stood beside me on the bus, and stood uncomfortably close to me, and since I was sitting, either his junk or ass was in close contact with my face.\n\nThe guy spoke in the way that adults spoke to little kids. You know, purposefully raising their voice, stuff like that. Maybe that was his natural way of talking, but it still kind of threw me off guard.\n\nThe first question he asked me was something like \"do you know Sandra?\" or some name. Of course, I had zero idea who 'Sandra' was so I just told him \"sorry, I don't,\".\n\nI thought he had confused me for someone else, which is fine, whatever, but he continued speaking to me. \n\nHe then asked me \"does this bus go to the mall?\" which really then raised my suspicion of him. All the buses on that road went to the mall, so that made no sense. Maybe he didn't know this, but then why would he go on a bus he knew nothing about? If he was looking for reassurance, why would he ask me and not the bus driver? Because I might know Sandra?\n\nI told him \"yeah, it does\" and even then he didn't stop, might I remind you he seemed fine shoving his junk into my face.\n\n He then asked me if I went to university, which didn't come off as creepy as it probably was. He seemed to be going to university, and I mean, maybe I did too? I think I look pretty young, but I'm not one to judge that.\n\nThe last thing we talked about before I got off the bus was my age. He didn't seem to be following me off, which made the bus question even more strange. However, I was a bit relieved that he didn't get off. My anxiety was shooting through the roof. Maybe he was just an awkward, weird dude. Which, if he was, whatever, cool.\n\nMy other bus was already waiting, so I swiftly changed into it. It left a few seconds later, but as it was, I looked out the window, and saw him. He was running towards the bus. \n\nAt this point, I had to think about what I should do. Should I tell the bus driver to stop, or do I not say anything?\n\nI had to try my best to piece everything together. Sandra, weird as hell. Mall question, weird as hell, but he did get off the bus. Why didn't he get off sooner? The second bus was only a few steps away, and it stayed that way for about thirty seconds. How could he have possibly had managed to be late to a bus like that?\n\nI eventually decided to stay nothing. It seemed to me that he actually had no intentions of going somewhere specific, and he was just planning on creeping. He only was late for the second bus because he didn't want to seem like he was following me.\n\n I felt a little bit bad about this initially, but now I feel like an asshole. Maybe I am just overthinking it?",

      "description": "Some context: for the past couple of years my mom was having an affair with a former coworker of hers. Eventually, she divorced my dad and he moved to Montana recently. Her boyfriend comes over quite a bit and she flaunted him around a lot when my parents were married and eventually told me and my sister that she wanted a divorce and to be with this guy. My problem is he is not my dad and I have no respect for him since he initiated the affair which is a shitty thing to do in my opinion. I have no interest in talking to this guy and I can’t stand him. I haven’t told my mom this as I feel she would get mad at me for not liking him and accusing me of not wanting her to be happy. So this ties to my question of me being the asshole.\n\nApologies for format I’m on mobile and sort for the length this situation has been stressing me out for months and has made quite depressed as well.",

      "description": "Background: I'm a university student (19F) and live in an only girl student house where everybody has their own room (mine is fairly small, double bed and a small kitchenette, and we are currently facing a mice problem) \n\nStory: A few months ago, one of my roommates (21F) texted she had some friends visiting and asked if I would like to rent out my room for 3 days, and they would pay €150 between them and I agreed.\n\nOn the day, I left my room very clean. I left the key on my table the night before and texted her that. \nThe 3 days passed, and she texted me the room was a bit messy, but she would be back the next morning to clean. I wasn't mad, even though I was already planning to go home that night. \n\nSince I had to get some things at my house I went there and saw my room. There were chips, packages and a drug snorting straw all over my floor and table. I was really mad but didn't say anything as she said she would clean the morning after. \nThe morning after and she texted that she had delays and would try to make it before 5:00pm to clean. I told her that it’s okay and she can just leave the money on the table. \nToday I went to my house and the room was clean but only found €60 on my table. \n\nI texted her and this is how it went:\nMe: M and Roomate: RM\n\nM: Hey, thanks for cleaning the room! I just have a question, you said your friends would pay €150 and there’s only €60 in my room, would you mind paying the rest this week?\n\nRM: Hi, in the beginning there were more people meant to be joining, but only 3 people came so then it amounted to €60. Maybe we should have talked about the money beforehand, but less people came to visit!\n\nM: I’m sorry but you said €150 and not an amount pp, that’s not what we agreed on because then it wasn't worth for me. Also 6 people in my room wouldn’t really fit to sum up to €150 total.\n\nRM: I’m really sorry I didn’t realize that I hadn’t said per person, and as well if you were expecting a certain amount, I think in my head I just presumed that you had known. I know this is annoying now, yes it was meant to be 7 people between the two rooms, I can ask if they would send another €10 each!\n\nMy last message was super long, but I'll summarize the content.\nIf only 3 of the 7 people came, she could've fit them all in her room like her original plan and not have to pay anything at all. She never said anything about the amount of people, just the final sum of €150. I also explained that €50 pp is already cheap if compared to nearby hostels or airbnbs (which are also more inconvenient). Leaving more trash for the mice didn’t help either and I also wasn't able to sleep in my own room for 2 more nights cause of the mess. I said I can lower the price to €120, but that's already low considering I have bills and tuition fees to pay. I gave her my bank details so she can transfer me the remaining amount by the end of the week.\n\nSo AITA for asking them to pay more than what they left?\n",

      "description": "Going to try to make this as short as possible while including details needed. \n\nI have been with my fiancé for 6 years. Fiancé has an older sister, we'll call her Sally, who is 28 and has a 5 year old child. I was there the day Sally was in labor and Baby was born, she is my niece. His entire family has referred to me as his Auntie since day 1. I am not blood but we are family, she calls me Auntie and we have sleepovers, zoo visits, etc. \n\n2 years ago Sally was in rehab from drug addiction. Alcohol, pain killers, and Xanax were her thing. She had a mental breakdown and the family collected money to send her to rehab and all organized a schedule to take care of Baby. The baby's child, Sally's boyfriend, has a welding/construction job and was out of town for 2 months so he wasn't there for all of this. \n\nShe checked herself out after 3 days, insisting she was \"fine and just needed a safe withdraw\". I pick her up, take her to her house, and she immediately goes to smoke weed and drink a beer. I don't think weed is a drug and am very pro-cannibas although I don't smoke, but that was not appropriate considering I just picked her up from rehab. \n\nA week later she was fired for snorting in the bathroom., evicted for being 4 months late, totaled her car driving while high and is being sued for $50k from wrecking into a house, and was kicked out of Fiancé's other sister's house for forgetting the sink was plugged up and running (she was high) and the entire downstairs was RUINED from water damage because nobody else came home for 8 hours. $20,000 of damage and thank god their house insurance covered it. \n\nThat was all last year. They've been in their new house on their own for about 6 months. In November she called FIL and said their electricity was shut off because she didn't have the money because BF's paycheck got messed up and didn't go through. He paid their late electricity bills.. a total of $500. I thought it was suspiciously expensive but kept my mouth shut. All has been quiet since. \n\nTwo weeks ago, she asked me to borrow some money to get groceries for Niece. Of course I'm not going to let my niece or sister go hungry, no matter what is going on otherwise, so I say I'll be over at 5. I got off work early and get there at 2:45. I come in using my spare key, walk in, see Niece playing with dolls in the corner, Sally passed out on the couch, and heroin on the coffee table. Unfortunately coming from a family riddled with addiction, I know what heroin looks like. I don't know how much it was, but I could have scooped it up and filled my palm with it. I noticed radiators everywhere in the front room and Niece was in multiple layers of clothes and her winter jacket. The heat was off. The house was maybe 40F - it was 30 outside. \n\nI took Niece to my car, and called 911 for an ambulance as I was scared Sally was overdosing.  I didn't want to alarm and freak out Niece so I stayed in the car and let her play on my phone until the ambulance arrived. Of course police and CPS showed up as well. I explained the situation and because Niece's dad is out of town working, FIL/MIL were called. When they arrived they were quiet and cold, didn't really talk, took Niece, and told me to go home. \n\nAn hour later I get home and fiancé asks me what I've done. I explained everything to him and all he had was anger for me. Apparently the entire family already knew and were pissed at me for what I had done. Apparently I was \"out of line and stupid\" because I called 911 before seeing if she was actually OD'ing because it turned out she was just nodding out from the heroin. We fought for hours and I left and spent the night at my best friend's house and cried all night. I couldn't handle it all so I turned my phone off and tried to relax and just calm down. My best friend was up all night with me, telling me I did nothing wrong, and I'm okay. \n\nI turn my phone on and I had 65 texts/messages. MIL, FIL, SIL, fiancé, and their extended family members blaming me. They are saying I ruined her life, ruined Niece's life, made everything more complicated than it needed to be, made it public when it was a \"family affair\", and ruined Sally's chances of ever getting cleaned or having custody of her child again, none of them ever want to see me again and I will never see my niece again, and they want me to pay for Sally's jail bond and sue me for the CPS case and emotional damages.\n\nI am also now single. So on top of losing my best friend of 10 years (fiancé), I will lose my apartment I had with him, what I considered my family, and my Niece.\n\nI truly feel horrible. I have horrible anxiety to the point where I'm worried someone is going to come get \"revenge\" on me for what I did. I can't eat. I have lost 7 pounds from it. I'm not sleeping for shit. I have bags under my eyes. I've had 8 migraine-days in two weeks. At first I felt so confident in my decision but as the days go by I'm thinking maybe they were right and I should have checked on her before calling 911 and being frazzled. I don't care about Sally anymore, but I did rip a 5 year old child away from her parents and I feel horrible about it. I know someone in the family will take her in, but it's never like being with your parents. She will grow up resenting me for it and all I've ever done is love her as my own. \n\nReddit, AITA? Please help me. The guilt is eating me alive. ",

      "description": "First time poster so please let me know if I am not following the rules.\n\nTLDR; I warned my roommate to close her door to prevent my cat from entering and messing with her stuff. She didn’t and my cat knocked over a plant. Would I be the asshole for leaving it?\n\nImportantish backstory: this roommate and I are finishing our lease only on “amicable” terms. After much bickering of her leaving bags of trash in the apartment hallway and also being unwilling to pay utilities, we barely even say hello to each other. I stay polite and try not to make her feel uncomfortable space though. She currently is also living out of town at her significant other’s parents for the majority of the week. I only see her for a portion of the weekend, if that. \n\nThere is a lot more to us being roommates and how she has wronged me. At the end of the day, I’m grateful I ended up with someone like her and not someone more disrespectful to my space and person. I don’t want to completely sour our relationship, but I would no longer call us friends-just roommates.\n\nNow onto our story: Our apartment is not the best so both of our doors do not shut completely and can be opened with just slightly pushing on hem. My cat has discovered this and makes it a habit to immediately open my roommate’s door whenever he sees it’s closed. This is something my roommate is aware of and complained about to me explicitly. This is on top of her ALSO having a cat who does this to me.\n\nLast week she left chocolate out on her desk, completely in the open. He of course got into it and ate some. After barfing everywhere I rushed him to the vet. He thankfully is fine. Instead of cussing out my roommate for leaving chocolate out, I instead told her that we need to start blocking off the door whenever she leaves. I figured I couldn’t blame her immediately for her actions. This would at least prevent him from hurting himself again and possibly harming any of her stuff, as he is still a kitten. \n\nWell after staying for the weekend and agreeing to the plan she left. This morning I woke up to my cat chilling in her room and a plant splattered on the carpet. I’m talking dirt everywhere, DEEP in the carpet. At this point I have been very jaded with her actions and behavior. I feel no sympathy after the panic attack it was finding an emergency vet in a town of 5,000 at 8:30 pm. \n\nBecause of this I need honest judgement: WIBTA for leaving that plant, pretending I never saw it, and reminding her that we agreed on keeping the door closed when she brings it up. I feel like I’m not responsible for my cats actions after explicitly warning her and us agreeing.\n\nI know this is inconsequential roommate and girl drama, but I would appreciate some answers on if I am being as much of an asshole as I feel like I am.

We both have a lot in common and we have each other's backs, we're more like friends than uncle and nephew to be honest.\n\nLast night, we were talking using the Messenger App, talking about memes, joking around and whatnot. When he said something that caught me off guard. I'm not gonna lie it was kinda stupid but it was something my sister used to tell me when I was younger to bully me. I told him how it made me feel and that if he could, he'd stop using that term. But he didn't. Instead he kept using it in a mocking term so told him I'd stop talking to him for a while because of how upset I was. Well I guess I was really upset, because I ended up blocking him on the app. A couple minutes later he texts me (which is something we rarely do) and says I upset him and that he's disowning me for blocking him, he also said to never talk to him again. \n\nI know this seems shallow, since we're both adults but I really don't know what to feel about this.

      "description": "My ex girlfriend and I were together for 3 years, and lived together for nearly the entirety of the last year together. We ended very amicably. The spark just wasn't there anymore and it just died.\n\nSo, during the time we lived together, we were very much in love and expected a long lasting relationship together. As is normal for when 2 people move in to a house together (from moving out of their parents), we purchased furniture on finance. A corner sofa, TV stand, coffee table, and a spinning single-couch.\n\nFast forward to when we break up and I move out within the month, as I had a military barracks I could stay in. She remained in the house with the furniture, and I loaned her £700(my standard half of the monthly house upkeep), to help with rent and the next months bills. This was August '17\n\nI was never really concerned *when* I got the money back, so long as I did. We were still very close, so I didn't care and wanted to help her out.\n\nGo ahead a couple of months, we're both happy, single, and living our lives. As you'd expect, we didn't talk much anymore, but were still good. I'm a computer engineer by trade and she asks if I could go over to her new place and help her with her laptop.\n\nShe explains that the furniture we got on finance together is still in our old home and she was hoping I would take it off her hands. My parents needed a new sofa, and this was pretty much exactly what they wanted, so I did. Happily. Now, as for payment of the sofa, which was still ongoing, she suggested she pays for it until she has paid back the £700 that she owed me through the monthly repayments of around £50. I was more than happy to oblige, and took the furniture from the old house, gave it to my parents and that was that. At this point, I figured there was only about £700 left to pay on the sofa, so I told her to let me know how much was left, as it was all in her name. This is around November '17.\n\nFast forward to April of this year, and I get a call off her, asking to take the payments off her hands, and that there was around £2000 left to pay. To my disbelief, I asked to see some paperwork to prove this amount was needed to be paid... and it was. I grossly misjudged the amount left to pay, I know.\n\nAnyway, I explained that I wanted her to pay off what else she owed me and I would happily over take the rest of the payments. My parents had the furniture and rightly so, I would have to pay for it. She didn't like this. She called me selfish and explained that she was in a new position in work and couldn't afford to pay for it. Her attitude towards me was pretty hurtful. Calling me selfish because if we didn't split, I would still be living there, and it was *my* choice to move out. kinda hurt. considering it's what people tend to do after splitting up, is move out.\nI try to be fair and she spent 3 years with me, so it hit me deep. I decided not to play ball and told her to keep paying until August, when her side of the bargain was complete, and I'd message her to take over the payments. She called me a few things and I didn't hear from her until I messaged her in August, as promised.\n\nI'm now paying for the sofa (via her), and have been since August and we're all good. We talk now and again, send eachother memes and shit and have both moved on to new partners.\n\nI have no bitterness towards her, but it still bugs me that she called me selfish, when I was trying to be anything but that. Kinda made me question my other moments of self-perceived selflessness, and think otherwise.\n\nSo, was I an asshole to her? She's paid me back now and it's all over with, but it still pops to mind now and again.\n\n",

My mom was (and still is) a crazy narcissist with a bit of redeeming qualities that make her bearable. When my parents were still together she was abusive and living with her sucked.  I know now that she is a survivor of sexual abuse and a generally fucked up childhood so I have worked on understanding and forgiving her but our relationship over the years has been fraught, including a couple of times that I’ve gone NC.\n\nWhen I was 22 my dad passed away suddenly, leaving no will (or money to his name because disabilities suck). Unfortunately my parents were still legally married so not only can she call herself a widow, but she is also able to collect his Canadian pension (total bullshit since she cheated on my dad and left with the guy on his Harley in the most dramatic way possible 15 years prior).  I guess she was grieving, but when I think about it all I can remember is her basking in the attention of being a widow. She talks about him now and cries. I really don’t know whether she’s just putting on a show or not, but it seems genuine and like I said I’m really trying to love her so I’m taking her at face value.\n\nAbout a year ago my paternal grandfather passed away and I knew there was going to be some drama about the 6 figure estate so I didn’t tell her. She has implied for years that she “deserves” part of my grandparents estate. This has always made me furious. She already collects my dads pension, its been 8 years since he died so that’s almost 30k in money that she did absolutely nothing for! \n\nFinally today she asked me out of nowhere whether my grandad was still alive. I didn’t want to lie about it so I told her yes, it was a bit ago and I didn’t want to bring it up. First thing she asked was “Well what happened to the estate?” so I told her it’s gone (truth, it’s settled, she soa) and that I didn’t really want to get into it. She immediately started crying and acting like I just stabbed her in the back or something, telling me she ought to just never call me again, that I must not want her around. I know what she’s doing, but I still feel terrible. I was involved in the divvying of the estate and ended up getting 1/3 of it. She would absolutely lose her shit if she found out what I received. I don’t think she would ever forgive me because I’m guessing she would think I “stole” it from her. I don’t even think any of this stuff with my paternal grandparents is her business at all but she seems to think it is (and that my exclusion of her implies we’re not family). Honestly I just want to have a normal relationship with my mom, but she is making this almost impossible. Did I cross a line by not including her? Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr AITA for not disclosing my paternal granddads death to my mom so she could try and fight for “her share” of their estate? \n",

He was only home 3-4 days a week, he was not nice to me or my brother( once he called mu bro  a c*nt because he ran away when my dad could of hurt him) , my dad may of cheated on my mum and has emotionally and physically abused her.\n\nWell in 2016, my dad picked me up from a recent trip from my ex  secondary school (more about that later) and when we eventually arrived there was a big arguememt. Big enough for me to have to call the police. In this arguement he had assualted my mum and threatened to kill her plus threatened for a divorce. He had to be taken away in police car and my mum later filed for a divorce.\n\nFrom then on he sent messaging stating why i called the police and later on saying its not my fault. He took me out to movies and stuff but he would always be late or wouldn't come at all. He would send messages deatiling rude things abput my mum and lied about having prostate cancer. In this time he had even called my uncle a pedofile for no reason.\n\nRecently i had stayed over at his place and he had me write something about staying with him every week which may just be a way for him to not pay so much child support. My brother had also went to a trip to italy.\n\nWhen my bro got backed we recieved a call from my aunt stating stuff that i wasnt allowed to stay at her house and he thereatend her.\n\nThat was yesterday when we recieved that call. Keep in mind i am 13 right now  but AITA.",

      "description": "I’m gay. We’re both girls in this story. \n\nThere was this girl I went out with uhh like 7 times? And she was okay, but I couldn’t see being her girlfriend. She sent me a text like every day and I was getting kind of tired of it. I wanted to reject her but she was nice enough and we weren’t official so I thought I’d do it in a nice way.\n\nI told her I was having a rough week and attempted su*cide (censored for trigger) and couldn’t go on dates for 8 weeks because I was on suicide watch. She was all oh my god are you okay and saying no no it’s okay health is #1 and I was saying thank you, she said she was there if I needed anything and I thought ok, this is where it ends. \n\nBut she kept messaging me almost every day, except now more stuff like “I hope today’s not too bad” and “how are you?” stuff. And she would send memes. I started conversations every now and then too but not as much. \n\nThen she asks me if I’m busy over the weekend and I’m like wtf, I already said I was on suicide watch. So I go “oh I don’t know which day I’m free because I’m going camping with my family” hoping she’s gonna get the hint. And she says oh okay, that sounds fun and I go “maybe you can come” but like in a vague way, she says sure just let me know which day soon so I can figure out my weekend. I never told her the day or talked about the “trip” and hoped she’d forget about it. \n\nI try being more distant and it’s not working because she keeps worrying about me. Eventually she says she’s gonna give me space and promises she still likes me and is here for me, and I don’t respond. Then she calls me. And double texts. And triple texts saying “that’s alright, maybe I misunderstood, good luck with everything and cya”. I felt bad so I said I don’t know about my health and after a while stopped responding to her. \n\nShe texts me again, in barely like a week, asking if we could be friends and how I’m feeling. I say I’m better and she’s like “wow awesome!” and I don’t respond. But my read receipts are on and even when I ignore her sometimes she double texts me. She asks me to hang out again and I say my schedule is so crazy for the next three months I don’t know (which obviously doesn’t go with the suicide watch thing... but she doesn’t get it) and she’s like you know, I really meant what I told you and really thought we were friends, and I don’t know what it is on your end, which sucks. \n\nI felt bad and kept saying no I’m just busy but she said “then tell me when you figure it out” and I didn’t answer. She finally left me alone. \n\nI heard a lot about ghosting these days and I don’t know it makes me feel kind of bad? I have anxiety and I meant well, and she had a lot of points where she could’ve taken the hint. I thought after the suicide thing she would go but she stayed and kept checking up on me. I feel bad and don’t think this makes me an asshole but also try not to talk about it. This is the first time telling the full story.  ",

      "description": "Throwaway cause my main can be easily traced to me and I don't need that.\n\nSo I'm gay and out for about a decade now. My country is like on the fence about the whole thing, no gay marriage but they're not hanging us so that's something I guess. Our government that is here to stay for a long time is the typical fake religious hate-mongering populist kind. The government TV channel is constantly blasting propaganda on all sorts of topics. Obviously one of them is homosexuality. They call gay people sick or mentally ill, they say pride marches are aggressive and harmful, they advocate conversion therapy. The works.\n\nOne of my close family members works at the government TV channel, and I'm not talking like they're the receptionist or a cleaner or the one fixing the copy machine. They are like IN it making the shows (think like writer/editor/producer level involvement).\n\nWhenever this topic comes up they are quick to say that they don't agree with it and that they do not believe these things, but I cannot phantom that a person can do this with good conscience. I also know that it is not a case of \"resisting from the inside\" cause the government is notorious for firing people who voice differing opinions (and they have many lost wrongful termination to show for it).\n\nBy no means do I want to tell them to quit or anything (even though there are dozens of non-government TV channels so it's hardly that there is no other option) it is their life and they live as they choose.  If you want to do this and be it, then own it so I know where I stand with you. I can't help feeling that this person is insincere, untrustworthy and just an all around shitty person for doing this and being part of the \"system\", while rejecting any criticism or responsibility (just a reminder that homosexuality is just one of the topics here, there is also blatant racism, xenophobia and sexism on this channel). However whenever this topic comes up, other family members say that I am overreacting, because they are just doing their job and it doesn't define them as a person.\n\nSo my question is, AITA for being distrustful towards this person, not wanting to associate with them and basically not treating them as \"family\"?",

      "description": "So I have these 2 friends who are around my age. I am a 25[M] and they are also male. We play this TCG called Yugioh. Now my friends have been playing on and off for about 10 years and I just started about a month ago. \n\nI tell them that I am interested in playing and they encourage me so I start looking online for kinds of decks I can play and decide on a couple to make. \n\nOne of my friends is, I guess, a \"purist\" about the game. He does not get new cards, does not adapt to the new format, and uses very old cards. We will call him \"A\". The other friend is \"B\". B gets new cards, reads up on what is being played at tournaments and keeps up to date with the current metagame. \n\nWhen we play against each other, we play a 1v1v1 style which is very casual. We keep it pretty loose and sometimes we argue about card rulings and interactions but for the most part it is a pretty good atmosphere. It is important to note that when we play 1v1v1, A usually comes out winning with his older cards.\n\nRecently I have been looking into a new deck that incorporates newer type cards and B is encouraging because now he can use his newer cards as well. \n\nA tells us that we need to stop buying newer cards so he can stay competitive. I kind of laugh it off and say that he wins most of the time anyway and losing is getting old. He goes on to say that we don't have an equal standing and that our (myself and B) decks are too aggressive as opposed to his. I don't think it's fair that he wants to tell us what cards to play and things like that but I don't tell him this. It could be because he wants to keep winning but he has said that he would rather lose and be competitive. I am not sure if I buy that. He says that we can get newer cards but we are slowly pushing him away from playing. \n\nI don't really know what else to say at this point.\n\nI like playing and I want to experiment with new play styles but I feel like I am alienating someone as a result of it. \n",

      "description": "Before I went to bed on Christmas night, I was added to a group chat with 3 other people (all men) by my friend (who is also a woman). She messaged us and said, \"If I don't get back to you guys at midnight, call the police.\" She then left an address in the chat.\n\nI was very confused and was asked what was going on. One of the guys in the group tells us that she was messaging some guy on Tinder and decided to go over his house. Weird that she's asking us to do this on Christmas night of all nights, but I get it, she doesn't celebrate it. My other girlfriends and I ask each other to watch out for each other when we've gone on tinder dates in the past but we've never had to call the police before.\n\n15 minutes past midnight we all call and text her and get no response. The guys insist that she was probably okay and we don't need to call the cops. I get really frustrated by this, thinking that they don't understand that women do this stuff all the time (asking each other if they make it home okay after a night out/on a date, and have plans to call the police if they don't get back). I tell them that if she asked us to call the police if she doesn't get back to us, then we should. I volunteer myself to call the police as a result.\n\nI call the non-emergency line to the police and let them know what happened. Right as they were about to send people over, she texts us that she's okay. I apologize to the police and tell them she's alright. \n\nTURNS OUT SHE SIMPLY FORGOT TO GET BACK TO US. But she also said she didn't get our calls (which I'm pretty sure is a lie, because I was able to connect to her voicemail and have a log of the call going through to it).  She ended up going over to the guy's house and just cuddled with him and lost track of time. Her exact words were \"Oh God. It's 12:20. Thank you and sorry.\" I am livid. I tell her she wasted my time and kept me up (she also kept my boyfriend up and we had an early flight to catch), and left the chat.\n\nI am so fed up at this point. There has been a bunch of things she's done in the past where use uses me as an emotional crutch or has forced me to be the \"responsible friend.\" This is basically the final straw and I decided that it wasn't even worth confronting her about this any further.

      "description": "Ok, so there is a lot of backstory on this one, so strap in. Also, FTP and that stuff.\n\nKey:\n\nR: Roommate\n\nM: Me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I live at a boarding school and recently switched rooms at the request of R into his room because R was a friend, and R didn't want a new kid. I agreed because I thought R would be a fun person to room with and because I thought that the room was a better room for me and actually doing my work (I have issues with that). So I move in right before a break and everything is fine. For that one night. When we return from break, R starts harassing me about every little thing I do, from being in the room a lot, to not showering. Now granted, both were rather problematic for me, because I have serious anxiety around those things in particular and am currently working through them. I relay this to R, as at the time, I still considered R my friend. R responds with: \"What are you gonna do? Cry?\" and calls me overly sensitive. This, obviously, pisses the fuck out of me, and I flip on R. I try to change rooms here, but no response from the higher-ups. I decide, since at one point I thought of R as a friend, I would try to mend things between us, and talk with R. R says they will stop nitpicking me and is sorry, and I was satisfied with that, but still rather pissed. R didn't actually stop. \n\nSo, that was all backstory, but it's important for the actual story where I feel like I might have been an asshole. So throughout my entire time with R as my roommate (about a month and a half now), R has refused to use headphones, or even turn his volume down on anything, and when R claims to turn it down, R turns it down maybe one bar, so almost no difference. Today, with my already annoyed demeanor towards him due to the above back story, I decided I had had enough, so I snapped when R was playing on an NES rom with the volume super loud. The convo went as follows:\n\nM: Hey man, could you please turn down your volume, It's really loud and annoying. (this wasn't said very kindly, as I was pretty pissed)\n\nR: (doesn't say anything but gets up and visibly presses the volume down button once.)\n\nM: Dude, that's not turning the volume down, it's still super loud.\n\nR: I can barely hear it! (If R was telling the truth, R is deaf, since I could hear it loudly and clearly through my headphones that were playing music rather loudly)\n\nM: Then could you put headphones on?\n\nR: The TV (it was a large computer monitor, not a TV) Doesn't allow headphones, and my headphones are broken anyways.\n\nM: Then you need to turn your volume way down, as It is annoying and distracting me from what I'm doing.\n\nR: (Not very happy) I've had a harder month than you can possibly imagine, so you can shut the fuck up. (He tries to guilt everyone into letting him do anything by constantly saying his life is way worse than any of ours could ever be, so I ignore this comment)\n\nM: It's common courtesy to not be super loud in a dorm and use headphones or turn your volume off.\n\nR: When I was watching Doctor Who earlier, it was much louder than this (I had asked him repeatedly to either put on headphones or turn the volume off while he was watching doctor who, on account of it being louder than the NES was now)\n\nM: And I asked you to turn the volume off on that too. And here it is just pointless sound effects, no dialogue, so please just turn it off.\n\nR: (Flips me off)\n\nM: I'm going to email the dorm head, as your current behavior is definitely not ok (Total BS, I had no plans on getting them involved on something that should be so basic.)\n\nR: (seems scared by this and turns the volume down a considerable amount, but it is still louder than my music, which was on rather loud for me.)\n\nM: I can still clearly hear it over my music that I'm listening to.\n\nR: Then turn your music up\n\nM: What, and blow out my eardrums? It is considered common sense that you remain respectful of your roommate and use headphones, or not use sound.\n\nR: (Flips me off, but does turn down the volume to where I can barely hear it, even though I still can hear it)\n\nNow, this is where I think I might have gone off the deep end into assholeness. I was done with him and decided to get pedantic.\n\nM: I can still hear it, why don't you just turn it off if you can't use headphones.\n\nR: I can barely hear it!\n\nM: Then you must be deaf, I can hear it over my music\n\nR: (Pretends to turn the volume down, I see this) There that better?\n\nM: You didn't turn it down at all just turn the fucking volume off.\n\nR: Fuck you, I did turn it almost off.\n\nM: No you didn't, you didn't even touch the volume button.\n\nR: (Turns it almost all the way off, but I can still hear it, maybe I just have super hearing, idk) There, I turned it off.\n\nM: No you didn't I can still hear it clearly (I couldn't but I could kind of hear it) just turn it off.\n\nR: Fine (decides he should test me) you close your eyes, I'll switch games, and you tell me when I've changed.\n\nM: (I close my eyes, he switches to super mario bros) Dude, I can clearly hear SMB playing.\n\nR: Fuck off and get your head out of your ass\n\nM: don't be a dick and just turn it off\n\nR: (Finally turns the volume off) There, happy?\n\nM: Thank you. ( goes back to what I was doing, but then had the feeling I might have been a total asshole and decide to post the story here to see)",

I was holding her ankle with my hand and without knowing I was rubbing it with my finger, I tend to do that sometimes subconsciously and my girlfriend hates it.She has told me several times to stop doing it, but sometimes I just can't help myself and start doing unconsciously. After she told me to stop, I apologized and said that I did not notice that I was doing it. She was angry at me that I did it in the first place and started to rub my neck with her finger to \"pay me back\". After some time she said \"How do you like it?\", since at that point I was annoyed that she did it, I said \"I like it a lot\" then she answered \"ok then\" and proceeded to rub my neck for the next 5 minutes, knowing fully that I did not like it. After I did not pay attention for some time, she started rubbing my face to get me more annoyed, I told her to not rub my face, then she started to rub near my ear, I told her to stop because the sound is annoying. Then she told me why should she stop when I do it to her. I said you already did more to me than I did to her.\n\nThen she told me to back off from her (we were cuddling up until that point). I backed away and she started to play with her phone and not watch the movie with me. Then I asked her why is she not watching the movie with me, she told me to \"fuck off\" and leave me alone. I said to her \"It is not fair that you are acting like this, since I apologized and let you have your revenge, then she told me to shut up and I repeated to her that it is not fair. She then got very angry and got very annoyed by me and kicked me in the face, it is not the first time she hit me. Usually when I annoy her she hits me and tells me it is my fault since I did not back off and ignored her warnings, so I have accepted that it was my fault. This time instinctively I hit her in her leg (Throughout our 3 year relationship I have hit her 3-4 times including this one and I don't hit with my full force as I do not want and hate to hit her at all) and then she got more angry. I told her it is not fair what she is doing and called her stupid, then she grabbed hear earbuds and told me \"call me stupid one more time and I will hit you\", so of course I called her stupid and she hit me,then I did it again. She said for every time you call me stupid \"I will hit you\" so I kept calling her stupid and she kept hitting me until hear earbuds broke. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "I'll start this out by stating that my family is religious. I am not.\n\nI am studying music in university, and to help cover some of my tuition, I have been working part time as a musician and section lead with a local united church. My early music training was largely in the Anglican choral tradition, and much of what I learned then translates into my work now. I am well equipped for the job, regardless of my personal beliefs or lack thereof.\n\nMy mother has been making efforts to reinsert faith into our family's regular life in the form of prayer, bible study, and discussions. I humoured her by sitting in for a while, but for a number of reasons, it became an ultimately uncomfortable, and unpleasant experience, instead of a positive family gathering.\n\nI have not been participating in these routines for about two months now. My mother has been putting pressure on me concerning my views, and I've been rather resistant to participating. She uses my job as an argument to claim I have \"emotional turmoil\" and that I need to join in (I work there because it pays well enough and the music style is both familiar and what I'm good at.)  and setting aside the religious points she's been arguing, she's also been saying I am keeping the family from coming together as a whole. \n\nI don't judge people based on the fact that they are religious, but neither do I see any reason in participating in someone else's practices/traditions. It seems disrespectful to people who do believe and disingenuous for me to join in prayer to a god I don't believe in.\n\nTL;DR am I the asshole for not joining in family worship despite working at a church to pay tuition?",

      "title": "AITA for stealing my college roommate’s girlfriend?",
      "description": "I went through high school as a very shy kid who had self-esteem issues and social anxiety. I hoped to break out of my shell in college, but failed and latched onto the first person I was put into a group project with. He asked if I wanted to room with him the next year and I accepted without realizing his new girlfriend would be spending most nights with us. My roommate and his girlfriend remained together through the next 3 years, and we all basically lived together through all of it.\n\nI spent a lot of time as their third wheel. I was fine with it for the first year or so, but progressively became more and more miserable. My attraction for his girlfriend grew as I learned more about her. We had very similar interests, beliefs, and awkward personalities. All of which clashed with my roommate. I distanced myself from her as much as I could out of respect for my roommate to the point of not even speaking directly to her. During senior year I hit what I feel was rock bottom. I was severely depressed and had picked up some bad habits. \n\nIt all boiled down to Valentine’s Day of senior year. My roommate decided he’d rather attend a school sporting event, so her and I went with a mutual friend to see a band we liked that was playing not too far away. It was when we returned that I decided I had waited long enough, and I told her that I had a crush on her all this time. I didn’t intend to get anything in return. I just felt like getting it off my chest would make me feel better. To my surprise, she revealed to me that she had the same feelings for me and was unhappy with her current relationship.\n\nShe broke up with my roommate, and her and I started spending time together to get to know each other better. It was at this stage that the ex became very controlling. He would constantly text her asking where she was and who she was with if she wasn’t home, and he repeatedly told her to stay away from me. If he found us together in private, he would begin throwing stuff around the apartment in fits of rage.\n\nWe began officially dating a month later, and I had finally felt pure happiness. Unfortunately, he put 2 and 2 together a few days before graduation, and his fit of rage erupted into a physical altercation with me after I got in between him yelling at his ex. The last few days there were incredibly hostile, and move out came immediately after graduation. \n\nFast-forward to the present, and her and I just celebrated four years together and we will finally (college isn’t cheap) be moving in together in a month. I am still deeply in love with this girl and have every intent to spend the rest of my life with her. Needless to say, we have not heard from or spoken to the roommate since.\n\nIs this a Cinderella story? Or am I the villain? Am I the guy that swept the girl of his dreams off her feet and lived happily ever after? Or AITA who broke the “bro code” and interfered with a long term relationship?",

MIL works at the local hospital where we will most likely give birth. Mother lives in another city 4 hours away and is no longer working as a midwife, but has probably 2 decades worth of experience.\n\nI have a great relationship with them both, and have always been very close to my mother. We only recently told our parents that we are pregnant, so its still new and settling news. My mother messaged me today asking if I want her to be there on the day, to which I said of course - but that I had also thought about asking MIL to be there too, she is very close to my husband and, I feel, close enough to our lives that having her there would be ok for me.\n\nMother sort of blew up about it - not exactly characteristic for her. She said it was a right of passage for mother-daughter relationships for her to be the one there and if I invite MIL then she won't feel welcome to be there/won't want to be there with her. I just like things to be fair, and its first grandchild for both of them so I thought to myself: have all the powerful women I respect with me when it happens and it will be a special time. It just made her more upset when I tried to explain why I might want MIL there.\n\nI don't know what to do. I know we have HEAPS of time before we even think about who will be present at the birth but I don't want to offend my MIL by blocking her out just because of my mum, but at the same time I want to share that special experience with my mother. I thknk her own mother wasn't able to be at my birth, which may have something to do with it.\n\nI just want everyone to be happy and enjoy the event. It only happens once.",

I just want to start off by saying that i have outstanding parents who have supported me finically and emotionally  basically my whole life, and i acknowledge every day how lucky i am . I work during the summers, and had a job this fall through my school, mentoring freshman students. Fast forward to now, and I have used up the majority of my savings, leaving me with just a few hundred bucks to my name. Im looking for a job but going to school full time (Next term I'm taking 5 upper division classes), takes up a lot of time and energy, plus i deal with various forms of mental health issues (REALLY bad anxiety and depression). Money is not an issue for my parents, and im sure they would give me some money if they knew i really needed it, but i feel extremely guilty asking for a small loan, since they already do so much for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats pretty much it. It may not seem like a big deal but even thinking about asking for help makes me feel like shit, because i feel as though at this point in my life i should be more independent. To provide more context, my parents already pay for my tuition, and apartment rent.  ",

      "description": "I’m a high school kid, so this might be petty, but bear with me. And sorry for formatting I’m on mobile.\n\nI started at a new school about a month and a half ago. According to a lot of my friends, girls find me really attractive, so a new attractive guy at school is really interesting for girls.\n\nAnyway, a ton of girls claim to like me, which doesn’t bother me or whatever because they have the right. I try to be nice to everyone and never hurt anyone’s feelings. \n\nThe other day, I asked out this girl who I think I really got a long with. She said she liked me, but she’d have to ask her friends about it first because there were some issues. I’ll call this girl Carly. I thought this was strange but I like her so I was fine with it.\n\nShe texts me later and says she can’t go out with me because her two friends also have crushes on me. One of them was my best friend from childhood (who I will call Jamie) who I hadn’t talk to in years until I came to this new school, and Carly didn’t tell me who the other was.I was shocked by this, but more shocked that Carly’s friends told her not to date me because of this. \n\nJamie and I were great friends in elementary school, until I went to private school. Now that I’m back at public school I thought we’d be able to pick up where we left of with no weird feelings or whatever, but I guess there are. I really value her friendship but this pisses me off.\n\nWIBTA For thinking that Jamie is selfish, and not wanting to talk to her anymore for this?",

      "description": "My (24f) sister is in her forties, she took voluntary redundancey from work when my neice was 5 (shes now 20) and hasn't worked since. \n\nI understand returning to work after so long is daunting, I can see she's anxious and scared. The only reason she's doing it now is because the money situation has gotten so bad that her partner can no longer support the both of them. \n\n I know she's deeply unhappy and getting a job would be so good for her. It would give her some financial security, confidence, social interactions again. I want more than anything for her to pick herself back up. \n\nI honestly feel for her and I've helped quite a bit. I wrote her CVs, I've written countless cover letters and helped with tons of job applications. She gets the job, works there for a week and finds a reason to quit. This has been going on for about a year. Its painful to watch.\n\nHelping her though, is so frustrating. I feel like she puts no effort into it herself. She will message me while I'm at work \"please will you write this cover letter for me, the application needs to go through today and youre better at this than me\". There will be a back and forth until I just drop what I'm doing and write it. \n\nI'm sick of it. I feel like there is no good reason why she can't do these things herself. She's a grown woman, she's by no means stupid, she's more than capeable of filling out an application or writing a cover letter. \n\nSo yesterday, she asked me to write another for her and I said no. I said \"I'm more than willing to sit down and help you write it, but I'm not going to just do it for you, you need to learn to do these things yourself\". \n\nNow my entire family think I'm out of order. They say the position she's in is really hard and we need to support her and that she's only asking for help. How is she ever going to hold down a job if she cant even apply for it herself. \n\nI feel like such an arsehole but I don't think doing whatever she asks because she finds it difficult is ultimately helping. What do you think?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "TLDR at bottom:  I’m 30 years old, married for 10 years with two kids.  A year ago my wife and I bought a home that didn’t pan out and we ended up financially in the hole.  Then we had our newborn and my wife quit working.  I stayed at my job for awhile before she decided to move to be closer to family.   I’d heard this story before.  “We’ll help you out.  Blah blah.”  I knew it wouldn’t happen but we moved and sold our home in order to have a support system.\n\nFast forward to now where her friend and her had a plan we’d all move in together.  That ended up not happening and now we’re living in squalor.  I took the first job I was offered, but I’m a disabled veteran from the military receiving a monthly check for disability and the physicality of this new job was too much for me.  I decided to resign due to the amount of pain I was in and I’ve scheduled a medical appointment for myself.\n\nI still receive my monthly check of nearly $1500 which is more than I get paid with this other company and helps us out financially.  She took her old job back and gets paid next to nothing despite additional responsibilities.  I’m still searching for something less physical while also trying to find us a place to live.\n\nAm I an asshole?\n\nTLDR: Quit my job due to physical limitations due to medical condition and aren’t bringing in extra income on top of disability check anymore because of it.  Wife is pissed and feels I’m not contributing.  Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Some context, I'm at my bf's a lot, to the point where I cook, clean, buy groceries, etc for them. I don't mind, because I always considered it my form of payment for staying over so much. Their mother is out of town for a few years due to work so I kind of took over as \"lady of the house\". I've also spoken to their mom and asked if she needed help with any of the bills, that I would be happy to take one of them off her plate (she got a pay cut recently) and she rejected me, saying that I've been doing enough.\n\nIn comes bf's brother, I'll be frank, I don't like him one bit. I think he's lazy, entitled, selfish, and incompetent. Not once, has he offered to pay for groceries, but he has no problem eating the ones I've bought. Not once has he helped me with any chores, despite being the one to complain about how dirty the house is. He honestly cannot do the simplest thing without asking how to do it (prolonged dealing with a claim on an accident because he couldn't bother to flip through the packet and sign the highlighted parts). He also asks me for rent because I'm over so much, even after bf has told him that I've spoken with their mom about that. He always says that he has school work to avoid helping around the house but we hear him playing games in his room (he's a yeller). And once, I worked in the morning, deep-cleaned the house, and was feeling hungry for not eating all day, I asked bf to pick me up something since he was out picking up his brother anyway. On the way back bf told brother that they were picking something up for me and brother asked \"Why?\" In the \"why the frick should we spend OUR money on HER\" way. My bf answered, \"You know, she does a lot for us, we can at least do this much and show our appreciation.\" To which brother said \"*I* DO appreciate her\" I kind of just rolled my eyes when my bf told me this. \n\nOne day, I'm chilling out because it's one of my rare days off of work and I thought I deserved it, so did my bf as he didn't really bug me and just let me relax. I call up a friend and ask her if she wanted to come over for dinner (I asked my bf beforehand and he said it was fine since it was only one friend). So she comes over and picks me up so I can buy some groceries. Before we leave bf's brother approaches me and says something like \"Hey since you're over so much, do you think you could maybe start paying rent?\" I'm kind of taken aback because my friend is right next to me and she knows that this has been a topic that we all thought was over. I kind of just look at my bf and my friend and walk out in shock.\n\nMy bf said that his brother wasn't too happy that I just walked away and called me rude for not replying, and saying that I SHOULD be paying rent because I'm over a lot and that I use their water/electricity. I do feel bad that I can't offer my help financially (bf refuses to take my money to use for bills no matter what) AITA?",

      "description": "Okay my family (mother, father, little sister) wanted to go eat out for some weeks now, we discussed many restaurants, but in the end my mom decided on a burger place. \n\nI had only heard about the place, that it is good, but definitely not a restaurant and more of a fast food place.\n\nOkay before I continue I have to say that I have gastritis, one part based on stress the other we don’t know yet, I have more doctor appointments in February. \n\nSo my parents get ready to leave and I tell them maybe it’s better to bring me the food rather than going with them, because I already had a light stomachache after some convincing I tag along. \n\nWe arrive and I tell them I don’t feel so good, the stomachache has gotten worse and the thing about my stomachaches is that I have to go the toilet, otherwise it just becomes worse overtime. \nThe place only has 3 tables for costumers to sit and no customer toilet, so pretty much my absolute nightmare. \n\nWe get ready to order and again I tell them that I don’t feel good and probably shouldn’t eat something, my pain will get worse. \nThey tell me to order anyways so I do. \n\nAfter some time (and my mother discussing with the „waiter“ which made everything worse), I ask if one of them could drive me home and take my food to go. \nThey complain „the food will be here any moment we can’t do that, go ask them if you can use their toilet“ which I absolutely didnt want. When I have these stomachaches they can take a long while on the toilet in bad cases and of course smell and so on. \n\nSo my father stands up goes up to the fucking counter and asks them if I can use their toilet. \n \nThey were so kind to say yes, but I was so fucking mad, I feel like my parents dont respect me or my wishes at all. \nSo I go to their toilet, well nothing happens because I feel really uncomfortable and join my parents again after 10 minutes. \nDidn’t eat anything, had a really bad mood the remainder of our stay. \n\nIf we were at a fancy restaurant (which would have had toilets thus eliminating most of the problems) or something I could have understood them not wanting to leave, or drive me back, but we were only at a fast food burger place.

      "description": "Gf moved in in January.  We've been dating since August.  When we agreed to move in I was over the moon about it.  Due to work I didn't get to spend nearly enough time with her.  It was a huge mistake though.\n\nShe's always been this awesome mix of sweet and sarcasm.  One of the funniest persons I've ever met and humor is my favorite trait in a person so I fell hard fast.  She was living with her parents, but being 24 it was not ideal for her.  So we talked and I invited her to move in.\n\nIt was like a switch flipped.  Right at the beginning I noticed a change in her personality.  The sweet part of her just seemed to disappear.  It's been nothing, but negativity.  I enjoy sarcasm, but when it's constant with no break it gets wearing.  There's also a ridiculous amount of complaining.  It's like she's miserable 24/7.  I'm not over stating it, if there's a few minutes of silence she will break it with the most asinine complaining.  She's also become really mean spirited.  The way she talks about her \"friends\" behind their backs just makes me feel bad for them as well as makes me wonder how she talks about me behind my back.\n\nI've tried talking to her about it a couple times, but it always ends in a fight.  The last time she kinda pouted and said that she just wouldn't talk at all then, and to be honest I wasn't mad at the prospect.   It didn't last very long though before she sarcastically asked me if she was allowed to talk yet.\n\nShe's just become such a pill to be around, it's draining.  I don't look forward to going home after work at all anymore, and I dread weekends.  I know if I tell her to pack up it's most likely the end of the relationship, but I honestly don't even know if that's a bad thing.  The only thing that's holding me back a little is that there's this shred of hope that the girl I fell so hard for is still in there and this is just some phase or something.  It's been less than two months, I haven't really given it a ton of time.  It just feels like it's been forever.",

      "description": "Me and a group of friends like to go see new movies together, like most friends. We’re all really close and these movies have been a good bonding point. It’s mainly Marvel and Star Wars and that sort of stuff. With Avengers Endgame coming up soon, we had plans to see that together for the longest time, obviously. Out of seemingly no where, my friend sends a text in the group chat that she has invited her dad to see it with us, and to get 4 tickets instead of 3 (I’m the one who gets tickets bc I’m the one who really cares about seeing it in a good format) This really rubbed me the wrong way. First of all, it made me upset she would make such a decision without consulting us, and instead of asking, she told. Secondly, I just really don’t want her dad to go. It’ll be awkward. Seeing my most anticipated movie ever with some 40+ year old guy that I barely know doesn’t sound fun to me. It’s not so much that this is a “sacred” thing, but I just know I’ll be uncomfortable. She can’t seem to understand why, which also kind of upsets me. She says that she feels bad because her dad likes seeing movies with her, but she’s always seeing them with us, which is completely understandable! But I don’t get why they can’t go see it just them two, or go another time all together. They saw Solo together, so I don’t get why this is any different. She seems upset and annoyed, but I don’t think I should have to apologize or feel bad. I don’t want to see it with her dad, and I’ve explained that I’m okay seeing it by myself, and that they can go without me. ",

      "description": "My brother and his ex wife recently went through a messy divorce. They stayed together through the last few years because of their kids. Once their kids grew up they decided to split and it was rather nasty. \n\nMy dad recently passed away and I was tasked with putting the program together. Now I was having a hard time finding a picture with the whole family in it, but I finally found a good one. The only problem was it had my brother's ex wife in it. I decided to quickly photoshop her out (it wasn't my best work I'll admit). Noone cared at the funeral so I figured it wasn't a big deal. \n\nLater my brother showed the program to his kids who couldn't make it to the funeral. One of them got furious and the other cried when they noticed their mom had been photoshopped out of the picture. I did it so my brother wouldn't have to be reminded of her but was I wrong? AITA?",

But I didn't know people felt this strongly about it. \n\nToday I was cycling omw to the store, a street I had to go through was blocked by several cars. No biggie right? Just take the sidewalk, there was nobody there anyway. As I turn the corner there is this man walking, I wanted to pass him so I could take a slope down back to the road. So I slow down. The man looks me straight in the eye and stops, making himself big and blocking the road. Now I have no way to turn and have to stop as well.\n\nHe starts yelling that I should be on the road, I try to explain to him that the road was blocked and I had to take the sidewalk for a short bit. He doesn't care and starts getting super in my face. This scared me so I started yelling back that he needed to calm down and if he could please move. He doesnt do either. I eventually turn around so I can go down the sidewalk regularly (bad for my tires but this dude was going to punch me or some shit). I am visibly upset and as I am on the road he starts yelling again because he thought I swore, i didnt. As I cycle off he tells me to take the right medicine next time.\n\nCould I have handled it differently?",

      "title": "AITA for not looking for the original owners of a lost cat?",
      "description": "Throwaway just in case.  I moved in to the neighborhood I'm currently living in about 3 months ago.  From the get go I noticed a pretty cat around the neighborhood.  I just assumed he belonged to one of the neighbors, but I noticed on several occasions how far of a range I would spot him at.  The thought \"Wow, they really let their cat wander\" definitely ran through my head a few times.  On top of that, I would see him out in the middle of the night, or when it's been really cold out recently, like below freezing.  There's a pack of coyotes that make their presence known at night here, and I am super strict with not letting my own cat out past dark lest she gets picked off by them or an owl.\n\nSo a few days ago, someone posted on our local Nextdoor that a cat had been living in their window box for a few days, and could the owners please claim him.  The picture they post looks exactly like this pretty cat I've seen.  After no one stepped up, a few people suggested taking him to the shelter and that's when I got the urge to act.  A few years ago I rescued my own cat from almost being euthanized at a shelter for developing kennel stress and becoming \"unadoptable\" - so I hate the thought of this cat going to a shelter.  So I volunteer to the guy to foster him in my basement short term while I personally search for the owners.\n\nSo I've had this cat in my basement for 2 days now.  He's heavily flea infested (which I am treating), STARVING with bones protruding out like he hasn't seen regular meals in weeks.  I can't help but wonder if he was abandoned, not lost.  I've thought about all the times I've seen him out in the cold already, or really far from wherever his home was.  3 months now I've been seeing him.\n\nAnd, I gotta admit I've fallen kind of in love, as he's nothing but constant love and affection.  He seems 100% content, shows no interest in going outside.\n\nAnd so here is my conundrum.  I already feel so protective over this cat.  I completely adore him already.  I keep having images in my head of reuniting him with his owners, then him going back to a crappy and dangerous situation.  Part of me wants to totally change course and never look for the original owners and keep him.  On the other hand, I feel like keeping him would be potentially stealing someone's baby.  I have lost cats before and I know how heart-wrenching and painful it is to not know if your little furry one is ok, safe, alive, etc.   There is no closure until you either find it or find out what happened.  Would I be creating that horrible situation for someone else?\n\nI am trying to piece together as much information as I can to determine his background, and I just don't know.  All I know is that he's been out openly wandering my neighborhood for the last 3 months in the shitty cold.\n\nSo yeah, AITA for considering just keeping this cat and ensuring his care and safety at the risk of keeping him from his potential original owners?\n",

      "description": "Last night, I was cramming for a test in the morning. I was facetiming my long-term girlfriend (temporarily long distance) at that time while finishing up a practice problem, and I decided I was too tired to focus so I would take a 20 minute nap.\n\nMy girlfriend decided that she would wake me up from my nap instead of how I normally wake up by using an alarm on my phone. About 20 minutes has passed, and I am fast asleep (so I was told), and my girlfriend had been trying to wake me up. She talked really loudly through the facetime, pulled out her laptop to play an annoying alarm sound, etc. but nothing worked. She started to worry because I didn't set any alarms at all, and there was a chance I sleep through the entire morning and miss my midterm.\n\nTherefore, she texts a couple of my roommates to come and wake me up. My roommate tried to wake me up for a few minutes by banging on my locked door and making noise, and ended up waking up the other roommates, but not me. oof. So now, my gf really starts panicking and feeling bad about this whole situation, but there isn't really much more she can do at this point, so she goes to bed herself. Luckily for myself, I wake up at 5:30AM and go back to studying.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't a big deal. Now, my girlfriend and I were talking about the whole fiasco later today, having a good laugh about it, and talking about how stressed and annoyed she was that I just was not able to wake up. She mentioned that, if I still didn't get up in the morning that my roommate said he could try to just break my door down in the morning. I figured a broken door is definitely better than missing my test so I had no problem with her suggesting that option to my roommate.\n\nHowever, in this hypothetical situation, she said she wouldn't pay for the door being fixed, which caught me off guard. Her reasoning is that she tried everything she could to wake me up, so ultimately she holds no responsibility for the situation. She literally said she would not even deserve 1% of the blame for this whole thing since it was my fault I was unable to wake up.\n\nI think that I shouldn't have to pay for it because it was her word and her responsibility to wake me up since she was the one who said she would wake me, and that I specifically do not need to set an alarm. I understand her frustration in her saying she did everything she could, but I don't think trying your hardest or doing everything you can = not taking any responsibility if the task that you were supposed to achieve ultimately didn't work. Like that type of thinking would get you fired from your job, results still matter.\n\n**Therefore...AITA for thinking that she should pay for the hypothetical broken door and take at least some of the responsibility?**\n\nPS: I even said I wouldn't mind 50/50 because I get she tried her best, and that counts for something in my book, but saying she doesn't deserve any blame at all seems like a stretch.",

The problem is, I currently feel like it'll completely overwhelm my schedule. \nI'm a homeschooled senior, but I still have an online full-time course load, with band practice, gym, and flying lessons (which I'm pursuing as a career) on top of that, and I really don't have any free time during the week. From their point of view, they see me on my computer for 6-8 hours a day, and associate it with me goofing off/gaming. Because of this, they've always piled my schedule up with a ton of extracurricular activities, which made me absolutely miserable. (This contributed to a hospitalization for personal reasons in 2015, when I was 15.) \n\nThis year, I managed to get rid of some of the extracurricular activities, with the main one being tennis, which was around 10 hours a week. While this has helped a ton with my mental health and my grades, my parents aren't too happy about it, and they've told me that because of this, they want me to get a job. Now, I have absolutely nothing against getting a job. I've worked a summer job at a restaurant for the past 4 years, so the idea of me getting a job/working isn't one I'm worried about. The problem I'm having is that they want me to get one right now, just to completely fill me schedule. \n\nThey know that I am going to be working full time this summer, and that I want to get said job. I've tried talking to them about letting me finish up school, which are going to be wrapping up in 3 months, but they constantly say that my schedule needs to be completely filled. They constantly talk about how they when they were younger, they had both school and jobs, and they were completely fine, but from my point of view, I'm not them, and I can't really tolerate that kind of 24/7 schedule.\n\nOver the past week, we've been fighting a lot over this. Anytime I try and talk to them about it, they pretend to be understanding, but then completely ignore anything I'm saying, and our conversations go nowhere. They constantly say that if I don't get a job, they're going to kick me out, (I'm 18, they can.), which will prevent me from going to college this fall due to being homeschooled. \n\nHonestly, I don't know what to think about either myself or my parents anymore, and I feel like there's nothing I can do. The only thing I want to do is finish up my school before I put anything else on my plate. \n\nTL:DR AITA for wanting to wait 3 months to finish up my classes/activities before I get a job?",

I’ve been without a father my whole life and at this point don’t need one or want to have one. My mom is very upset with me and I don’t understand why, am I being irrational?",

      "description": "Honestly not sure if this goes here or in an advice sub. If it doesn't belong here, let me know where it would be most appropriate and I'll take it there. I just figured that since I'm personally conflicted on whether or not it's an a-hole move, then there's no harm in seeing what the judges of this sub think.\n\n* I'm 25yo, unemployed, and don't plan on going to college for mental and financial reasons. I live with my dad, rent-free, and earn money by doing housekeeping chores and making sure my younger siblings (all still in school) don't die. I'm well aware that I'm lucky I have such a decent living situation considering my age and lack of future planning, and that it's all because my dad loves his kids too much to just kick them out on the street.\n* The pay system in our household is simple; you do your chores every day all week (save for days where you're literally \"i'm vomiting\" sick), you get paid. No exceptions. Chore allowance is $20, but I make an extra $30 for the babysitting. So, I make at least $30 a week regardless of whether I keep up with the housekeeping or not as long as, again, none of my siblings die.\n* I'll be the first to admit I'm not the most consistent when it comes to the housekeeping I'm supposed to do. I suffer from depression that was diagnosed but never properly treated and most days I just don't have the motivation to get up and do anything at all, but I always make a point to at least get the dishes done so we can all eat. I also try to get my siblings to do their chores so my dad doesn't wake up (he works nights, so he sleeps most of the day) to a pigsty, but for the last couple months, they've been infuriatingly neglectful of them.\n* We have four pets (three turtles that share a tank and one snake) that are classified as family pets though the snake is technically my brother's because he's the one that caught it (Dad's rule is that if you catch it, you can keep it as long as it's within reason; apartment rules allow for cage critters, so Dad allowed it). As family pets, everyone has to pitch in and make sure they're all cared for; even my Dad, who does his part by making sure there's always food for them and changing the turtle water monthly when the filters just aren't enough to keep it clean anymore.\n* Normally, I wouldn't even consider asking to be paid for their care, but as I mentioned before, my siblings are really stubborn about chores. That includes animal care. That leaves me as the only active caretaker of them and, frankly, I don't actually consider them *my* pets. No one consulted me about bringing them in. They just showed up and I see it more as pet-sitting on my part and I've started thinking that if I'm going to be only one of the kids that takes care of the animals, then I might as well get paid for it.\n\nSo, would I be an a-hole if I asked my dad to add the animal care to my official chore list or am I within reason?",

We put in a lot of work, and we ended up with one of the, if not the, highest marks in class. I'm not trying to brag, but it was a massive endeavour and I was glad when it was done. \n\nFast forward 6 months, and I receive an ail from the school saying that I had won an award for our major research project, donated by a prominent market research firm in the area. It looked a little sketchy (wasn't formatted correctly, things looked out of place, etc), so I emailed back and did some googling. I verified it with the awards coordinator, and on the school site. Both the awards coordinator and the school site listed the prize amount as $1000. \n\nAgain fast forward to the awards ceremony. Huge plaque, lots of handshaking, I thank the donors, etc. I check the cheque when I get home and it's $666, not $1000. I know this is a total money grab, and it's not even that much, but it just seems very strange. \n\nWIBTA for checking that this amount is correct? ",

      "description": "Me and my older brother are in business together, though he is pretty much understood to be in charge. \n\nHe frequently takes me to restaurants and clubs to meet clients. I find these boring but I so enjoy socializing and having a few drinks.\n\nOne of these clients is an old guy, pushing 70, with a smoking hot young wife. Shes about my age so I let my brother talk to him while I talk/flirt with her. Its usually playful and she and me both enjoy it. Her husband never says anything.\n\nSo one night we're all in the club in a booth and the husband wants to go home, but the wife wants to stay and dance a bit. I say I'll drive her home later and he agrees. So after he leaves she asks me to dance with her and it gets pretty heated with a lot of touching and grinding. \n\nAs we go back to our booth she has me sit next to her and she places her hand on my thigh, while I do the same to her. She then asks me why im so energetic tonight, I reply that im always energetic when I see her.\n\nShe then says she'd like to see how much energy I have, and I tell her if I ever get her into a locked room id show her that and then some. At this point my brother asks to see me, and tells me to stay away from her the rest of the night. He drives her home and I end up taking an uber home. I am obviously pissed off he embarrassed me like that but it gets worse.\n\nThe next day when I show up to meet my brother he says I was an asshole last night and that he would kill me if I ever did that again. He also said that id be lucky if the wife kept her mouth shut and her husband didn't have me killed. \n\nA few things. My brother like I said is nominally in charge but I am also part owner, and two I am the main reason why my brother is as successful as he is through the things that ive done for him. I am also the top earner in our business. \n\nI tell him hes out of line for saying that to me and that it was all harmless fun, and that I didnt actually fuck her or anything. On top of that she would never tell her husband, but even if she did he does not scare me.\n\nHe tells me to just go home for the day which I do. Am I the asshole for flirting with a clients wife despite never sleeping with her?",

      "description": "My ex and I of almost 2 years got together and talked about our relationship and what went wrong. At many times during the relationship I put a lot of blame on her and it wasn't until this discussion she threw it all back and made me rethink everything. Want to know your opinions. \n\nI met this girl at her senior year of HS at our work (I was a junior). Ever since I started talking to her on a more regular basis, I realized her and her close friends hang out a lot. Not that its a bad thing but it's usually about 5x a week. I never made her choose her friends over me because I thought that would be the a**hole thing to do. So 6 months goes by and all is well. She leaves for college 6 hours away and we agreed to make it work. I'd visit about once a month for a weekend and it worked out. On any breaks she was home, I was hoping to see her as often as I can because obvi missed her and etc but she usually got me with the \"my friends and I have something planned, what about ____ day?\" I swallowed being pushed aside and accepted it since she hasn't seen her friends and I drive up once a month. \n\nA year and a half in and its Summer time, I'm working and trying to balance my social life while prepping for school as well as spend time with her, but eventually got frustrated when it felt like my life revolved around hers. I was constantly being told which days I was able to see her and put pressure on me to hang out with her those days. After expressing my frustration of not being able to see her as much as I'd like, I got hit with the, \"I don't see my friends while I'm at school and you drive up. It balances out\". I knew this was unfair but as I tried to make her happy I accepted it and moved on with my day. Summer ended and she went back to school, other problems arose but got dealt with. \n\nWinter break came and I saw her the first few days she was back. I thought how she came to my POV of spending time until it slapped me in the face and didn't see her at all when the rest of her friends came back. I saw her about 2 days a week and almost every time, she would tell me she'd have to leave at __o'clock because her friends have a thing she wants to go to. After again bringing this up, it was brushed aside and I didn't want to fight it since I just wanted to have a blissful time while I can. \n\nThe last straw was when it was my grandmothers birthday. It was only 30 minutes away and dinner was to start at 6pm. We agreed to drive together with my mother because it would be easy transportation. She showed up at my house at 6:15 apologizing for running late because she lost track of time with her friends. I just let it go because I didn't want drama at my grandmothers dinner party. I knew we would be home before 9 I accepted plans with my friends to hang out with that night (Honestly thinking she would leave me at that time anyways). After getting home and telling her this, she breaks down at me for leaving her on a night we could spend together. We fought and I eventually caved and told my friends I won't be going over. Upset at the whole situation and the past month, called a break a few days later and eventually broke it off.\n\nTL;DR- GF would constantly brush me aside to hang out with her friends. I did my best to accommodate until I had enough and eventually broke things off\n\nSo AITA for wanting more time with me if it meant sacrificing it for her friends? Or was I expecting too much?\n\nSorry I left out tiny details. I felt this story was long enough \n\n",

      "description": "i found this [twitter account](https://twitter.com/kittycataddy) a month ago and thought she posted some decent content. also thought she was p cute. but then i discovered that she was a girl from the css community back in 2012 and mysteriously disappeared in 2014. she had a lot of problems and controversy surrounding her. she had anger management problems, cheated with other people's partners and spouses, and even rumored to have personality disorders which led to her being a compulsive liar and victim player.\n\nI tried to reach out and keep an open mind that maybe this girl had changed. cause it was years ago since she did those things. immediately when i confronted her about it via social media she started to get all rude and condescending about it and blocked me. this shows me that she is immature in handling that situation. i try to message her another way 2 weeks later asking how she is doing and on her progress to recovery (which she talks about often in her social media), again instant blocked. if she wants to help herself that's fine, but she acts more like a hypocrite shutting people down.\n\na couple of my friends were heartbroken by her but they still want her to get better even if they are afraid to talk to her. So am i being an absolute ass trying to get this girl to realize that she is not really helping herself and is still being a rude and toxic individual. that was one of the biggest controversies about her when she was banned in her region for a temporary time about being a toxic individual and inability to be a decent human being.\n\ni want more people to help me with this and help her realize she isn't getting the proper help and that all her preaching about self-care and help isn't doing any good when she still tweets and makes social media posts that shows her being all nutty and inability to handle her emotions like her [tumblr](https://kittycataddy.tumblr.com).\n\nanyway am i the asshole for just trying to bring this to her attention&gt;? and i wish more people could help me but they are all too afraid of her",

      "description": "tldr at the bottom\n\nLast year we got an allotment offer after a 3 year wait, it was late in the season and totally overgrown but we paid and took it. It was a lot of hard work for my partner and I to get it to a state of planting but we knew it'd be worth it as we don't have a garden and are limited to how much we can grow on windowsills. \nThe allotment has about 100 plots on a gated site, ours is on the smaller side, tucked away right at the back corner so we only border 2 plots and woodland on the other side of the fence.\n\nWe managed to get some strawberries and other bits in, and moved our in-door grown chili plants out to great success.\nA month or so later we started noticing our strawberries were ripening, but every time we came back to harvest/maintain the allotment they were suddenly gone.\n\nSo it could be birds - we haven't netted our plants - but the missing strawberries look cleanly picked off, not the missing bits and pieces we've seen on our other produce.\nSuddenly the signs plastered up around the site about 'petty theft' started to make sense when my partner went over there one afternoon and while working spotted 2 kids (about 10-11) walking down the path to our corner. They got halfway down, spotted him, and turned around. \nHe later saw the kids over the other side of the site on a plot with presumably their parents. He dismissed it and thought they probably wouldn't chance it again. \n\nUnfortunately we didn't get a single strawberry out of our 8 plants last year. Everytime we went to harvest they were all gone. The association that runs the site hasn't been that helpful as we can't prove who it was, and petty theft is a thing among allotment owners apparently.\n\nSo this year, we've got chocolate habanero plants on the grow, and since we're planning on using the strawberries for chili jams, WIBTA if we started rubbing chili on our unripened strawberries? \nWe're thinking that it'd give the thieves a shock and deter them, but at the same time we're sure the culprits are kids and we're unsure about this.\nWe've had no luck speaking to the parents, and haven't seen them since that first time or my partner would've said something.\nTo clarify, we've got no problem if the thieves turn out to be adults.\n\ntldr: WIBTA if I cover our unriped strawberries in chilli to deter kids from stealing them?",

      "description": "I'm worried the title is misleading so I'll explain.\n\nWe had to head out of town on short notice and couldn't board our dog for irrelevant reasons. We asked a friend who also has a dog to watch ours for a few days and they were okay with it. Our dogs have played together a lot and always seemed to get along, though they play rough on occasion.\n\nWhen we picked him up they said they got along great the first two days but their dog got a little territorial the third day and got more rough, so they separated the dogs the rest of the day. Fine... we know dogs can get that way. We were only concerned that he was overly lethargic and skittish, but we figured he was just exhausted from running and playing all weekend.\n\nWhen we got home we noticed some huge bite marks on his neck and hip, and his neck had a massive swollen bump. I called my friend to ask if they got in a fight and he said they did - his dog bit mine and attacked him pretty hard, so they broke it up and locked theirs in a room til we picked ours up.\n\nWe had a vet friend check him out and they said he was in kind of rough shape, but as long as swelling didn't get worse he'd be okay. His swelling went down overnight so we're relieved, but he's still lethargic and we noticed more bite marks. Fortunately none are punctures.\n\nAnyway, it sounds like they're at fault, but the reason I'm asking who the asshole is, they were doing us a favor by watching our dog. The dogs have always played fine in the past. And I understand their dog can be an asshole - we knew that before asking them. However I'm irritated they didn't flat out tell us he attacked mine until I called to ask. If something happened to rack up a huge vet bill, I'd be pissed. And if he died for whatever reason, we would be absolutely devastated.\n\nTldr: a friend watched our dog for free, their dog attacked ours, and they didn't tell us until we asked what happened. Fortunately our dog is okay, albeit in rough shape and a little jumpy/on edge now.",

I told them the reason he told me he laid me off, and I asked them to double check. \n\nI was talking about this to my mother, and she told me this was rude and cruel because he has a family, but he has intentionally went out of his way to make my job hell.

Sometimes people aren't sure if I'm joking around or being serious and the coworker in question has a habit of getting offended over really minuscule things (in my opinion).\n\nAnyway, today during a coffee break I pointed to my coworker's \"fashionably distressed\" jeans and told her that she had a rip in her pants. She then begun a story about how her dad bought some expensive pants and was ironing them and found a rip in them. Her dad then started ranted and raving about how there was a rip until someone pointed out that the rip was part of the style. This was the conversation that followed (as close to exact as I can remember):\n\nMe: What did your dad do after being told that the rip was meant to be there? (I think people's reactions to finding out they were wrong can be interesting)\n\nHer (can't remember this part too well but basically she didn't answer the question so I repeated it)\n\nHer: How am I supposed to know? I wasn't there\n\nMe: Well you were told about the reaction to the rip, maybe you were told about the reaction to finding out it was intentional?\n\nHer: Why are you giving me a hard time?\n\nMe: I'm not! I'm asking a genuine question.\n\nHer: Good luck getting me to come down for coffee again (and then just started talking to someone else)\n\nI tried to defend myself but that never works very well because my coworkers are more than happy to just see the worst in me sometimes. I then retreated to my phone for a bit but was so worked up that I just left and went home.\n\nI'm pretty confident that I wasn't being an asshole, but is there any chance that I was? AITA?",

      "description": "Hi! This is my first post so sorry if it’s not long enough or if it’s too long!\n\nA little background information: My grandparents are my legal guardians since my father is a bipolar drug addict and my mother is just not fit to be a parent. I am openly transgender (ftm) and when I get misgendered it makes me feel horrible.\n\nMy Nana likes to play Bridge and Mahjong with a bunch of her friends and their friends and usually I stay out of their way because I’m usually taking a nap because my Narcolepsy makes it almost impossible to stay away for more than 10 hours. But I was hungry so I went downstairs. \nThey were set up in two tables and they would rotate turns on who plays with who. My Grandmother was sitting next to her best friend (Let’s call her V). V knows about me mostly because she’s taken care of me a lot and watched me transition. V waves at me and says hello, and she uses my preferred name. Some other ladies look over and I recognize them after seeing them once or twice before and they smile. \n“Who is this pretty girl?” One says and my heart drops. \nMy Nana looks up and says “That’s my granddaughter.” But she still uses my preferred name. \nThis isn’t the first time it’s happened. \nAfter her game night I confront her cautiously because she tends to get offended very easily. I ask why she hasn’t told them about me. I am probably visibly upset but she holds no emotions. She tells me it’s my job to tell her friends that I am a boy. \nI was taken aback. I countered back by saying that they were her friends and I don’t know them. I tried to tell her how bad it makes me feel everytime I hear them call me “she” or “girl” etc. but she says that it’s my transition and that I should tell them. \nAITA for wanting my grandmother to tell her friends and be open about me being a boy?\n\nTLDR; My grandmother keeps my transition a secret from her friends and refuses to tell them even when I am openly trans.",

      "description": "Firstly a bit of backstory:\n - my parents have been separated for several years now and we've all come to accept it. At first, I was terrified that I would never see my dad again (it wouldn't be the first time, more on that in a bit.) However, my parents defied the odds and remained friends, despite all of their hardships. \n - Now, my dad is definately not the man my mum married nearly 20 years ago now, and that's partly due to his deteriorating mental and physical health. His head has dissapeared up his arse, to put it bluntly. \n - When my parents split up, my dad moved out and he lives on his own in a flat that's not that far from us, like a 20 minute walk. Me and my 3 younger siblings stayed with our mum and he would come round pretty much every day to see us all.\n - Also, this needs to be mentioned for context. He's not my 'real' dad. He adopted me in 2003 shortly after he married my mum. For all intents and purposes, I'm going to refer to him as my 'dad' and my biological father as 'sperm donor' (because that's what he is, you'll find out why shortly.)\n - Another bit of context: recently, I got my first tattoo and it was a lot to do with my dad. I got my surname and the date that he adopted me, giving me that surname. He came with me when I got it done and noe its there forever.\n\nHeres where my dilemma comes in. I love both my parents. I have a really close relationship with my mum and I used to feel like I could go to her with anything until recently. I also love my dad and I feel like our relationship strengthened when he provided me with much needed support when my sperm donor fucked off. From when I was about 11, until I was 16, I had a relationship with him, but then one day he suddenly up and deserted me, giving me little other reason than he didn't agree with some of my life choices (I have my head shaved on one side, I was bisexual and I had a girlfriend at the time.)\nMy dad helped me a lot when this happened and I was so glad he was there for me, considering my parents had split up a few years prior.\n\nRecently, I feel like my relationship with my mum has been going downhill, and it may be partly to do with the fact that her and my dad arent on speaking terms at the moment. This has happened a few times but every time, its only lasted like a week, and then they start talking again. They haven't spoken since Christmas. Christmas day was the last time he was round at our house. My mum is on a shorter fuse lately, and i feel like that's because of his deteriorating health. Shes said to me several times that she thinks he's being selfish because he's not doing anything about his health for the sake of his kids. He'll be on deaths door soon if he doesnt do something and she thinks he should try for his kids. But he'd terrified. He's been told he has 18 months to live (I'm not going to go into details as to why.) that was a hard blow to all of us, him most of all. He doesn't know what to do with this news so the best thing he figures to do is not think about it. But that's not gonna make it go away. \n\nI feel like I've been drifting away from my mum and gravitating more towards my dad, even though I can completely see both sides of it. But every time my mum rants about what a useless prick my dad is, it makes me wonder if getting my tattoo was the right decision. Rather than being angry, I want to try and make the most of the time I have left with my dad.\n\nTL;DR: my parents have been split up for years now and my dads health is deteriorating. He was given 18 months to live which made my mum angry because she thinks he should try and do something about it for his kids. I got a tattoo to commemorate my dad adopting me but I'm starting to feel weird about it because my mum has fallen out with him. I also feel like I'm drifting away from my mum and towards my dad, but I feel like this is wrong, given the circumstances.\n\nSo, am I an asshole for choosing sides between my parents?",

Lately they want to hang out all the time and they get upset when I turn down most plans. \n\nI hate it and I wish we would fight badly so I never had to see them again. I don’t hate them, I just hate having to make time for them when I’m already so busy with school, work, and taking care of my disabled father. \n\nI don’t get any “me-time” because they want to hang on my day off from school and work, which is the same day my father has long physical therapy sessions. Meaning the only time I can truly just sit and rest is the same time my friend wants to plan activities for us. \n\nSometimes we’ll plan something after I’m off work, but I work long hours and I have to cook, clean, and study. So I’m often too tired.\n\nAITA for not wanting to see my friend at all?

      "description": "My wife and I got the new IPhones a couple months ago and we financed them by applying for a credit card at the apple store that we have 18months to pay off before the interest kicks in. Today my wife texts me that my brother in law wants to get a new IPhone as well, and wants to use the credit card we got at the store. We’ve let her parents borrow money many times and they’ve always made sure to pay back in a timely manner so I have no issues lending money to them. Her brother on the other hand is a different case. He makes good money, and is basically living off of his parents. He blows his money on whatever he wants and doesn’t pay rent, he only pays the internet bill and complains about that. He’s 25 btw. Anyways, when I asked her why doesn’t he just apply for the credit card there himself she said that his answer was that “he didn’t want to worry about a monthly payment”. But yet, I’m supposed to be able to count on you to pay me back monthly? That makes no fucking sense to me. I told my wife no, that he can get his own card there and pay it off himself. He’s a grown man who still lives with his parents and should be no ones financial responsibility. My wife kind of brushed me off like I’m being cheap or an asshole but I don’t trust him and don’t want to be stuck paying for his phone because u never know, he can lag on payments or just not pay me at all. I don’t want to be stuck paying off another $900 phone. AITA? ",

      "description": "Might be kinda long I apologize.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years and he hasn’t met my parents yet because of my own personal issues with them. \n\nAbout a month ago I asked my boyfriend to marry me he said yes but in the condition that he gets to meet my parents beforehand. I don’t want him to meet them and when I told him this it blew up into massive argument with him yelling at me and questioning why I’m keeping a big part of my life a secret from him (it’s not as big as he thinks it is but more on that later) and kicking me out of our apartment so he has time to think about our relationship.\n\nNow a little backstory about my boyfriend, he’s a great guy the nicest person I ever met in my life and he gave me the time of day when I was at a point in my life where the sun never shined after getting discharged from the military for suicidal ideation. He was the most beautiful person I’ve ever met and made the few months I would see him walking around my college campus worth it and mean something. \n\nThe thing about my boyfriend is his specific quirk I’ll call it. It’s a harmless thing and it helps him feel more comfortable in his own skin. My boyfriend is small 5’2 to be exact with feminine features he said he never looked like a boy and that caused him great distress as a kid but he never felt that he wasn’t a boy. So his quirk is that he dresses up in feminine clothing dresses, high heels the whole nine yards and he looks amazing breathtaking completely phenomenal. When we first met I was already gay but confused why I was so insanely attracted to this woman only for him to tell me months later that he was actually a he in women’s clothing. But that’s an entirely different story.\n\nSo we began dating and things were perfect he lived his life to the fullest without regret and it was perfect. I rarely if ever talked about my past before meeting him. He knows about my suicidal thoughts and that I was discharged because of it but he doesn’t know the reason why I had those thoughts he respected my privacy about it and didn’t pry which I was thankful for.\n\nNow backstory on my parents. They hated that I was gay. When I came out at 16 they all but cut me off I still lived with them and didn’t really have anywhere else to go. I was abused relentlessly emotionally and physically I have scars on my body from cigarette burns and getting hit with objects like bats, metal rods all of that. I was a gay kid in a very rural and very religious part of Georgia so not only was I getting abused at home but also out on the streets and school. My only way out was to join the military and I did I left Georgia and my parents and never looked back for the next 6 years. My suicidal thoughts started at around 17 and when I joined the army I thought it would get better but it didn’t it got worse until I was discharged at 20.\n\nBy this time I was in contact with an aunt who found out what happened to me at my hometown and offered me a place to live for as long as I wanted while I get my life on track. So I move in with her in L.A. and then that’s where I met my boyfriend.\n\nSo now my boyfriend doesn’t know anything about my abuse when I came out and I don’t want him to because I don’t want him to think of me as damaged goods and boy am I damaged. I know that if I did introduce my boyfriend to my parents they would only hurl insults at him being a man in a dress and how much of an f-word he is and my boyfriend could dress in men’s clothes but I know how uncomfortable that is for him so I don’t want him to deal with any of that in my eyes I dealt with enough of that for the two of us and more. My aunt is still in contact with her sister (my mother) and she could set up a meeting between all of us so it’s possible.\n\nBut my question is am I the asshole for keeping my past a secret and from protecting him from the shit show that is my parents?",

      "description": "I had to do an activity for class with these two guys. It involved having to run back and forth. While we were deciding who was going to run, one of them goes like 'Can you even run? Like are you physically able to?\"\n\nI knew it was a joke but I got pretty annoyed so I retaliated lightly, \"Fuck you, of course I can.\" It wasn't too serious, I smiled and everything, we were friends after all. It just grated my nerves because it felt like they were belittling me.\n\nBut then they started making fun of 'my feminism' throughout the activity even though it was not my intent. \"Whoa, such a strong feminist.\"\n\nAfterwards, we had to sit down and translate something relating to the activity. I did the translation because they were the ones to run back and forth, and it wasn't fair if I barely did anything.\n\nThey asked me if I needed any help. I said \"No it's okay, I'll write, you guys ran.\" However, they took this opportunity again to make a fragile feminist joke, saying, \"What, just because we're guys? That's not fair to assume we can't write and can just run.\" \n\nAt this point, I was just trying to calm down and look at it from their point of view. Clearly, it was a joke but it was fucking annoying when they kept rubbing it in. I was just fuming on my seat, ignoring them because I was trying not to snap.\n\nThey kept up a conversation of how guys should have a word for a men's version of a feminist. \n\nLater in the day, I had one of them for class again. We were passing papers to the class together. I finished up early but he still had a stack so I offered to get half so we can continue class already. He went like, \"It's fine, I'm independent.\"\n\nMaybe I was just jumping to conclusions but it rubbed me off the wrong way like he was trying to make fun of the \"strong, independent woman archetype.\" Maybe I was just too uptight and can't take a joke.\n\nI glared at him and fumed back in my seat. When he passed a paper to me, I snapped and took the chance to explain myself, albeit expressing my irritation, on how I didn't mean to \"express my 'feminism', how I was just pissed off because it felt like they were personally belittling me.\" \n\nHis expression changed to an annoyed one and he replied with, \"Well, we were just joking and I hope you know that.\"\n\nDo I just have a stick up my ass?",

      "description": "My husband and I have been living in the same apartment complex for about four years now. Last summer, someone new moved in upstairs from us. This person plays an electric guitar. Over time, the amount of time they play has gone up a lot. The thing is, this person has their amp turned up. Way up. They also have an annoying habit of never finishing a song. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've talked to the apartment complex staff, who have just kind of shrugged and said 'yeah, they can use their space however they want'. We've tried to talk to the neighbor (who conveniently is never home when we've gone up there, even if we can hear them playing). It's usually during the day when they're being their loudest, though there have been a few incidents where it's late at night when they start playing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing that complicates this - I'm pregnant and due next month. We can't afford to move right now, because of the baby expenses. I really don't want to have to deal with the guitar playing waking the baby up. Since we've tried talking to the neighbor and we've tried talking to the complex management, this leaves calling the cops for noise complaints. We know it's the nuclear option, but frankly I don't see another way around it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: upstairs neighbor plays electric guitar very loudly, and I'm pregnant and don't want them waking the baby up, WIBTA for calling in a noise complaint on them?

      "description": "Sorry in advance, this is kind of a long story. \n\nSo Friday night, my boyfriend spent the night with the intention of us spending the day together Saturday morning because I didn’t have work and he didn’t have to be at his job until 5. Fast forward to Saturday morning at 10am. I wake up to him gathering his things and about to walk out the door. Super confused, I ask him to come talk to me about what’s bothering him. He tells me he doesn’t feel like spending all day watching me sleep. Still confused, I asked him what he’s talking about. He told me he woke up hours ago and went and sat in the living room for 2 hours waiting for me to join him (which I obviously was unaware of because I was asleep) and that he tried to wake me up (which I have no recollection of). I asked him how I responded when he tried to wake me up and he said I laughed which is something I tend to do when people talk to me while I’m sleeping. \n\nAnyways, he’s going on and on about how he didn’t want to spend all day lying in bed while I slept and how he needed to go to the bank to deposit a check (bank closes at 12, possibly relevant) so eventually I told him to go if that’s what he wanted to do, and that I couldn’t make him want to hang out with me. His response to this was calling me a “pitiful whipped puppy” and told me that I was manipulating him by trying to use sympathy to “win” an argument. \n\nI told him that saying that to me was one of the most hurtful things someone has ever said to me and he said “I’m sorry for being so blunt, but I won’t apologize for saying that because I meant it”, and then asked me “how come every time I [he] gets upset, it ends up with you [me] curled up in a ball and me consoling you?” And then he told me he loved me and left. \n\nAfter he left I texted him and told him that if he wanted to come back and talk more I’d really appreciate it because I didn’t like the way we left things. So he comes back an hour later and he’s basically a different person. He started holding me and telling me he loves me and telling me he hates when I’m so sad and that he wished he could make it better. \n\nWe kind of made up I guess and he went to work. Later I was thinking back to what he said and texted him and told him that I was still pretty hurt by it. This was yesterday, still no response. \n\nI’m super confused and need an outside perspective. AITA? Is he TA? Help me, Reddit. ",

I’ve been volunteering for a children’s program at my old church for 10 years. \n\nToday I was volunteering for the children’s program at my church as I’ve done almost every Sunday for 10 years. For the past 10 years we’ve had lots of issues with our room being left a mess, things going missing, our storage closet being stuffed with things to we can’t get into it. \n\nToday I’d had enough of all this. I set everything up, hunted to find the things that were missing and then, told my dad I was going to go talk to the office director about what’s been happening. \n\nI’ve known the office director for years so I think it’ll be an alright conversation. When I find her we hug and exchange pleasantries. I tell her I need to talk to her about some things for my ministry. I’m calm and polite and reasonable. Honestly I don’t think people would have blamed me if I’d been livid because of how long this has been going on but I wasn’t. \n\nMe: hey ___ I want to talk to you about the ministry. I know that on Fridays people use that room. It would be helpful if- \n\nHer: okay you need to stop giving me attitude. \n\nMe very confused: I’m not? \n\nHer: you have been from the second you got up here. This isn’t you. I’m an adult, you’re a student you need to respect me. \n\n(I’m not a student I’m an adult with a job to get done). \n\nShe’s full on yelling at this point, In front of everyone. \n\nMe: well I wasn’t don’t speakin- \n\nHer; IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE AN ADULT SHOULD HAVE COME TO ME. LIKE_____ OR_____. I’M VERY BUSY! \n\nMe: if you let me finis- \n\nHer YOU SHOULD HAVE SENT ME AN EMAIL I’M NOT GOING TO REMEMBER THIS. \n\nme: I don’t have your email. Please let me finish things are also getting stolen from us. \n\nHer: that isn’t my issue! \n\nAt this point I keep trying to walk away and I kinda tuned her out but I know she kept yelling. \n\nI know she has a very stressful job and she has a lot to deal with. Maybe she was having a bad day or something. \n\nSo who’s the asshole? ",

      "description": "First time poster here and I’m on mobile so I hope this goes well. Anyways, let’s jump right in to the stank!\n\nMe (24M) and my girlfriend (24F) had a baby boy one month ago today, and things have been pretty awesome. We’ve really come together as a couple and our communication has been healthier than ever; even our levels of trust and little displays of affection are through the roof. All in all, a potentially stressful and chaotic situation worked out pretty well! \n\nMy SO has a six year old boy from a high school fling. The father moved several states away when he found out about the kid, and has only been around two or three times, for no more than an hour each time. Her son knows I am not his father but for the last three years I have tried to reinforce the fact that I am his friend and he can always talk to me. We play basketball together and we go bowling every weekend, as long as he behaves in school that week, so I would think to think that we are pretty close. \n\nSo two days ago (Friday) after work, the three of us went bowling while my mother watched our newborn. As we’re changing shoes, I notice a really gnarly odor akin to sour milk and garlic. I searched for the offensive smell and I realized it was my Gf’s son’s feet. When I leaned down to put all of our shoes underneath the table, I was about a foot away from him and couldn’t help but notice he absolutely REEKED. I was a little boy once, so I shrugged it off and made a mental note to tell his mom later. \n\nAs luck would have it, she brought up to me a few minutes later how he got made fun of at school that day for smelling bad and how it hurt his feelings. Me being the idiot that I am immediately responded with, “SO, it smells like he hasn’t wiped his ass properly in days. Does he use soap in the shower? Did you ever show him how?” To which she blushed and vehemently responded that it was not appropriate for her to bathe with her own son. \n\nNow that he’s six, I kind of agree, but I wasn’t born knowing how to properly clean my body, I had to be taught. I told her that I felt as if it was her job as the sole parent to teach her son hygiene, otherwise this problem will never go away. I also stated that with our son, the newborn, I would 100% be taking responsibility for his hygiene so that I knew it would get done. She started to tear up and got really angry with me, so we finished our first game of bowling and left. She’s been pissed at me all weekend. AITA here? Should I have handled that better? Different?",

She is someone who thinks the world revolves around them and doesn’t care for anybody else.  For instance, for Christmas she got my brother tickets to a play she really wanted to see, and actually did not get him a gift.  Her and my brother visited between Christmas and New Years, I let them stay at my apt while I stayed with my GF for 5 days rent free, even gave them my car to use, and she was so ungrateful for everything.  She even brought her dog, who my GF is allergic to, proceeded to let him vomit and shit in my car without any attempt to clean it up.  Wouldn’t even try to see me for dinner, and when I confronted them I was told I was being selfish because I worked while they were there (my job is technically “in season” so I could not get off)... whatever.\nToday, I just found out she is coming back for a few days to work in the city I live in, and she wants to get dinner at her favorite restaurant which is very expensive and personally I’m not the biggest fan.  Because she never even tried to apologize for mistreating my possessions and myself last time she was here, I have no interest in seeing her at all.

      "title": "AITA for breaking up with GF of 2 years?",
      "description": "Names :  K - Guy,  Me - me,  S - GF\n\nS  is a really cute, attractive girl in the conventional way, most people  would find her  cute as well, so did I. She have good personality as  well, very friendly, I'd be crazy to not be attracted to her.\n\nUnlike me, S is very much an  extrovert. So, she have a lot of rather close friends even  among guys. I am not and was never bothered by this, I know of it before  going into a relationship. They are her friends, and I also have a  few girl friends. So it's all okay.\n\nFor clarification, she's in pre-u, I'm a degree student. It's at the same campus, but not the same facility.\n\nAround  the start of her study she became good friends with K. He's basically the nicest guy I've ever met. I've met him a few times, we played basketball together, he's a friend to me. I don't have a problem with  their relationship either. I've sensed that he liked S in a romantic  way, but make nothing of it as I trust her. \n\nFast  forward to a few weeks before our break up K told one of my friend that he have feelings for S. They were just talking about girls, then S came up. I don't remember much of what my friend told me, but one sentence I do remember was \"They're \\[me and S\\] just a couple right? I still  have a chance with her.\" \n\n'Fucking prick' I thought to myself.\n\nA few hours later, K confessed to S. This is where it all started getting shaky. She was more sad and confused, sad  that she might have lost a good friend.\n\nOf  course the situation got weird between her and K. But I didn't ask her  much about it, she's not too fond of talking about it either. Around  this time she also started getting distant and cold towards me. When we  met she's not as interested in our conversations, she barely text back,  even when she does it's only a few words long or when she needed me for  something. I tried talking to her a lot of times but it doesn't help.  She avoided the issue like Ultra Instinct Goku dodging Kefla's attacks. All the answer I got from her was that she's just acting normal, I'm the  one who's weird for thinking she's acting weird.\n\nHer  being distant has really worked against me, it keeps bugging me. It's not like we have a big fight or anything, it's just .... nothing.  After 3 - 4 weeks I can't take it anymore, it's getting in the way of my  basic function, can't sleep, can't focus on my studies, we're also not  making any progress in trying to fix the situation. So I broke it up  with her. She took it rather well, maybe a bit too well, her first  respond was \"I've seen it coming\" . That being said, I still think she  was sad if even a little.\n\nI don't know if the thing with K was the reason for her action, it's not why I broke up w/her, or maybe she's just not interested in  me anymore. I don't know much about her life  now, so I can't really judge on anything here.\n\nI broke up with her around 3-  4 months ago and it's been bugging me ever since. Was I an asshole?",

      "description": "My motherinlaw is in her late eighties. Though we have had disagreements in the past, I always make my very best efforts to mend things and keep open communication. A few weeks back we went to visit during a blizzard, and as I was bringing things in from my car, the garage door stopped working in the open position. I let her know there was a problem and before I could do anything about it, she called her male neighbor over to see if he could fix it. I wanted to observe what he did as he was troubleshooting so I could handle it myself in the future, and my motherinlaw basically told me to go away and that my help wasn’t needed. I explained that I simply wanted to know how to help her in the future and twice she waved me away and said “Goodbye” in a condescending manner. Once the issue was fixed and the neighbor left, she flipped out on me and said that I embarrassed her and insulted her neighbor for asking a question about what he was doing.  It upset me that she treated me this way and I asked why she had to be so hateful towards me. She told me to shut up repeatedly and finally stomped out of the room. I gathered my children and our things and we left. It’s been two weeks and we have not heard a word out of her. Should I apologize for “embarrassing” her, or wait for her to make the first move. I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful, and this is far from the first time she has been rude and dismissive to me. Life is short and I don’t want to deprive the kids of their grandparents, but I also don’t feel like I should be treated rudely over something so inconsequential. ",

My two housemates are a couple and have the master bedroom that has an ensuite and a walk in robe. I have two small bedrooms that are roughly 2.8 to 3 metres square (9 feet 2.236 inches to 9 feet 10.11 inches). I use one to sleep in and one to game in, their master bedroom is over double the size of my two rooms put together.\n\nMy routine essentially consists of working during the night and sleeping during the day, that's it. I'm too tired after work to do anything and I don't expect my house mates to do anything for me. I basically carry them through rent, use virtually 0 dishes and only really exist in my two rooms and at work. I clean up after myself if I make a mess and we all pay equal amounts for the bills, save for the internet where I pay a bit extra for faster internet speeds that they benefit from as well.\n\nI just wanted to know if my feelings are justified that I don't really need to do housework considering the circumstances. I could very well be an asshole here, but figured I'd check. Sorry for any formatting issues btw, I'm on mobile.",

      "description": "Burner account.\n\nMy wife and I have been married for 1.5 years. She has a child from a previous relationship. We got pregnant before the wedding and had a child 4 months after we got married. \n\nAfter we got married, but before the child was born, my job found out about a relationship I had with a subordinate while my wife and I were split up, and were going to terminate me. I quit that job, and found another job making nearly what I was making at the previous. I started that job 5 days after my child was born, but I was working 60-70 hours per week and felt like I was missing a lot of time with my family. \n\nAfter 2 months, I quit because I couldn’t take the stress of being a new dad and also working as much as I was. I found a temporary job making considerably less, but in a field I had experience, working mid-shifts, 40 hours per week.\n\nI took my current position 6 months ago, knowing that it would not be a long term position, but that it would introduce me to an industry that I enjoy working in and potentially lead me to better opportunities (either within the company I currently work for, or through networking). The hours are much the same as the temporary position from last year (mid-shifts during the week, usually off work by 8PM, occasional Saturdays, 40 hours per week).\n\nShe, meanwhile, watches the children 4 days a week and works Fri-Sun, 10 hours shifts. She did not want our children to be in daycare, so we settled on this schedule. It means we very rarely get days off together, but they do happen. \n\nIn my previous position, I could pay all of the bills and still have plenty left to go on dates, etc. Now, it does require that she pay some of the bills, although I pay the mortgage, car payment, car insurance. She is usually left with 2-3 bills per month, including her cell phone.\n\nAnyway, she constantly complains about how my position is terrible, I’m too good for the job, how I don’t get paid enough, how I’m abused by my work. I have been very successful in the position, though I did have an early rough patch. I’m a department manager, so when someone calls out, I’m expected to cover the shift. She complains about this. She frequently fusses at me when I get up to get ready for work, complaining that I’m leaving too early (Google maps says 27 mins to my job, I usually try to leave 25-30 mins early), and telling me that the job doesn’t respect me so why should I care about being late. \n\nShe will also do things like try to run to the store for cigarettes/tell me to run to the store when I need to leave in 10 mins. If I tell her that there isn’t time, she starts complaining again and telling me how shitty my job is. This happens at least once a week, leaving me to start my work day in a bad mood.\n\nI stood up for myself today and told her that I was tired of her disrespecting me and my job, and that I wouldn’t listen to her complaints anymore. Right now she’s on her way to her parents’ with our children. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So my boyfriend and his grandmother live together in an apartment and sometimes I'll stay the night because it's more convenient to get to work from his place than mine (I only work 2 days a week since I'm a full-time student). However I don't know what I did but my bf's grandmother gets upset at me for both eating and not eating her food. \n\nI think she's a great cook and I'm extremely grateful that she cooks for us but sometimes I'm craving tacos or ramen or something ya know? So my bf and I eat out, she gets upset because we're not eating her food that she \"spent all day making\"  (she doesn't actually). We even let her know a day ahead of time that we'll be eating out and remind her when we leave but she'll still be really upset when we come home and aren't hungry enough to eat the food she just cooked. But when we do eat her food she complains that she's old and how cooking takes so much out of her and even called me a leech at some point. We've offered to take her out to eat with us but she refuses. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have both offered to do the cooking but she refuses to let us use the stove. I'll even cook stuff at my apartment and bring it over so she doesn't have to feed me but then she gets upset at me for not eating her food again. Same thing happens if my bf and I bring back pizza or something. Even when I'm staying at my apartment she'll send my bf over to bring me Tupperware full of food because she feels obligated to feed me which ends up with a) too much food in my fridge and b) her complaining about having to feeding me. I've told her she doesn't need to bring me food at my apartment because I can cook but then she gets upset and calls me ungrateful for not eating her food. If I so much as sneeze she say it's because of food poisoning from eating out and say her food is the only food I should eat. \n\nI don't know. Am i the asshole here? I don't even know what I'm an asshole for but I just feel pretty shitty all the time now. I feel like I'm doing something wrong but I'm not entirely what anymore I'm just confused",

Recently she decided to adopt a 3 month old puppy, which I had no idea she was going to do until 3 hours before the dog was going to come to our house. \n\nSince then my stepmother has forced my sister, stepbrother, father and I to take care of this dog, while she sits in her bed all day watching television. It doesn’t seem to bother my sister or stepbrother, or even my dad even though he takes care of my stepmothers and his baby all day on top of working two jobs. However it is starting to annoy me and I am getting fed up. \n\nI never wanted a dog ever since my old dog passed away about 5 years ago (around the time my parents got a divorce) and we have 3 cats. So I didn’t think a new puppy, especially on top of a 7 month old infant, would be the best idea. So I was pretty annoyed at my stepmothers spontaneous decision.  \n\nI’ve been focusing on schoolwork and my job more this semester so having to take care of this dog that I didn’t want is really starting to annoy me when I’d like to just take the free time I have to relax and unwind. \n\nAfter my school club today I walked home like always and proceed to go up to my room. As I was going up the stairs my stepmother told me to take the dog out so she could pee. I was pretty annoyed as I’d just walked through snow and was pretty cold but so be it. I went outside with the dog since she’s still pretty young to make sure she wouldn’t run away or get lost. I was out there for about 20 minutes until I decided to bring her back inside even though she didn’t pee. \n\nI was still annoyed as now I’m pretty cold and just wanted to change clothes and take a short nap, but my stepmother decided to talk to me saying how I’m an unappreciative brat who has no respect for anyone. At that point I was fed up and just was trying to focus on my homework to try and drown her out, which caused her to go on more until she left my room. \n\nI made this post to see if my reasons at being annoyed were valid or if I really am just whining and I am an asshole. Sorry that this is a huge wall of text, but thanks a ton if you read this far. Thanks to any and all comments as well I really appreciate it!",

      "title": "AITA for calling my friend (and team captain) a hypocrite?",
      "description": "(To preface, I'm a part of an engineering club at my school and have been given a title pertaining to leading the design process for our projects. I've known the team captain for a little more than four years now, though only got to be close friends in the last year after I joined this club.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the actual story: my team was recently issued a new challenge. To simplify, we have to design and build a robot to pick up and place different manipulatives at different heights. During the first week of our building period, the team spends a lot of time brainstorming and drawing up ideas for possible solutions to the problem. It seemed like every single time I'd try to even suggest an idea for what we could do, it'd be immediately shot down by the team captain. This happened with just about everything relating to our robot, and eventually, I just gave up, and just went with whatever the rest of the team and he decided on. (Since apparently he was fine with taking suggestions from them; can you tell I'm still a little salty about this?) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt one point, we (the leadership team in the club) were discussing the final direction were looking for the robot to go in since we needed to get started with building. I suggested that we attempt to build a system to shoot one of the game pieces (a ball) in order to get it up higher. I was immediately met with \"That won't work because we tried to make a shooter a few years ago and it didn't work.\" (No other explanation. Keep in mind I wasn't around the club when this previously happened, so I didn't know.) I hung back from the conversation for a little bit, but noticed something just a few minutes later. Team captain suggests to get the ball higher we should re-use an elevator system we built last year. One of my friends in the club asked if it was wise to try and re-use it since it didn't work before and our captain immediately responded with \"We can make it work this time.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know he means well, but it felt insulting to be given this title of \"Design Lead\" and then be completely ignored in terms of design. I got upset, and in a private message, (we'd been in a team Discord server up until this point) said that he was being hypocritical to immediately shut down my ideas about re-using concepts from past years but to be accepting of it when he came up with it. He responded to me with a curt response that went something along the lines of \"you don't know what you're talking about.\" He later told me that it made him angry that I'd suggest he was being hypocritical when he just didn't want to spend time dwelling on ideas that he knew wouldn't work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've talked it over (thought not to the extent that I would have liked since I still don't really feel like he gets how terrible I felt about being so useless for a whole week.) and there isn't any bad blood between us. That said, I figured I'd ask for public opinion since it's been eating me up inside. AITA/too sensitive?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: My ideas for a group project were being ignored and I called the person shutting me down a hypocrite for it, making him upset. AITA?",

      "description": "Disclaimer 1: This happened three weeks ago. Disclaimer 2: Fake names. \n\nMy friend, Anthony, was in a relationship with Amelia that ended about two weeks ago. Since then, Anthony has told most of our friends that he would be uncomfortable with anyone getting with Amelia while the wound was still fresh.\n\nA little piece of information about Adam beforehand. He recently broke up with a girl on the basis that he cannot commit to both her and his work. It came to light that his reasoning was a load of shit when it turned out that he is now talking to two girls on the fly without them knowing there is another girl.\n\nAdam -- our mutual friend -- made out with Amelia at a nightclub. Amelia then told another one of our mutual friends, Abigail. Abigail was torn on whether or not she should tell Anthony -- she did not want to break Amelia's trust but she also felt that it would be better if he knew, if only because Adam was not a great friend and that should be known. \n\nAbigail came to me for advice -- and apparently about six other people -- and I told her it would be best to tell him. I know Anthony well enough to know that it would be a lot more painful for him if he found this out in isolation and then learned that all of his friends knew and didn't tell him. It would be alienating and he would likely feel more alone than he already does. Abigail agreed with me, but feared the consequences of telling him and did not know whether or not it was her place -- especially considering Amelia had confided in her.\n\nOne day I was sat, coincidentally, with the seven other people who knew (including Abigail), and they all agreed that he should be told but they kept trying to get somebody else to do it. I was feeling light-headed and dizzy at the time, so I was largely keeping to myself. Eventually, Anthony approached us and they handled it very clumsily until eventually they dropped the responsibility for telling him onto me. I reluctantly told him what had happened and he was devastated that his friends hadn't told him sooner, that there was no respect between Adam and him, and that -- despite recognising that he was no longer in a relationship with Amelia -- the thought of such a scene upset him greatly. He walked off to let off some steam and hasn't been as happy since. I've been trying to keep him company and to assure him that there are people who respect him and want him around, but I'm wondering AITA for telling him in the first place?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I'm going to try and keep this short but there is a lot of details  \nthis all started a few months ago but for context ill start about two-ish years ago when my mother began divorcing my stepfather. when he first got the news from my mother that they were getting divorced he got pretty violent initially when he was living in the house still he stole my mother's med(not forgetting high more just to piss off my mother) and it only escalated from there. one my mother kicked him out of the house he would randomly show up and threaten to break in, fight me and my siblings etc but pretty much never when I the oldest child was there. one time he actually did break in while no one was home but my mother and sexually assaulted her, she chose not to file charges(a choice my nor my siblings agreed with). this prompted me to stay at her house all the time instead of swapping from week to week between her and my biological father's house so that I would be there when/if he ever showed up again. this lasted until I went back to college at the end of that summer. while I was away that first semester I struggled with depressive episodes and contact worrying about her and my sibling's safety while I was away and this in conjunction with other factors led to a lot of drinking and skipping class and ultimately a GPA of 1.4 something I am still trying to recover from. \n\nfast forward to about four months ago when I was in my room minding my business when I suddenly hear his voice upstairs and go up to see him in the kitchen talking to my mother in a civil manner but none the less I went back to my room and grabbed the baseball bat I had stashed under my bed and listened readily to go down and try and stop anything if he started to get violent.  when to my surprise she came into my room and told me that he was staying the night and they were getting back together and I told her I couldn't live or sleep in the same house as him so I gathered as much of my stuff as I could carry got in my car and went to my biological fathers house. I began gradually moving my things out of her house and trying to find a place for it but my bio-dads house is pretty small and I share a small room with my younger brother there and now I am looking for a place to live by myself permanently to get away from it all. my sister, however, thinks that we shouldn't abandon her and I am being stubborn in my original statement and that living in that house with him is not that big a deal because stepdad mostly minds his own business.\n\ntl;dr my x-stepfather got violent after a divorce but now my mom is letting him move back in so I decided to leave her house permanently.\n\nso my question is am I an asshole for leaving my mother and sister to live there with him while I am just trying to run away?",

      "description": "So I live in an apartment with two roommates, we'll call them Tina and Kacey, names changed for obvious reasons. They're both girls and I'm a guy, this is relevant later. \n\nSo for the past few weeks or maybe a few months, one our friends Jack started to have interest in Kacey, he would always ask her to go eat with him, to drink with him, etc. Now living with Kacey, she tells me that she doesn't want to really hang out with him and that she really doesn't like him like that. Every time Kacy gives in to hang out with him, he's always tried to come over after, the last time this happened Kacey ended up locking her door and leaving him in the living room after constantly telling him he can sleep on the couch. \n\nA few days ago it was Tina's birthday. So Both my roommates and I, along with a few of our friends, including Jack, went to go out and drink and celebrate. So we had fun and moved on to some karaoke to continue the night. Now, at this point, both Tina, and Kacey are pretty wasted, I was a a little past tipsy but not too drunk. Now I know Jack wasn't drunk at all, he arrived about 2 hours after we started drinking and was mostly there for the karaoke.  So, the night is winding down, and I call us an Uber. Before we leave, I overhear Jack talking to Kacey that he's going to come over later, I ignore it and hop in the uber and head home with my roommates. So back at home I asked her if Jack was coming over and she said she doesn't know and she asked if I could tell him not to. \n\nSo I texted him saying that we're all about to go to sleep so now isn't a good time to come over. Then about 2 minutes later he texts me, he's here. I ignore the text. Then about an hour later he text's me. \"I ptfo'd in my car\". Again I ignore that text. Then I get bombarded with texts like, \"be a bro\", \"yo let me in\", etc.\n\nAt this point I know everyone is asleep, including Tina so I ignore the texts again. Then about 10 minutes later, with my room being closest to the front door. I hear someone there. So we have an electric lock that requires a 4 digit pin to get in, and for about 30-45 minutes I hear who is presumably Jack incorrectly guessing our pin. Then for the next 20 minutes hes banging on our door. At this point there's no way I'm letting him in, everyone else had already fallen asleep and I told my roommate I would take care of it.\n\n\n\nSo, Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Obligatory Sorry For Formatting Because I Am Posting This On My Mobile Device\n\ntl;dr at bottom\n\nMy brother (11) had a couple panic attacks in the past week or two. My mom got super worried and got a therapist and all that jazz. She (the therapist) gave my brother some breathing exercises to calm him down. \n\nMy brother has always been an attention-seeking little brat. And a momma’s boy. Whenever my mom leaves the house, for ANY reason, just to go shopping, to walk the dog, etc. he has to hug her and get a kiss. ALWAYS.\n\nI am not denying he had panic attacks. I am denying his constant “anxiety.”\n\nI’ll also point out he’s an incredibly picky eater. Like sitting at the table for an hour waiting for him to eat a piece of chicken. That’ll be important later.\n\nToday on the way home from church he started humming real loud. My mom asked him to stop as she was listening to a podcast. He didn’t.\n \n“I can’t control it.”\n\n“I need you to try.”\n\n“I can’t.”\n\n“Use your breathing exercises.”\n\nNo response. He just hummed quieter.\n\n“Sawyer, you need to control it.”\n\n“I can’t.”\n\nThis is his THING. Whenever he’s asked to stop doing something, he does it quieter, smaller, lesser, but still noticeable. He never stops.\n\n\nThis exchange went on for a while.\n\n\nHe said this while giggling. Not in a creepy way. He just thought what he was doing was funny and hoped everyone around him would think so too, and give him attention.\n\nYesterday when we were eating dinner he didn’t like what he was eating. In typical Brother fashion, he pretended to be sick/not feeling well to try and get out of eating. Now, mind you, he’s 11 and weighs less than my dog. Dead serious.\n\nA couple times when he didn’t get much sleep he twitched in the morning. My parents know this and my brother took advantage of this and pretended to twitch at dinner. They were noticeably fake and laughably huge and slow. Twitches are super small movements that are super fast and, I believe, impossible to recreate voluntarily. The movements are too small and fast. Please correct me if I’m wrong. He curled up with a blanket and sat at the table. However, he only twitched when someone looked at him. He actually ate all his dinner quite fast that night and we all celebrated and when we celebrated, his twitches magically disappeared.\n\nI’m a high school student. I am an *expert* in attention whores. Almost everyone around me is one. I’m probably one. I know one when i see one.\n\nHe is one.\n\nHowever, I could be wrong, and I don’t want to be the one who denies legitimate symptoms.\n\nAlso, my parents don’t really take well to opinions. There’s a good chance I’ll be “telling them how to do their jobs.”\n\nAny opinions?\n\ntl;dr: I have a suspicion my brother is faking most of his anxiety symptoms. Would I be the Asshole if I informed my mother of my suspicions?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "My mother in law has always hated me.  She’s very intrusive in our relationship, constantly critical of me, and over all a negative influence on our relationship.  My wife needed a lot of help when our daughter was born so I sucked it up that she was around a lot.   I’ve been nothing, but respectful to this woman even though she basically spits in my face whenever I’m around her.  \n\nNow that my wife is returning to work she wants to hire her mother to watch our daughter.  She’s always just told me to ignore her mother and try not to take it seriously when I’ve complained about the way she treats me and our relationship.  The idea of having even more of her in my life is awful.  If we’re going to be paying money for someone to watch our daughter it might as well be someone else.  My wife thinks it’s better to have family watch her, that the care would be better than with a stranger and that the extra money would really help her mother out.  I would never ask my wife to go along with a sitter that she was uncomfortable with and I feel like I deserve the same consideration.  ",

But it was to the point where my spouse had to mute her on Facebook because of the barrage of messages.\n\nShe was diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed medication to alleviate some of these issues. But it’s just not enough.\n\nI wouldn’t mind supporting her when I could, but she doesn’t seem to remember anything that I or my spouse tells her about ourselves- simple things like ages, she forgot my spouse had a hearing problem and can’t drive, forgot that I was disowned from my family for being gay, things like that.\n\nIt really boils down to me feeling like she’s not invested in either friendship. And I normally wouldn’t have so much hesitation in cutting out someone, but we are her primary emotional supports and her family sucks.\n\nSo WIBTA for telling her that she’s been a one-sided/fair weather friend?

I am making drinks when my flatmate comes up to me and starts grinding a breadstick in my ear into dust like my ear is a novelty pencil sharpener. I am irritated by this already, then he grabs another one and crumbles it up in my hair. I am thinking wtf but also feeling humiliated by him doing this and want him to stop and to know in no uncertain terms not to do this to me. \n\nNow I am a good fighter from having older brothers and I dont want to try and restrain him half arsed and then we end up scuffling. He is stronger than me and would have over powered me and would have just been messy and potentially dangerous. So I went full force but gentle, a scoop his legs with my legs as I lifted I flipped his upper body and put him to the floor gently and put a chair on top of him which is when my other friend came over and took the chair. I wasn't angry doing it, well I was but I felt measured. \n\nI didn't hurt him and didn't go beyond what was required I felt. He looked stunned that I had done it and I explained where I was coming from with doing it. Over the past week or so he seems to have been quite shook up by it. We live together and things are fine we are getting on, there doesn't seem to be any tension I just feel bad he felt unnerved by it and seems to have affected him. I just replay it and think, well what else could I have done? I mean I could have said not to do it instead I suppose but I was also annoyed and it felt like the response fitted- by physically violating and humiliating me I think it is ok to respond in this way.\n\nTLDR: flatmate stuck and grinded breadstick up in my ear and crumbled one into my hair so I flipped him onto the floor gently and seems to have been a little traumatic for him.",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my friend's house after one of his buddies used the word \"gay\" as an insult?",
      "description": "I've created a throaway account for this question. Also sorry if I make any mistakes, English isn't my first language.  \n\n\nSo, a little bit of info about me: I grew up in a rural area where most of the people are rather conservative and whatnot. As a young kid / teenager it wasn't very easy for me to make friends and get along with other people cause I'm gay and also not exactly the \"manliest\" guy out there. People would always joke about the way I speak and act and I was often referred to as a sissy and a fag, which took a huge toll on my self-esteem and made me super cautious about the way I come off to others. After graduating and moving to a bigger city (I'm at university now) my situation has improved a lot cause I was able to meet other gay people, get active in the community and just surround myself with peers who are less judgemental in general. I feel a whole lot better about myself now!\n\n  \nNow on to my problem:\n\nLast weekend, a straight friend of mine (we aren't super close but we get along fine and hang out sometimes) asked me if I wanted to come to his place to hang out with him and his friends (also all straight). I said \"Yeah, sure\" and looked forward to a nice evening. Me and his friends actually got along really well at first and there were no problems until one of them (I don't remember the exact context, I think they were talking about how a friend of them reacted to a certain situation) said \"Man, that is just the gayest and most pathetic shit ever\". After saying that, he immediately looked over to me, started laughing and said \"Oh don't worry, I didn't mean it like *that*\". I said that I don't appreciate him using the word in that context and he apologized. Since I still felt really uncomfortable from that point on and got a lot of flashbacks to my teenage years when people were unnecessarily homophobic in my presence, I thought it'd be better to just leave. My friend was a bit surprised and asked if it's because of the remark his friend made, which I affirmed. He said he'd really appreciate it if I stayed and that his friend meant no harm whatsoever, but like I said, I just felt uncomfortable and wanted to get out of there. On my way out, his friend who made the remark actually went after me and apologized again, saying he didn't intend to hurt me and that it wouldn't happen again. I thanked him for apologizing but left anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day my friend texted me and told me that I completely overreacted and shouldn't have just left like that. I replied \"After growing up in a really homophobic and close-minded town, I just don't feel like I need to spend time with people who talk like that anymore.\". I also criticized him for not saying anything to his friend (I didn't expect him to throw a scene or anything, a simple \"Don't say stuff like that\" would have sufficed), to which he replied \"Why would I? He wasn't *actually* being homophobic, he just used a slang word\". The convo went on for a bit longer and ended with him saying \"Your future life will be really stressful if you're just gonna throw a fit and run away whenever someone says a word you don't like\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked my other friends (who are all part of the LGBT community) and they agreed that his friend was being an asshole, but my friend told me that his other friends also agreed I overreacted.  \nI just feel really torn right now. On one hand, his friend apologized two times (although the first one didn't seem very sincere, he only realized he had truly fucked up after I got ready to leave) so maybe I should have just gotten over it and stayed. On the other hand, people talking like that just makes me feel anxious and uncomfortable (because of the homophobic people I had to deal with during my youth) and I also feel like my friend could have been a bit more supportive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

      "description": "Yeah, the title might sound like im the asshole, but please read the text first. (sorry for the kind of long post) \n\nSo, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years, so our relationship is really serious and all, and I won't leave him for this of course, but it's still something that makes me angry from time to time.\n\nI'll tell it with a story: we've planned to go to a street food festival this saturday, everything is fine until his dad calls and demands for his help on saturday. So we immediately have to cancel our little trip so he can help his dad. Maybe you see the point already. \nOf course, I'm not against him helping his dad and I also like that they have such a strong relationship, but it literally happens all the time.\n\nHis dad is in only his mid 50's and also some kind of craftsman, he is muscular and can do things on his own. Plus he has a lot of friends that can also help him with stuff. But no, it has to be my boyfriend, as always. And of course, my boyfriend never ever (not once) says no. We always have to shift our schedules so he has time to help him. \n\nAlso, last summer we were at my bf's parent's place for dinner and his dad demanded that my bf helps him next summer (means this year's summer) for a whole week to paint his house. He did not ask \"Could you?\", he said \"Come over and help.\" Yes, this is a major task that one can't do alone but as I said, he has so many friends, including my step-dad, who could help him. Still, my boyfriend didn't say no.\n\nThis is just something that really pisses me off because it makes me feel that he prefers everything his dad does and says over me. When we make plans days or even weeks before, his dad chimes in a day before the event and asks for help, everything else gets cancelled. \n\nI've also talked to my bf about this but he just said that I see this differently because I didn't really have a dad growing up (which unfortunately is right). Am I overreacting about this or is my anger justified? I really need to know because it also makes me feel bad for being angry that my boyfriend spends time with his dad.\n",

      "description": "I live at home with my parents and my oldest brother (I'm 19, my brother is 28). Oldest brother has a girlfriend of 3 years and about 2 months ago, she was threatening to break up with my brother. She isn't abusive but she treats my brother like an option, and is semi-high maintenance (very self absorbed). I tried to make him feel better but she takes it back. She has been sleeping over every weekend (Friday to Monday) since that.\n\nMy brother would come into my room every Friday and ask to take one of my pillows. Once she left on Monday he wouldn't return the pillow. He would keep it until I eventually would go into his room and take it back. Repeat.\n\n3 weeks ago is when this all came to a head, this was the 2nd week in a row that my brother came in my room while I was showering and took my pillow without asking.\n\nI have a hard time vocalizing my emotions or my intentions, my brother knows this. Confrontation doesn't really bother me (as my family knows) but because of my anxiety, I didn't develop all of my social skills (like sometimes I'm too blunt and/or don't pick up on social cues). I knew that he would be busy with his gf so I sent him a text. I didn't hear anything from my brother after that.\n\nText Screenshot Here: [https://i.gyazo.com/d6711fdcf66a9322794f2e0b03ec236d.jpg](https://i.gyazo.com/d6711fdcf66a9322794f2e0b03ec236d.jpg)\n\nFast forward 2 weeks. I ask my brother for some help with my new bed frame (I was recovering from a dislocated shoulder) and he doesn't say anything. I shrug it off, not really thinking much of it. This is where that struggling social skills come in as I obviously didn't pick up on his social cue that he was giving me the silent treatment. My Mom and I are talking a day or 2 later and she brings up that my brother is mad at me. I brush it off and say \"What? No he's not. He would tell me if he was mad.\" The reason I brushed it off was because my mother has a bad habit of taking my brother's side and defending him over the smallest thing. She's very quick to paint my brother in a holy light.\n\nFew days ago, my Dad asks my brother for help regarding the bed frame and my brother starts shit talking me. I was sick and my Dad is recovering from a week in the hospital: \"She hasn't apologized. She can figure it out her fucking self.\" I get upset and I end up getting worked up and collapsing in the bathroom. My Dad gets me to my room, my brother comes to see what's happening, sees that it's me who fell and just leaves.\n\nThrough ALL of this, my brother hasn't confronted me himself to tell me he's upset. He has not once spoken to me, he hasn't even directly told me that I said something offensive or hurtful.\n\nIt's been about 3 weeks since, my brother and I still haven't spoken. My mother is telling me every other day to apologize to him. If my brother and I absolutely have to be in the same room, we walk past each other (or avoid the room all together) and pretend the other isn't there.",

      "description": "So a little bit of background on my career for the last 10 years. For 8 years I worked in TV/Live Sports Productions. I was a replay operator. For anyone who doesn't understand, I was the guy who would show the slow motion instant replay and make halftime highlights among other things. During this 8 years my mother always referred me as a camera operator. Now I'm not digging on camera operators, I started as one myself and worked my way up but camera and replay were two very different things and I was proud of what I did. I was only in my young 20s at the time and was considered one of the best in my region. I use to let it go but now in the last 2 years I switched up jobs to where now I service tech at a local university. 2 years I have been there and my mother saw that a sports event was coming to town and asked if I was on the production crew for it. This time I called her out because it wasn't even my career anymore, I had completely switched jobs. She got mad at me for calling her out and said that it was mean. Now that I think about it, no one in my family understands what I do for a living besides my wife which upsets me cause I am proud of my job. Was I being an asshole for calling her out? ",

      "description": "Throwaway cuz they reddit.\n\nSo in December I(24F) started dating a guy(24M) that I briefly dated a solid 10 years ago (when we were teens) We stopped dating end of January because I'm a big dumb dummy but a few weeks ago started dating again. Things have been okay, hes moving away from the country in June for 2 years so we both know that the relationship isn't going anywhere but he's insanely fun to hang out with. About a week ago we talked about things being exclusive, and by that I mean he told me he had a dream where he cheated on me. I said \"cheating implies were exclusive, are we?\" He said \"yeah, i'd consider us to be exclusive\" and I just kind of said okay because I'm not REALLY talking to anyone else right now and didn't have intentions to date anyone else before he leaves. The situation feelings wise is also very complicated with this guy. I told him in January that I loved him and he only recently said it back. I didn't expect him to ever say it back and was fine with that but I feel like it complicates things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where the issue comes in, I talk to a friend(28M) that I like on a daily basis. We dated for about a month in October but he ended things because I have a kiddo. He didn't want to be a step dad so a relationship wasn't really an option for him. That's totally okay, I wasn't mad so we continued to be friends. Obviously I still liked him as more than a friend but was fine with just being friends. Hes funny af to be honest, why would I give up all them memes??? We've only hung out once since we stopped dating in November and it was really good seeing each other, until last night. Last night he was going to go out and I suggested he stop by my place to hang for like 10 mins and pregame with some really cheap alcohol. He came over and we ended up drinking more than planned but definitely weren't drunk or anything like that. We were just having a really good time and flirting etc. We ended up making out for....awhile. But that's it. He knows I'm seeing the other guy and I obviously am aware of this. It also wasn't just a one off making out thing, we kind of want to date each other more seriously. We also agreed that we shouldn't do anything more than that while I'm seeing someone because if we want it to be a serious thing that's a shitty start to it. (I have also literally never cheated on anyone before, if I had known his feelings towards me had changed I probably wouldn't have invited him over last night just to be safe.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not planning on telling (24M) because I'm pretty positive it will just hurt him? Like if we were going to try to be in a committed long term relationship or something I would OBVIOUSLY tell him, but were not. I also don't want to stop hanging out with either of them? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, AITA for not telling him about it? I already know I'm the asshole for kissing (28M) in the first place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I don't want mom or my brother to find this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend and I( both 19) have known eachother for 9 years and been together romantically for 5 of them, we love each other. We fight and make fun of each other but we're in love. My mother however, dislikes my girlfriend and has made no attempt since we were ten and first met to try and make a relationship. She wanted me to have nothing to do with her and saw her as a rowdy delinquent and not a good influence on me. My girlfriend will tell you herself that she was terrible person as a kid but she's grown up a lot since then, we both have.\n\nWe mutually decided that we would wait until after university for marriage and kids and used condoms plus pulling out. But like everyone says it only takes one time and my girlfriend is pregnant after one night without a condom. My mom found out from my brother after he let accidentally let it slip. We were gonna tell her after we returned home from a summer long visit to my grandparents on my late father's side in California (found out in August 2018)  but I told my brother beforehand for advice on what to tell her and he somehow let it slip to her. So we returned early from the trip and well mom flipped her shit and yelled at us for being reckless (we expected as much) when we got in the car then asked us what were our plans. We told her we were gonna keep it and she told us we need to to think about it more before deciding what to do it. My girlfriend told her we had spent two weeks thinking about since we found out and decided to keep the baby. Mom told us we were making a mistake and we'd regret it and the rest of the ride was tense and silence after that. Me and my girlfriend moved into our own place (with help from our grandparents) and my mom and I didn't talk the whole pregnancy.\n\nLast week, we welcomed our son into the world and a made a post on Facebook about it only to get a call from my mother consisting mostly of her tearing me a new one for not 'making her get an abortion' (exact words)  and trying to convince me to 'run while he can't remember me'. I told her to fuck off and hung up in her face. Yesterday she called and and apologized and asked when she could see her grandson. I asked if my brother also had a son I didn't know about and told her that as far as I was concerned, she gave up the right to be in his life when she told me to run and that she would NEVER see him until I say so. She started to cry and hung up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother messaged me and told me I was 'too harsh' and 'she was just trying to look out for me' and that I should apologize and let her see him now that she's changed her tune. My mother's parents are also pissed at me for this but my girlfriend is on my side. I'm starting to wonder if we were too harsh on her and was she really trying to look after me?",

Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to say they are bad parents, but the way they treated me made me feel this way. Upon hearing this, my parents immediately suggested large revisions to my testimony, which would have shifted the blame entirely away from them. I stood my ground. How I felt because of my parents was an essential part of my testimony. They complained that this would damage how people thought of them at church, which wasn't wrong. However, this was still MY testimony. I can't just change a fundamental part of my testimony and huge factor that affected my life.

I tell my family that I have been around people and I just want to relax, but they respond by saying “We aren’t people, we are family!”, and acting offended when I don’t want to spend time with them.

I told her about how I was forced to go a different school because of a kid who we will call M. She told me that M was her best friend and that he would never do that. Well I'm a 17 year old mtf transgender person who has Asperger's and have been bullied since 8th grade for being openly gay and trans. Once he found out he started bullying me. Calling me a fag, calling me a it and whatnot.\n\n8th grade year I came out as gay and was writing a list of people who are and aren't supportive. I was in the middle of writing the people who weren't when a kid looked over saw his name and asked me if it was a hit list. So long story short he went around saying I was going to shoot up the school it followed me all the way to last year and through 3 schools. \n\nSo we were nearing the end of the school year and it's the second to last day. He said I was the reason for a stay in place that happened a few days ago. I said I wasn't we started pushing and shoving each other. Principal came and broke it up. He got suspended and my day went as normal. At around 6:30 that night police showed up at my door to inform me that I was not to go to school because I was a threat. Long story short he told one of his friends to send out a mass text saying I was gonna bomb the school. So I got told to stay home because I was a security risk to the school.\n\nSo I told my GF all about this and she said that she knows him and that he would never hurt a fly and that I'm a asshole because I'm blaming him for a problem I started.

      "description": "To start some background information. My girlfriend and I live with my parents in a 5 bedroom 2 bathroom house. Been that way for 3 years now. GF and mother never really had the best relationship they barely talk at all. So bad that at some points my GF has said she feels  like an \"unwelcome guest\". I've never had the best luck with used vehicles. Most of mine have ended up in junk yards needing repairs costing more than I paid for them. So with me working nights and the girlfriend working days we decided to share her car.  \n\nNow my mother at age 45 has never had her license  and has to rely on me or my father driving her to go grocery shopping, doctors appointments and such. 2 years ago my mother was in a work place accident and now cannot work. The year following my girlfriend and I bent over backwards to help her. Driving her to appointments, stopping getting her meds. Stuff like that.  \n\nFast forward to today. My mother asks me if we could take my girlfriends car tomorrow to buy a card and cake for her upcoming anniversary. I asked if she asked the owner of the car. To which I receive a scoff and \"why, you're the one driving me. So why does it matter\" and \" Tell you what, I will start asking her when she starts helping out around here. Until then I'll ask you\". Now my GF and I have had a few issues with my mother essentially using us as a delivery service; pick her up pops or snacks or take her to buy last minute stuff. I asked her just last week if she needs anything to let the GF know before she's off work because we're tired of being used. So today we finally drew the line and told her that if she needs anything to ask before the GF leaves work or if she needs my girlfriend or I to drive her anywhere that she is required to ask my GF for permission to use the car otherwise she's SOL. Am I being an unreasonable asshole?",

I didnt find out until after moving to my current place that my roomate was allergic, and I had to send her to live with my dad for the year. My dad ended up getting his own kitten(Paris), who has grown up with Luna and now they're really good friends. My dad says I can take them both if I want.l, but knowing him, I know he would be really sad if I took them both and hes just trying to spare my feelings. At this point Luna has lived with them more than me and I'm not sure if itll just be better for me to leave her there.

I was out of the house by then, but he and my younger sister got evicted from our apartment. My 15 year old sister (we'll call her Ashley) had nowhere to go. She stayed with one of her best friends (Kelly) for about 5 months.\n\nI grew up babysitting Kelly but after she hit her teen years I barely saw her. I heard a few stories about drugs, stealing, not being able to hold down a job for more than a few months, etc. You know, typical teenage drama.\n\nHere we are today: Ashley and Kelly are both in their early twenties. Ashley lives with her boyfriend, a roommate, and another guy is crashing on her couch. (An entirely different issue, dude is freeloading and won't leave). I am almost 30, and live in a 3 bedroom apartment with my fiance, my now sober and disabled) father, and 4 cats.\n\nAshley calls me up and says Kelly has an emergency situation at home. She needs a place to stay. Can she crash with me for 2 or 3 MONTHS while she tries to find another place to live? Oh, and she wants to bring her unfixed, unvaccinated cat.\n\nMy 3rd bedroom is basically storage space, a futon, and three giant litter boxes. I told Ashley that Kelly is welcome to couch surf or stay a few nights on the futon if it's really an emergency, but I wasn't comfortable with an undisclosed amount of time without some kind of game plan.\n\nAfter half an hour of bickering the likes of which we hadn't done since I was in high school, she tells me she can't believe how selfish I was and she was \"SO disappointed in me as a sister\". \n\nNot 15 minutes later my dad walks into my bedroom with the other tactic - guilt. Kelly would be willing to pay for the room. Kelly's family took Ashley in when he was fucked up, Kelly should be like family to us, it's the \"Christian\" thing to do, why can't I show a little compassion, etc.\n\nI told him he didnt understand the psychological and financial burden I'd be under, the legality of it, not to mention the stress and anxiety. Introducing another cat into my horde would bring a plethora of new issues. He left after telling me he was concerned about my immortal soul for being so callous.\n\nReddit, am I being an asshole for saying this girl is basically a stranger to me and my gut is telling me this isn't my problem?",

      "description": "I’m 25, he’s about to be 26. We’ve been together for a little over 2 years and have lived together for a little more than 6 months.\n\nI have a deadline of sorts, in my mind, that I’ve set. I was hesitant to move in together before being engaged so I told myself that if a year goes by and my bf hasn’t committed to building a live *together* (AKA putting a ring on it) then I’m out. I told him flat out early on that being in a married partnership was important to me. He agreed and said that it was for him, too. So we’re on the same page in that sense. But he never wants to talk about it. He doesn’t shut the conversation down abruptly, but he does try to scoot it under the rug or switch the subject. \n\nThe reason I have a deadline is because I don’t want to get stuck in a dead-end relationship. The kind where two people stay together out of convenience but don’t actually have a future together. I just don’t want to invest everything into a relationship, get totally screwed in the end, and have to rebuild my entire life from the ground up. \n\nMy desire to get married is mostly practical. I don’t care much about the actual ring or the actual wedding, although it would be fun or whatever. He doesn’t even need to do a big proposal or anything. I’m more interested in the legal benefits and protections that are provided in a marriage that you just don’t get while being in a domestic partnership. It’s also a career thing, too. The field in which I work is still very traditional and being single vs. married still alters people’s perception of you. Old fashioned and stupid, I know, but oh well. \n\nI think that 3 years, at our age and having lived together for a whole year, is a good amount of time to figure out whether or not we should get married. I feel like, if it’s not hell yea by then, it’s a no. \n\nSome people have agreed with me and others have said that it’s not fair for me to put that kind of pressure on my bf. \n\nSo... AITA?",

      "description": "As background, my friend is a zealous Christian. I’m Christian to but I’m better described as an agnostic that chose a god. And I’m gay. So polar opposites on that front. However he just keeps becoming more and more zealous and I try to be supportive but he’s not really thinking for himself anymore which is what bugs me because it’s the Christians that have lost the ability of critical thinking when it comes to the Bible I and most of my friend group have a problem with. And I’m the only one trying to prevent that I feel. Anyway, on to what I did. \n\nSo out of nowhere he texts in the group chat that he’s getting rid of his iPhone and downgrading to a flip phone to help him stop watching porn so he can be closer to God who thinks it’s wrong. I’m fine with what he’s doing but I pointed out the Bible actually never says that it’s a sin to jerk it. I even tell him what my psychologist had told me about masturbation and how it’s actually healthy for people. He of course rebuttals with how the Bible talks about adultery and how he doesn’t feel he can separate watching porn from it. I correct him that I believe he means lust which I can understand so I suggest alternative methods of getting himself off, some of which I have tried and found to be more enjoyable to the point that I only watch porn if I need to be fast. He of course comes back with how he’d just rather not because God blah blah blah. \n\nSo was I the asshole for not just outright supporting his decision? I do think it comes from a poor viewpoint. I’m also gonna say that whenever he says stuff like this I do usually support him but try to figure out where the hell he got his reasoning from because for some unknown reason he also believes the only way to get to heaven is to follow the Bible as closely as possible when the Bible makes it explicitly clear that that’s not how it works. \n\n",

      "description": "I graduated college about 4 years ago in computer science and got my masters after that. For anyone who has any knowledge of computers and computer illiterate relatives know what comes next. I was relegated to \"The IT guy\" in the family. For the most part I don't really mind it. Most of the family at least knows only to call me when their problem is more than a google search problem. Except for my grandmother. My grandmother calls me at least 6-7 times a week demanding I fix whatever problem is bothering her now. Most of them are so simple that any google search will fix them but she refuses to do anything on her own and treats me like her personal computer slave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's also another problem with my grandmother, she thinks computers are worthless. Whenever I go over she decides to ask me when i'm getting a \"real job\" or tell me how me begin able to fix computers is \"not a real skill\". She doesn't understand anything about computers and thinks it's still the 60's with how computers work. So I avoid going over at all costs and get my mom to fix her problem and just tell her how too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night though she began to blow my phone up telling me \"hackers\" were attacking her and I needed to come now. I had just got done with a 12 hour shift and told her I would come over in the morning before work but she demanded I come NOW and would not stop calling me or my parents (despite me not living with them) to get me to come. In the end I decided to just end my misery and go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got there it turns out the \"Hacker attack\" was a rouge toolbar she had installed that was popping ad's up in her browser. I got rid of it and told her that she needs to be careful when downloading stuff but she (Very rudely) told me that it wasn't her fault and that a hacker put it there. I told her no, it was her fault and she needed to be more careful. She responded by telling me I was wrong and didn't know what I was talking about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, Already having a bad day I decided to show her why she was wrong. I pulled up her download history and showed her exactly how she got the toolbar. After this she started to tell me I was wrong and that she was not \"some stupid old lady\" and that I was making fun of her. She then started ranting to me before I just got up and left. I told her she was wrong and to just accept it.   \n\n\nTo this she said, \"How dare you talk back to me like that you brat. I'm your grandmother, when I say something you do not disagree with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI responded with, \"Well fuck you then you stupid bitch. I don't have to sit here and listen to your senile rant. Don't call me again you dumb cunt.\" before stomping out. On my way out as she was yelling I unplugged her ethernet cable from her router and blocked her number on my phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, since then she has been calling my parents non-stop telling them how much of a \"little shit\" I am and that I need to come back and fix whatever I did to her computer because she \"can't reach google anymore\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas what I did wrong? I feel a little bad but honestly, I'm sick of her and her shit. I know she's family but I don't think I should have to deal with this crap. ",

      "description": "When my mom was 18 she hooked up with a guy named Bryan who was 17 and together they had me. Bryan didn’t want to be a father so he left my mother.\nYears later my mom met a guy named Ryan and had a kid with her named Ellie.\nThen later my mom gets with another guy named Kyle and they have a kid named Laurie.\nRyan, my first step-dad. My mom and him used to switch Ellie and I every week.\nRyan is with a girl named Amy. Amy had a kid named Lyle. They had a kid together named Winston. \nAbout a year ago I came out and told my second step-dad Kyle that Ryan’s father, Chris, had been sexually harassing me for the past year. To name a few things he did:\n-He offered to buy me a dildo. When I laughed and said my parents wouldn’t like that he said I didn’t have to tell them\n-I was in a night gown one night and he was making a movement with his hands and when I looked down I realized he was staring at my privates under my night gown\n-He would constantly rub my thighs closer to the parts I didn’t want him to touch\n-He would groom me by getting me foods\n-He shoved his hand down my shirt and tried to grab at my chest. I slapped his hand away \n-When I told him about my online boyfriend he asked me if I had ever orgasmed before. I said “maybe” and he said “you haven’t. If you did you would have known.”\nOnce I told Kyle he told me I could stay with them. Ryan wanted me to be the one to fix our relationship after everything that happened. I had to get therapy and deal with all the pain and trauma his father caused all on my own. \nNow for the part why I’m truly mad at his side of the family: \nThey abandoned me. I tried so hard to try and fix things with Ryan.\nI’ve had an incredibly hard time dealing with the pain and trauma of all of this. I break down a lot and sometimes someone just touching me slightly makes me think that Chris is there trying to touch me. \nRyan’s entire family all think I’m an asshole, even Ellie. Ellie and I used to be so close but now she basically hates me and yells at me whenever she gets the chance. I don’t know what to do. Am I an asshole for reporting Chris? For the past year I’ve struggled with this question and I guess asking a bunch of people on reddit is how I’ll decide.\nNote: Please don’t come on the post and comment that Chris didn’t actually harass me sexually or that I’m not really trans because I wore a night gown at one time. None of that will help me figure out if I am the asshole or not. \n\n",

      "title": "AITA For breaking things off with my SO for suspicious activity?",
      "description": "TLDR at the bottom. \n\nI’ll try to keep this short and sweet. My SO and I (we will call her “Alex”) we’re seeing each other for about 6 months. Things were perfectly fine, we got along great with each other’s family/friends, our personalities/hobbies/interests coincided with one another’s very well, and we both had stable lives (she was in grad school I work full time after graduating last year). About 3ish weeks ago I introduced her to my parents (to me this is a big step. Friends/siblings are one thing, parents are a sign of faith in one another) and things went very smoothly over dinner and drinks. She had to get up early for a rotation the following morning so I dropped her off around 8 and went to finish the night with a few drinks at a friends house. My friend who is single was casually scrolling through Bumble (a dating app for those who are unaware) and suddenly came across Alex. Immediately I felt all the emotions, stun/fear/confusion/etc, but after some discussion my friend and I rationalized it as she either didn’t delete the app because she was never very active on it or the app does not delete your account automatically upon deleting the app. Sounded reasonable enough. Over the course of the next few weeks things started to seem erratic and I’m not sure if it’s subliminal paranoia or if it’s legitimate concern. At first i started to notice how little we actually hung out without having a bar/restaurant/excursion involved, and when asked she gave a very easy answer of “I hadn’t thought about it, I guess we just don’t have much time as is and going out just seems to come up. We can start staying in more from now on though”, which was more than good enough for me. But then when she started coming over I’d notice her consistently snapping and DM’ing the same guy (no text message/call that I had seen) late at night. Again I rationalized it as he was just a friend and that was when he was free/bored around his phone.  Then she started randomly not responding to ANYTHING for long periods throughout the day, with a short text following when she finally did respond. Finally she started blowing off plans very very abruptly (which was extremely out of character for her. Alex was always punctual and at the least gave notice if she was late or if things would change). We’d have something set for days in advance then 5 minutes before she would cancel, or she would not answer at all and text back a few hours after apologizing that she had randomly fallen asleep at 5pm. Things came to a head when after 6 straight days of cancelled plans I asked her if something was wrong and told her things were feeling strange lately. I asked her about the guy she was talking to, why suddenly her time seem to be stretched so thin, and why she seemed to distant lately. She accused me of feeding into insecurities and told me that nothing had changed. After a few hours of back and forth followed by a few days of not talking, we were done.\n\nTLDR; Am I the asshole for assuming there was something going on when things started to look suspicious? ",

      "description": "Hey everyone, first time poster and I’m on mobile, so sorry for any issues that come up. For background, I’m a 16 year old girl on the west coast (will be important later), and I was playing League of Legends by myself a couple months ago when I met C. \n\nC had a falling out with his previous friend group on league, and began to vent to me about how that group were basically his only friends, and he couldn’t believe what he even did for them to react like this. I’m normally a sympathetic person, so I continued to talk to him in order to keep him company. \n\nEventually, we traded Instagrams, then numbers.  He kept talking to me about my looks, calling me pretty, etc. He asked how old I was, and I told him 16. He was shocked and said, “you look way older.”\n\n\nHe was 19, so at the time, we agreed to just stay friends. Until a few days ago. \n\nMy schedule was packed at the time, so I did not have time to play League, and we stopped talking for a while. I saw him on recently, and decided to invite him for a game and called him on discord. \n\nAfter that, he starts sending me good morning/night texts, and from that day that we started to chat again, I played League with him every night. Since he lived on the east coast, he was 3 hours ahead of me, staying up until 1-2 am for him JUST to play league with me. \n\nHe began to call me “cute” and “beautiful” periodically as we’re playing. At first it was okay, but it soon made me feel uncomfortable, but I made jokes out of it to try to get rid of the awkwardness. \n\nI made an offhand comment to him about how I was planning on buying Gun Goddess Miss Fortune, which, for those of you who don’t know, costs around $20 worth of in game money. Soon after, I receive a notification saying that I received a gift. And what was it? Gun Goddess Miss Fortune. From C. \n\nLast night, C admitted to wanting to have a relationship with me, to which I replied again that I was underage. I found out that the age of consent in his state was 16, while the age of consent in my state was 18. I told him that even though it might be legal in his state, I was not comfortable in having a relationship with him because of the age gap. \n\nEven after that, C still continued to call me cute and comment about my looks. I hadn’t told him before that it was making me uncomfortable as I try to avoid confrontation as best as I can, but I felt like I had to make my opinion known to him. \n\nI told him that his compliments were making me uncomfortable and asked him to stop, and he agreed, but still held on to that that mentality when talking to me. \n\n\nI talked to some people about this, and they all told me to block him as he is still making advances on me knowing I’m still underage. But I feel guilty as he stays up late just to talk to me, and spent his own money just to make me happy. WIBTA?",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom, didn't realize I would ramble this much.\n\nThis happened an hour ago. \n\nBeing in university, and with midterms coming up, I am completely swamped between completing assignments and studying for the tests. So, around this time in the semester, my day is spent mostly in my room studying, only leaving twice to eat with my family, and going to the bathroom, showering, etc. My parents can get a little frustrated with me being in my room all day studying, but for the most part they bite their tongue because it's for my education. \n\nNaturally, I'm studying in my room, and my sister(13) comes in and asks if I can take the dog outside, but also includes that if I don't want to, then she has no problem doing it herself. However, I know that my dad has an issue with my mom or my sister going out to the yard alone, so whenever one of them says he needs to be taken out, I will typically volunteer if I'm not doing anything at the time. I ask her what everyone else is doing, because I'm busy studying so if anyone else has nothing to do then maybe they would be able to do it. My sister wasn't doing anything and my parents were watching TV.  I told my sister that I'm working, but that I'll take him out anyways because my parents will be annoyed if I don't (because I made my younger sister do it instead of doing it myself). \n\nReluctantly, I got up and took him outside to walk around and go to the bathroom. When I came back inside, I went to the living room and, as calmly as possible, said to my parents:\n\n\\[M: Mom, D: Dad, Me: me\\]\n\nMe: \"Guys, I have no problem with taking \\[my dog\\] out, but I'm studying and nobody else is doing anything, someone else could have taken him out.\"\n\nM: (Passive-aggressively) \"Oh sorry, we have made a mistake asking you, please forgive us.\"\n\nMe: \"I just said I have no problem taking him out, but if I'm busy and nobody else is doing anything, why can't anyone else do it?\"\n\nD: \"You should be able to do anything anyone asks you to do, you have to start taking responsibility and helping out where you can.\"\n\nMe: \"But you guys are just watching TV, and \\[sister\\] isn't doing anything either, why did I have to take him out when I was the only one actually doing something?\"\n\nM: (yelling now) \"We said we won't ask you again! Why are you making this more than it has to be!?\"\n\nMe: \"It makes no sense, anyone else could have taken \\[dog\\] out, I'm the only one who is busy right now\"\n\nM: (still yelling) \"Stop arguing! We said we won't ever ask you anymore! You don't do anything at home anyways so it was our mistake to expect you to do this!\" \n\n\\[This especially ticked me off because I don't even live at home for the most part. My university is closer to my aunt's house, so I live with them and come home for the weekends only.\\]\n\nMe: \"Okay.\"\n\nand then I walked back to my room, and I could still hear them talking about how I \"don't do anything\".\n\nTL;DR - Parents told me to take the dog out while I was studying, and nobody else in the house was doing anything. I take him out, but I also tell them somebody else, who isn't busy, could have taken him out. They snap at me.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

They told me it was $60 for a diagnosis, and then they give a quote for how much labor and replacement parts cost.\n\nThe repair guy takes a look at the stove, unscrews a few screws makes an adjustment and then screws the unit back together. I ask him what the quote entails as far as parts and labor and how long it would take to fix, and he said \"There's no parts to order, I already fixed it. somebody just had it screwed it on wrong\". Then he hands me a bill for $120.   I told him I was expecting to pay $60 for a diagnosis and to get a quote and he said he fixed it while diagnosing it so I had to pay $60 for the labor.  \n\nI refused to pay for labor and told him that he should have told me what the problem was and asked if I was willing to pay $60 labor to have him do the work instead of just doing the work and expecting me to pay.  At the end of the day, he walked away with $60, but he was not happy about it. Am I the asshole?

The reason this is important is that my uncle and my grandfather like to call me but I would say about 80% of the call is about my brother. My brother doesn’t really like to call them either (I don’t know why) so they like to call me asking how he is and it gets tiring after a while of getting called and then being asked how my brother is so they can brag about him to their friends. I decided to stop calling my uncle but that also started another problem. When I would talk to my grandfather (he asks about my brother too but to a lesser extent) so after about a couple hours after me and my grandfather talked my uncle asked why I don’t call him and other things that make me feel guilty.

I work part time and I am mostly supported by financial aid.\n\nToday, I was walking to class and I make eye contact with someone campaigning for the trees in California. He walks up to me and says, \"Wow! Thank you for noticing me! People have been ignoring me all day.\" This made me feel bad and I gave him my time of day thinking he just wanted me to sign his petition. \n\nHe starts his speech about deforestation in California and says all he's looking for is a signature for his petition. Perfect, I sign the petition and I think that's the end of it. But he starts going on about contributions to his cause.  I start to feel a little awkward and I usually don't know how to react in these kinds of situations. It's very easy to sell me something. I'm a wuss, I know.\n\nI start to oppose and he takes my belongings (I was holding my jacket, a water bottle and a bag of chips) and gets me to sit with him at a nearby table. He is a pretty good salesman and starts to make me feel guilty about not contributing. He asked me things like, \"isnt it a waste of time to sign my petition and not contribute?\" And \"you're a university student working towards your future. What if CA doesn't have a future? Don't you want your kids to see how beautiful CA is?\"\n\nI start to tell him that I'm a student and I don't have any money to give him. He starts to tell me \"low cost\" payment options. He says that one-time contributions of any amount can only be made with cash. If I use a debit/credit card, it will have to be monthly contributions of $20+. I told him, \"I don't carry cash on me and I don't feel comfortable with having monthly payments. I just don't have that kind of money.\"\n\nHe started asking, \"well what CAN you give?\" And I said, \"If I had cash, I would probably give you $10\". He said, \"Well ok! We can take the $10 with your debit card\". And I asked, \"well can I make a one time payment of $10 with my debit card?\" And he says \"no, but just put down your information and it'll charge it monthly.\" \n\nI then asked him, \"If I do it monthly, can I just cancel after one payment?\" And he looks at me like I just insulted him and said, \"well I'm really not looking for contributions for you to just cancel after one payment.\" And I told him again, \"I don't want to make monthly payments\". We went back and forth for a while. \n\nI finally gave in and signed the contribution just to get away from him. The form did not have a beginning date or an end date. He told me it would charge me indefinitely until I cancel.\n\nI feel very icky about the whole thing. I am very stressed out about the $10 a month so I am thinking of emailing the organization to cancel and report my card lost before they could charge me. Will I be the asshole if I do that? Am I legally obligated to pay them $10/month because I signed a contribution form?",

      "description": "Throwaway as I know my flatmate browses.\n\n**TL;DR** - moved into a new house with best friend, their SO is living with us and is meant to pay a third of the rent from 2nd month but at the last minute refused to. I said I wouldn't cover the shortfall and now (because of bullet 1 below) they are acting rudely toward me in my own home and I have been asked to just ignore it, but I don't feel I should - am I missing something?\n\nI recently rented a new house with one of my best friends and we had agreed that their SO would move in with us after the first month (the SO had to give a month notice on their flat) and that we would pay an even share of all costs after that point (so it would be 1/3 from then on). I paid half of the fees, deposit and first month's rent and my friend paid the other half. SO moved in practically straight away and has been at the house 4+ nights a week. \n\nA few points for context:\n\n* The house wasn't available right away and there was a month gap where I would have to find somewhere to stay, my best friend had a month left on their contract so I agreed to pay my them 2/3 of their rent costs and they stayed at their SO's place for the month (for free) so that we could offer on the new house together.\n\n* The SO did not want to pay any deposit money or to be on the contract, which I'm fine with because couples have a tendency to break up and that would make things messy if they had paid money for the deposit.\n\nIt was a couple of days until we were due to pay the second month and my friend asks to speak to me and says that their SO has said it's not fair that they pay for the month as they technically wouldn't be \"moving-in\" until a few weeks after and then would be away over Christmas etc. As it turns out, the SO did not give notice in time on their current place and would be having to pay an extra month there. As an alternative the SO said that I should show gratitude to them (e.g. cover their rent) because I had stayed in my best friends room (which I paid them for!) whilst my best friend had stayed at the SO's place.\n\nI said that if the SO was on the contract then this wouldn't even be up for debate and that, in any case, I shouldn't have to cover the cost of their mistake and that it wasn't fair for them to ask me to. We left it at that, and SO's costs have now been covered by best friend (which I still don't think is fair on them). \n\nI've now been warned by best friend that SO is royally pissed at me (too angry to even be reasoned with) because they think I am ungrateful and that I should expect but ignore rude behavior toward me. AITA for wanting to tell SO quite bluntly to give it a fucking rest and quit acting out? I don't think I should have to stay quiet, but I am worried there's something I'm missing here?\n\nEdit- formatting",

I had heard the bagels there were good, so I was really inspecting them, hoping to find a choice pack of bagels, but I was having a hard time evaluating their freshness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a store employee stood right next to me, facing outwards, not performing any specific task but kind of standing 'on-alert' for requests or just keeping an eye on the store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned to him with a pack of bagels in my hands, and said, verbatim (to the best of my recollection):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'Yo, are these bagels the fresh ones?'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe turned to me with a scowl and said 'First off, my names not yo'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI immediately backpedalled and apologized, and then introduced myself. He simply pointed to where his name badge normally would be, but there was no badge, then kind of snorted and shook his head. He then pointed me to the right part of the store for fresh bagels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said 'thanks boss' before turning to go to that section, but he replied loudly 'I'm not the boss, she is' and pointed to another employee. I left it at that and went to get my fresh bagels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was pretty shaken up by the encounter, and am genuinely open to the possibility that what I said was out of line and an inappropriate way to greet a stranger. For some context, I'm a young guy and he also appeared to be a young guy (early to mid 20s?) which is part of why I felt comfortable asking the question the way I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've brought this up with my friends who think there was a racial dimension to the whole incident (I'm Asian and he was black), and that maybe he felt disrespected because he thought I was putting on a show or speaking down to him or something? But that's honestly just the way I speak and how I grew up talking to my friends. Is there a racial aspect to the word 'yo' I might be unaware of as well?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also thought that maybe he's a very prim and proper kind of guy, but later in that same trip I heard him yell out 'Yo, we got any cakes in the back?' which, I'm not gonna lie, annoyed me a little bit.

      "description": " \n\nSo today is my birthday (yay me) and I've had plans with my family to go out to dinner all week. I was with my girlfriend for most of the morning and we were hanging out playing a game together, my mom came in and let me know that we were going to be leaving earlier because there was suppose to be freezing rain (We had a storm the night before so it was pretty bad). I forgot to let my girlfriend know and just continued to play the game with her. It just sorta slipped my mind I wasn't paying much attention to my mom and heard just enough to clue into it, but yeah I forgot to let her know I was leaving earlier. \n\nWhen the time to leave finally came around my mom was telling me to hurry up and that everyone was ready to go and they were just waiting on me, I had told my girlfriend that we were leaving earlier because of the freezing rain. I left our discord call and was trying to type to her as much as I could while my mom is rushing me out the door, My girlfriend was super upset that I didn't let her know we were leaving earlier and was saying if I leave I will \"regret it\" and was trying to make me not leave. My mom started yelling so I told my girlfriend I loved her and that I would try to message her if I could. I walked up the stairs and open up discord to find out she changed her profile picture to a picture she knows I don't like having as a profile picture because it is a bit revealing. she has down this multiple times and each time I've freaked out and begged her to take it off. But after I see this when I open my phone I get really upset and I start flipping and I did say something like \"BooHoo I didn't let you know right when I found oh\" and I was basically being pretty rude. She said if I went out with them I'd regret it and to come back right away, I told her I couldn't and she got more upset. \n\nAs we were driving there she continue to threaten me. When we finally arrived she had texted me with a picture of her sending private photos to another guy (Later I found out she didn't, but led me to believe she did) and kept saying she would send my stuff around as well. She said she would add my friends and send them my stuff and basically was just throwing threats around. When I finally got home I told her I wanted to hang out with my family and she proceeded to threaten me even more saying \"If you leave you will regret it\" and I finally told her I'd be fast. I came back and we started arguing again it feels like at least to me she is trying to deflect and minimize everything she has done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for forgetting to tell my girlfriend that we were leaving earlier that ended up turning into this big mess and blaming her and saying she ruined my birthday? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso sorry if it's a little hard to understand or follow, I'm very bad at writing and getting my thoughts out in a understandable manner.",

Dad (carpenter by trade) asks to clear the deck awning every few inches of snow so it doesn't cave in\n\nSimple enough, at this point it's been 3 weeks and it has snowed a few times, each time I cleared the awning using this ridiculous shovel thing that is 20 feet long. Recently we were meant to get 5-8 inches over night and I had to be at work at 7 so with shoveling I have to wake up at 4, so I go to bed at 8. I wake up to over a foot and a half of snow, at this point I started shoveling and when it became clear I was going to be late for a variety of reasons and it was getting hazardous I call out. I continue to shovel and eventually got the drive way and front door cleared so I move to the awning. I should mention at this point the awning is not ready for winter it's a tarp being supported by \"special\" treated 1/2 in. wood, yeah you know a functional redneck tarp for the deck. Each snow fall before the tarp held fine, but that was 3 inches at a time. This time the tarp is starting to cave in and the wood is caving with it, I send a pic saying the awning is caving in and what happened and start clearing knowing this is gonna be bad. Less than 5 minutes later he says \"Thanks for nothing can't even do what you're told, some marine\" (I was active duty, got out about 2 years ago). At this point I stop clearing the tarp and just start moving the stuff under it out of the way and respond \"fuck off, What did you want me to do wake up in the middle of the night to clear your half-assed deck? If this is so important drive back up and clear it yourself.\" At this point he tells me to call his friend and our neighbor over to prop the thing up and fix my fuck up. The snow is still there and I'm waiting for it to cave in, and they are still gone. I can predict the verdict will probably be EHS but seriously if he said this was a final product to his client they would demand a full refund, and the best part is he decided to not take it down when he had the chance because fuck it. Further to my point I told this story to my neighbor and his friend, both said they aren't helping it's his fault, let it fall. Dog is fine though, he's a good boy.",

      "description": "First post, sorry if it isnt up to standards but I need clarification &amp; advice as to if I am over reacting.\n\nA little bit of background:\n\nHis culture is very social, they are very family oriented and like to go out to each others houses and celebrate and party. They hug and kiss every single person when they arrive and hug and kiss when they leave the event. His family is always together and thoroughly enjoy socializing until the sun comes up (literally).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family is the opposite.  I guess we don't really have cultural social traditions like my boyfriend does. We rarely go to parties because my parents just prefer not to. Both of their jobs are extremely social (Mom is an ER Nurse and my dad is a police officer) so they just want to come home and relax. I never had to socialize with other people besides school and work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, him and I have been together for a year and his family absolutely loves me and I love them too. I am always invited to any social gathering they go to. I went to thanksgiving with them at their uncles house and I felt so left out I  never wanted to go to another gathering with them again. When we walked through the door, I was greeted with tons of hugs and kisses from people I don't know, which makes me extremely uncomfortable. I do NOT like being touched by strangers, and I hate being forced to do so. I sucked it up and started the night off with some wine to calm some my nerves and some anxiety. It only got worse from there. His friends and family don't prefer to speak English and that is the only language I speak. So my boyfriend had to translate for me or summarize the conversation while I just sit there and nod with a smile. I wanted to go home. They kept asking him things about me in their native language when they could have said it in English to me. His family knew I was uncomfortable the moment I had to hug and kiss everyone, and his sister pulled me aside and said \"Its our tradition, you need to get used to it.\" I got mad and said \"Well that is not MY tradition.\" Which now that i look back on it, i feel really disrespectful about. My boyfriend did not leave me side and tried to comfort me as much as he could, but I am not a very social person-- i cant even be social if they aren't speaking to me in English. I've even tried to pick up on some phrases to try to talk to them. They even expected me to stay out until 3/4 in the morning. I said no and I wanted to leave. I had enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe entire night made me feel uncomfortable and my boyfriend knew that. I don't want to go to other social gatherings with them again. I have told them I get some pretty bad social anxiety in situations like those and all they said was \"get well!\". I don't think they understand very well, as they don't have that issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(This is also just one instance there have been multiple)",

      "description": "This is my first post here, I hope I'm doing it right.\nSo we've been friends for 6+ years now and we've had each other's backs all along. We were inseparable every day, he would help my family when I'm at work and I'd help his when he was busy. \nHe was that one friend who could never get together with the girl he liked, and I have had different girlfriends for the period of time, but never have I left him alone or dumped him because of that. I would always take him with me if it was okay with my girlfriend and the three of us had fun all the time. He was always my first choice, not my girlfriends. A few months ago he finally got together with a girl for the first time in his life and they have been together every day, every night and whenever he has free time. He stopped calling me, he stopped asking me to hang out. So basically if I don't call he won't ever and if I were to call I'd always get the same answer: \"I'm going out with my girlfriend, sorry\". I've told him countless times that he is being an awful friend as I was in need of support recently and he wasn't there to talk to me, he didn't even ask. I have always been there for him and I still am, yet again he just refuses to accept that he has changed his attitude towards me and we are constantly arguing about it, whenever we talk. Now I know that you can't expect people to treat you the same way you treat them, but am I an asshole for shaming him for it in front of everybody (family, friends, even his gf) every time he dumps me for her? Every time I tell him we need to talk about it he says we will, but we never get to. What is your opinion?",

      "description": "Obligatory formatting because on mobile...\n\nBackstory:  37 years old now, I’ve know this guy J since high school, so close to 20 years.  A few years ago during the 2016 election cycle we got into yet another argument where he would push his views onto our group chat without doing any reading.  I pointed this out to him and he blew up and got pissed because he felt that I was always belittling him and trying to pick fights.  I tried to make amends but he wasn’t having any of it.  Now I like a good debate as much as the next guy but J would always just read the headline of an article and argue his point off that.  Several times I’ve had to point him to the same news article that would refute his entire argument.  It was extremely frustrating any honestly sometimes I really did think he was just trolling all of us.\n\nA few months ago he reached out so we met up and talked things over.  Basically he asked me to be nicer and to choose my words differently when arguing so as not to be such an asshole.  So I told him that I couldn’t do that because I literally felt like I was being trolled most of the time.  I didn’t feel like I should change if he was just going to continue trolling me.  In addition to all this I asked why he even wanted to be friends anyways?  He had been dating someone and we never saw him anyway.  We’d ask him to hang out, get a drink, whatever...but he was always too busy.  For his birthday another friend asked him to get drinks on a weekend and he just flat out said “I’m busy every weekend of the summer”. We all know it’s because he goes to see his SO every weekend,and he rather spend his time that way.\n\nTo be honest I’d already written him off as a friend just because we would never hang out, we would chat in a group chat but that was it.  So my thinking was, why should I change my behavior to save a ‘friendship’ when truthfully there wasn’t anything to save?  I couldn’t depend on the guy to be there when I needed him, so why bother?  I thought I made it clear to him that I welcome him as a friend but I would not change myself for him.  But he’s been talking to my other friends telling them that I’m some monster that has no interest of reconciling.\n\nSo AITA for just telling him like it is?  I dont think longevity is a criteria for friendship and sometimes they just die out.  If we actually hung out a lot together or missed the fact that we see each other I’d probably be more receptive to changing but fact of the matter is, I rarely saw him prior to our falling out so it doesn’t seem like a big deal to me to ‘lose’ this friend\n\nTLDR; friend of 20 years wants me to be less argumentative so he can call me a friend.  I said no because I don’t really consider him a friend so much anymore.\n\n",

      "description": "I've known and hung out with my friend Dave for 4 years. Over those 4 years we've had some good to great times. Our friendship on retrospect was superficial. It revolved on smoking weed, drinking, and video games. But i felt close.\n\nOver the better part of the past couple he has been with Sarah. Sarah was always cool and we became friends but I never really tried to get in between their relationship. They broke up in October and since that time, Sarah and I have become very close. \n\nNow this seems like it's going a certain direction but i promise this has been nothing but platonic from the jump. I had never hid the fact that Sarah and I hang out from Dave.\n\nNow Sarah and I had a palentines day where we played with like 5 other people where we just played pong and board games. I told Dave this and he blew up at me, threw expletives and caused a real fracture in the friendship.\n\nFast forward to last weekend and Dave and I go to the gym. It's here he \"confides\" in me that he hasn't been coming to the gym because he's been experiencing symptoms from a so-called std he got from Sarah. I know immediately that this iss bullshit.\n\nNot only has it been since October since they slept together, she never cheated although he did. He's fishing for a reaction for me or counting on me to tell her to get her to confront him. Basically i felt like he was just trying to manipulate me. \n\nI made a choice to tell her because i choose this friendship that has become very important to me. They had a drunken interaction tonight on St paddys where everything came to light and he knows i told her. I feel this effectively ends our friendship.\n\nSo, am i the asshole?\n\nTldr; Superficial friend told me a bullshit lie that his ex girlfriend gave him an std. I told her because i value that friendship more.",

      "description": "So here is the backstory- this might be long, so please bare with me. I work at a large non-profit, but at a small local office. I am on a team with four other members, all female and one male. The male and I are the same position (although I arguably carry all of the workload) and we frequently have to work together to get tasks done. Male shall be referred to as Richard from here on out (name changed for confidentiality purposes). The other females on our team will be referred to as Angel, Suzie and Debbie (team supervisor).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRichard is one of the most unprofessional people I have ever worked with, constantly interrupting people's flow (we work in a large, open desk room and concentration is lost quickly when someone interrupts) and not getting his work done in a timely manner. We really suffer due to his lack of professionalism, specifically in office outcomes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Halloween, there was a large party at one of our coworkers house, in which Richard was in attendance. He consistently over-drinks at group gatherings, work related or not, and this night was no exception. He was pretty intoxicated, and ended up getting into a small (but incredibly damaging) confrontation with one of the females on our team. Angel called out his behavior in regards to women. He is a womanizer and is constantly jumping from girl to girl. He was livid and privately spoke to me about the matter, in which he was vehemently angry, almost to a point at which I was scared for my own well-being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, Richard held that resentment towards Angel, and it really started to eat away at him. He would bitch about Angel to other team members in private, and was PISSED that she did not apologize to him (ridiculous, I know). A couple of weeks ago, Richard began berating me because I would not give him one of my personal office supplies that I bought with my own money. He refused my no's three times, and finally, Angel stepped in. He verbally snapped at her in the office, and at one point lunged at her in a threatening way (he is much bigger than she is). Luckily our head boss of the office was able to step in and diffuse the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then, our head boss has been having private meetings with each person involved in the conflict. Suzie pulled me aside one day and showed me a notebook in which she had been documenting every instance of inappropriate behavior committed by Richard at work events or in the office. There were 17 documented instances within the span of 8 months. Some of them were directed at her, and bordered on sexual harassment. I was floored. I never thought things were that bad, and I sure as hell didn't think that Suzie was documenting everything. Suzie met privately with our head boss and laid everything on the table, and our head boss was devastated. We work with vulnerable populations in our community, and this is a serious red flag for our head boss. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI began thinking about all of the times Richard made me feel uncomfortable. He has commented on my rapid loss of weight while in the office (I suffer from an eating disorder), has physically pulled me out of my office chair to hug me (after I had stuck my hand out only to be shaken) and has asked me who the biggest guy I've ever slept with was (referring to genital size). The worst instance took place when I was brand new with the company. I drove his car home from a work-related party with him inside (he was on the verge of black-out drunk and was in no shape to drive). I walked him to his door, and gave him a hug. As we hugged, he kissed my neck. I was unsure if he meant it for my cheek, but it landed on my neck. It was something that really shook me up. I have had past experiences with sexual assault, and this kind of brought it all back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this to say, I had a friendship with him for long period after the kiss on the neck took place. We would regularly hang out with one more of our coworkers outside of work, but never one on one. I attended his birthday trip, and I would say we we friends. He told me a lot of personal information about his mental health/alcohol problem and I would always try to be patient and understanding. I never brought it up with him out of fear of retaliation (you saw how he reacted with Angel) and was nervous that he may not even remember it. I'm afraid that if I bring it up with my head boss, and he finds out, he will confront me with a \"what the fuck? everything was fine for 8 months? why now?\" I am really struggling working around him, as he makes me feel very uncomfortable, and tense. My meeting with my head boss is tomorrow morning, and I am not sure if I should bring it up or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA for presenting this information about Richard to our head boss, even though we were close friends after the most severe incident took place?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- Male coworker is in trouble for workplace aggression &amp; head boss is interviewing all involved. I'm pondering bringing up a sexual assault experience, but hesitant because we were good friends after the incident took place.",

      "description": "I am a clean person and take special note to keep my private bits fresh. I am also very sensitive and use unscented laundry soap. That said, with any sexual partner I have had I make sure to remind them that they need to be sanitary before any kind of contact. This means recently showered, hands washed, and if they want to go down on me they need to use mouthwash first (my gyno said that mouth germs can cause things to get funky). \n\nI made my current fwb aware these things being important to me when we engage. As much as I love the heat of the moment, several times I have had to stop him before things got more heated to tell him to go wash his hands. It is kind of annoying and makes me wonder if his past partners did not care as much about their well-being. He has told me before that he washed them *recently*. But I would see him touching his phone, game controller, or whatever germ harboring thing. I explain to him that he needs to wash them right before. The next few times I remind him until I trust he will respect my wishes. \n\nWell, a few days ago things got hot between us. It was very much in the moment, so when he was reaching his hands down my pants I did not say anything and enjoyed. He continued with his mouth, which I blindly assumed was clean. We finish up and all is fine. Within the next few times I go to the bathroom I notice that things start to smell fishy down there. I had not seen him go right before we did that, but was not paying attention either. I have never had issue with these kinds of things without impulsive sexual decisions (not STD’s, more like doing things while camping or in other less sanitary situations where immediate hand-washing and that sort of thing did not happen). A friend once told me that vagina’s clean themselves when I told her how much of a stickler I am in bed. I know this is true, but only to a certain extent. \n\nSo now I am left super irritated that he did not mind my wishes and I have to feel like an AH every time I need to remind him to wash up. ",

      "description": "To preface: We are all teenagers, so for sure some of the stuff here is amplified by the general insecurity and dickish nature at our age, sorry if this is a really petty post!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have two friends that I regularly have meals with - my best friend, who is a lesbian (becomes relevant later), and a mutual male friend. The male friend is a bit of a 'player' - he has at least 4 FWBs and often talks about his sex life, which is awkward, since my bestie would be disowned if she got a girlfriend and I'm asexual. We go out for movies/dinner/walks etc around twice a week as a group, but hang out separately as well. Whenever we hang out as a group it's always fun and a good time is had by all, but my bestie generally has to leave first due to her driving and us other two bussing. Invariably, every time that it's just me and the male friend, he makes a comment to me about how much he wants to date my bestie. Comments include 'god, she's so hot', 'what can I say? those booty shorts do things to my dick', 'if she wasn't gay I'd hit that so hard', etc. He never says these things to her - he only ever comments to me once she leaves. There's some underlying resentment there as well because he doesn't believe asexuality is a real thing, and thinks I just need to masturbate to 'fix myself.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMale friend also has an outspoken philosophy that if somebody upsets you, the absolute worst thing you can do is try to talk to them about it. If you can't deal with banter and jokes, that's on you, and any conversation around an issue isn't to be respected. Just hit back harder with another joke, don't show weakness or else people will double down on the thing that's upsetting you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy bestie is aware of these comments that she makes behind her back and is uncomfortable, but is generally afraid of confrontation and doesn't really want to bring it up with him. The problem is more of a me thing. I find it really rude for him to constantly compliment her to me, as well as his attitude towards woman in general being really demeaning and disrespectful. I've told him in confidence that I have self-image issues and I'd prefer if he could keep the compliments between them two, as all it does is make me feel lesser when he constantly talks about how good my bestie is. My bestie agrees thoroughly and is really supportive and understanding, she tells me that he's just trying to mess with me and that in 15 years people won't care about his good looks, and that me and her both will be outta this town and making good relationships together that will matter far more than any scuzzy comments (she's the best &lt;3). She knows about my jealousy and tells me it's coming from a totally realistic place and that it isn't fair for him to say things like that, especially behind her back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've brought it up with him a few times, but he always plays it off as a joke and tells me to get over myself, and that just because he compliments HER doesn't mean he doesn't like ME any less. However, it's been getting to the point where I'm trying to get away from him as quick as I can at the end of a group hangout because I just don't want to hear about how sexy my bestie is and how much fun she was every time. Like.. I'm here too, dude. It culminated yesterday when I had to leave early for a change and he texted me out of the blue that 'after you left his minidate with (bestie) was so much fun. I texted him back and told him that I found it pretty rude to say that to me and that it made me feel like he wished I'd left earlier, and told him to just say those things to his face instead of to me because it was making me feel unwanted. He told me to cut the jealous crap and that he'd done nothing wrong, and that I was just upsetting myself and needed to stop having a rivalry. I think it's fair to say I'm jealous - but in a group of three, he constantly singles her out as the hottest, smartest, most fun. It's hard NOT to feel jealous. I know it's a petty thing to be upset about, and that I should just be agreeing with him and saying 'yes! she IS hot! I know!' because she is, but it's really ruining my time together with my friends and I don't want that to happen. I don't really have any other friends so I've admittedly put up. I repeated myself and asked him to just compliment her instead of make comments to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Male friend in a group of three constantly talks about how cool and hot my bestie is to me and won't stop, especially once I leave the group hangout, despite knowing I have issues with that and asking him to stop several times. It makes me feel unwanted by comparison and want him to just compliment her direct instead of me having to hear about it. He thinks I'm jealous and am responsible for being in control of my own insecurities. I'm worried that I'm overreacting and I'm letting my own issues get in the way of things, but at the same time I'm inclined to think it really wouldn't be hard just to NOT make a comment everytime. AITA?",

      "description": "Going to say right off the bat, my title for this situation isn’t very good, and doesn’t do much justice. I’m just going to type out the scenario, and some of you can put your thoughts below, just ignore the terrible title. \nAs for the person I’ll be bringing up here, I’ll just refer to them as Kendall, since I don’t want to risk any small chances of witch hunting to occur.\n\nSo Kendall and I have known each other for years. We met up on a social media site, and our only way of contacting each other, is through text messages. For the most part, things tended to be pretty laid back. We’d greet each other, say some nice things, and occasionally roleplayed. Nothing much happens in our conversations to be honest. \n\nBut anyways, things started going downhill when I became a bit inactive. I would occasionally disappear for a bit, sometimes for a week or two, sometimes a month. Whenever this happened, she would get upset with me, and understandably so. I genuinely felt bad for not being able to juggle my life outside and inside the phone properly. Soon after though, there were times where she would randomly disappear, or wouldn’t say anything until I messaged her. So now both of us were guilty of doing this, but whenever it was her that disappeared, I never got upset about it. \n\nAfter some time, it started getting to me. I grew irritated whenever she got mad at me over this, as I’ve stated before, we were both guilty about it now. Eventually, I told her that it felt unfair for her to get mad at me like this, especially since I had always forgiven her whenever she was gone for a while. Just to give a little bit context, she got mad when I disappeared for a few days, when some time before, she vanished for a whole month. \n\nShe didn’t take what I said too nicely. Kendall got mad at me for being open about how I felt, and began to spout out how she had been working her butt of in school so that she wouldn’t get beaten. To give some more context, not once had she ever brought any of this up to me. It came out suddenly, and randomly. \n\nEver since then, we have been getting along off and on. One moment we’ll be cheerfully greeting each other, and the other, she’ll get angry over the following things: \n\n1. Me not responding too often. \n2. Me trying to break off our now toxic relationship. \n3. Me not asking about any of her hobbies, or checking up on her personal life. \n\nMind you, she does all of this too, and kinda fails to catch this. \n\nI could go on about the details, but I don’t want this to go on for much longer. If you guys want anymore clarification on the things that have happened between me and this person, you’re more than welcome to ask. \n \nSo, AITA? Honestly though, my post is a jumbled mess. I didn’t necessarily focus on the question I brought up, and I probably didn’t get into a lot of detail over some of the things here. Regardless though, I’d like to know anyone’s thoughts, and I’d be more than happy asking questions.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for planning a poker night while on vacation?",
      "description": "  \n\nFor about 15 years I had a weekly poker game with a group of friends. We played for low stakes (winning or losing more than $50 in a night was rare), and while we were competitive the vibe was also casual and fun, with plenty of non poker discussion and kidding around going on.  \n \n\nNear the end of that 15 year period my then girlfriend, now wife, moved to town after we had begun the relationship as a long distance one. She had no interest in poker, so did not attend the weekly game. I am not a super social person and the weekly game was my primary interaction with many of my friends, so my wife felt somewhat excluded.  \n \n\nAfter living with me for about two years we moved across the country to her home state, thus bringing an end to my longtime participation in the weekly game. Since then a couple of the other regular players have also moved away, so there is no longer a weekly game at all. In my new town I've tried to get a new game going (on a monthly basis to start) involving some of my wife's friends, and we've played a few times but haven't yet made a regular thing of it. She has been supportive of this effort.  \n \n\nMy wife and I visit my hometown about once a year, and each time I try to get those people who are still around from the game together to play. This has happened for about three years in a row now. Our next trip is in about a month, and when I asked my wife which nights she thought might be good for me to try to organize poker (we will be there for a full week), she got upset. She wants us to plan a night to hang out with my friends, but to not play poker so that she can be involved.  \n \n\nMy take is that poker is what I did with this group of friends for years. It is our thing. I only visit once a year and so she should not begrudge me a night of poker, even if it excludes her. For the record, she would be welcome to come and either just hang out with us while we play, or let us teach her to play. Her take is that we are excluding her, she isn't getting a chance to spend time with my friends, and I'm taking away a night of our vacation for my own purposes. She made a few friends while living in my hometown but some of them have since moved, and there are maybe one or two left that she could potentially reach out to and see if she could do something with them on the night I play poker.  \n \n\nSo AITA, or is she being unreasonable?",

      "description": "So yesterday was the first time in a few years that my sister came to my grandparent’s house for thanksgiving. My sister and I haven’t been very close since she tried to kill herself in front of me before I left for college.\n\nFor some context, since that incident my sister and I have had a volatile relationship. My first year at school she would send me videos of her self harming in order to get attention. Stole money from me. Started selling drugs. Started using drugs. Stole drugs from our very sick mom.\n\nHer manipulative behavior got her my attention the first year, but for my own sanity I tried to pull away year two—she didn’t take kindly to this and responded by accusing me of battery to try to “ruin my life”, trying to suffocate me in my sleep, stealing my ID, making copies and selling it to her friends.\n\nNow, apparently she’s trying to get clean. This isn’t the first time she’s made an effort. It happens periodically. She tries and then relapses and usually steals a lot of family shit and sells it to get her fix, she probably has BPD. I took a semester off from college Bc I have PTSD following some of the stuff I’ve witnessed at her hands. I’m a work in progress and definitely have a short fuse.\n\nThis was my first time home for thanksgiving since college as well.\n\nMy sister walked in and started typing away on her phone. I said hi, no response. For the last 8 months I’ve made a real effort reconnecting with her, listening to her to blame me for her drug use and unhappiness. Reiterating my love and support for her. Inviting her out for meals and fo cafes. Most of my efforts have resulted in wasted energy. I asked her why she hasn’t responded to any of my texts. She said she’s too busy. My brother asked if she has a job (no).\n\nAt the table she makes a snide comment about me taking time off from school and insults my brother and it really just set me off. She begins talking about how she is thinking of applying To college to study pharmaceuticals (what a great line of work for an addict!). My brother and I begin a line of questioning. How is she planning on financing college? Where does she want to go? Does she know it’s difficult to find scholarships? We aren’t explicitly nasty but definitely asking questions to make her less comfortable. She leaves shortly.\n\nLater last night she texts me telling me she doesn’t respond to my texts Bc I’m a bitch and she’s fed up with me and my brother. I send her a lengthy message telling her I’m no longer going to accept this narrative she paints where she’s the victim. We are making an effort she isn’t entitled to. She needs to make an effort and she was rude first. She replies that I haven’t changed at all, she needs to move on from me so she will now remove me from her life.\n\nMy mom is mad at me for picking a fight with my clearly unstable sister and says I need to be more considerate and patient. I feel like she’s had far too many free passes, and eventually she needs to be held accountable. AITA?",

We were getting ready to smoke outside, using our brand new, one-of-a-kind Pink Floyd bong that my boyfriend and I had just bought together (about a week ago). It was sitting on a table and Jeff asked a question but, when he did, he extended his arms out and a little behind him, knocking the bong onto the floor and breaking it.\n\nJeff was immediately extremely apologetic, but I was still very upset because my boyfriend and I normally keep finances separate, and this was our first bigger joint purchase. It was a total accident, so I can’t be mad at him for breaking the bong because shit happens, it was just pretty disappointing. My boyfriend and I continued to act normal so that we wouldn’t ruin the night, and smoked out of a pipe instead.\n\nJeff never offered to pay to replace the bong even though he broke it, and I was thinking about whether or not I should ask him for the money. On one hand, I feel bad because Jeff is a broke college student, but on the other hand, so are my boyfriend and I. We decided to make the investment because it is something we both really wanted, and it cost us $80. Jeff is unemployed but he should have some birthday money coming soon, I just feel bad asking for it because he never has money. \n\nSo, WIBTA for asking for $80 to replace our broken bong even though it was an accident and Jeff’s birthday?\n\n",

For a while nothing happened until we met again at a later party and both admitted our feelings.\n\nWe hung out a lot, both with friends at parties and just us two eating at restaurants and such. We never really committed to each other or did anything due to her being with someone already and I just don't do that. We just hung out for 3 months.\n\nAfter that, she ended up breaking up with her boyfriend and we got a bit more committed, but nothing serious. A lot of flirting and \"can't wait for you to get home\" texts. Until I found out she was having herself with my best friend, who is better than me in most aspects but he is kind of a loose cannon, doing whatever he pleases. After this I told her that she was obviously not ready to commit to someone like me who is gone for so long at a time. This was while I was at work. \n\nWell, one thing lead to another when I came home and suddenly we were back to how we were before that happent. I forgave her and him because we weren't truly committed and she seemed really sorry.\n\nWell, the exact thing has happened again and I know if I don't do anything it'll just continue to repeat. But, I just don't know if I can get over her. Would I be the asshole for going completely silent on both of them? ",

      "description": "So a little bit of backstory first. \n\nI'm not vegan, my husband is. Yes he is my husband because we're already married on paper. We planned to have our big party this summer. So this party is going to be very different from your typical wedding. We are both pretty frugal and we don't really need or want any unecessary luxuries. It's going to be in our garden, with homemade food, composting toilets and a campfire. \n\nBasically my family is ok with this non-traditional thing, but they kept nagging about the vegan food. They would say things like \"But you need to think about you guest bla bla\"and threatened to smuggle in some meat. I'm really protective of my husband because he's very shy and wouldn't dare to speak up to my family. So at one point I said something like \"If you have a problem with this, don't come\". In my opinion they are just pissed because they couldn't have their way. But maybe it's really a dick move of me and I should be more considerate. What do you think AITA?",

      "description": "There is a stray cat nearby where I work who I see almost every day. Since I got here a year and a half ago, he's had huge matted clumps of fur on his back and shoulder. I didn't want to try to cut it if it was freezing outside, but since it's spring and getting warmer, I figured I could try. Some of the other employees are really protective of these strays and feed them daily, so I'm worried I'll be the jerk for cutting the dead matted fur off this cat. I remember reading once that matted fur can hurt them, but I don't want to put the kitty through it if it's not bothering him. Pics for evidence below.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/MpxEAXQ",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.   \n\n\nWill try and keep it short. I (23 F) am bisexual but I get crap from straight and gay people as I am currently in a relationship with a guy, despite having previously dated both women and men before, and my best friend is gay.   \n\n\nMy best friend had  came out 6 months before this happened, but everyone and their mum knew, and understandingly became very much into pride, extremely vocal about gay rights etc. which I stress, there is nothing wrong with, but this did make him come across a bit sensitive about things. He's not like this anymore.  \n\n\nWe were hanging out and our conversation went like this, not exact words but:  \n\n\nBest friend: Something about Gay Pride this year, excited to go, etc...  \nMe: I dunno man. I think I'm going to give it a pass from now on.   \nBest Friend:  Why so? It's really important   \nMe: I find it silly that it's went from a free event to celebrate and support the LGBTQ+ community to costing a fortune to go, do anything, and I'll be honest, I don't like how I get dirty looks when I show up with my boyfriend.  \nBest Friend: Ah I guess.   \n\n\nThen it were really awkward. A little while later, he asked if I was going to a gay bar he had started going to because no one wanted to go with him anymore. I said no. We are all into metal and punk, and the gay bars in our city all play this crappy pop, synth, dance music.   \n\n\nBest friend then blows up at me, accusing me of being homophobic, not giving a damn about LGBTQ+ rights, and just in general insulting me. I tried to explain but he wasn't having any of it and accused me of faking being bi, despite knowing my previous dating history. The thing is, I used to go to Gay Pride every year, but now it's like £40 entry, everything's like festival prices for food, items, etc. and the music playing is acoustic guitar singers and z list pop bands, and I get made to feel uncomfortable if I attend with my male S/O. I also barely drink. I mainly go to gigs, and I hate sitting in bars, nevermind a bar that plays what is in my opinion shitty music for hours on end. This happened a few years ago. We have made up since then but I wouldn't say we're best friends anymore. We more just catch up with each on FB and very rarely hang out. AITA?",

      "description": "\nSo my cousin, who is one of my best friends got a girlfriend about 6 months ago and stopped  never going out. We used to hang out almost every day but I now see him only when his girlfriend is out of town. We are 20 and live in away from our hometown for uni. We come from a muslim family,and his new girlfriend is christian. His father  knows this and is okay with it, bit it will be relevent later.  So my dad started to ask me why we don't hang around and I told him about the girlfriend. I make sure that he doesn't say this to anyone and knowing that he doesn't care about it. That was 3 months ago.\nSo fast forward to yesterday  I'm talking to my dad and he causally mentions that my uncle is coming to visit and asked about me, my dad told him his son(my cousin) and I don't hang around because he doesn't have time and is in love \nI decide to text the cousin and worn him about this, in case his father asks about us or something like that. Not even 5 minutes later, his girlfriend calls me and starts yelling at me, saying I'm messing with their life, meddling and that she is going to mess with me.I just say that she doesn't have the right to call me and that if my brother has a problem with it he should call.  He calls and very calmly says that he didn't expect me telling my father that he used some excuse about school when they asked him. I ask why did his girlfriend call me, and why is she meddling when this isn't about her, but he claims she is the \"center\" of it. Then my other friends calls me and tells me that I am taking about her in our family, and how she is christian and that can't happen.  \nI text him an apology about me telling my dad, i didn't know it would be a problem and say how I'm hurt that he let his girlfriend talk to me that way, as he is aware about my social anxiety and knows that I hate conflicts, but he did not respond. That was this morning, it's 3am now and I can't sleep because I fill like I betrayed him. \n\n",

It’s been an open secret for a while that he has been having an affair, he would often throw my grandma on a plane to visit us and spend the week with his mistress. There are hundreds of stories of him being an ass to my mom and making awful financial decisions that have put my grandmother in the place she is now. A few years ago my grandmothers hip gave out and needed surgery instead of being kind and helpful he abandoned her a week before Christmas and divorced her. My dad spent a year pulling the family together putting my grandma in a home, selling her old stuff and getting her a new hip. All was well for a few years except his repeated attempts to contact me. My brother still talks to him as he was to young to know what happened. I simply tell him I’m not interested in talking. Then recently my grandmother decided to move to a old folks home near us. So we flew down to Florida to move her out. On the first day my dad decided to have lunch with my grandfather almost as a goodbye because we won’t be returning soon. During that lunch i talked to his new girlfriend and tried my best to ignore him. Until he openly addressed me I answered as abruptly as I could and called him by his first name. He didn’t like that. I felt good doing it but later my dad said it was rude and I kinda feel bad. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My little brother unexpectedly passed less than a year ago. He was only a teenager. He had a condition that was serious but well maintained and his death was incredibly sudden and unexpected. Like one day you wake up to a normal day expecting nothing out of the ordinary and by the end of it, it’s the worst day of your life kind of thing.\n\nObviously nothing can really make this situation better. A few weeks after he passed away I found an event that raised money for the condition that my brother had &amp; I thought it would be a good way of honoring his memory. The event was a couple of months away and my family and I put a lot of effort into raising as much money as we could for our team. On our team page we wrote about what had recently happened, details about my brother and the kind of person he was, and why we were doing the event in his memory. This experience really helped my family. It gave us something to look forward to/actively do for him. It meant a lot to us and gave us a lot of purpose.\n\nWe had a lot of small sum donations that amounted to a good amount. For a while we were the only team and then after we were always the top team. Which sounds so trivial but it meant so much to us to “win” for him.\n\nWell closer to the day of the event another team signed up and started getting big donations. They probably had a team of 4 people with $1k donations each. We had a team of like 50 ppl with small sums that added up to around their total.\n\nI went to look at their page and they had a young child with a condition that was doing really well.That’s what makes me feel like an asshole, because I get why they wanted to win too.\n\nWe worked really hard in order to catch up to them the last couple of days, but it seemed like every time we caught up to them or passed them they would slam down another $500-1000 donation.\n\nAt this point my family &amp; I got pretty crazy competitive and basically did everything we could to win. I’m going to be honest, we probably raised a lot more money because of this &amp; at the end of the day I know that’s what matters - getting the most money for a good cause. Before them we were at like $3-4K and after them we raised like $10k.\n\nAt the event as the top team we were allowed to talked about my brother to everyone there. It meant the world to my family /friends &amp; I. Afterwards, the other team asked to talk to us &amp; told us that they had read our story and said that they were trying to actively beat us. \n\nI guess the thing that really bothered me was that they had known why were doing the event all along &amp; could see how much it meant to us and still tried to beat us. Maybe because I know what it’s like but if in the future a team has recently lost someone I would tell our team that we should help them with donations/win, because I know what it probably means to them.\n\nSo, AITA &amp; in the wrong for reacting like that/feeling this way?",

I’ve told her before about this and she half heartedly apologized, but recently it happened again, and she became upset saying I’m too sensitive. I don’t think I’m being too sensitive, and I’ve never called anything of the sort either (not even “stupid”).

      "description": "GF of a year and a half is having a \"sleepover\" with her two lesbian friends where she will be cuddling and sharing our tiny twin bed with them. I'm not worried about anything sexual happening even though they plan on not being sober all night. I don't expect anything to happen and I told her that, but I also explained how this situation makes me uncomfortable and frankly I don't see it as very mature, and still said that they could do it even though I would feel uncomfortable. I was kinda just shut out and blamed for causing drama for expressing how I feel, even though I said she could do it, even though it makes me uncomfortable...\n\nI'd like to clarify that I don't see anything wrong with their sexual preferences and fully support them, but still don't like the idea of the whole situation. Regardless of whether or not I'm the asshole I probably won't get past being uncomfortable during this situation, but as said before I won't try to stop them, I just feel \"useless\" I guess? I'm not sure how to describe it. Am I out of bounds here for not wanting this?\n\n\nI guess here's more information about me. I am not a touchy person, grew up in a fairly conservative household regarding things like that, but don't really have any issue with other people that hug and kiss etc their friends. And my SO is aware of my more \"distant\" personality, where I choose to only have that kind of connection with very few people that I am close to.\n\nI don't feel like I'm being overbearing here expressing my distaste for the whole event, but still allowing it and stewing in my own distaste of the situation (distaste is probably a strong word here, as I don't really care what others do, but feel like my chosen \"lifestyle\" should have more sway here given my SO and I are together).\n",

      "description": "So a little back story for context. \n\nWe were roommates in college and this friend had done some... questionable things as far as friendship goes. Taking the girl I was seeing at the time (and then sleeping with her in our room constantly), abusive behavior and getting upset over little things, pushing me into and breaking one of our tables, and just generally someone who would put you down for having any opinion that contradicts what you would think yourself. Overall sort of a narcissistic attitude towards everything. \n\nI'm happily married now and before my new life starts I just wanted to reach out and say I'm sorry for not having talked in the longest and that I want to put this old grudge to bed. I still have reoccurring nightmares about this person and how he would act in general, and I'm not sure if it was just a result of the situations or if I was too petty and overly exaggerated things in my head. \n\nAnyway I had called him and we chatted well for a while and I apologized for holding a grudge for so long. After the call he texted me asking if we could hang out soon and I said \"no, nothing personal\" and passed out afterward. I said this because my wife has enough on her plate with immigration and coming over to the US to suddenly deal with the situation of \"Hey that guy I hated and never forgave in college, lets hang out with him lol\" \n\nHe texted me back saying \"well I don't accept your bullshit apology then and it was entirely self serving\" - this was hard to read because I honestly wanted to say I'm sorry and that I want to put this bad part of my life to rest. But somehow he made me feel like it was all my fault that I didn't want to see him just yet to take care of things with my own NEW family first. \n\nI responded saying that I didn't mean for it to sound cold, just that I have enough things to handle for now and I don't think the timing is right (or tbh if the timing will ever be right). I haven't gotten any reply yet and the whole situation is making me more anxious than it should have. I am starting to regret calling him at all. \n\nWhy would I have said \"oh heck yes lets see each other\" when I had just reached out for the first time in --years-- JUST to put this thing to bed, and I have my own work and life situation to deal with. Why did he have to make me feel like shit?\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Its long and complicated so I'll try to keep it short. Throwaway for reasons. TL:DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for over two years, we live together, in our mid 20s, happy, no major problems in our relationship. Now, I love her family and thats the truth. They treat me like their own etc.   \n\n\nMy big(est) issue is that my MIL doesn't have a car, so she relies on my girlfriends lease to get around. In the year and a half that she's had it, she (my girlfriend) has driven double the milage. so on a 3 year lease thats 36k miles, she's already at about 30k, courtesy of her mom 'needing the car'. What do they do in return for her? Nothing. (THEY GOT MAD AT US AND TOLD US WE AREN'T ALLOWED TO USE THEIR LAUNDRY MACHINES BECAUSE WE HAD TO DO LAUNDRY TWICE AT THEIR HOUSE BECAUSE MY WASHING MACHINE BROKE AND I WAS LITERALLY TOO BUSY TO GET IT FIXED. WE BRING OUR OWN DETERGENT!! Yet they let her sister come home and do laundry with her boyfriend whenever they want... Even though we're the ones that have to drive to go get them and drive them to their parents house!) I've tried to tell her that she needs to stop lending her car to her parents because she's always complaining that we can barely get our bills paid, and if she keeps this up, she's going to be a couple thousand dollars in the hole when she goes to get a new car, and when its time to step up to the plate with that money, who's going to help you out then? Not her parents because all they've ever known to do with this girl is take advantage. (I'm talking SERIOUSLY take advantage-- telling her she has to go to a local college because she needs to be able to babysit her younger siblings when her parents are at work... meanwhile they're fully supportive of their younger sister moving to the other side of the country to go to college and come back with nothing but failed classes. Thats a whole 'nother story)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy doesn't her MIL have a car? Because she just doesn't. FIL is a typical douchebag/alpha bro. sits at home all day not working, watching tv with his really big Rottweiler and a gun always at his side (Dog caused damage to the car by biting at it once when he saw a squirrel, and her father has refused to help her pay for it, even though its his dog). using the car thats supposed to be MIL's. So my girlfriend has to leave home early in the morning, bring her mom to work, then go to work herself, to then pick her mother up from work, to bring her grocery shopping, then to her home, then come home herself. Listen, I'm all about helping your family out, but man! Cmon, EVERYDAY you have to go out of your way? Its stressing me out because then I'm the one that gets to hear about it, and then look like the asshole when I say \"maybe you should stop helping them\"  \n\n\nThen comes her pregnant (other) sister who also doesn't have a car, so take one guess as to who needs to go out of her way to do things for her? i'll give you a hint, its not their Father who is sitting at home doing nothing in his car all day. No, Its my GF! Who just took another day out of work last week to bring her sister to a doctors app.   \nThis is ridiculous.  \n\n\nNow heres where I need y'all to judge:  \n\n\na week ago, FiL caught wind that I was 'talking shit about his family' (i.e. I was talking with my gf about all of this, telling her how I felt about her family using her, her pregnant sister relying on her to be a crutch because she and her boyfriend cant afford a place to live, never mind a car, her mother relying on her to do everything, her other sister thats off in college ad come back failing every semester) and he feels disrespected and 'banned me from his house' until I apologize. I Honestly feel like I shouldn't have to apologize because hey, if you feel offended, then that means you did something to make me think of you in a certain way, and you're just offended at the fact that I have an opinion. ESPECIALLY considering that i'm not going around chatting about this shit to friends and family. I've had conversations about this with my GF directly, With my sister because we are each others go to people when we need to vent.   \n\n\nSo tell me, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: FIL 'banned me from his house' until I apologize for having an opinion on the fact that him and his family take advantage of their daughter and are doing nothing to help her out.

      "description": "I'm in a little bit of a dilemma. I don't know if I'm in the right, being upset with two of my best friends. They've been in some kind of relationship for a little over a year, but they've kept it a secret so far. I kind of get, why they would want to keep it quiet, because it could cause some problems at work (the three of us all work together at the same company).\n\nHowever, I did find out pretty much immediately after it started. While it is a little disappointing that they feel the need to keep it a secret from me, that is not exactly what I'm upset about. Both of them have, seperately, talked to me about some pretty private stuff over the years, so they know they can trust me. Also it's not what I would do with a good friend, but I could accept that.\n\nAs I said, the three of us are rather close, so I'm more likely to notice this than most other people. Because of that, they apparently do everything to hide it from me. They lie to me, make up little stories and really go out of their way so that I wouldn't notice anything. This is what really pisses me off about it. I don't want to be lied to on a regular basis by two of my best friends. The worst thing about it is, that he actually knows that I know! A few weeks after it started, I asked him about it. He was a little shocked that I found out, but told me everything. I also told him that everytime they lie to me about it and everytime the three of us hang out together and they act as if everything is normal, it puts me in a really shitty position. I should be enjoying spending time with them, but I can't, because I know that all they do is an act and a lie and that really bugs me. He apologized about that and seemed to really get, why this was a problem for me. Lastly he made me promise to not tell anyone (I wouldn't have done that anyway) and also not to tell her, that I know. I didn't get why, but I decided to go with it. Everything was kinda good after that talk, or at least that's what I thought. However, we haven't talked about it since and nothing has changed. They still do it to this day and I'm really fed up with it.\n\nIn my opinion, that's a really shitty thing to do to a friend. What makes this a little more complicated is, that I have a major crush (at least) on the other friend. Neither of them know about it. I didn't even try anything with her, because she is obviously interested in him, not in me and I absolutely accept that. It does make me wonder, tough. Am I rightly upset, or just jealous?\n\nI realize, that them being involved is their business and I'm honestly not trying to interfere with that. Even the fact that they're trying to hide it from me isn't really the problem. It bugs me, but I guess they're entitled to their privacy? I don't know. But the fact that they keep lying to me almost every day, really pisses me off.\n\nI've been feeling really miserable lately. So much so, that other people noticed, something was up with me. I can't just let that go on any longer. I don't want to lose two good friends, but at this point, I'm not sure, if this can even be called a friendship anymore. I need to talk to them about it. I would honestly prefer to talk to her, just because she does all that, without knowing, that I know about their relationship. He actually does know how this hurts me and he still does it. I can't talk to her, if I want to keep my promise towards him, though. So I guess, I'll talk to him. Before I do that, I would just like to know, if I am right to be upset about this, or if I'm just overreacting or being jealous.\n\nWhat do you think, WIBTA for telling him that I'm pissed about this?",

      "description": "So I am about half a week in a two week long trip in Japan. A friend of mine who was living over seas wanted to tag along for the first week which I was ok with. \nAfter choosing what I felt were decent prices on hostels/airbnbs and showing him how much lodging would cost he showed a bit of hesitation (this was because he was planning on getting a tattoo before the trip) he but he assured me everything would be fine. This should have been a red flag but I gave him the benefit of the doubt because I trusted his judgement. I wanted to enjoy my trip to Japan with my friend. \nI also reminded him many months before the trip about the costs and to make sure he had extra money for his food and travels  \nFast forward to the first day of our trip my friend beings to tell me he doesn't have enough money and that he needs to eat at places that aren't to expensive and also needs to borrow a bit of cash so he can have enough money to take a train ride back to the airport. (Which he didn't research before hand) I was fine with that and asked him if he was going to be ok with the rest of the money that he had. He said it would be ok. \nOn that same day while we were our eating, he asked if he can borrow more money. I told him that the only money I could lend him was the one I gave him for the train to the airport and that was it. \nThis made me lose my trust in his ability to handle his finances. \nAll day today he would make decisions that didn't make sense to me so I would always ask him how much money he has left just to make sure that he wasn't spending the money I gave for his train on other things. He always relied with a vague answer and would tell me not to worry about it. \nAnd while he's telling not to worry about how much money he has left my friend was seriously considering purchasing a souvenir that costed around about half of what I gave him for his train ticket to the airport. \nThis was the last straw for me and at the hostel I confronted him asking him how much money he had left for the trip. He told me once again not to worry about it and to stop asking him. \nI replied that I feel like I have to keep asking  because of the decisions he's been making and now he's upset at me and isn't talking to me.\nAITA?",

When I realized that he’d rather sleep in, I stopped bothering him. \nToday I left for class at 8:05 and kissed him and cuddled him goodbye.

Here's the story, so every since I hit puberty I've been watching porn and mostly haven't thought anything of it since I figured most other ppl do as well. Well when I was younger I watched it pretty frequently but as I have gotten older the amount has significantly decreased, mostly do to me being able to have actual sex. So fast forward to now and I've been dating this amazing girl and we have sex pretty frequently, but sometimes shes not up for it which is obviously gonna happen now and then with anybody. So whenever that happens but I'm really needing release I'll find sometime later that day to take care of myself (which I use porn to help me do). Recently porn got brought up in a conversation which I'm honestly surprised never got mentioned until now and apparently she was under the impression that I didn't watch it, which I then informed her that I did. So now shes very mad at me and says that I've been betraying her trust and practically cheating on her, which I don't agree with at all. I guess i just don't see porn as cheating and I figured that she watched it sometimes also. Now I feel bad because I really hurt her but honestly it just never crossed my mind to talk about it. So Reddit AITA in this situation",

      "description": "Throwaway because friends know my Reddit account.\n\nBasically last night a few friends and I got together at my place for some drinks, one of my friends had just got back from a trip to Asia. While he was out there he kept sending stories to the group chat of girls in bars propositioning him for sex. He says he never slept with any but he mentioning making out with a few. Initially we were just laughing about the situation together until I noticed this huge, nasty looking spot on his upper lip. It had multiple heads and looked way worse than a normal whitehead.\n\nAt the time I noticed we were playing beer pong. I stopped and asked him what was up with his lip, if anything happened to it. He said he just had a spot. I said he should definitely get it checked out because it’s a nasty looking spot and I said I was gonna stop playing beer pong.\n\nI kept stressing I was just taking a precaution and he kept saying it wasn’t herpes. Another friend and I googled images of herpes spots and it looked *exactly* like what our friend had. So we said to him he should get checked out ASAP, he said he’d wait a few days and if it didn’t go down he’d go to the doctors. I’m a little bit of a hypochondriac and I firmly stated he should go first thing in the morning because herpes comes and goes so it doesn’t mean anything.\n\nHe’s a nice guy but he is very reckless and (if I’m honest) pretty dumb and blasé about things - I feel like making out with prostitutes in a foreign country proves this. He’s also a very smelly guy, like he literally stinks, so with his obvious poor hygiene I was really uneasy around someone who was quite possibly infectious and also didn’t give a crap about personal hygiene so I didn’t let him touch my computer to change the music and made him drink out of disposable cups.\n\nAnyway my friend and I weren’t mean to him in the slightest, in fact if it was most of my other friends, who aren’t so sensitive, then I would have just said “bro you have fucking herpes get away from me”. As nice as he is, he should be taking precautions if he’s showing symptoms like that after making out with hookers in third world countries. I made him drink out of disposable cups the whole night and refused to play beer pong,\n\nHe seemed pretty bummed out the whole night. Other friend said he didn’t want to say anything and that he knew I would, but that he didn’t blame me and agreed with everything I said and did. Nobody called me an asshole but seeing my friend be bummed out made me feel like one, even though really I feel like *he* should have been taking precautions and not have left it up to us to say anything.\n\nSo, AITA? I feel justified but I’m no doctor and I don’t know exactly how contagious herpes is so I didn’t want to take any chances.",

      "description": "So last week Thursday I found out my grandpa was in the hospital, hes there every now and then but it's more serious this time. The whole family is there and my mom didnt even tell me he was admitted untill I called her that day to catch up. Hes still there, shes still being vague. That's just how she copes but I'm stressed as fuck. \n\nFriday I asked for over a week prior so I could get together with my group from school for our project, and Friday was the only day we could all meet. I had a really hard time concentrating and spent most of the day crying instead of getting my homework done before our group met up. \n\nSaturday I went into work but I asked to leave early. I told my boss what was going on in a text and hes not the best with handling bad news I guess, he just kept repeating \"your grandpa is in the hospital\" \"I hope hes doing well but I guess hes not doing thaat well because hes in the hospital\" and it just added on. My job keeps me in my head a lot because theres no one to really talk to. I asked to leave early after having a little breakdown in the bathroom (he doesnt know about that) and he agreed. \n\nSunday was my day off. I spent it with a boy whose like white noise. Whenever I'm with him I cant hear anything else and it was really refreshing, I got a lot done for my cultural studies project and I had a really good day in what felt like forever. \n\nSo today I feel like I can think, my grandpas still there but mom says hes coherent and knows who they are. My aunt brought her little dog in (he loves chico) so that was really nice. I asked for today off because I have so much to catch up on after this..emotional rollercoaster weekend. 2 tests due tomorrow, a speech outline, 6 pages of math to go plus some worksheets she gave us. I asked if I could have today off and that it was the last day I needed because everything is happening at once and my boss sent me a text saying how I'm calling off too much (literally just this weekend), how no one can fill my shift (even though theres 2 other employees that could, but he suspended one of them and doesnt want to call him in), and now we need to sit down and \"have a talk\". \n\nI'm just the back of the house. I work 6 days a week and I'm in classes. My life got shook up a bit and I need some time to catch up. I thought I was being reasonable? I have him 6 hours notice. Am I being an asshole? I'm living paycheck to paycheck but I still understand when I need time for school and just, me. ",

      "description": "I'm 19F and live with mom who is widowed at 54. I like to have everything in a particular place: laptop on the table, pens on the right of that, paper on the left, etc. I hoard things that hold sentimental value that I can't find myself letting go of too.\n\nI introduced mom to the KonMari method of cleaning and living lifestyle and she's been thrilled to try it out. It's been really good to her and the house has already felt more comfortable and joyful :) Told her I want to do my own room and things on my own time. Haven't done so yet b/c of school and work, you know how it goes.\n\nGot home from a late shift tonight and walked into my room with all of my clothes piled onto the bed and things gathered into one area (per the KonMari method) and mom going through everything to put into \"sparks joy\" or \"doesn't spark joy\" piles.\n\nI ask mom why she's going through my room and look around for important things I don't want to lose. Can't find them, start panicking, and ask more aggressively and angrily. I got very upset and said things like \"what the fuck is wrong with you\", \"get the hell out\", saying/interrupting her saying \"fuck you\" every time she tried to explain herself, slammed the door when she left, and said that she had no right to go through my things. The only thing she could fully ask was to have me stop swearing at her. She was calm the entire time and left without questioning it.\n\nI've never cussed at my mom before. I never say the lesser words like \"damn\" or \"shit\" with her. I hardly say \"crap\" because I know she doesn't like it. As soon as she left and I could recompose myself I sat down and cried. I don't know why I did that, and I don't know why I reacted that way. I may be overthinking it, but maybe I need to get diagnosed for OCD since I realize get extremely uncomfortable when anything of mine is out of place or touched by someone else.\n\nI feel like I'm rightfully angry to be mad since she went through my things even though I explicitly told her I'd organize it myself, but I feel awful that I had such an outburst and I don't know where it stemmed from. I don't know where to go from here.",

      "description": "My older sister starting going to college last year, and I will too in two years. But ever since she left, I’ve had to pick up doing all her chores in addition to mine.\n\nFirst off, our dog gets up at 6:30 every morning, because he likes to get up when my parents leave for work and me for school. As a product of this, he gets up and paces to go out on the weekends, so our parents usually make us alternate who gets up to take care of him. This normally isn’t too bad, but since my sister left I’m getting up with him all the time, and never get to sleep in. When she’s home, usually for 2-5 days, I ask her to get up with him so I may sleep in. This is personally the biggest deal for me, since I already get up early on weekdays, and I know for a fact her earliest weekday class starts at 10 and she has no classes on weekends. I also feel like me covering for her when she’s gone all the time warrants me the few days of sleeping in when she’s here.\n\nSecondly, we have other around the house chores. I usually mow, edge and blow off the lawn, take the trash out, vacuum, and do my own laundry plus my parents sometimes. My sister usually mops, cleans the pool, and does her laundry plus our parents sometimes. Usually we both do the dishes and wash the cars. However, when she leaves, for usually a month or two at a time, I am stuck having to do both our chores. \n\nWhen she comes home, I ask her to get up with the dog and to do her chores, plus vacuum. She is complaining and yelling claiming that just because she is home doesn’t mean that I can stop doing things and force it onto her. Am I the asshole here?\n\n",

      "description": "So long story short I had trust issues with my boyfriend but I felt like it was just my anxiety. I felt bad for not trusting him and I made it clear to him that he never did anything to deserve me taking away his privacy like that. \n\nOne night we were showering and I got done before him so I was gonna get out. He kept telling me to wait for him to get out so I did. When I got out I noticed he had left his phone in the room which he never does because he always has it near him. I thought that he didn’t want me to get out before him because he thought I would snoop through his phone. I felt like I was being controlling but at the same time I was wondering why he would even be so scared of me looking through it? So I spent the next few days telling him I wouldn’t snoop through it anymore. \n\nCome last night, he stayed out drinking till about 4 in the morning. I have him on find my friends and I usually track him because he tends to get too drunk and wonder off leaving me to find him and pick him up. I noticed he was at a House I was unfamiliar with.\n\nWhen he finally got home he passed out right away. He was extremely wasted. So my paranoid self thought it would be a good chance to look. Turns out he is cheating on me. With one of his clients at work(he’s a personal trainer). So I guess I got what I was looking for.. although it’s not what I wanted. \n\nI am definitely going to bring this up with him but I feel like he is going to guilt trip me for breaking his trust and looking through his phone. \n\nAITA for snooping through his stuff?\n\nTLDR: Didn’t trust my boyfriend. Would snoop through his phone all the time. Actually found out he is cheating on me. AITA for invading his privacy?",

      "title": "WIBTA For telling a friend the real story of me sleeping with her ex?",
      "description": "Warning: may cause discomfort, rough story\n\nThis is a couple years back but this situation has been on my mind for years, it's been a serious problem that I've only recently started addressing in counseling but it doesn't seem like it's enough to make it stop bothering me. It especially doesn't help that because of what others say about alcohol and SA, I constantly go back and forth between it was my fault to it was an assault.\n\nOne of my best and closest friends for years has recently decided to drop me from her life because she feels I broke her trust. She says that me, sleeping with her ex (seperated for years but occasionally f-buddies but not during the period this happened) and one of my close friends, was something that proved me untrustworthy. Since there was alcohol involved on my end, the story to (at least to the few who I told) had become I got drunk and initiated, and it was my fault it happened. When she told me this, I was more crushed at the loss of her friendship than what had happened to me, and never really explained fully what happened, mostly because I did blame myself. \n\nA few years back, I was saying goodbye to all my friends to go off to training. I was only going to be gone for 6 months, but we had a pretty tight friend group and it seemed appropriate to party with each friend or group before I was gone for so long. There was one group, 3 of my friends (B, J, and G) who lived together semi-near me that I went to visit. B was a really close friend, and J was who I considered my best friend up until about 6 months prior to then but I was still trying to hold onto the friendship because it was such a long one. It was especially weird because he had recently told me that he was interested in me throughout parts of our friendship and was jealous that I had a fling with his brother. I was trying to ignore this because he brought it up just a couple weeks before I had to leave so I figured it would just blow over.\n\nWhat we normally did was I would go over there and hang out, drink some stuff that I brought myself, cook and eat and just talk. I figured this would be a lot like what we normally did, so I wasn't worried. I was planning on staying the night because of the alcohol. Normally I would crash in B's bed because he was very respectful of space and J would normally forbid it because of his \"attire\" when sleeping. But at this point, B had a GF and I wasn't comfortable sharing a bed with him because of respect for her. Normally then I would crash on the couch but J insisted I crash with him in his bed. \n\nNormally after the conversation we had earlier that month, I would have refused and slept in G's bed since he was never there (but it was constantly filthy) and I was pretty drunk off of 3/4 a bottle of jager so I agreed to crash with J. J at this point is mostly sober, coming down off of a joint he had smoked a couple hours prior. \n\nAs soon as I got in the room, he had started being very persistent. I dont want to go into detail because its not super important, but it ranged from me not being close enough, to taking off clothes, to outright demands for sex. I had argued for as long as possible, saying no and giving reasoning and saying I was uncomfortable. I hoped he would stop. I felt super uncomfortable, but I didnt feel like he would disregard what I was saying forever. I trusted him too much at that point. I kept trying to fall asleep, and he kept insisting. Eventually when I was half asleep, he kept pushing on my shoulder and telling me to just roll over. I was so tired and uncomfortable and I couldn't leave and I kept thinking I couldn't even escape at this point, there were no locks on the bedrooms and B was asleep and I couldnt drive home and he wouldn't take no for an answer. I just rolled over. \n\nI remember asking if he had protection, to which he said yes but didnt use. It was horrible. It was really uncomfortable and painful, super dry. I think he took my grunts of pain as some sort of encouragement. When it was over he finally let me sleep and I just sort of blacked out. In the morning it was disgusting. I wanted nothing to do with him. He was getting ready to leave for work, I refused to get up. He left and I just tried to clean myself as best I could, but was kind of in shock. I think I went into some sort of hysterics because I couldnt stop laughing. I went to breakfast with B, but he didnt say anything about it and I sort of ignored it. I went home and told another friend, asked for advice without mentioning any more than I had slept with J. She scolded me a little and told me I needed to tell my other friend, his ex. I was already planning on it, so I did. She was angry at me and didnt talk to me for months. Told me alcohol wasn't an excuse and I made my choices that night. And I guess part of me still believes that.\n\nWe haven't had even a text back and forth in a long time, over a year and a half. What makes it worse is that she was still seeing/ sleeping with her still ex after it happened. I dont think I can salvage the friendship, I just want closure. I want to tell her the truth of what happened, how it affected me, and just be done with it. I'm done being haunted by it and knowing that our friendship is gone over something she incorrectly assumed. But is it selfish of me to want that?\n\nTLDR: I had been sexually assaulted by one of my friends, who was an ex of my best friend. Best friend, who was not told otherwise, assumed it was consensual and has broken friendship. I want closure by telling her the actual situation.\n\nWIBTA if I told one of my past best friends that her ex, who was one of my best friends who she thought I consensually slept with behind her back, had actually sexually assaulted me and that's why our friendship is ruined?

This money lasts until March 2019, which as you might know is soon.\n\nThe whole year she said that it didn't need to be hurried as she had till March 2019 to do it.

My mom has done things like this before, knowing a full year she has until a certain date and only a month after that date decides to do it and realizing she can't do it anymore.\n\nSo am I the asshole for telling her she has 3 days to spend money on the cats or I'll use the money myself as I have enough to use it on for myself?",

The rough team slashed a player, ok time in the box, and then the same guy straight up punched a guy at face off, more time in the box, at this point the other team is getting angry. And the referees begun to take notice, at this point the parents and the player got angry saying the other player got in his way and it shouldn’t be his penalty, but surprise that’s not how it works. And the same dude decides to basically stab his stick into someone’s shoulder pad. That’s the final straw he was asked to leave, while doing this his parents went mad and started to swear and threaten the referees and anyone who doesn’t support his team. She was asked to leave as well. After this the game ended normally ( only had 10 minute on the clock anyway) and when I was done changing the parent was waiting for me. And said she is going to file a complaint. I feel I did the right thing but in the change room one of my co worker told me I should’ve just left him.",

      "description": "For context my best friend and I just finished our last year of high school. We have been very close for the last 3/4 years and had the majority of our classes together. Last year he moved in with his girlfriend when he was only 17. At the time people were suspicious but I and a few others knew he had a history of domestic abuse and was in and out of the hospital. He confided in me but was otherwise pretty private. He told me he was hesitant to live with his partner so young but he had no other options, so I supported his decision. \n\nI don’t know too much about his time with his girlfriend but he was accepted into the family. For further context my best friend is a young European and his girlfriend’s family were first gen Vietnamese migrants so it was unusual to let a male into their home and live with them. He had only just months prior been allowed to sleep over after 2 years of them being together, so this was a sudden adjustment that shocked a lot of people (our community is primarily viet). \n\nHe became very dependent on the family and for the most part they seemed very happy. My friend and his girlfriend got a dog together and he became very close with the family.\n\nIt seemed sudden but they became distant during a busy period at school. He reached out to explain to me that he and his partner had starting fighting more often. At this time I started talking more to his girlfriend. In the past she and I had very minimal interaction and I knew she had advocated against me due to my drug use. Both she and my friend were very school oriented.\n\nOne night he messaged me saying that he had just broken up with his partner. He didn’t give much explanation but said he was upset, but his partner was far more hysterical. She threatened suicide and cried and begged for more chances, and my friend was too worried about her safety to leave to his mates house. So they stayed living together until the end of the week when he would move out.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, they had gotten back together after a few days. His girlfriend was regularly taking to me suddenly after the breakup. That weekend we had our school formal and my friend and his girlfriend went together. They hadn’t publicly stated they weren’t together. That night at the after party while my friend was passed out I hooked up with her. We were both drunk and high.\n\nA week later he broke up with her again and moved out to his friends house. He said that if she really desired they could try again once the stress of school had ended. She agreed, wrote him a love letter and was relatively pleasant on the goodbye as he moved out. That night he got drunk and made out with a girl that he had a relationship with years ago at a party his girlfriend was at. I figured he had moved on and so when his girlfriend kept talking to me I figured there was nothing wrong.\n\nShe asked me to do acid with her and then we hooked up at her house. This was 4 days after he moved out. I asked the girlfriend to keep it secret as I knew he would react poorly. \n\n He asked me several times, admittedly apologetically, if he should be worried about a relationship between his now ex and I but I flatly told him there was nothing going on and that I was just comforting her because she hadn’t taken the breakup well. He apologised and said he just must have trust issues. His ex told me that he was very controlling and this was just an expression of that.\n\nHe eventually found out when talking to his ex mother in law. He was very upset and blasted me over the phone. He was borderline abusive, saying that I was a coward, that both his ex and I had betrayed his trust, been emotionally abusive and lost my respect. He said that I couldn’t understand the relationship that he had with his ex and that it was something he couldn’t even comprehend. \n\nI tried to break it off with his ex but she kept telling me she was completely over him. My friend forgave me but made me promise I’d stay away from his ex until he finished school and was in a more stable state of mental health. His ex said this was controlling behaviour and completely unreasonable. I felt too uncomfortable seeing him after this and avoided him at school, as well as rejecting his attempted plans to hang out.\n\nI figured seeing as the relationship was over between my friend and I, there was nothing stopping me from going out with his ex again. She is my first proper girlfriend and I’m really enthusiastic about our relationship. I even started inviting her to social events and everyone saw that my friend was the unreasonable one and was told about how controlling he was, and got to know her better. She started smoking and drinking with us and became a part of the group quickly.\n\nMy group supports me and nobody can tell someone who they can and can’t date. My ex friend has been telling people that he has the moral high ground and making up stories about why they broke up, claiming his ex was emotionally unable to deal with the complex and difficult emotions of a relationship of that nature so young that she became violent and would give him the silent treatment daily for several hours at a time. She hasn’t exhibited any of these behaviours to me so I think he is lying. \n\nHe has reached out to discuss it with me and his ex several times but I have blocked him because I don’t want his judgement or criticism. He says that he just wants to forgive and understand us but I think he is too far gone. He is very condescending about how I can’t understand his situation as he sacrificed a lot to move out from his ex’s. His ex’s sister blocked him on the phone of his ex mother in law and won’t let her speak to him. He accused us of defaming him and socially isolating him but I think the group just prefers having a girl around to him and didn’t like him much anyway. None of them really wanted to be his friend after school anyway which is nobody spoke to him after he found out about his ex and I. Only a few people have remained in contact with him and he must be manipulating them because they are critical of my relationship with his ex.\n\nAITA for wanting a relationship with a person I love? We have been together for about a month now. My girlfriend has started talking to him again and he is reaching out to forgive us again but I think we need to distance ourselves from his controlling behaviours. My girlfriend says that if he respected either of us he wouldn’t want us apart when we are in love.\n\n",

      "description": "We are from the states. \n\nMy fiance and I have decided to get married with a destination wedding. It was the only venue my fiance fell in love with and the only venue that catered to everything we need. I fell in love with it too, but seeing him light up at it was amazing, and sealed the deal so to speak.\n\nHis mom is going, however his fsther vehemently is against going. The wedding wont be for 2 years, but he has already decided he isnt going. He gave off a list of excuses:\n\nThe first was that he didn't want to spend his money in another country - i sidetracked him asking why he had no problem spending money in Canada and Mexico then.\n\nThe second was \"Who was going to watch their dogs?\" - I reminded him that their friends can watch them, since they have before for long periods of time. \n\nAnother was that he couldn't afford it - i offered to pay out of my own pocket for him (although combined my future in laws bring home about 7800 a month, have no bills, and travel across the states in an RV retired - but I'm not a jerk to assume that they're perfectly well off regardless). \n\nThose are the two i remember. There are more but I cant remember them but they were equally debunked.\n\nOne night though his mom got drunk and revealed the real reason - its because his dad cant smoke pot and doesnt want to go with out for so long. His dad doesn't want to go with oit pot for 4 days.\n\nI confronted him about it with out my fiance knowing. He tried to deny it, but then admitted it. I just said \"Your loss then\" and left it at that. Since then he's been truing to convince my fiance to change his mind, but I always interject with \"Are you going to pay for it?\" And that ends the Place Change Conversation quickly. \n\nNow my future MIL is begging my fiance to live stream the ceremony when originally we wanted no photography except by the photographer. She wants to have his dad there in her phone face timing when we originally asked that no phones be present during the ceremony. We were adamant about it originally because we would rather the photos be more professional than iPhone or whatever, but his mom is pushing for it. She is also starting to guilt trip him about the destination as well, but I put a stop to it every time. \n\nAm I the asshole because I don't want to change what we both agreed on, because his father can't break a habit for 3 days? \n\nI feel like it, but I'm adamant that I don't want the ceremony recorded, and we dont want any electronic devices present. This was something we both agreed on.",

I have curly hair, and a greasy, sweaty skin in general. I've never had my hair too short or too long, my uncle used to cut it down to around 1 cm every 3 months. Recently i've taken it on me so to get closer to the haircut i'd like instead of the repeating cycle of \"short, a bit longer, short, a bit longer\" that i've experienced for 18 years. I've just been cutting it down to 3 mm on the sides, and long enough for it to curl on the top. This summer i grew tired of the heat and awkwardness of my hair and just shaved it. I don't look bald, it just looks shaved, like at a quarter of a millimeter. It feels amazing, the constant itchiness, warmth and grease is gone. When my uncle saw it, he bursted screaming on how i look like i'm sick and like i do meth, that he can't use me to go outside for him anymore, and that i'm an asshole for doing this to him.

      "description": "So I was homeschooled. My family and other homeschoolers would meet up at a park. Nothing private so other families could go to said park. This family: 2 parents, 3 kids, and a small dog (Tan Dear Head Chihuahua puppy again I will say *puppy*). The dog was not on a leash walking around and sniffing, extremely friendly. Everyone noticed the dog especially the young children. My mom's friend daughter we will call her Tilly because she is a important part of the story.\n\nTilly points out to my younger sister that the small children are pulling on and throwing the small dog from his small paws and tugging on his ears and tail roughly to the point of yelping and when the dog when to the adults for help they would pick him up and toss him to the side like a toy they were annoyed with and kicking him hard. Tilly and my sister took the dog from the kids as they try and play literal tug of war with the dog by his head and hind legs. They gave him water and my mother and Tilly's mother noticed and both felt like they had to do something.\n\nWhile the family was distracted they tucked the dog in a park bag that had carried my younger brothers tonka trucks in and got my siblings and I in the car. One in the car the bag was put on my lap and out came the small dog's head excited and curious. We immediately took him to the vet to find out he was barely 6 month old and was bruised. He later had fur falling out of his head we were afraid he had mange but its because the fur was  removed repetitively to the point the spots was scarred. A vet friend said that with treatment like that the dog is lucky to have just been bruised. Especially when he was nearly thrown into some of the ***metal*** playground equipment. The kids seemed to like the dog but their rough housing was not healthy and the parents where not treating the dog like a living thing and not teaching the kids how to safely and respectively play with the dog.\n\nWe spoil him and named him after my great grandfather Reilly he to this day struggle to trust most people and are extremely protective of his protectors 4 years later but there isn't a day that goes by that I worry about the kids so now I have to ask. Were we the assholes for taking this small dog from children who loved him even though they were hurting him?",

      "description": "So a little pretext, my little brother and I share a room and sleep on bunk beds.  My other brother moved out, and my little brother was supposed to move in to my older brothers room. But because he’s sick (and it’s not contagious) he’s still sharing a room with me. Nothing serious for him, it’s just like a strain of the flu. Headaches, slight nausea, maybe vomits once every few days, messed up sleep schedule. Wakes up at 2pm and goes to bed at 4am\n\nNow on to my anger. For the last couple of weeks my little brother has been sick. And most of the time when he asks me to get him something, like an orange or some water, I’ll get it for him, because treat others how you would want to be treated, right? So for the last few weeks, while I’m home, 90% of the time I grab whatever he asks for and gives it to him.\n\nSo tonight, it’s like 10:40pm and I just started trying to sleep. The bed was just how I liked it, blankets are warm, and I’m starting to doze off. He wakes me up, to go throw something out. I grumble and ask why he can’t do it, but still go and throw it out. Then get back into bed. Takes me til about 11:30 before I get comfortable enough to start dozing off again. Like a minute away from falling asleep. He wakes me up again to get him a bottle of water. I start getting a little angry, but get him the water. I quickly grab it and give it to him. And try to go back to bed. Now I’m tossing and turning, trying to go back to sleep, while he watches some Netflix show. No headphones, nothing. Just watching the show. It’s like 11:40 now. I ask him to put on headphones, cause I have to be up at 6am for to finish my homework for my ethics class. He starts complaining about it. Now in the past, he’s just watched Netflix of YouTube without headphones this late, so I gave him like 3 pairs of headphones. 3 pairs, so I could sleep in peace. He starts complaining about having to wear headphones, and it takes me like 5 minutes to get him to wear a pair. I try going back to sleep. Now he’s tossing and turning, and starts to complain because the headphones are uncomfortable, and tries to guilt trip me. It starts to work. This is the point where I get angry. I just yell at him for a minute. \n\nI feel very guilty about yelling at him, but I’m writing this post at 12:21am, needing to get up at 6am to finish stuff for my college class. And when I talk to my dad about it, he said, “cut him some slack, he’s sick.”",

(Important thing to note, he has a bit of a voyeur fetish and him and his wife both have \"free use\" agreements with each other). So I got him and his fiance together and said I needed to plan the bachelor party.

And after a bit I inform him he has to go into the back room for his bachelors lap dance. So one of the strippers leads him in (also in on the prank) and starts to give him the lapdance on the chair I placed in the middle of the room. Handcuffing one limb at a time. Once he is fully handcuffed she tells him she has a surprise for him and blindfolds him. She then quietly sneaks out the door and his fiance sneaks in. She undoes his pants and starts sucking him off. He is freaking out because he things it is the stripper and only once she has finished the task does he take off the blindfold to show that it was her the whole time. \n\nAfter a bit of embarrassment he goes back and enjoys the rest of the party. And he hasn't said anything about it and when I brought it up he said it was cool and that it was a good prank, but I can tell he is a bit peeved at us. So AWTA?",

      "description": "TL;DR: SO doesn’t want to do any sort of day-after wedding brunch. My parents want to host a smaller one for some people on my side, which I want us to attend. AITA for insisting on it?\n\nBackground: SO and I are getting married this summer. My parents said they’d like to host a day-after wedding brunch for us that included our families and OOT guests. I thought it would be nice, SO didn’t, and an argument ensued. Background is that my parents have definitely not been the easiest people to work with, even with the rehearsal dinner or any other planning, or clearly supportive of our relationship in general. I thought this was a nice gesture, but SO recognized it as sort of a sign of wanting more control, and also just doesn’t want a brunch for a number of reasons (it would be a big to do, things planned by my parents tend to be kind of chaotic and unorganized, and the somewhat complicated background relationship with my parents, and SO just wants us to be alone that day). Anyway, I eventually came to my senses, especially given that this brunch would entail a lot of people and would really be too much, and I told my parents that we were declining their offer for this day-after brunch.\n\nMore recently, my parents said they’d like to have a brunch for a smaller subset of people being just my parents, my siblings and their families, my father’s side OOT guests (my mother won’t have any there), and _maybe_ grandparents. Roughly 18-20 people.\n\nI talked with SO again about this, and another sort of argument ensued. I continued talking about how I thought it would be nice both for us and anyone attending, and that it seems like a small thing that would mean a lot to other people (especially with the day after being Father’s Day, I guess - it seems to mean a lot to my parents and would to the OOT guests that’d attend). SO doesn’t want to do it for the same reasons listed above, and also said they’d feel weird doing something with my side and not their side (even though they didn’t want a brunch with everyone, and said they wouldn’t want to go to an additional thing with their family). \n\nAnyway, I’m having a hard time not feeling like SO is being selfish and stubborn and that we should do this.\n\nAITA for still thinking we should do this brunch, and not letting it go?

      "description": "So a couple of months ago I met a girl at a club and went home with her. At the time I thought it was just going to be a one night stand, but we’ve stayed in touch. We message each other a few times a week. She’s stayed at my house a couple of times and we spent New Years together. \n\nIt’s very casual, We’re not in a relationship, and we haven’t agreed to be exclusive or anything like that (although we both have been exclusive since meeting, because i think we’re both just like that) \n\nThe thing is, since before I met her I’ve been planing on going overseas for a couple of months at the end of January. I’ve already quit my job in anticipation of this. I can tell she really likes me, and I feel like she’s going to be a little hurt if I leave. We’ve talked about traveling, as it’s a common interest, and I have brought it up, but I think it sort of came across more as something I want to do (rather than something I was 100% going to do)\n\n\nAITA for just up and leaving?",

      "description": "A few redditors who commented on my last post suggested I add some extra info I supplied in the comments to my post for more information. \n\nSo to begin again..\n\nI currently live with my parents. I am 17F and my parents were very kind to let my boyfriend 20M live with me. They both really like my boyfriend and he offers to clean and pay for bills and just generally help out when he can. My parents asked him to pick up the electricity bill which is 200+ a month, which is definitely reasonable because there letting him live with me. \n\nMy boyfriend is in no way reliant on my parents, he could move out but he lives here because I asked him to. He could go back to his dorm or rent elsewhere but I asked him to live with me and my parents allowed it. \n\nThe issue is though, my mother wants us to buy groceries for the household. And if we ate a fridge full of food each month I would understand completely. But we’re almost never here. I go to school half the day and work the rest. My boyfriend works doubles every other day and night shifts the days he doesn’t work doubles. He’s not in school currently because he’s paying off the debt from last semester (due to bad planning).\n\n We eat a small breakfast each day consisting of either eggs and veggies or oatmeal. Otherwise we eat at work since our bosses are both really nice and don’t mind giving us food at the end of the night. \n\nMy mother claims we eat too much (we went through a large carton of eggs and a small bag of tortillas in a month) and that we need to buy groceries for the house because they’re “broke” and can’t afford it. But the issue here is\n\nThey buy shit they don’t need all the time \n\nMy mom just bought a fancy new car because she wanted a fast and loud gas guzzling car. She also constantly buys random items off of amazon and new makeup pallets form Sephora. She does not need these items. \n\nI understand I’m lucky I have parents that don’t make me pay rent or some outrageous fee (though I do pay 250+ in bills each month for car/insurance/etc..) but I feel like I am still their responsibility (even though I’d rather not be and take care of my own groceries and rent as I’ve offered to move out already). \n\nI don’t feel like I should have to buy groceries when 1.) I eat one meal here a day 2.) my mom blows money on stuff she doesn’t need and claims were “broke”  and 3.) ive offered to move out but they won’t allow me to (and I understand I’m under 18 but I’m fully capable and make enough money to be on my own currently)\n\nAITA for not wanting to buy groceries for the household? \n\nTl;dr: My mother wants me to buy groceries for the household even though my boyfriend and I eat one meal a day \n\n\n",

Today me and my gf went to a restaurant near my home to have our dinner.\n\nWhen we got in the restaurant, we picked our seat, I pulled out my chair and took my seat, my gf stared at me angrily, that's confusing. She told me: \"You just know to pull out your own chair, is it? Or you only pull the seat out for Jess?\" \n\nI stood up and pulled out the chair for her. No replying. \n\nWhen our food was served. I took my chopsticks and wiped them with a tissue. Then she asked me: \"Can you wipe the chopsticks for me too?\"\n\nMe: \"You can do it yourself right?\"\n\nGf : \"Omg, if I was Jess so you might have wiped it for me already, doesnt even need to be demanded.\"\n\nMe : *wipe her chopsticks*\n\nAfter we ate a little food:\n\nGf : \"Oh there are pickles in my food. I dont want to eat them\"\n\nMe : \"So do not eat it, simple\"\n\nGf : \"Yeah, if I was Jess you might have picked all of the pickles up and swallowed all of them.\"\n\nMe : \"Dude, you are weird today, stop talking about her, its very frustrating\"\n\nGf : \"I want you to be frustrated\"\n\nMe : *silent*\n\nAfter a while, when we didnt even finish eating. \n\nGf : \"Oh can you get me a fork? I cannot eat steak without forks\"\n\nMe : *go and get her a fork*\n\nGf : \"Can I eat your steak too? I'm really hungry\"\n\nMe : \"Seriously? You ate a lot\"\n\nGf : \"If I was Jess so you might not complain about me eating\"\n\nMe : \"stop dude, it isnt fun when you keep mentioning her, its my past already\"\n\nI was really irritated that moment but I didnt lose it. When she started eating both her and my steak. She asked me to get her some spices on the table in front of us. \n\nMe : \"Get it yourself, let me go and use the restroom for a bit.\"\n\nGf : \"*sigh* I wish I was Jess, I really do\"\n\nI lost it that moment, told her: \"Ok so you can have your dinner solitarily, I've had enough. I will pay for your food, but you get yourself home, I'm leaving\"\n\nI went and paid for both of our foods. \n\nI grabbed my stuff and left the restaurant alone. I got myself to a cafeteria and left her at the restaurant. \n\nHours later she texted me and told me that I was an asshole. \n\nAITA? \n\n",

      "description": "I apologize in advance if formatting is funky because I’m on mobile. So the first week of February my fiancé got arrested for DUI on prescription meds that weren’t his, driving without insurance, and driving with expired registration. I got him out on bond the next day, and had a serious conversation with him about walking a straight line. Apparently he’d been getting high on pills the whole while we’ve been together (I guess I’m an idiot for not seeing it). I told him that he needed to man up and be responsible. There’s no reason why a 37 year old man with a good job wouldn’t have insurance or registration on his car. I told him I didn’t want to marry a man who is completely irresponsible, and that he needed to stop taking pills, especially if he’s on the road putting himself and other people in danger, and he needed to stay on top of keeping insurance and registration. \n\nHe (supposedly) got some type of temporary drivers license that would be good up until his court date, and I let him use my car to go get insurance and registration on his car so he’d be able to get back and forth to work. \n\nI got a call at work tonight from his best friend. He told me that my fiancé told him not to tell me, but he’d been arrested earlier and was in the county jail. He called me because he felt bad keeping it from me, as he’s one of my friends too, and because he couldn’t afford to get my fiancé out on his own. I called the jail and found out that they got him for:\n-Suspended Registration\n-Use of License Plate with intent to Conceal\n-No Insurance\n-Driving while license suspended or revoked\n\nHe’s been lying to me this whole time about getting all of his ducks in a row and being good to drive his car. I’m hurt because I thought he wouldn’t lie to me again. At least he wasn’t fucked up on pills this time, but, god, how stupid can you be? He really is my best friend, but part of me feels like I just need to let him go because I’d be setting myself up for a lifetime of being his “mom.” I don’t want to leave him, but then again I feel like Id be a fool for letting him lie to me and rushing to bail him out again. \n\n\n\n\n",

Trying to get some peaceful time, I suggested my girlfriend i pick her up today at 7am to go get some breakfast before I go into work at 11. She said yeah. Later she said we should go to a motel to fuck instead since her yeast infection is gone and it’s been two weeks since we’ve done it. Obviously, I was fine with it as well. I left it up to her to decided what we’d do. When I got off work last night after closing, I called her and asked what the plan was. She started throwing excuses as to why we shouldn’t do anything, that she was tired and wanted to sleep or that I didn’t have enough time. Fine, that’s okay. I got frustrated but not mad. Later on as I was telling her about my day I got a bit mad thinking about all the little things happening to me and she’s suggested we do go out after all, to which i said no (she had already said no!) She then got mad at me and hung up and has been mad at me all day. I wasn’t mad at her, but now I am. I just want some peaceful time ☹️",

It’s been a learning experience as this is my first live in girlfriend.  \n\nShe works part time and I’m full time as well as crunching some overtime.  At the beginning of the week I asked her if she could do some of my laundry sometime in the week. There’s two machines on our floor and when I went to throw my stuff in both were in use.  \n\nShe got annoyed and told me she’s not my mother, to just wait until the machines were empty.  I was dead tired, but stayed up and did exactly that.  \n\nToday is my day off and I woke up to a note asking me to pick up some stuff from the store and pick up her laptop from her cousin’s place.  \n\nShe set the term that it’s acceptable to deny favors and I would rather not do these.

Tired with all the propaganda, I replied to it and said that I think that it is fake because I couldn't find any sources online to confirm the news.\nSome other relative replied saying that why should I bother with fake news that is pro-India as it will help India. I replied saying that fake news should never be tolerated. He said that using fake news is the new war tactic.\n\nTired of the pro-war rhetoric everywhere, I just left the whatsapp group, instead of replying.\n\nToday morning, as I checked my phone, I saw that 2-3 of my cousins messaged me asking why did I leave the group. When I told them what I feel, they replied with a \"Oh, I see.\" And told me that some kind of drama ensued on the group because I left it. The relative who spoke about how fake news is the new war tactic is feeling guilty that I left the group because of him, which is why people are messaging me to ask why I left. This is making me feel guilty for leaving the group.\n\nSo, AITA for leaving a whatsapp group without giving any clarification?",

      "description": "Never posted on here so forgive me if my formatting is off.  This has been bothering me for weeks now.  I work in a bank as a teller and I have maybe 4 people at most working with me at this location on a given day.  I started working here about a month ago and about 2 days later so did my new coworker who just so happens to be VERY pregnant. \n\nWell the pregnant coworker (I'll call her PC from here on out) has apparently taken a dislike to how I treat her.    I sit by a door that we have to use often and when I notice she's walking towards it I toss it open.  When I knew she was about to reach for something to hand to a customer in about 30 seconds, I pulled it out of the box and set it on the table in her reach.  When PC's printing out a form for the member she's talking to, I'll walk over and bring it back so she doesn't have to leave the customer.  Whenever I do these things for PC, she gets an irritated and rude tone to her voice and will say something along the lines of \"You don't have to do that for me 55North\" or \"I can do that myself!\"\n\nThe thing is, I don't treat PC differently from how I treat any of my other coworkers!  I do all these things for ALL OF MY COWORKERS, regardless of the gender, age, position, etc.  I can honestly say I don't treat her any different because I could care less that she is pregnant.  I pointed this out to her politely after she snapped at me once and it didn't seem to pacify her at all. I don't do these things with any ulterior thoughts of \"I'll do this so people like me more\" or \"I'll do this because she needs to take it easy in her condition.  I mostly do it because our location is very slow and it gives me something to do.  \n I never go out of my way when I'm busy or in the middle of something, only when its convenient for me.  I still do these things for her as well because I either do it reflexively or I don't want to be seen as a lazy coworker.\n\nSo the long story short, I help my pregnant coworker at work and she gets an attitude as if I have wronged her, AITA?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years now, but we don't go to the same college. We're kind of LDR and we see eachother about twice a month on the weekends. Back in September we had a huge fight that led to us almost breaking up. We made up after, but I was still reeling a bit as it was the worst fight we've ever had and brought up some issues we have with eachother that we had never openly communicated before. A couple days after we make up, our relationship feels a bit awkward and unsteady but we both feel like we've finally voiced our feelings and are hoping to work on the issues. \n\nOnto why I might (probably) be an asshole: I meet a guy at my college literally two days after we've had this fight and make up. We were both waiting for a vending machine and he had a boosted board with him. I'm into skateboarding and was kinda looking at getting a boosted board  so I asked him about it and he started telling me about how nice it was and how much it cost and stuff. Then he asked me about my major and we talked about school for a little bit while I got my food. I say bye and am walking away with my food when he asks me for my snapchat, and I give it to him. He messaged me and we talked about our school and the weather and shit for maybe a week and then he asks if I wanna hang out. Ngl I really wanted to try his board so I say okay. I've been telling my boyfriend about this the entire time and he says he's fine with me going skateboarding with this guy. So I go skateboard with him and afterwards we sit down at a Starbucks and talk for a bit. I got the vibe it wasn't really a date but it also kinda could have been. I didn't mention having a boyfriend. We parted ways and didn't talk again until a couple weeks ago. \n\nHe messaged me asking how I was doing and I probably should have just ignored him but I didn't. I felt rude just leaving him on read. We make small talk and he asks me if I wanna hang out and I say okay. The day before we're supposed to meet up I slip the fact that I have a boyfriend into conversation. He's still down to meet up so we did. We haven't talked since. I told my boyfriend he was texting me again but I didn't tell him that we met up. I told my bf that I had already told this guy that I was taken and he seemed satisfied. My boyfriend and I are in a better place in our relationship right now and the things we fought about are getting better. I feel like I should tell my bf that I hung out with the skateboard kid again but I don't know if I should at this point. Literally nothing happened except some boring conversation and telling my boyfriend now would probably just make him upset. AITA if I don't tell him? ",

      "description": "I had a bit of situation recently at the entrance of my gated community. Usually people who live here have a registered tag which opens the right side of the gate automatically and its marked 'Residents Entry Only' and others have to punch in an entry code to enter from the left side marked 'Guests Entry Only'\n\nGot myself a new car recently for which I don't have a registered entry tag yet so I'm technically obligated to use the guests side but from time to time I end up following in someone who enters in front of me from either side. \n\nThis one time its late evening and I'm turning in to the community when I notice 2 cars coming in behind me. So I park my car in front of the guests gate anticipating to get in a few seconds behind one of them. \n\nThe first car is a residents car and goes in through the right side and the gate is now wide open for the next one a Big SUV also a resident. The Big SUV guy decides he doesn't trust me so he parks the car right next to mine so I cant turn in and enter from the residents side then rolls down his window and gestures at me. This pissed me off and I felt like he was treating me like some low life criminal trying to get into the community unauthorized. So I honked my horn for him to move on but he obviously didn't get the message and kept gesturing shouting at me to get in. I punched in the entry code and got in but was cussing and gesturing at him while doing so. He didn't stop or retort but clearly went in feeling superior.\n\nI got into an argument with wife who had no empathy with me about this and just kept insisting that no matter what I shouldn't have been rude to him about trying to protect his neighborhood. What do you guys think? AITA here?\n\nTL;DR Got mad at a stubborn neighbor and my unsupportive wife about him not letting me follow him into the gated community.",

      "description": "This is very long a complicated. I promise it is all relevant. I(F17) was put in a situation well this anonymous who cares. Also mobile so sorry. \n\nIn February my mom drove drunk, and she ran into another car and killed the two people in it. She only survived because she was in a volvo, had a broken sternum and broke both her ankles. She was in the hospital for 3 weeks and then a rehab place for 2. \n\nShe is home now. She is going away to jail in like 3 weeks. So she was around while I was there but we didn’t know when she would go away until Monday.\n\nMy mom is a single mother so it was just me and my brother(19 and not responsible) but my mom’s friend reached out. She and her husband are in their late 30s and have 3 kids, one girl (1) and two boys (5 and 7). They have a spare bedroom in their basement, and because I had nowhere to go they said i could live with them. \n\nI went over that night and I told them to think and consider this. Before this happened I had a history of trauma and just not fun life. I told  I have been diagnosed with depression and many other things, I am on medication and unstable and I really don’t want to strain their family. The parents are heavy drinkers though, they call themselves functioning alcoholics so maybe they don’t remember it.\n\nThey knew I had mental health issues before the accident. I told them to call me in a few days and they did and has me move in. They even let me bring my cat. They told their kids I was their older sister. It was a good situation. The mom lashed out on me a lot, but she also  took me prom dress shopping and showered me with expensive gifts so I dealt with it. They did care about me. They got me a math tutor to help me improve my grades.\n\nIt didn’t work out. They didn’t let me go to therapy and forced me to lower my depression medication. They encouraged me to smoke weed to deal with my problems. I dealt with it because I love their kids.  My friends hated coming over because I said I was their live-in nanny because I helped change the babies diaper and took care of the kids but their were my siblings. My depression got worse and I became bitchy I guess. I was waiting for my mom to get sentencing and I couldn’t talk to anyone about my feelings. They told me I could always talk to them but after the kids went to bed the weed and alcohol was broken out so they were never sober enough to support me. \n\nI think I maybe got a little spoiled. I asked if it was okay if I asked for a laptop for my birthday, the mom said yes, as long as it wasn’t like $2000. She told me there are many good laptops under $1000. I asked for a $850 one because I figured it was her way of saying $1000 was the budget. Apparently that was too much. The mom also started taking me to the chiropractor with her, and my insurance didn’t cover it. After the first visit I told her that I wanted more chores because I felt bad about it. She said okay. \n\nWhile I was there like 2 months in one of the mom’s friends from high school accidentally OD’d. This put a lot on her mentally. I am trying to do both sides which is why I mention it. \n\nSo basically the entire month of August the mom shut me out cold. The only time she talked to me was to yell at me for something or for not cleaning something up and then after she would buy me a gift. Anytime we got in a fight it was me apologizing even if she was in the wrong. I’m a 17 year old girl I was a bitch sometimes, but so was she. \n\nMy birthday is the end of August, and the day before was my party. The mom had insisted on throwing a big party, they are rich and have a nice party house. She ordered all this carnival stuff.\n\nThe week of my birthday I was sick. I had a double ear infection. I couldn’t hear shit. On the day my birthday party was supposed to be I overslept for school by like 10 minutes and needed a ride.The mom freaked. She told me to leave. She said I was nothing but an emotionally manipulative ungrateful bitch and that I ruined her life. She said she had been going to therapy. She literally kicked me out into the driveway. Took the phone she bought and left me crying. Her husband, the sweetheart drove me to school. My party was cancelled my birthday the next day sucked because all my plans were with them. \n\nI got really depressed because they told me so many times that I was their family. She told her kids I was their big sister! I went to her cousins wedding in Florida, to all the family functions for 6 months. In the start of October I tried to kill myself, because she had not contacted me and I felt so rejected. I missed my little siblings so much. I was in a psych ward for 3 weeks, wasn’t the first time no big deal. In the hospital I called her and asked why she didn’t call me or contact me, she said she wanted to remove herself from the situation. Okay she gave up on me. Her husband says that he wants me to move back in, and that he feels so bad about what happened. \n\nI’m dealing with a lot but this is all I want to know. Will I be an asshole if I send Christmas presents and cards to the kids who I consider my siblings. The oldest will remember but the other two might forget about me once I’m older. I don’t want these kids to be confused about their big sister sending cards and presents and letters, but goddamit they feel like my siblings. The mom does not want me in her life or vice verse . The father wants to be in my life but I have not reached out since I got discharged because she will yell at him if he finds out. I want to be the big sister to those kids. \n\n\n\n\n",

Growing up with my Dad and Stepmom we didn’t stay in hotels much, most vacations revolved around camping. It wasn’t until last year on my honeymoon that I learned you should tip the housekeeping staff for cleaning your room. This was a total surprise to me! \n\nMy mom comes to visit every year and when she visits she doesn’t let housekeeping into her room, she keeps the Do Not Disturb sign up for the length of her stay. To help the staff she takes her own trash out when it gets full and occasionally asks for additional toilet paper if needed. \n\nI have picked up my Mom’s habits and really don’t want someone coming into my room (theft) or having to pay a tip every night. (And while the room gets reimbursed by my employer any tip wouldn’t be) I don’t need fresh sheets when I’m only staying four nights at a time and I don’t make any messes or use more than one towel and a hand towel. At the end of my stay I leave a $3-5 tip for inconveniencing the staff. My Mom once mentioned that the staff don’t like it if they can’t see a room in case you are trashing it. \n\nTLDR: I’m cheap and uncomfortable with someone coming into my hotel room. Leave the Do Not Disturb sign up so housekeeping doesn’t clean my room daily. ",

      "description": "I'm a light sleeper and the 8am bright sun through the blinds doesn't mesh well with my sleep schedule. I got a very effective light blocking curtain which is also a tad heavy. My roommate, despite having a bachelor's degree, is extremely insistent that 3-5 command strips will hold up this curtain and rod just fine. Despite not being able to find a single style of hook that would properly secure this rod in place, I went with it. The rod wasn't even laying flat on the first go with three hooks.\n\nTen days in, the middle one falls. I decided to remount it, this time with the curtain resting safely on the outer two. It lasts 30 minutes. Now we have a spot on the wall to repaint, and roommate is freaking out (same thing happened to him back at his college place and he thinks he lost $75 on his security deposit for that; try carpet cleaning and other little things). About an hour ago, one of the side ones falls, and nearly brings the curtain rod down on my head. Now we have another spot to paint.\n\nI've tried having the conversation on this twice, including the \"we can fill the holes in when we leave, others have already done that\" conversation. Even my dad, who helped my roommate move out and the both of us move in, said that would probably be ok by the staff, and told my roommate this /to his face/. He did this exact thing when I moved out.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I just went ahead and asked the apartment staff about the security deposit and such, mounted my curtain with its included hardware and refill the holes before moving out and didn't have to deal with this again?\n\n[Mods: my previous form of this literally began with WIBTA, any reason automod would've removed it?]",

Y’all... the nickname he wanted to go by is mil’s pet name for him (let’s say it’s “sweetiepie” so he would be “grandpa sweetiepie). I told him no way and that stepdad can be called his name. My SO asked why but didn’t really care, we even talked to his parents and while they still wanted him to be called that they also didn’t care too much.

      "description": "Title is a bit misleading, here's the full backstory:\n\n-am trans, ftm\n\n-break up with my gf of 1 year because she wanted to \n\n- continue to try and stay friends \n\n-befriend another trans man I met on tinder (we hooked up but he's now in a committed relationship and our hang outs are strictly platonic now). Our friendship meant a lot to me, since we clicked great but he's also the first trans person I've been able to feel some sort of community with. I've since met other trans folks, but he was the first and the most important at a very critical time of my life \n\n- every time he and I hung out though, my ex would throw a fit in some way or another. It might have been intentional, but to my understanding she is just deeply insecure and felt like I was abandoning her whenever I wasn't around. That bothered me, so I acted in a harsh way at the time and that only escalated her negative feelings towards this new friend. I am fully responsible for my irresponsible actions towards her in a time of need and I know I nearly pushed her to suicide a few times in these situations. I deeply regret how I made her feel. \n\n-we finally reached the conclusion that my new friend and I couldn't hang out because it just ended in a breakdown for my ex (this was approx 5 months after we broke up). I never actually discussed this with my friend, I just turned down a few chances to hang out and we naturally stopped seeing each other because he lives far away anyway. \n\n-i secretly did resent this agreement, but I felt responsible for my previous actions and how I had hurt my ex-now-best-friend. I felt I owed her this level of peace. \n\n-fast forward about 4 months. Trans friend asks to hang out for the first time since we first started growing apart. I really miss him and I genuinely enjoy being around him, so I brought it up carefully to my ex. She is clearly frustrated with me, but all she's saying is \"do what you want\". \n\n\nAm I the asshole for going back on my word to never see this friend again - because I severely hurt my ex when I was with him, creating this negative cycle she experiences every time I'm with him? Or am I free to do whatever I want? \n\nAlso, even if I DID go with him to hang out, I just know it'll be interrupted by a string of distressed texts from her - and if I reply it'll likely turn into a fight, and if I don't it'll just come back to haunt me even worse the next time I speak to her (trust me).

      "description": "Let me start off by saying that I've always been prone to illness since I was an infant. From grade school and on, I would routinely get sick every 2 or 3 months, and sometimes even as little as a month after my last bout of the flu/an aggressive cold/etc. The only period in my life were I was never sick was the last two years of my high school education which I completed from home online and away from other people.\n\nI started my grocery store job 10 months ago, and since then I've probably missed around 9 or 10 days of work, one of which was a mental health day (I suffer from OCD. Particularly intrusive thoughts, which can sometimes cause me massive amounts of anxiety for long stretches of time) and 3 for a family emergency. Another 2 of those days, I was sent home by a manager. Once from puking on a register and another for nearly passing out while ringing up groceries. The rest I called in for due to being too sick to come in.\n\nAnyways, I know that it's highly frowned upon to miss so much work. But my immune system is super fucking bad, and when I catch a cold or flu, it hits me like a truck. On Saturday I came down with the worst flu I've had in at least a decade. Lots of puking, sneezing bloody/almost black mucus, persistent nausea, almost unable to hold down liquids, extreme body aches and chills, etc. So I've called in the last two days and plan on calling in the next two as well, as well as taking my next 3 scheduled days off.\n\nThe store manager is a nice guy but he gets visibly (audibly?) pissed over the phone when I call in, and it always makes me feel like I'm being a baby/doing something wrong. I've come in without complaint when hungover, I've come in on days off to fill in for people who were sick or to cover the shift of someone who was fired, etc. But I feel like an asshole for missing so many days of work; an amount that is nearly unheard of from my understanding.\n\nSo tell me Reddit.. Am I the asshole? Should I just suck up and go anyway with a mask and gloves?",

      "description": "I like the idea of people helping me when I get in trouble but while friends are nice to have it's hard to make reliable enough friends that can do things for me without needing to do them something first. So I go around work, the neighborhood, school, or where ever and do people favors that are not of big cost to me and are only a bit time consuming for me. Then tell them they owe me in the future. I usually don't even cash in those favors as either to much time has passed for what I did to be significant anymore or I don't even need them to do anything. However when I do call in those favors it is usually for something bigger when what I actually helped them with for example I helped someone with a single problem of the homework now do this whole homework sheet for me. If they don't help me I will guilt trip them into doing it and if that doesn't work I simply don't do them anymore favors cut contact with them and if they ask for any favors I say sure but then don't do them and screw them over even more. This is devastating when it happens in my job. I cover a two hour shift but then later they refuse to cover my five hour shift and when guilt tripping didn't work when they asked me to cover they're shift again I said sure but then didn't show up and it got marked against them unsure if they got fired or not (don't care that much). Well one day my very observant friend, lets call him simon said he notices that I do that and asked me why, so I told him it was like getting extra parachutes to make sure I am safe when I fall. He agreed that it was okay but my other friend who was hanging with us lets call him joe said it was wrong and that I was an asshole. I don't think it's that assholish of a thing I do them a favor and then they owe me I think it's chaotic good. But what do you redditors think? AITA?",

      "description": "Hello,\n\nThis past year I moved to Hawaii for work. I’m in a one bedroom apartment. I’d like people to come visit me, and when I speak to my friends around the country I always encourage them to take a trip here and hang out in paradise.\n\nA couple of months ago I wished happy birthday to a guy I dated in college for a couple weeks (I’m a guy). He mentioned he loved seeing my pictures and was very attracted to the men I hang out with. Both he and I aren’t typical “prizes” we both sort of struggle in the scene. I mentioned that if he wanted to come out meet some of these guys and be gay in Hawaii, he was more than welcome. I also mentioned off hand he should try and recruit some of our mutual close friends (small college) to come with him.\n\nRecently he calls me up and we start talking dates and activities and logistics. He’s gonna come alone. We decide not to set any dates and not to book anything until our schedules for this coming summer start to take shape. Nothing is planned or booked. At the end of the call, he goes “there’s one thing, I want to talk about what happened between us before I come. I feel like we never got the chance. And it bothers me a lot.”\n\nHere’s the history: things didn’t end well between us in college. I was a first semester freshman. He was a sophomore. He pursued me, and I never really felt anything for him. But he was nice and smart, so I continued for a few weeks hoping that maybe something would spark on my side. However, I eventually realized that it wasn’t going to happen. Before I said anything to him about that, I agree to go to the Winter formal with him. That night, I got really drunk— I think partly so I wouldn’t be cold to my date. He was not drunk. The night ended with us in my dorm and me losing my virginity. \n\nAs it happened, in physical motion, I had this terrible moment of knowing I didn’t want it to happen and regretting it was happening with this person. I ended the sex in tears curled up in a ball. He tried to comfort me and I played it off and wished him a good night. I stopped seeing him and slowly stopped replying to his messages after that night. UNTIL he asks to talk. \n\nI meet with him, and he doesn’t address the night we hooked up. Instead, he goes on about how he was disappointed that I ghosted him after we had gotten “so close.” He sort of goes at it as though I was just a heartless fuckboy who broke his heart. He also made the key comment that “but it’s okay that (I’m) not ready for a relationship” in a very condescending tone. I drew the line there and basically unleashed my side of the story: that i welcomed his advances cuz he was a nice guy but i ultimately never felt anything for him. We didn’t speak for seven years after that until we reconnected when he moved to my city and connected with our mutual friends again.\n\nFast forward to today, and I know that I should give him a call and let him talk about what happened 7 years ago and lock in his trip to visit in Hawaii. But I’ve been hesitating. I’m shocked that he still is hurt by what happened so long ago, but I’m also torn about telling him the full truth: that I felt he took advantage of me in my drunken, virginal state— him being older and much more experienced in sex and the dating scene. I don’t want to go so far as to call it an assault— I think it’s more in the grey area of consent. \n\nBecause it’s so grey, I don’t want to bring it up to him and force him to be accused of something so serious. However, I also don’t want to take a phone call and listen to another condescending narrative in which I broke his heart (this is the story that he tells people to this day).\n\nThe adult in me knows I should suck it up and talk it out and softly tell the truth of why ghosted him 7 years ago, but I always just want to leave the past behind and not dig up the lousy way I lost my virginity.

I don't smoke or drink and I'm pretty vehement against both of those things as they just make me uncomfortable and she knows fully that it's just a part of the relationship that we don't. \n\nMaybe I'm just being petty because I'm going to be lonely tonight with my car being in the shop and her being with her mom. But I don't like talking to people under the influence so that means that I won't be able to talk to her at all tonight.\n\nI know she'll be perfectly safe as she'll just be on the couch watching movies with her mom so that's not really a concern.

The timing was great. The neighbor was leaving at exactly the same moment. So I said:\n\n\"Hey, I wanted to apologize for last night. I am quite talented.

      "description": "My friend and I are grad students in our early twenties. Her boyfriend is in his 40s... literally twice her age and old enough to be her father (friend is 21). Not only that, but he's a professor at the university where we attend grad school (different department though).\n\nIt skeeves me out, to be honest, and I also feel like it's a bit predatory on his part. I do not feel comfortable being around him. Say what you will about \"age is just a number!\", but I personally think it's really unsavory for a man in his 40s to be dating a woman barely out of undergrad. \n\nI don't want him around when I plan time together with this group of friends. Whether it's going out to dinner together or going bar hopping or literally anything... I really don't want him to come. I'm also going to be honest--I think a dude in his 40s hanging out with a bunch of 20-somethings is weird in general, and the group dynamic is totally different.\n\nThe thing is, I don't mind other friends' SOs if they want to come (unless we really want to do a night out for just us or something) since they are close in age to us. So I would specifically be asking for this friend's boyfriend not to come, which could come off as dickish. I have not brought this up with my friend because the issue hasn't come up yet, but I can see it potentially being an issue in the future because we're starting to hang out more.\n\nTo clarify, I'm talking specifically about things I plan--if it's an event someone else plans, I would of course not say anything about him being there. I just don't want to extend the \"SOs are welcome by default\" invitation to him for stuff I plan.\n\nTL;DR. Friend and I are grad students in our early twenties. Said friend has a boyfriend in his 40s, who's also a professor in a different department at the university where we attend grad school. I'm creeped out by the boyfriend, and I don't want him at things I plan with this group of friends even though I'm fine with other friends' SOs (who are all in their twenties).

      "description": "Right, so here's a bit of backstory: a couple years ago (i was 15 at the time) me and my mom flew to Morocco to visit our family. Nearly the entire family from my mom's side lives there, so we took a bit of a roadtrip going from city to city, visiting family and staying with them for a couple of days before moving on to the next family member to visit. While we were there, we stayed with my aunt, my favorite uncle and her three children (13F, 15M and 17M). We would basically stay at my aunt's place for a few days, then travel to a family member along with her and her children, then travel back and stay at her house for a couple days before going to visit another family member, and so on and so on.\n\nMy niece (13) would constantly mock me for my accent (i speak arabic, but since i grew up in a different country i have an accent when i speak it and sometimes mispronounce words) and would also mock me whenever i would pronounce a word in the wrong way just slightly or if i would mess up my sentence. She took this so far that she eventually laughed every time i spoke a sentence, even when it was perfectly fine, just because of my accent. I told her to stop numerous times, i think i told her to stop every time she would do it, but her being her 13 year old self, could not resist the temptation of annoying me.\n\nThis just went on and on, until i one night decided i was so fed up with it that i just screamed in her face about how she has been a pain in the ass this whole trip and how she is just so annoying to me for no aparant reason. I screamed that she should stop making fun of my arabic just because im not moroccan and didnt grow up with it and that she needed to understand that and stop being a little child. My cousins were still playing fifa, but they were clearly listening and not paying any attention. My mom was looking at me, my aunt was nodding at me. And then, i ruined it. After my rant, i made a spitting noise towards her...I could feel the eyes of everyone piercing into me after i made that comment. My cousin (her oldest brother) stood up from next to me and went outside. He later told me he walked out because he really liked me and was afraid he was going to punch me because of what i did. My aunt consoled her daughter while saying \"idk why he did that\" and my mom was F-U-R-I-O-U-S.\n\nEven though i did get a little backlash for it, it was just a little bit. My niece, however, got grounded for apparently \"having been so annoying to have caused someone as calm as him to burst out like that\" and had all of her devices taken away from her. My other aunt in the room also shared what happened with our other family members who made sure to let me know that they were with me and they do not condone what my niece did for one bit.",

I had to postpone the first date for some sort of MLM type party my sister had organised. This bummed me out a little because I like to celebrate closer to the actual birthday.\nThe party was for my parents, my two sisters and their husbands and kids.\n\nTwo things that speak against me: I had a very busy week at work and ever since  I started working out I get hangry when I don't eat by 7pm. \n\nFor some reason the kids were extra rowdy, even though I had plenty of toys for them to play with, they found it more enjoyable to make a mess and break stuff. I had prepared plenty of appetizers for the aperitif but I didn't get the chance to taste any of them. \n\nI was too busy:\n- mixing cocktails for my sisters.  Couldn't make a pitcher because they wanted to taste all of the options, and they went through them FAST.\n- mopping up drinks spilled by the kids. When I told the kids to leave their drinks at the table, my sisters said I was being too strict. And I'm pretty sure my sisters think seeing their child with an empty cup is a direct violation of Human Rights, insisting I refill each time. So that happened 6 times. \n- getting out bandaids because the boys found that the most enjoyable thing to do is smack each other with their toy cars. Removing said cars was on par with empty cup.\n- getting out more food because everyone was inhaling the stuff on the table the second I put it there. \n- cleaning up vomit from a kid who thought it was a good idea to drink every none spilled drink and eat half a bag's worth of cheetos and at least 5 springrolls, all given to him by the people seated at the table.\n- trying to prevent the kids from going into the kitchen. My house has  an open floor plan so you can run straight from the dining room into the kichen. This was also flagged as a grave injustice by the people seated at the table.\n- clear the table, refill drinks and food, do some in between dishwashing,... the usual hosting stuff.\n\n\nThis continued during the main course. I was feeling lightheaded so I asked the other people to watch the kids while I ate. The response was not supportive. Going from \" eat faster\" to \" aren't you on a diet\" to \" if you can't handle this stuff don't host a party\". \n\nThere were desserts and coffee afterwards but I went through that on automatic pilot. When they asked me if I would be hosting again next year, I think they saw my doubts as a personal victory. When I said I didn't really enjoy the time together they were outraged and said it ruined my twin's party. Even though all they did for the entire evening was drink an eat.They have their busy family life and I'm not fit to handle that it seems.\n\nSo am I the asshole? Genuinely conflicted. ",

When I was a kid, he was pretty abusive (which got \"better\" as I grew up, meaning he wasnt physical, just emotionally and mentally) and in my adulthood, hes stolen my credit card twice, taken my tax return without permission, and has insulted me heavily whenever we have disagreements. On top of being an absolute narcissist, he is generally very crummy to be around. I love him for being my father, but as a person I dont like him one bit. \n\nNow, the issue comes in when I talk about my mom. Shes amazing, and I'm really lucky to have a parent like her, but lately, with me being back home, she feels like I'm still gone because I never visit. And why dont I visit? Because my dad is still there. I dont know why shes still with him, the dude is incredibly mean and callous to her, but that's irrelevant atm. But shes upset because I havent been around to see her and I mean, I am too. I miss my mom so much...but I guess not enough to put up with seeing my dad. He really is such an asshole...he has me pay for another plane ticket so he can come up to Washington and drive down with me and during the trip, steals my credit card and then gets angry at me for something he unnecessarily damaged while driving down and doesnt even tell me that hes spending on it...and hes done that THREE TIMES. And my mom says I need to forgive him and just try to work with him...HOW??? HOW DO YOU WORK WITH SOMEONE WHO IS NEVER WRONG??? The dude could straight up murder someone and he would find a way to spin it as if it was all the guns fault. He isnt open to talking about our issues and that's why I cant go over there. Hell, I just saw him at the PX and I damn near had a panic attack driving back to the place I'm living at just thinking about this whole thing. \n\nI know this whole thing sounds like a jumbled mess, but I need to know I'm not crazy. I'm making my mom feel like shit because I cant see her and she misses me and I absolutely miss her too, but I really dont want to see my fucking dad. And she hardly ever has time away from the house cause if she isnt at the house, shes at work from 0700-2100, and not back home until 2300.\n\nAITA for not wanting to visit home because I dont want to see my dad?",

      "description": "I saw a post about a McDonald's employee giving obese people sugar-free soda, and that reminded me of a thing at my previous job in fast food. I don't work there anymore, but I still find it an interesting dilemma. \n\nI used to work as a manager at a fast food joint, and one of our regulars was a (somewhat) mentally disabled person. I'm not sure what his exact disorders were, but he looked a bit like he had Down syndrome and spoke very awkwardly. \n\nThis guy would often come and try to order himself a small Coke. Sometimes he'd have the money (in loose change), and sometimes he'd try to get a discount or something. We had to put a stop to the cashiers giving him a discount, as it turns out that he'd just \"find\" more money in his back pocket. Clearly he wasn't as helpless as he came across. \n\nOne day, an older woman comes by saying that she's his mother and caretaker. According to her, the disabled man is diabetic and that we should only serve him the sugar-free drinks. Of course, every time the man ordered, he'd say no to Coke Zero and only wanted the regular thing.\n\nSo, for the next few times (when we remembered, it was a busy restaurant) we'd secretly give him Coke Zero. He didn't seem to notice, but it divided the employees' opinions and was probably against company policy. After all, it's not up to us to decide if he's capable of making his own decisions. We just gave up on it and went back to serving him what he ordered. \n\nSo am I the asshole for giving sugar to this (probably) diabetic mentally disabled man?\n\nJust for clarification:\n\n- The man was probably in his 30s. He came to buy soda almost daily. \n- We didn't have any concrete proof that the woman was his mother (although no one doubted it).",

      "description": "When my wife and I started dating, she had a rescue dog, to which she was quite attached.  She got the dog during a traumatic period in her life, and the dog was also abused, so they formed a strong trauma-based attachment. The dog was abused by males and reacted aggressively towards all males. I'm a dog lover, and empathized, so I set about trying to form a healthy attachment with the dog.\n\nMy presence in the relationship had a lot of positive impact on the dog's behavior, as we spent way more time outside, got more exercise, and generally lived a lifestyle that made the dog happier and improved a lot of behavioral problems. He eventually came to trust many males, became far less aggressive, etc.\n\nHis outlook towards me, however, has never improved. Based on my limited knowledge, because I compete with him for my wife's attention, and he sees her as a resource to be guarded, I've remained Enemy #1 in his eyes. He barks at me constantly, growls any time I go near my wife, and acts as though I'm going to slaughter him any time he and I are alone together. We have tried implementing strategies we could find online, like my wife reducing her attention and affection towards him while I took on the main caregiver role. This helped temporarily but any sign of attention from her would put us right back at square 1.\n\nWe've discussed finding a new home for the dog, and I've never pushed for it. I empathize with the bond they formed, and I see the value he's had to her. I didn't want to, well, be the asshole, and just couldn't feel right about demanding that she get rid of him. He's also getting quite old, and the thought of \"I can wait this out until he passes on\" gave me some hope.\n\nAt this point I'm not sure how much longer I can take it, and it's starting to impact my relationship with my wife. For example, we have a shock collar that we try to use during times when the dog will definitely bark at me. Of course I don't want him to have to wear the collar all the time as it's uncomfortable and I don't feel great about shocking a dog to begin with, but I've become more angry at my wife for not putting the collar on, because the dog barks at me in so many different situations and it's inevitable that she'll take the collar off, only to have him go nuts when I walk back inside from checking the mail.\n\nI'm at my wits end, I'm angry at the dog for being a little shit, at my wife for keeping him around for so long, and at myself for not putting my foot down and protecting my sanity and relationship with my wife sooner. AITA for not patiently riding this out for another 1-4 years until the dog passes on?",

I watched his ABC interview and just couldnt believe the story bleach and noose at 2am by two white MAGA guys who watched empire enough to know this dude? Already a tough thing to believe and Jussies telling of the story only furthered my doubts. My girl of course believes him, she is black and has a habit of defending black people in media, earlier she had even been angry that Bill Cosby had everything taken from him while there are still white men in media who there is proof of their misdeeds yet still havent been taken down. She thinks they should be in trouble before Cosby gets in trouble. \nShe says there is no logical reason for Jussie to plan this whole thing then downshot everything I said that might be reasons. More media attention for real hate crimes, more publicity for himself or maybe because he thought he could get away with it and he wants just more attention. She says I have no proof beyond my gut feeling and what the media has out there, this is true but sometimes the gut is right and its not like I can investigate something in Chicago all I have is what multiple sources are saying is what happened. I dont deny that hate crimes still happen I just dont think this particular case happened to him. I in the end just said it doesnt matter what I think I have no sway in anything that happens to him and she hung up the phone on me in anger AITA? \nSorry for formatting and bad spelling on mobile",

So now it’s looking like half the group are vegetarians so I won’t be cooking for just me. \n\nThis is also happening 2 days after our normal Christmas gathering that I’m having to cook/prep for. \n\nMy mother also mentioned that because my cousins’ kids are all coming (I think 4 in total) that I will be expected to set up my playstion for them. This I absolutely put my food down on and said no way. I don’t care if these kids are family. They are not going to be playing around in my room while I’m not there to supervise. And even if I was, I should be able to expect my privacy in my own room and not be expected to babysit a bunch of kids. \n\nI know these people are family but honestly I’m pretty pissed that I’m going to have to play host to virtual strangers. My mom says she will handle it, but she’s not a young woman and if I don’t step in, she’s going to over work herself just trying to prep the house and won’t be able to cook or anything. So I’ll end up having to play host and entertain these people. \n\nAITA? ",

We can't really get any day's off from work, and my dad won't get paid for any days off since he only makes money when he works, (self employed). Today, my cousin told us that we never loved her and that we don't consider her family, since we were able to go to her older sister's wedding. We recently have had some bills we're trying to pay off immediately but were still able to send her a $2500 wedding present, even though we can't attend. When she told us that we never \"loved her\", i got very mad and told us that she never asked us how we were ever doing and that she should be grateful for what she has and not be selfish, making her even more mad.

      "description": "My husband (30/M) and I (27/F) are not in the best financial shape - we’re both students with part-time jobs but we live with my parents so don’t pay rent. While we don’t have much in the way of monthly outgoings, he has a couple thousand pounds of credit card debt and I’m about to leave my part-time job to focus on my studies for the last few months of my degree, at the end of which (summertime) I will be essentially guaranteed a decent-paying job. \n\nSo I suggested setting a spending limit for each other’s Christmas presents just to make sure neither of us goes overboard. We agreed on £100 ($125) and I would have been happy with much less. He went and bought presents for me today and I asked if he had gone over budget. He said “a little” and I asked how much and he said £50 over (so £150/$190 in total). \n\nSo I said I was a little unhappy about that and asked if he could take something back. He was upset and didn’t seem to get where I was coming from at all. I don’t want to feel ungrateful at all, I very much appreciate that he wants to get me nice gifts but he has a history of spending a lot of money and getting into debt and other people including me having to bail him out, so when he gets me something I know is expensive it makes me uncomfortable thinking about potential consequences. Also because it’s mutual, it means I don’t spend beyond my means either.\n\nMostly what bothers me is the fact that we agreed upon something together and he hasn’t stuck to it. I’m not sure he ever had any intention of doing it (this has happened before to a lesser extent). He says he doesn’t want to do a limit, which would have been fine if he had said that at the time. He said “well I’ll just take everything back then” and later “well you can take it back yourself after then”. \n\nTL;DR: my husband and I agreed on a spending limit and he ignored it. Am I being ungrateful or am I justified in being upset?",

      "description": "I recently started dating someone who I really like. I noticed though, that she ALWAYS gives money to panhandlers. We live in NYC so this isn’t exactly an infrequent occurrence. If we are on the train and someone performs, she will give them money. If we get off the train and someone is shaking a cup, she will give them money. If we are walking down the street and someone has a sign, she will give them money. Almost every time she walks past a panhandler anywhere she will stop and give them some money.  The other day we got into an argument because I wanted to stop by a cash only place but she didn’t have cash to spend because she had already given all her cash away that day to panhandlers. Usually, that wouldn’t be a huge deal since we pay for each other frequently but we had spent the day together and it just annoyed me that the reason she didn’t have cash was because she was so eagerly giving it away to random people. \n\nI could understand if you give every now and then, but I find it very strange that she does EVERY TIME. She actually told me that the only reason she even carries any cash is to give it to people when they ask for it.  I think this is insane. AITA for thinking this is a weird/crazy thing for someone to do? She gives away around $40-$50 a day. Her argument is that she can very easily afford it (true) and that it is her money (also true) and can do whatever she wants with it. On the other end she thinks I’m crazy for even giving a shit.\n\n\nAm I the asshole? \n",

She's a wonderful person and worked hard in college. She's suffered a lot in her childhood and has had injuries in her youth leaving her not completely 100%. She's strong and resolute in her goals besides being no stranger to adversity.\n\nMy mother has had a track record of bad habits and criminal activity starting in '08. When my parents divorced, I was three and up until 2008 I had done the whole weekend swap-house routine between my parents. \n\nIn 2008 she met, we'll call him Jeff. Jeff had a history of armed robbery and such criminal offenses, I think drug charges was one of them as well. Well he somehow convinced my mother that he was a worthy prospect for a relationship. Jeff creeped me out. He made weird off-putting  ?threats? towards me. Like one time I made a paper airplane and he set it on fire and tossed it off a balcony. Really just unsettling things. I did not like him. I voiced this to her. I was ignored. Fast forward a few months and her house is robbed. Jeff and my mother were living together and he had stolen valuables and sold them. That night, (I wasn't there) she assaulted him since he stole her stuff. \n\nJeff and my Mother's relationship resulted in a son, A.\n\nShe was jailed for a few months for the assault. Over the course of the next few years, she was in and out of the system several times due to shoplifting, illegal movie sales, and drug possession. \n\nIn years in-between incarceration, she has me flown out and we've done fun stuff. Family dinners, Christmas, Thanksgiving. I've witnessed her attempt to steal for my benefit, like Christmas gifts, and we had a crying fit together when I made her put it back.\n\nAbout threeish years ago, I was visiting her in WI from CA for Thanksgiving, and she was in another shady relationship. His name will be \"Henry\". Henry seemed ok apart from not having a job, a musty weed smell and breath of an alcoholic. That would be all well and good (well lawfully tolerable) if my mother and himself weren't on probation from previous offenses. The morning after my arrival arrival, I was awoken by her Parole Officer or some Official busting down the door, and searching her place. She was in possession of Alcohol, Marijuana, and I believe some other hard drug, Oxy maybe? Anyways, they were both arrested, right in front of me. They were both on probation and they were charged with violating it. Coupled with new charges for illegal substances. And since I was visiting her, I was far away from a legal guardian, that being in CA. \n\nIn the year of 2017, she got out of jail and managed to get her son A out of foster care after a year. He went in because of the situation I experienced. He wasn't there that night, he was at friends house or something.\n\nA has had a rough life with no stable family, with both parents in the system. His father, Jeff went to prison for meth, and armed robbery, shortly after his relationship with my mother. A has learning disabilities and endures bullying at school. He's 9 now and self harming and depressed. \n\nThis year my mother went back to Jail for the fourth time. She called me while I was in my art class, telling me so. I blocked her and forgot about her. I was starting college soon and I needed help, I couldn't bear  the weight of caring for someone who won't care for  her family. I was destroyed, not because of her but because of A. What will he do?\n\nSo all of that looks bad. But I still feel like an ass because, after all that she is my mother. And I should be there to help her if I can right? She turned to me for help and I'm blocking her out. She was going through tough times and that's understandable. I feel guilty. She's my family, immediate family, she cares for me, accommodates me, and helps me when I ask. Am I doing something wrong here? \n\nTLDR: My mom keeps going back to jail, asks for forgiveness each time. I blocked her from everything and refuse her calls. AITA?",

      "description": "Yo folks. So a few months ago I matched with this girl on tinder and we'be been chatting on and off for a few months. On the count of both of us having just a ridiculously busy schedule and some unfortunate events hitting us both we only me up for drinks this past week. Its the dead of winter here so I took her to a nice coffee and pasty place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn pictures she was physically very my type, however her appearance in person was radically different (she was far shorter and nowhere near the average body type she made herself out to be on pictures). She works with Photoshop for a living so I cant help but suspect there was some kind of shenanigans going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is very nice and we get along extremely well, but I cant see myself going for any kind of romantic relationship with her. I am just not physically attracted to her. Whats more is that I recently underwent some semi scary health issues and since then I've been taking care of myself very seriously, sorting out my diet,working out etc. and I really dont want to get involved with someone that might cause me to fall out of these habits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am gonna try and not ghost this girl, but I really cant see us on another date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "Backstory, my day was probably the worst it has been in months. \n\nWork is extreme stressful, recently I’ve been taking calls from stressed out people who I can’t even help because we are stretched thin as it is and can’t get more help til after the holidays. \nMy gf is going through some things with her family, she lives in a appt with two other people and they all don’t get along.  I can’t even escape over there when I’m stressed because how cramped it is there. \nI live at home but I’m getting ready to move out into a condo soon as soon as the weather is better and I save more.  Until then my life is a living hell living with the parents. \n\nMy relationship with my dad has never been good. He started drinking when I was a baby, I think it was innocent at first, but escalated to him being constantly drunk. I’m taking about going through a 6 pack a day drunk. He used to beat me, yell at me, called me fat, and once pinned me by my thought agent a wall. All of this happened when I was a minor. I never remember doing anything really with him aside from typical dad things, fishing which I never liked, fixing cars, or going to drag races. He never went to things that meant a-lot to me like football, to look at new cars with me, or even movies. Fortunately he stopped drinking around the time I was 18, he claims “he sees whats going on now and nothing can get by me anymore” but Other then smelling like beer and not being funny he haven’t really changed.\n\nFast forward to today. \nI woke up later around 730, I wanted to leave at 8 this morning. My sister came to me asking for a ride I said sure and told her be ready at 8, she came running to my car as i was patiently leaving after waiting an extra 10 min. I told her that i will now be late and she can get a ride elsewhere.. she starts at 945. It was 810 when I left. She then begged my mom and bitched at her to get a ride making my mom late. \n\nWhen I got home later my dad was there and first thing he said was wtf happened this morning, as he “wanted to hear both sides” i told him i waited and then left when she took her time as i was late. He took her said in the argument that it was my family duty to give her a ride (He was mad that my mom bitched at him about my sister). We then started a 2 hour long argument about this. I walked away then asked my mom if I was the family joke as everything that seems to happen is my fault. I start telling her how this feels to me and that i feel that everyone is ganging up on me. Then my dad casually walks by and starts talking about how much everything I am is because of him And that i am nothing if it weren’t without him.\n\nNote my dad is not rich. When I finished school i was given 2k for college, they helped out a little by not charging me rent but in the past year i’ve been paying the electrical bill. About 100$ a month. About 90% of my pay cheque goes to savings because i am extremely strict with my savings and don’t really like to spend money on luxury. \n\nBack to the fight.. \n\nHe said I am nothing with out him and a few more things. Honestly at this point I black out with anger. All i remember saying is “I am about to slap you if you say one more thing” he said “go ahead do it” and I did. I hit him, open palm as hard as I have ever did in my life. \n\nPart of my is regretful. I cried uncontrollably after on the phone and in the car with my gf, i wanted to kill my self. \n\nThe other half is happy that I finally hit is stupid smug smile off his face after he said “I dare ya”. \n\nAm I the asshole?

      "description": "My mother moved from our 5 bedroom family home and asked my siblings to help move out. Over the course of 2 years (over mainly weekends) my sister and I collected everything we owned/wanted to keep from the house’s contents.\n\nMy brother, on the other hand, took it upon himself to deal with storing the the rest of the house’s contents. He moved about a freight trucks worth of furniture, antiques, sentimental items and art to his friends storage unit, several hours away from my home and my sisters home. Recently my brother found out his friend had been selling items from the storage unit without telling anyone and now needs to find a home for all of these items.\n\nHe complained to me that my sister and I didn’t do enough to help with the move and that I’m an asshole for not helping more. \n\nI pointed out to my brother that my sister and I are in full time work and did spend every weekend we could clearing our family home. Since he is unemployed, he is the only one with no time commitments and also the only one who really cares about the rest of the contents of the house. My sister and I also dedicated a number of weekends over two years to help clear the house while he travelled the world only coming back to help a few months before the house was sold.\n\nHe got angry and said some pretty unrelated and shitty things which I know he’s an asshole for, but it’s whether I’m an asshole for leaving my brother to deal with the rest of the house’s contents?\n\n(Every time I tried to help my mum with selling the house, she completely negated any help I offered. I organised visits and meetings with estate agents, builders and lawyers at her request. She didn’t use any of them and despite my protests hired an acquaintance as the realtor. Several months of meetings with businesses only for my mother to pick someone she met personally made me feel like I was wasting my time)",

      "description": "Background: My wife and I have a pre-teen daughter who has made a new friend via a 'social club' for lack of a better term.  Both girls happen to enjoy a particular activity so my wife and I have taken them twice to said activity.  Today the other child's parents decided to take them to an event and we dropped our daughter off at their house this morning.  \nSituation: This afternoon they came to our house to drop off our daughter.  They have an autistic son who as soon as the door opened, stepped into our place and the father, despite saying 'So sorry, we don't mean to intrude', stepped into the room right behind his son.  My wife is in the middle of planting seeds (very long growth tropical plants), so the kitchen was a mess, there were dirty dishes on the counter, there are seeding pots and dirt everywhere, and I was in the middle of hanging shelves so there were tools and dust and parts.  I was congenial while they were here, but after they'd gone I muttered half to myself half to my wife 'I can't stand it when people walk in without being expressly invited, it's fucking rude.'  She became defensive and ended up feeling sad because I was offended and irate (not at her, at the parent of the other kid).  I tried to comfort her, explaining my perspective, that unless expressly invited I would not consider stepping in to someone's house, and unless the visit was expected and planned I would assume the invitation was pro forma and still not enter unless I either had a long term relationship with the family, or the invitation was repeated.  This situation was neither; there was no implied invitation until after they were already in and my wife said 'please come in' nor was there a planned visit.  \nThis particular situation was complicated by his son who is, I'd venture to say, autistic, and the kid led the way in.  I've lived for 10 years next to a severely autistic child who had been taught to not wander into houses uninvited, and whose parents bent over backwards to prevent their child from being an inconvenience to the neighborhood, and in doing so earned the welcome and earnest support of all of us.  \nI dunno, I still feel like what the father allowed his son, and then in turn, him, to do was very rude and I don't think I am wrong for being perturbed.  \nAm I the asshole?",

Mostly because we don’t have space in his room for both our things with our current living situation and also because he is loud in the mornings and I sleep in until our child is awake. So this is the room where I get dressed and sleep most nights as well. The monitor shows pretty much just the inside of the crib and a little of the room around the edges of the crib , but it still picks up all sound in the room. \n\nAm I the asshole for just being uncomfortable about anyone outside our household having a constant stream to that camera at any time or am I overreacting \n\nTl;dr: SO wants to give login to a video monitor that constantly streams in a room I mostly share with our child, to family members outside our household ",

We were going to play Smash and exchange secret santa gifts. \nAll of a sudden a guy going to the party suggested that he’d bring weed brownies.\nAbout half of my friends enthusiastically agreed. There’s about 10 people going to the party and maybe 5 people want to do it.\n\nHonestly, I just don’t like drugs at all so I said I’d probably skip the party if they did. Since then, they’ve called me close-minded, said ‘I don’t have a reason not to go’, saying I’m being unreasonable because they’re not pressuring me to do it, and that this is the only time they’ll ever do it, etc etc. My boyfriend is mad at me too for not wanting to go.\n\nI just don’t feel comfortable at a party with weed! I know it’s a soft drug but I just don’t like it. Am I really being so much of an asshole, reddit? I just feel like it’s unfair that I need some extremely good reason to not like weed, while they can just do it because they feel like it. It doesn’t change my opinion of them at all, we all experiment, I just don’t want to be around it personally. \n\nThey kept asking me about WHY I don’t like weed, saying that if I’m okay with alcohol I should be okay with weed too. (I don’t like alcohol either.) I told them some family had drug problems(including weed) that led to a bad life path, they said “but how do you know it was the weed that led to a bad life? Your family members might have been predisposed to a bad life anyway.” Basically making excuses and further prying into my personal life. I wasn’t comfortable with this.\n\nI did say, ‘can’t you do it any other day?’ because they were trying to figure out how to\nmake it work between those who wanted to do it and those who didn’t, which maybe came off as rude and demanding. Otherwise I’ve never tried to like blackmail them from not doing it by saying I wouldn’t come, although I guess it could come off that way.\n\nAm I too much of a goody two shoes?

      "description": "I work as a waiter part time. Since im 17 and in full education, I only do friday and weekends depending on the rota. Well on sunday, I was to work 12pm-3pm, and mid shift the team leader of whatever its called asked me to stay and extra hour. \n\n\n\n  I didn't because since I had work friday and saturday I hadn't done my homework. (I know an hour isn't much but I sorta couldn't be bothered). Plus the lunch rush was starting to end. \n\n\n\n\n  The shift leader was going on about why I never stay for extra hours. I told her because I go to school and need to put that first. Then out of nowhere another waiter decides to 'one up' me by saying \"I have a daughter, and I still stay when I'm told to, why dont you stay?\". I did get a bit sassy and say in a normal voice \"its not my problem that the manager didn't do the rota properly\". \n\n\n The shift leader decided to let me finish at 3pm. I went home. Thing is that I finished my homework the hours before by shift began at home and I just wanted some time to chill because I was busy all weekend and hardly every get time to myself. If I told the shift leader I wanted to chill she would of made me stay. But still... I cleared my section and stayed a few minutes extra to finish bits and left.\n",

My girlfriend, who also lives with me, was okay with it for a couple weeks but now refuses to go bowling because she \"doesnt like it\". Shes pretty good at it and we all seem to have a good time when she goes. \n\nNow she gets mad when I go with the rest of my roommates since she gets left at the house alone. I spend pretty much the whole day with her and when the time comes that all my roommates want to go bowling she makes me feel guilty that I'd rather go than spend time with her. We usually go a couple times a week as well as Friday and Saturday nights. \n\nShe's also been upset with me lately since I just decided that I cant go on a 200 mile hike with her this summer since I cant afford the time off work. So i think shes quick to judge anything I want to do for the time being. \n\nThanks for your time\n\n\n ",

Presumably that was just the way he drove.\n\nI tapped by brakes repeatedly. Didn't work.  Two times I gradually slowed down, roll my window down and with my hand make a  pushing motion, hand vertical moving toward him, to signal to back off.  *(Obviously we do not have a good hand signal to \"back off.\")*  He did not get the message.  I would then speed up again to keep pace with traffic.  I did this procedure several times, but it didn't work. \n\nHe kept tailgaiting.  Really close.   \n\nI had paper and tape in the car.  My wife in the car with me wrote a small note *Stop Tailgaiting!*   At a red light I jumped out of my car and quickly went to his car and taped it to his windshield.  Note was small (3 inch square) and I taped in to the low left side where it would not interfere with his vision at all.  (He was white, like me; I presumed he could read English.)\n\nHe starts lamming on his car horn.  He was an old guy.  I'm middle aged.  I presumed it was not going to get into a physical road rage dispute, not from my end, anyways.  I did it real fast--maybe 4 seconds total.  Jumped back in my car quickly.  Felt it was preferable to any verbal exchange.\n\nHe kept honking for some time.  But it worked: *He stopped tailgaiting.*\n",

      "description": "So I (26m) have a mate (26m) who I've been good mates with for roughly 7 years give or take, we confide in each other for a lot of things, if I was to get married he would be my best man. We used to hang out a few times a week, but obviously as we have gotten older, girlfriends, jobs. Etc, that time is significantly less frequent.\n\nA bit of background info regarding our jobs. Im a shift worker who does 4 days a week for 12 hours ranging from days, arvos and nights. This alone has reduced my friend circle a lot due to potentially working any day or the week, being weekends, public holidays and other days.\n\nHe does 10pm-6am, 5 days a week. This significantly affects the time that we can hang out and meet without having a schedule conflict. In the past when we have hung out its usually for lunch, dinner, or linner (combo of both like brunch).\n\nA few months ago we organised to hang out. We set up a time and date in the arvo, 5 days from the inital message to hang out. He messaged me roughly 6 times in the week to confirm the time and date with me telling him the time and date each time. \n\nFast forward to the day we are meant to meet up, I didn't eat due to meeting up with him from lunch. I didn't get a message or phone call at all that day. I message him at 4pm giving him the benefit of the doubt, thinking he may have forgot. I didnt get a reply until 2 hours later stating \"oh shit i forgot\". I was rather annoyed as he messaged me 6 times in the days leading up to it, to confirm the date and time. His reply was \"cunt, you know I forget shit all the time\". \n\n(Just for context, in Australia cunt is basically another word for mate). I pretty much told him he was an adult and needed to take more responsiblity for his actions as he is an adult. He then tried to change the subject asking if I knew some random person. I ignored him for a few days after this as there was no apology on his behalf. It was him basically trying to put the blame back on me. \n\nA week after I spoke to him on the phone and told him that it wasn't on as I don't much time off from work so I value my time and would rather spend it with people who want to hang out with me. He eventually apologised after i reminded him that he never even apologised for it, and we moved on. \n\nWe organised again to meet up a few weeks after with me making sure he knew the date and time. The exact same thing happened, only this time his excuse was that he fell asleep. Once again no apology, I suggested maybe if he knew he was hanging out with someone at a specific time and date he set a reminder, or even an alarm to wake up. \n\nWe moved past it and hung out a few times beteeen then and the most recent incident.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago we went through the same rigmarole. We were meant to meet up at 2pm for lunch, he event said that he had set and alarm and wanted to go to the gym afterwards and blah blah blah.\n\nExact same thing happened again, I didn't eat and waited until 3.30pm before I messaged with \"sick hangout, lets do it again sometime\". I didn't get a reply until 4.30pm from him stating \"bro I was asleep -_-\".\n\nI completely ignored him as once again no apologies just roughly 20 phones calls and messages asking why I wasn't talking to him. I'm more pissed off as I could've organised to hang our with other friends I haven't seen in a while but instead i waited almost a whole day before I got told by him that we weren't hanging out.\n\nI'm at that point where I'm contemplating not talking to him anymore. There has been other stuff in the past that has happened but i feel this is the straw that broke the camels back.\n\nWIBTA if i was to cut all contact with my friend?\n\nTl:dr: Best mate and I were meant to hang out on three separate occasions and each time he ghosted me with an excuse. I had to ask for an apology each time. Considering cutting him out of my life.",

      "description": "I feel like an asshole for it because I can't specifically pinpoint a reason. I mean for one thing I rarely see some family members so I naturally feel a bit awkward when I do go and visit but I feel it even more with him? He's in his late fifties and has lived at my grandparents house his whole life- which I think is more of a shame than anything else- but he's never kept the house clean (layers of dust) and never goes outside or socialises. I think there's a bigger issue in his life that he needs help with that's beyond what I can do, but at the same time it makes for very uncomfortable visits. His social skills are a bit off, awkward laughter, heavy breathing, long monologues about either (a) controversial topics everyone in the surrounding area disagrees with but is too polite to say (b) topics he knows hundreds of facts about but we know nothing. Obviously being in a house filled with grime and dust is not very pleasant either. My parents have been telling me lately that he specifically keeps asking after me, which I guess sure I'm his niece, I started uni and we share some interests, is understandable. But also still makes me uncomfortable because I already just feel weird around him. I don't know. I think I am a little bit the asshole because we're family, there has been no inciting incident to cause discomfort and he's just a really isolated, socially awkward guy. Obviously when we meet I chat and would never be unfriendly but I just don't like being around him or having him be so interested in me. ",

      "description": "So my fiance Joe and I have a pretty good relationship. This story has a few parts to understand where it's coming from.\n\nTldr- I sometimes in good fun wack my fiance and he went awhal \n\nJoe and I were messing around, I was wacking him with a sock and he was wacking me with a knitted hat. We were laughing, joking, having fun. He goes to walk away and as he does I hit him with a pair of underwear on his leg, he then went awhal and screamed at me about hitting him and how hes told me to stop.....which stems from 2 other times....\n\nWe were in the car and I was getting business done for him on the phone. They needed his ID number so I let him know preumptively. When I got to an agent and they asked the number I was miming to him to indicate for the ID number while saying something on the phone about getting the number. He didnt respond so I started tapping his shoulder (I didnt think it was hard, he did) and he eventually understood.\n\nA few days later we were driving and his hand was in my lap, I warned him of the upcoming school zone and when we got there he sped up to like 23 in a 20 as a \"joke\" and my anxiety went through the roof so I started wacking his hand telling him to *slow down* \n\nI also regularly slap his ass and sometimes I miss and hit a bit too high which I know can hurt, but so does he. \n\nI also slap his face with my boobs often which he is receptive to and encourages, but I know that can hurt?\n\nI also will lightly slap his man boob as a joke because he likes to do the same to mine\n\nWhen we later fought because he screamed at me he said he was sick of me hitting him and refused to discuss the issue past that, despite the fact he was joking *with* me and showed no social cues of being bothered by the sock fest. He then said discussing it made him uncomfortable and wanted to just drop it.\n\nI have already agreed I would not mess with him except in certain ways anymore, but I'd like to know if I'm truly wrong or if he overreacted\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to go to prom with another guy?",
      "description": "Ok so I started dating this girl about 3 months ago after being close friends for about 5 months. Prom has always been a common topic for us because she goes to an untraditional school so they don't have their own prom. Not a big deal, my school has a prom so we would just go to that. But here is where it gets complicated. She had already promised another guy (lets call him M) years ago that she would go to prom with him. I knew about this beforehand but I assumed that him knowing she had a boyfriend would mean that it would probably not work out. But I was wrong. M was still planning on going with my girlfriend. When he brought it up to her she called me.\n     I was just getting back from work when i got her call. She said that M was still expecting to go with her and she was wondering when my prom was so the dates wouldn't overlap. Ultimately if they were on the same day she would go with me, she made that clear. So she was planning on going to two proms, one with M and one with me. She then asked \"you're ok with this right?\" I hesitated a little but then said it was ok. Huge mistake. After that call i started immediately thinking the whole situation, but it wasn't until I spoke about it to my friends did i realise how much I disliked the arrangement. I texted her later that day saying that the idea of her going to prom with another guy, friend or not, made me feel uncomfortable. We have a pretty secure relationship but this was a bit to much for me. She said she wasn't going to do anything that made feel uncomfortable so she cancelled her plans with M. She feels bad about it because he was really excited about it and she had already confirmed with him and his parents that shr would be going with him. I also felt bad but I hoped he would understand. Now M isn't even talking to my girlfriend and I feel like my girlfriend deep down is pissed that I ended their friendship. Am I the asshole for not wanting my girlfriend to go to prom with another guy?\nTLDR: I asked my girlfriend to cancel her prom plans with another guy and now he won't even talk to her",

My dad has always badmouthed students/universities and said that they are lazy and useless and don't know how to work, so he doesn't want either of us to go to uni. Also uni isn't completely free here and from what my brother has told me especially the study materials can be quite expensive. My brother already went to high school against his wishes and he's doing very well and wants to go to uni to study computer science, which means that he'll have to commute an hour by train to the uni. \n\nThis really pissed my dad off and he told him that he should just get training and start working to earn money. He also said that he wasn't paying for his train tickets and study fees (bro's law teacher said dad has no choice but to pay) and that he could move out if he doesn't get a job.\n\nHis mom never stands up for him because my dad is a lot more dominant than her, she often just goes along without saying much. I don't think he'd be happy with a trained job, and dad says really stupid things sometimes. I told him just because he was a meathead doesn't mean that my brother has to become one as well, and that if he makes my brother move out, I'd move out with him as well. This really worked because my dad is always overprotective and spoiling me, so he hasn't complained again. AITA for threatening my dad and calling him a meathead?  \n",

      "description": "Preface this with a disclaimer- i do not believe in equality of the sexes. A man has to conduct himself with a certain degree of gentlemanliness, if you will. I always open doors for women, offer a hand if something they're carrying seems too heavy, seat on public transport, etc. And teach my two sons that.\n\nThat said, this particular happened about five days ago. I was in the ER with a pretty severe chest infection- my fever was nearly at 40 C, and i was in rotten shape. The waiting area of the hospital has about ten seats- the only one available was next to me.\n\nA couple walked in with a baby- let's call them Dimwit Husband (DH) and Stupid Wife (SW). DH takes the free seat next to me, while SW is standing.\n\nAbout five minutes later,\n\nSW: Excuse me, could i sit down there?\n\nMe- where?\n\nSW- Could i ask you to give me that seat. I've been holding my daughter since we got here.\n\nMe (now genuinely flabbergasted)- sorry- ask your husband to carry your daughter. He's sitting right next to me.\n\nSw: he's been at work for the last 20 hours. Is it going to hurt you to give up your place for a child?\n\nMe- excuse me, are you stupid or fucking blind? I'm in the emergency department of a hospital, and you ask ME to give you a seat, instead your fucking husband here?\n\nSW: Excuse me- what did you just say?\n\nDH finally steps in with this gem\n\nDH: Put her in her pram. Evidently courtesy is too much to ask for.\n\nI turned and told him to piss off, when two doctors heard the altercation and stepped in. They offered her a wheelchair to use, and she went off muttering to herself. DW chose to go STAND with her at the other end of the room.\n\nHonestly, i wouldn't have minded if i wasn't as ill as i was. What further annoyed me was that the guy in no way made an effort to give up his seat for his own wife and infant daughter, and chose to be shitty about it. The most aggravating part- hospital staff acting like i was part of the problem. Fuck that.\n\nAm i the asshole here- or is this fucking prick the problem? I have been in an ineffective rage for the last five days over this shit.",

      "description": "\nI had a crush on this girl in 11th grade. I asked her for notes and it all started from there. As I started getting to know her better, I started liking her even more. She was smart, thoughtful, and very pretty. We had plenty of similar interests from films and music to our careers. I believed that she was the one for me &amp; I would never find someone like her.\n\nBut, she was dating someone in a different city for 2 years. It seemed to be going well. However, a week before our final exams, she called me, in tears, saying how he had broken up with her. \n\nWhen we met after the exams, she confessed to me that she liked me, I told her I liked her too. Confused abt her ex, she said she wasn’t sure what to do, and me, being an idiot, told her that it was probably better to go with her ex. The reason I said that, instead of suggesting we get together, was that I was headed abroad for Uni and was skeptical about a LD relationship. Also, I thought that if she started to like me while she was in a long distance, she might end up liking someone while I was away. \n\nShe decided that she was no longer interested in dating anyone at all until she got her 5 year degree. I accepted that, being  heartbroken. Tbf, I kinda did tell her to move on and focus on her career, and didn't present myself as an option, only hinting at it.\n\nI went abroad for my degree soon. A few months in, I asked her how she was and she said she was much better. I then asked her how she felt about me and if she wanted to try a long distance relationship. She said she wasn’t interested in dating anyone and that if I wanted to date her, I would wait for her to get her degree. I asked if she still had feelings for me, to which she didn’t bother responding. I told her that it wouldn’t make sense for me to wait for her, unless she felt the same way about me, but she said that I should wait regardless. We stopped talking altogether later. \n\nI contacted her after months and we got back to talking. I once again expressed my feelings to her, and she regurgitated the whole wait for me bit. I said that if she didn’t have any feelings, I would never again bother her about it again. I wanted her to be a part of my life, even if only as a friend.\n\nAfter some time, she said she wanted to start calling regularly to keep in touch, but she would always come up with an excuse last moment. She would just say that she was too busy. \n\nWhen I’d go back home, she would make me wait for an hour minimum and would refuse to admit fault in the slightest. \n\nWhat really got to me was when I had to fly back when my grandmother passed away. When I. told her, all she said was ‘heartfelt condolences’. She didn’t bother asking how I was doing, or how I was dealing with it.\n\nIt took me over 3 years to finally see how selfish she truly was. She kept me a back-up just in case she didn’t find anyone else. \n\nI can see how me asking her abt her feelings for me could make me seem like an ass. So, AITA? ",

      "description": "We have been dating for let's say? A year now and I am still virgin, my girlfriend is not. But we have VERY strict parents and rarely have the opportunity to actually experiment with sex, but with the pressure of living up to the standards of my girlfriends last sexual experience (which was her first) \n\n  But once her mom left the house after almost 7 months of waiting to be alone we finally had our chance. The problem being that I was putting on the condom when I thought it had a tear in it, and I got really annoyed and mad because this was our ONLY chance in a matter of 7 months, and I want to pleasure her physically and mentally and lose my virginity and her last experience sexually being not good ( I won't go into it but it was a bad choice for her age at that time) so I wanted to \"blank\" out that section of bad times and replace it with some good ones (I can see where some of these points are deemed selfish but I just wanted to show her a good time).\n \n   Back to where I got mad after breaking of the condom, I got mad and annoyed and took it off put on my cloths and went into the living room. Yelled \"Fuck!\" And sat down mumbling to myself about how stupid I am. And my girlfriend came into the living room and tried to cheer me up but didn't really say a word.\n\n  Later that night, after hating on myself for hours, I get a text from my girlfriend saying \"hey can I tell my sister what Happened?\" I then say sure. But then I ask her \" have you already told her?\" She responded saying her she did. Which is rude enough from my POV because she completely told her sister everything. And this is hands down the most embarrassing thing to every happen to me. I just started to sob I felt pathetic and stupid. But eventually I got over it that night and woke up the next day alright but still kinda hating on myself. My girlfriend atfter school then tells me how they both laughed about it in her sister's car, and I could have not felt worse. My first time trying to have sex and it's just bullied by my girlfriend and her sister who on their first times had successful sex. And they laughed at someone who messed up the first time. \n\n   Idk if I'm the asshole for thinking like this but after that all three times we tried to have sex after that failed, because of my performance anxiety\n\n  So please judge me, hate me or agree with me. Just please try to give me something to ease this thought.",

      "description": "Ill try and make this short as possible without leaving anything out.\n\nMy biological mother passed away from cancer when i was 9 and my brother was 7. Before my mother getting sick and her passing, she divorced my father and he remarried. Now i dont know if something happened between my mother and my step mother, but she would almost refuse to let me and my brother to see her before her passing. My father would just blow it off and take her side. Fast forwarding a few years i found out she was lying about all of this to her son. Telling him that she would always talk mad shit about her and her son (my step brother). She would not invite my mothers side of the family to graduation parties, school band concerts, sports games, because she didnt want the \"drama\" and other things such as that. I am now 20 years old and in the military overseas. I have no intention of staying home on leave, i told her that i am going to stay in a hotel while at home, kind of playing it off. But i know she knows why i am not going to stay at home on leave. And is questioning why. My brother is also backing my decision. As he plans to get out of the house soon to get away from her. She would not send pictures to anyone on my mothers side of the family of us growing up. This made them feel like they did something wrong, and made me and my brother feel like we were nothing. We were constantly scared to say anything in that house, due to the fact that she would scream at us and bring something up about my mother and how im \"just like her.\" We were afraid to speak up for or about anything, even scared to ask whats for dinner.\n\nMy father is also talking to me and my brother about the possibility of splitting because he feels that she is taking advantage of him. She quit her job to stay at home, makes him buy her cigs and other stupid shit that she should work for herself and pay for. \n\nI feel like an asshole for not visiting, but i dont want all those bad memories coming back. I have no intention on even seeing her.",

I and my mother, sister and step dad do not believe in school. She's been really mean to my bisexual sister at some points by continuously implying that she should get her hair dyed rainbow. It's like walking on eggshells with her around because you can't make a single joke without her being offended. Seriously.\n\nShe has done a lot for me though, as she help support my indie game development company in supplying an upgraded computer for me, and she has helped me in that kind of way most of the time she's lived with my dad. But at the end of the day I don't believe that that was her doing that from her heart if you know what I mean. I think that was my dad having her help me. I'm going to answer questions if any of this is unclear.\n\nShe isn't completely terrible either.

      "description": "Okay so this happened about half a year ago when Me and my ex-bff (A) were still friends. We were best friends for 2 years and I really thought that she was the best friend ever. Me an A had so much in common. But the thing is, I was really depressed and self-conscious while we were friends, and she was the last thing I thought would be the cause.\n\nA had recently had a habit of raging at me for the tiniest things, so this could have been one of the causes of the incident. \n\nSo basically, I commented ‘ew’ on all of her pictures on Instagram. I thought it would be obvious it was a joke, but little did know it would cause A to go ABSOLUTE SUPER SAIYAN ON ME. Long story short, lots of texts from her and her friend (L) that was over her house, (A had lied that she had to go shopping with her family so that L could go over instead of hanging out with me), lots of videos, and texts every day for about a week. I was an absolute wreck during the whole thing. \n\nShe has replaced me with this awful person she called a friend in seconds. The thing is, I’m pretty sure that we had known L for only a couple of months and I’m pretty sure all the bad things in between me and her had started when she arrived. The punchline is that L abandoned A a month or two later to hang out with ‘the cool kids’. L wasn’t ever the nicest person to me (idk why she didn’t like me because I had done nothing to her), so it is possible that she had convinced A to go Super Saiyan on me. \n\nWhen I stopped being friends with A I had gained so much self-confidence. I feel like this is important.\n\nSo there you have it. So it begs the question, who’s the asshole? Me, A or L?\n\n(No mean comments please)",

I, on the other hand, am completly against any kind of religion. On a day to day basis, i can shut up  and i am not sharing my opinions or arguments with anybody else, especially religious people, because i know that it won.t lead to any change in theyr belive system or anything. Except when i am having a glass or two, after this, i simply cannot shut up, especially in the religion area. I feel the need inside to make them understand that they are beeing irrational and/or dellusional.\nAnd so, i am discussing with some friends, and my girlfriend the possibility of us getting married. My girlfriend says that she is not considering the possibility of getting married in any other place that a church. I say ok, i can live with that, not a big deal, it.s our decision, as adults who understand what they are doing. But then, she goes onto saying that she is also not considering the possibility of our chirldren not beeing baptisied, and thus beeing christians right after they are born. Now, don.t get me wrong, if, or when i will have a children, he or she cand be anything he or she wants to be, in every aspect. Gay, transgender, christian, muslim, budhist, white, black, blue, doesn.t matter to me, it will be my kid and i will love the crap out of it no matter what. But, what i won.t accept is the thinking that we, as parents, are entitled to make such a big decision for our kids (to baptize them), at an age when they cannot possibly understand what  we are doing to them. It will affect my life too much to baptize my kid? No. It will affect my kid.s life if it will be christian? Probabbly no. This means tacking a decision for my kid, that i am not entitled to? From my point of view, yes. I am willing to baptize my kid for the sake of my girlfriend or wife? No. I won.t take that decision for them, no matter what, i think that they should take this decision, if they feel the need. i won.t make any decision for them that are not legally requested, such as naming my kid. For this, i am the asshole, as she is now very upset on me. You decide if i am or not. Sorry for long post\n\nTL, DR: girlfriend says that she wants to baptize our (possible) children. We are not planning to have a kid right now, is pure theoretical. I don.t want to baptize my kid, because i don.t want to take such a decision for him or her, girlfriend gets very upset at me",

It’s loud, obnoxious, they drink and smoke and watch old reruns of wrestlemania and other such nonsense.

Also the way our house is laid out, the only place I can moderately escape them is our bedroom. I’m also two months pregnant, and my tolerance for these shenanigans is at an all time low and it’s not really comfortable for me to be in bed for hours unless I’m sleeping. (No chairs or headboard in the bedroom.) \n\nI’ve asked my husband multiple times if they can do this at his friends house instead of ours, and he absolutely refuses. I don’t think he’s even mentioned it to his friend. His friend is single and lives alone, so there’s no roommates or anything for them to bother.

      "description": "Throwaway because a few people know this story so I’d like to keep it away from my main.\n\nThis happened a few years ago but I still feel bad about it and get mixed responses when I bring it up, so here goes.\n\nMy parents split when I was 3 so I was raised by a single mother most of my life. When I was a teenager, she came out to me as a lesbian (nbd, as soon as I learnt what a “stereotypical lesbian” looked like as a kid, I remember thinking, “huh, like my mum.” so I kinda guessed).\n\nShe never really dated though, just a few people here and then. When I was 23, she got into her first long term relationship since my father. The woman was really nice and they got on really well, no issue with her whatsoever.\n\nOne night they came home drunk at about 1am from a date. Now, my mother rarely gets drunk. I’ve seen her drunk about twice in my life and we go out drinking together quite a bit. But she was very drunk, very loud and I could hear her laughter 3 floors up.\n\nI had to get up at 6am for work, so I rolled over hoping they’d shut up and go to bed soon. They did. I’m almost falling back to sleep when I hear moaning. Loud moaning. My mum and her girlfriend have very different voices so I can just instinctively tell that it’s her and not the girlfriend. I try to put a pillow over my head and ignore it, I try to hum to myself, I can’t wear earplugs because I’ll miss my alarms. It’s not so loud it would be keeping me awake but it’s the nature of the sound that’s reverberating through my skull and preventing me from sleeping.\n\nIt’s about 2am now and it’s not stopping. I really need sleep and I feel kind of insane from listening to this for nearly an hour. I decide I have to stop it, so I call the house phone which is next to her bed. I hear silence for a few seconds while it rings, then she answers very quietly with “Hello?” and I just say, “Sorry, I really need to sleep, I have work in the morning.” She says sorry and I hang up. Dead silence. I fall asleep.\n\nI don’t see the girlfriend again. At all. My mother and I never mention it. Two months later, they break up. A year or so passes and we’re talking about the girlfriend and my mum makes a comment about how “she was always embarrassed to come over again after that night” and I feel awful.\n\nI just wanted to sleep without hearing my mother’s sex noises. I tried to think of the least invasive way to do it, hoping she could’ve made an excuse or something instead of telling her it was me hearing them, but I guess she didn’t. And she hasn’t had a long term relationship since.\n\nAITA? I feel like it.\n\nTL;DR Interrupting my mother having sex with her girlfriend, leading at least partly to them breaking up and ruining her only ever long term relationship since my dad.",

      "description": "I have an incurable, life threatening illness. I was diagnosed with it when I was in elementary school. My disease has nearly killed me multiple times. It stole most of my childhood and it made me miss out on many academic opportunities.\n\nRecently, my family and I found out that Make-A-Wish isn't just for terminally ill kids, it's also for kids with life threatening illness. We spoke to my doctor about applying and he felt that I would qualify due to of the severity of my condition and the fact that Make-A-Wish has already accepted kids with the same condition. He filled out all the paperwork and submitted my application. Almost immediately Make-A-Wish rejected my application. Their reason was that I was no longer sick enough. They said that if I had applied when I was sicker they would have considered me. \n\nWe didn't even know I could apply at that point. Even if we did, we wouldn't have. My family thought I was going to die. I was quarantined for my own safety because my immune system was so weak.\n\nNow, when I see kids who have received wishes I feel kind of bitter. Especially the ones who had cancer but are now cancer free. I get so frustrated because most of them will remain cancer free the rest of their lives but I will have to live with my condition forever. It irritates me that they're considered sick enough but I'm not. I'm not even angry that I didn't get a wish. I don't want to be sicker either. Honestly I'm not even sure why I'm so upset.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my roommate, whose rent I'm currently paying for, that her BF can't come over anymore?",
      "description": "To start off, some context:  I found my current roommate online.  She's very nice and we're courteous to each other, but do not have enough common interest to be considered friends by any means.  She moved into a kind of luxury apartment without first having a stable job, but by working odd jobs here and there, she was able to pay rent (albeit somewhat late at times) for the better part of a year.  Nice girl, but just doesn't seem to be great with money, probably spent as much as she made.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward to this past month, she's not able to make rent.  I talked to her multiple times in the beginning, but was greeted with \"I just can't.\"  Then, she gets into a car accident, which sets her back even more.  So of course we're talking to the building at this point (only after a lot of prompting from me), and they are pretty accommodating and was willing to wait to see if she can get money together.  She was going through a lot, so I tried not to be too obnoxious and didn't probe her too much about it.  Eventually, she finally went back home at the end of the month to see if her parents would help her.  They won't.  At this point, I am beyond frustrated.  Even her relatives wouldn't lend money to her, and to save my own credit score, I, someone who doesn't even know her that well, had to end up paying for her rent. And of course, I made her sign a promissory note with me in the hopes that she'll pay me back.  At this point, I have just simply decided that it's time for her to move out, and to just find another roommate on my own.  She agreed to it, but asked for a week to do it and we tagged on some more rent money to what she owed me to quantify for the week.  \n\nNow comes the issue, which is honestly kind of petty in normal circumstances, but I feel that I have already suffered through a lot with this girl.  So she has this BF that she brings back home 3-4 nights out of the week.  Since they're both nice and unassuming, they go immediately to her room and don't really take up common space in the apartment all that much.  However, and this is definitely just a personal preference, I don't really like roommates bringing someone of the opposite sex over, especially when I can hear them doing stuff in their room from time to time (a lot of smacking noises for the most part).  It was fine when she was legitimately living here and deserved her space and who she brings over, but now that I'm literally paying for everything, it is irking me even more.  I know it's for the last week, but I've really just can't suffer through it anymore.  Every time I hear something, I just cringe internally and get very angry (almost unreasonably so).  I am thinking of bringing this up to her today and just being honest and telling her that her BF can't be here, and that she should go to his place if they wanna hangout.  \n\nAm I being an asshole?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, any tips on how to approach the topic with her?  I've actually been very nice with her even throughout this whole thing, as I know it's a rough time for her, so we actually still have a pretty good rapport, and I don't want to destroy that either...",

      "description": "okay so I’ve (28/M) been with my GF (25/F) for nearly 4 years. We’re currently on holiday and last night we went out for a couple drinks and she was quite drunk. We had a conversation of what it’s gonna be like when we get married ( we both know it’s not for a good few years yet), it was nice discussing what we both wanted and for the most part I just agreed with her wishes and dream. It was sweet but all hypothetical. Anyway, at one point she said she wants me to give up smoking before we get married, I agreed because I want to too and said I’d make a deal with her that I will give up this year after my birthday in May and if I didn’t I had to buy her some Jimmy Chu’s and if I did I have to spend and extra £1k on the engagement ring.\n\nNow I want to point out that she’s not normally so money driven. Like most girls her age she likes expensive designer things but is definitely not with me for money as I have none. We split bills all the time and tbh as she doesn’t have to pay rent she treats me to small things more often than I treat her. \n\nWhen I’ve personally thought about weddings I just think it’s a colossal waste of money. If it were entirely up to me it would be a very small affair with only close family and friends in a modest back garden setting with modest wedding stuff. With all the money saved I’d rather spend more on a lovely honeymoon for my bride and I instead of paying for an expensive meal for random family members and friends I barely know. Obviously, it’s not all up to me and I would want her to be happy and get what she wants.. within reason. \n\nWhen I said I would only spend 1.5k on a ring she got very huffy and told me she’d say No if she didn’t get the ring she wanted. I think marriage should be about love and it shouldn’t matter what ring you get, she should either be happy that I’m asking to spend my life with her or not want to be with me anyway. She stopped talking to me last night and this morning she’s saying it was drunken argument and we should forget it but she stands by everything she said last night.\n\nI feel quite hurt by it and it’s not something that can be swept under the rug as it’s our future. It’s changed my opinion of her and I can’t just stop thinking about it. I love her to death and never felt this way about anyone, we’ve had four lovely years but I’m sure this argument will keep tearing its ugly head. Am I being an arsehole? ",

      "description": "On mobile, apologies in advance for spelling and format issues.\n\nI have a friend who is a gay transgender person. He is a leftist, but not in the traditional sense (believes in political systems such as anarchy etc). I am a male, non denominational Christian, more conservative (although I'm not very political minded), and heterosexual/cisgender. Basically we are polar opposites. We usually get along pretty well, with the occasional debate with our other friends in our group about politics, which I usually lose these debates because I'm more of free minded (not really sure how to describe this, basically I just want to be free and happy). Anyways I'll cut to the chase.\n\nSo recently, around Christmas time, we got into a texting debate about religion. Which is what I feel I'm strong in debating. Anyways this friend (I'll just say F for short) is basically \"slut shaming\" the mother of Jesus, and how she probably got raped in a back alley instead of getting pregnant by the holy spirit. He then continued on with different misquotes and false facts from the Bible. This triggered me. I started defending myself, and the debate went really far into the Bible, so far that the topic began to sway twords homosexuality. At one point I said that homosexuality was a sin, and against the Bible. At that point, F just said he was done putting up it and left the group chat. Then he blocked me. We havent spoken since, and as far as I know, F has completely given up on me as a friend (we had been friends since about this time last year, and got closer near the beginning of September it so (beginning of the school year) because we had a bunch of classes together). At this point, I'm starting to think that F  was just after next for love (tried to hook up with me around the beginning of the school year, showed all the signs, tried to flirt, etc) until I put a stop to it, saying I wasn't interested in an intimate relationship. And since then we have been friends until this recent debate. So my overall question is: *AITA for debating up to this point and offending F?* Any feedback would be extremely helpful, thanks!",

      "description": "So I need a bit of an outside perspective because I can't tell if I'm just being childish.\n\nBackground information: I'm 23 years old and temporarily moved back in with my dad while I'm finishing my degree; this has been the first holiday season since my parents split up; dad has been in a new relationship for 5ish months; this isn't really a Christmas problem, it's just worse now than it has been so far; I've talked to him about this before but apparently he doesn't really care, since he's taking it to the extreme right now.\n\nA couple weeks ago my father asked me if I'd be okay with him spending part of the holidays with his long-distance girlfriend. I told him it was a-okay, as long as he spends Christmas Eve at home, because traditionally that's the most important holiday of the year in my family. Initially, he agreed, but apparently his gf went into terror mode and threatened to break up with him if he didn't think she was \"important enough\" to spend Christmas Eve with. He asked me if I'd be okay with inviting her to our place, which I refused because I wanted him to pay attention to me on this one single day and didn't want to play the hostess to her three children and four dogs. It was selfish, I know, but it seriously has been an incredibly rough year and I have zero energy left. So instead I backed down from the Christmas Eve thing and suggested he spends the 26th with me instead. In the end, the \"compromise\" he landed on with his gf was that he left on the 17th and came back on the 26th. We did none of the usual ceremonious stuff, just exchanged gifts, then he spent the rest of the day on his phone, to the point where I wished he would have just stayed away. He was very sad/angry because I'd spent Christmas Eve with my mom instead, and he left again the next day. The only contact we've had since then was a brief \"Happy new year!\" - \"You too!\" text conversation. He told me before he left that he always turns of his phone when he's with his girlfriend, and gave me her number \"in case of an emergency.\" \n\nHe's going to be back tomorrow and I have no idea how to greet him. I'm supposed to be civil because he's going to have his gf and her children with him, but I'm so hurt and angry because he doesn't seem to care about me at all.\n\nReasons why I don't think I'm the asshole:\n* We have a house and four pets to take care of, so I can't leave for an extended period of time when my father's gone, which is a problem, since he's spent *literally* every weekend at his girlfriend's place for the past three months.\n* This has been the shittiest of years for me in more ways than one. I already do most of the housework even when he's here and I wish I could have taken a break at least for a few days around Christmas.\n* He talks a lot of shit about my mother because she doesn't give a fuck about her children, but the only reason he's more involved in my life than she is is because I happen to live here. Christmas was the first time in months that he's seen my brothers, who both live less than half an hour away.\n* I don't think it's entirely unreasonable to want to spend time with your parents, even as an adult.\n* I have an eating disorder, which he knows about. I skip a lot of meals when there's no one here to make sure I eat enough. I'm aware enough of this to know it's a problem and not quite strong enough to do something about it by myself.\n\nCounterpoints:\n* I'm an adult. It's not like I'm lost and helpless without him and he shouldn't still have to base his life choices around my well-being.\n* I don't have to pay rent when he's not here, so I don't have any extra expenses.\n* A lot of problems would have been solved had I just agreed to invite his girlfriend here for Christmas Eve.\n* It's entirely possible that I'm just jealous because he gets to take a three-week-vacation while I'm stuck between work, household chores and pet duty.\n* It's also possible that I'm just jealous because he spends way more time with his \"new family\" than he ever has spent with his own.\n\nTL;DR: I can't tell whether I'm stuck in a childish \"I'm your daughter, please pay attention to me\" mindset or I'm justified in being pissed off because my dad is ignoring me and spending all of his free time with his girlfriend and her children.

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to be with my family on Thanksgiving or holidays",
      "description": "This is about the holidays and life in general. \n\nI've been through a lot with my family this year.  To make it short, my mom is pretty narcissistic and my family are her followers. Lately she's  been using her nice face. I've  limited her visits already because she has made a huge negative impact  on my older kid (4yo) and often makes me question my sanity. This week she has constantly asked \"You're coming to help us cook like we always do,right?\" I told her no. She asked if she can take my oldest then, I said no.. because why have a 4yo over there while they're cooking, they won't be paying attention to her and she really can't help. They put her in front of a TV and let her eat a bunch of junk whenever she wants.  I also said no because every year that I've  \"helped\" is only me doing one thing and now because I have a 6 month old that just got his shots and is clingy so I can't even help much anyway.  She tried to convince me by saying she got this delicious turkey and she's going to make a dish that I love,  she tries to use food to bring us over for some reason,I told her i'm not a dog, i'm not driven by food. She also coincidentally gave me $100 a few days ago, not sure why.  I know she'll try to convince me tomorrow too because my guy works part of the day. \n\nLast year, while we were living with her, I made a big apple pie and like 2 other dishes..none of them ate them. It has been a year since I've  moved out again and i'm determined to stay gone this time. Today she asked if I wanted her to come pick me and the kids up since my guy is at work with the car so I can \"help like we do every year\", I said no because I have food to cook too. But honestly I'm not starting to cook the major parts until my guy gets home to help entertain our baby while I cook or vice versa. \n\nThis year has been full of me having to distance myself from my controlling,helicopter, narcissistic mother and family because she was making my oldest obsessed with her,she kept trying to force me to make decisions that she wanted, and thought me trying to be an adult was \"cute\". But they've  told me before that they \"care\" about me but not as much  and that they try to keep nice with me so they can see the kids. I'm lucky my fiance is honest because my mom has contacted him many times trying to make him convince me to do what she wants but he told them to stop because he doesn't  want to be involved in their stuff and that I'm an adult and we can talk over our own decisions. So i'm a bit..empty towards  them. I still love them. I love my mom but we don't get along much so I stay neutral when I let her visit,i don't say anything about our life anymore to her. It's  like she wants me to be like my sister..who is almost 40,has never lived on her own,has a decent career, no friends except an ex who is using her as a backup while he's with another chick, no kids...a mess of anxiety and medication. They do everything together. I don't want that. I miss how my mom used to be..kinda. But she's  almost 60 and stuck in her ways. I'm 25 and have a life of my own,I want to make my own traditions with our family.\n\nShe thinks us trying to be adults and a family is \"cute\". She calls us all \"shorties\" but my guy is the same height as her. When she saw we had our Christmas tree up she thought it was \"so cute\" and \"Did ya'll have to get a ladder??\" and laughed..damn tree is only 6ft, my dude is 5'9. But when I talk about how we're trying to do things as a family and not go over to her house or not involve them, it's no longer cute.  My family is obsessed with \"FAMILYYYYY IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT FAMILYYYY  WHEN YOUR GUY LEAVES YOU YOU'LL ONLY HAVE FAMILYYYY IF HE STARTS ABUSING YOU LIKE YOUR EX DID YOU'LL  ONLY HAVE FAMILLLYYYYYYY \" by family they mean blood. Friends don't matter to them,  anybody that isn't blood doesn't matter to them.  Which is weird because my oldest is from an abusive ex and my mom can't seem to stop thinking that he'll change one day (he really won't he's beyond help and wants nothing to do with my oldest) but my fiance has taken over being her father and we have a baby together and he's amazing but they keep insisting that he'll leave me. She's still mad that I spent one Thanksgiving with my ex and his grandmother about 6 years ago. So she'll hold another grudge this time most likely.   My own grandmother rarely calls me and she called last night right after I told my mom I wasn't coming to help, I guess so she could try to convince me to go. I feel shitty because they often guilt-trip  with \"we could die any day and you would regret doing &lt;insert whatever they disagree with&gt;\".  After I started limiting her visits she suddenly started asking me if she could get rid of some of my stuff at her house. \n\nSo AITA? Should I feel guilty?  I told her we could visit for an hour or two tomorrow but I guess that isn't enough for her.  \n\n",

      "description": "I (28F) have a number of friends who are on a particular fad diet. They've had great experiences and like to talk about that with our larger friend group, myself included. I have no inclination to try this diet, but I'm happy that my friends are happy.\n\nI am on the thicker side so I've dealt with people making passive aggressive comments about diets my whole life. Enough people have outright told me I need to diet so much that I've developed a sensitivity to any talk of diets, thinking they might be a comment on my weight.\n\nI am healthy and am happy with my weight, but this wasn't always the case. I was diagnosed with EDNOS (catchall term for eating disorders that aren't anorexia/bulimia) when I was younger, and I'm currently working with my therapist to manage my mental health as I take care of myself physically. One of the steps for this has been focusing on overall health over exact weight, and I don't actually know how much I weigh know since I've avoided a scale for so long. I feel better than I did a few years ago, so to me, that's good enough.\n\nHowever, when one of my friends says things like \"I can't eat this, I only have 20 carbs left for the day\" or \"\\[Mutual friend\\] is doing well, she says she lost 3 pounds last week\", I go to a bad mental place. If this comes up while we're eating, I'll immediately stop. I feel sick and feel an overwhelming urge to harm myself to get rid of my excess weight.\n\nWIBTA if I asked my friends to stop talking about this diet around me, especially the parts with numbers? I'm afraid of it seeming like jealousy (and on some level I wonder if I am just jealous) but it's hurting me to hear it.",

Sometimes I acted like an ass and sometimes he has, but in general we make up. He is mentally ill and has BPD and many other mental illnesses. Before college, he relied on me a lot and during senior year, our friendship got strained. I got a boyfriend and he was jealous (he's not into my romantically and he says his jealousy was because of his mental illnesses) and I got into a college out of state and I wouldn't be home a lot. But I thought things went well after awhile and we were better friends to each other by the time I left.\n\nHe logged into my twitter once and left his account info on there. I didn't check it for months since I dont use the app anymore. One time I went on twitter and it was still on his private. I saw some tweets about me that I didn't like, even if it was from long ago. One was a screenshotted pic I uploaded of my bf and how I loved him and was gonna go visit him at school with the caption: \"Is this bitch done?\" I know he does this a lot and says its because of his mental illness, but honestly after being in college, I don't want to take it. I dont know if anything recent was said about me, because I logged off his account. \nI know mental illness is hard and I have dealt with it, too, but I don't think it's an excuse. Should I do something about this? Or would it be better to leave it be?",

The very first task was putting together slides to open the on site client facing workshop. It was agreed the slides would be done by the other person a week prior, and multiple follow up emails ensued. By 7am the morning of the workshop the slides had not yet been sent out. \n\nI “saved the day” but putting together some slides the night before. At breakfast, the other person said when looking to put together the slides they realized there was just not enough information - they might have put together something, but I never saw it and just went with my slides and I presented them. Day saved. \n\nA few workshops &amp; lots of information to capture, the next explicit ask if for this person to put together the report template (a deliverable back to the client). It was discussed on Feb 11th. On Feb 14th, a follow up email - the excuse was “Microsoft Issues” will call tech support. The following week we were all travelling to a conference, more follow ups “yea, let’s find time to sit at the conference and I will show you what I’ve done”, conference over, another two business days and now we are running against a deadline so I started writing the document/report (about 15 pages in of 45) and have every intent on finishing it rendering their efforts at a template now defunct or useless (even if it would be two weeks late) \n\nAm I the asshole for letting the person get away with it?

All of my other roommates looked at me like I was a shitty person, one even ran up to his room while I was pouring my cup of water. \n\nWas that an overreaction?\n*On mobile, sorry for formatting issues.

      "description": "Ok so a bit of backstory is necessary. My dad moved to canada from the UK when he was very young, 3 or 4 years old I think. Almost as soon as they got here his dad just vanished and nobody knew where he was for almost 10 years. One day they just show up out of the blue and surprise, they're a woman now. Cue 1-2 years of marital confusion and they disappear again, for about the same length of time. This pattern repeats itself a few times until just recently, when out of the blue my dad asks if I would like to meet her, since she'd found out about my sister and I somehow. Obviously it's my choice to see her but I really dont want to, not because they're trans, I really dont care about that either way, but mostly because why would I ever want to spend time with someone who's spent decades of her life purposely ignoring their child?",

      "description": "I live in an apartment and I am currently working from home. Normally I cannot hear any of my neighbors at all, I made sure to pick a place to live with walls built well enough not to hear every movement or conversation. \n\nMy next door neighbor (couple) have a dog, dog is probably 1 year old. The dog is a lab, very cute and very friendly, but obviously not well trained. Dog jumps up on you and people, doesn’t heel for owners, and bites at leash, etc. Neighbors just started leaving the dog at home alone all day about a month ago, and the dog howls and barks and carries on for about 3-4 hours every day. I can hear this clear as day in my apartment, so the dog is obviously loud. I can drown it out with music, but that’s not a long term answer. The noise isn’t necessarily loud enough to disrupt my work, and I don’t expect the complex to be dead silent or anything, but this dog makes a ton of noise and for long periods of time. \n\nI told the neighbors a few days after it started, very casually and in passing. I wasn’t mean or rude, I was sympathetic, the dog doesn’t know any better, she’s just lonely and reacting to her situation. But part of being a pet owner is teaching your dog what behavior is and is not acceptable. Neighbors were apologetic and promised to work on it, but it’s been weeks and it hasn’t gotten any better. I mentioned this to them 2 more times and they have been very apologetic, claiming they are trying to take the dog to day care and such, but every day, same shit. \n\nI’ve given them many chances, and I’m really tired of it. I sent an email to the community manager outlining the situation, and he quickly responded. He has warned neighbors and if they continue to have a disruptive dog, it could be a lease violation and them thrown out. They used to be friendly and say hello, but now they clearly are mad at me and give me rude looks when we pass by. I feel bad, but I tried everything. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm 23 and I live at my parent's house for family reasons. My brother (16) started dating this girl six months ago and he found out she's always wanted to play a Nintendo 64 (don't ask me why, I literally have no idea why). I have an N64 and because of this, my brother asked if he could use it with her. I said yes. After his permission was granted, he invited his girlfriend.\n\nSince the N64 is in my room, I gave him a few rules.\n\nI: DO NOT TOUCH MY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS\nII: DO NOT BRING FOOD OR DRINK IN THE ROOM\nIII: DO NOT USE THE BLACK CHAIRS IN THE CORNER OF MY ROOM.\nIV: WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THE N64, UNPLUG THE CONTROLLERS, PUT THEM ON THE SHELF, AND TURN OFF THE N64.\n\nThe next day, I texted him that list and his reply was, \"yeah yeah ok\". I was a bit nervous after this reply. I was nervous that he would not obey the rules, but I just told myself, \"It's okay, he got the text and read it. He's probably just being his direct self\".\n\nWhen his girlfriend arrived at our home, I invited them both into my room and told them the rules. They assured me that everything would be okay. I hoped so. I'd be fucked if my room was trashed because I'm the leader of a band and the band and I would be meeting up today in my room a little bit after my brother's girlfriend left. After they assured me that everything would be okay, I took my trumpet and told them I'd see them later.\n\nA quick fact: We were home alone. Our dad was on a business trip, and our mom was running errands. \n\nAfter I left the room, I went to the basement to practice. I was practicing the music I'd practice with my band. An hour later our mom came home. Turns out, she had gone grocery shopping so my brother and I helped her unload. After that, our mom gave my brother's girlfriend a ride home. When they left, we went to our rooms. I was fucking pissed when I entered my room.\n\nIt was trashed. They broke every single rule. There were crumbs on my floor and on the chairs I told him not to use and the N64 controllers were not on my shelf. In fact, they were disrespectfully left on my desk. The N64 was on and MY FUCKING TUBA WAS ON THE FLOOR LIKE GARBAGE! Furthermore, I think they had sex in my room because I found a used condom in my trash can.\n\nI didn't understand the meaning of this. I couldn't wrap my head around this. Why the fuck would they break all of my rules and have sex in my room? I needed answers. I went to his room.\n\nMe: * knock knock *\nBro: Come in\nMe: * enters * Why did you break all of my rules?\nBro: Sorry, I didn't mean to. Jeez, dude you don't get to come in my room and be an immediate asshole.\nMe: You didn't mean to? You didn't mean to break my rules? You had to have knowingly did that!\nBro: All right fine! I'm sorry, now get out before I call Mom.\nMe: Okay.\n\nSo AITA for being pissed? Was I being an 'immediate asshole'? Oh and I want to tell our parents. WIBTA for doing that? \n\nThanks, Reddit.\n\nP.S. I was able to clean my room in time for my band to come over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I met another girl who was going to my school a few months before we started our program through reddit. We met up a few times and she seemed nice enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, onto what's been going on since we started about 6 weeks ago. From day one, she's been so beyond negative. The second day of class she said to me \"I wish I would have just done the LPN program.\" She failed our first test by 4 points (because she admittedly didn't study) and stated that she was just gonna drop out of the program-to which she has a full ride-if she failed our next test. She wound up passing by a few points and stayed in the program. Now, we have another test coming up Friday and she's back to the same crap. \"I'm dropping out.\" \"I don't like this.\" etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy whole thing is, if you don't like nursing-then drop out!! Just quit bringing me down with you. Nursing school is by no means easy, but it's totally doable. But being constantly surrounded by this negativity is affecting my mood and motivation to study. Honestly, it's been making me kinda depressed. I was so excited to start this \\*highly competitive\\* program, but she's just been bringing me down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I told her to screw off and leave me alone?",

      "description": "My partner and I chose this preschool over the public preschool because it advertises an increase in self esteem which our kid needs (very shy).\n\nThe school was putting on a play and required all the 3-4 year olds to participate in the show. My daughter did not want to be in the play because she didn't want to be on stage. We talked about it with her teachers and she agreed to try it out. The teachers kept telling her that what was important was that she try her best.\n\nWell the play rolls around and the kids walk out on stage and my daughter take one look at the audience and starts crying. Just a couple tears at first but then a full out panic so my partner goes and pulls her off the stage. We sat in the audience and watched the play and she calmed right down.\n\nAfter the show, we tried to take her to the reception for the kids and parents and her teacher told us we have to leave because our daughter didn't make it through the show, so it wasn't fair for her to be at the after party. She told us we had to leave and actually took a cookie out of our daughters hand. It was a big scene so we left and took our daughter to Dairy Queen as a reward for trying it out.\n\nI would understand her being excluded if she had bailed, or thrown a tantrum and refused to get on stage, but she tried something new and I'm shocked that the school would respond in such a way to stage fright. I mean, she's 3 years old. What kind of lesson is that?\n\nI'm thinking we should pull her out and put her in the public preschool. She has friends from other activities in the public school so it's not as if we'd be ripping her away from all the people she knows. I just don't see the point in paying for a preschool that claims to endorse self esteem and then does that to my kid. My partner thinks I'm being rash. AITA?",

      "description": "Hey everyone, I've never used this sub before so apologies if I'm not doing this right!\n\nI have quite a few vinyl records that I don't listen to anymore, so I casually sell them from time to time on a website called Discogs, which is essentially a site where average people can buy and sell records. I sold an album to a guy a month ago, and earlier this week I got a Paypal notification stating that the buyer wished to dispute the claim and receive a refund. Upon viewing the buyer's message, I find out why: the buyer said the record arrived slightly warped (meaning the vinyl itself wasn't perfectly flat, which can lead to playback issues if not handled properly), and so he used a vinyl flattening system. This basically entails putting the vinyl record in the oven at a high heat between two solid objects (usually panes of glass) for a period of time in an attempt to flatten the record. The buyer admitted in his message that this process messed up the vinyl record and made it unplayable.\n\nAm I crazy here, or am I right in not wanting to accept a return? It would be one thing if the buyer messaged me upfront and told me the record was warped - I always make sure to only sell items that are in mint condition, and I package records extremely carefully, but slight warping that happens in transit is not completely unheard of. If he had told me what happened, I would certainly issue a refund in exchange for him returning the item. However, I think it's unfair that he is asking for a refund while wanting to return an item that is in considerably worse condition than when I sent it due to his actions.\n\n**TL;DR: I sold an item to somebody online and it arrived with slight damage from transit. Buyer tried to fix the damage himself but ended up ruining the item, now wants to return it to me in exchange for a refund. I don't think it's fair that I would be getting the item back in considerably worse condition than when I sent it, but he disagrees. /r/AmItheAsshole , Am I The Asshole?**",

      "description": "The club I usually go to to party lets people stay in the VIP area, as long as it isn't fully booked. Once it is, those who have reserved a table get to decide who may or may not enter (will be important). \n\nSo this Friday I was at a party there and we just decided to go into the VIP area since it was free. One of my friends had invited a friend who, again, invited another friend of hers. Later, that friend of a friend of a friend started \"aggressively\" trying to get others to dance with her, rubbing her ass against every crotch in the VIP zone. When she came to me I clearly stated that I won't dance, but eventually she always came back asking, so I got annoyed and told her to fuck off. That still didn't work, and unfortunately for her she came again, getting all close and shit, which kind of flipped my switch. \n\nI went to the bouncer and reserved the free couches for myself. Then I told him that now that they are fully booked, she had no permission to stay and she should get out. When the bouncer told her to go to the normal area, she started getting mad at him (sorry bro), trying to push him away. Eventually he decided to kick her out of the whole club (which I can't say I wasn't happy about). \n\nDid I overdo it?",

She always gets pissy when I come in her room at 11:30-12. We’ll in sorry but I don’t want to lay around in the bed all day.\n\nShe takes forever to wake up and I want to go out and do things. I get that she wakes up early all week but so do I. She barely takes care of my 7 year old brother and frankly isn’t much of a mother to begin with. During the week I do most of the looking after. I do everything she wants specifically so I can go out on weekends.\n\nI already agreed to respect her rule of going out one day and staying home the next. Still, she still gets pissy when I want to go out with my friends. She used to yell at me about not going out and how I had no friends. NOW she gets pissed when I want to go out with friends. \n\nThis isn’t a new thing, I’ve started this about a year ago. If I ask her the night before she gets pissed too. I’m not sure what to do, when I stay home she doesn’t spend time with me anyway. I just sit in my room and don’t talk for a day. So I’m not sure what the big fucking deal is. It’s obvious she doesn’t care to spend time with me.\n\nMy brother doesn’t care when I leave either, sure my step dad might not like it but he’s always pissed at me for something. “Don’t wake me up for this shit.” Okay but you sleep until fucking 3 PM and I want to fucking do stuff. I can already see some of you saying she’s depressed, I’ve told her to seek therapy or something. She’s been like this for years. She refuses, says it’s for weak-minded people. Guess who goes to therapy? Yep me. \n\nMy mom has a past of abusing me, so it’s not like I bust her door open and jump on the bed screaming or anything. I crack the door shoo my brother away and creepy around the front of the bed to whisper at her. She still gets mad. Like I get no one wants to be waken up but you have kids - kids that you refuse to take care of - but kids none the less. I never woke her. Up when I was little out of pure fear of what she’d do.\n\nI’ve finally gotten the courage to do it. All she does is angrily bitch at me and most of the time give me 0 answer to the one question I asked her. \n\nSo AITA for thinking my mom sleeping all day is bullshit?",

I'm good at history and language arts, but not so great at math, and she's the opposite, so we help each other out 3) we're debate partners, so we kind of have to meet up. \n\nTaylor has been insecure of this for a while. A few days ago, she asked me if she could come to one of my meetings with Lydia. We are just meeting up at the library to go over stuff for state, which is this weekend. She's hinted before that she was jealous/suspicious. \n\nSo, to appease her, I said sure. But problem is, Taylor knows nothing about debate. But she tried to include herself in the conversation by asking all the time, 'what's that?' We tried to stop and explain, but after a while it got a little annoying, plus time wasting, to explain every little thing to her. So we brushed her off a little bit so we could focus.\n\nAnd of course, Taylor was mad at me over this, and made a big argument out of this. This argument ended up leading to us 'take a break'. \n\nAll her friends (other than Lydia) have been texting me, telling me I'm an asshole for brushing her off. In my defense, 1) she didn't have to suspicious or jealous of me. JFC, I'm her boyfriend and Lydia's her best friend. I've never done anything to indicate I can't be trusted, and yet she continued not to 2) She was at a debate meeting, before *state*, asking 'what's that' to literally everything, and it was just slowing us down. 3) I did brush her off, but I'm the asshoe for trying to prepare for my tournament and she's not for being suspicious?\n\nSo, aita?",

      "description": "My mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. It's been ok. She and I are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. She is a traditional Hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. I am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.\n\nBefore, out of consideration to my wife and out of a belief in the my \"my house, my rules adage,\" I used to watch what I said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. But when my spouse asked if she could live with us, I said I was okay with it as long as I no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. My spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. I don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.\n\nLast week, my 10-year-old and I were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. We were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. We are very mature, I know. But when I said, \"I fart in your general direction!\" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in Spanish, \"Don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. I will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer.\" And I said, in English (I can understand Spanish but can't speak it well), \"This is my home. You don't get a say in how I interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act.\" She stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.\n\nMy spouse says ITA because I embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because I expected her to accept too much, too quickly. They also say that I am being a little culturally insensitive and that I need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how I spoke to her, so I need to apologize. But I think it was important for her to see that I will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that I won't be policed in my own home. ",

      "description": "So my friend ( I’ll call her j) suffers from bipolar and is hospitalized at least 5 times a year. She and her husband along with their 5 year old son love with her parents. They’re retired so when she ends up in the hospital the brunt of childcare falls to them. They don’t mind it and this isn’t the issue. \n\nThe problem is that her son has a very hard time emotionally when his Mother’’s away.  She was in hospital for 2 months and two days after she was released she told me she was going away for the weekend ( leaving the next day). This is where things got dicey- \nMe- you’ve only just got back from two months  away. I know it’s hard on kid when you’re away, maybe you should stay home this weekend and catch up and spend time together; I know he’d love that\nHer-I need this trip to continue improving my mental health ( she’s going to a casino to see Dane Cook)\nIf you can’t understand that then we’re done being friends. I’m a good Mom and you’re a piece of shit Mom- I have 2 kids.\n\nAfter that last jab she hung up the phone and won’t answer my texts.\n\nSo am ITA for mentioning she would stay home and spend time with her kid?",

      "description": "TLDR: Ex and his new wife are now best buds with my dad who I had a falling out with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy ex husband (31m) and I (28f) finalized our divorce about two years ago. The divorce was pretty messy and now we are trying to co parent our 7 year old daughter best we can. My dad (not bio) never really liked my ex but was cordial at family functions with him. We never lived close enough to consistently see him so in person he and my dad have talked maybe 5 times. My dad has been my rock through everything though. From the rough teenage years to being 19 and expecting my daughter, and then my divorce, he's been my best friend through it all. (Note: Dad suffers from extreme depression and anxiety, it has hurt some relationships but he does his best)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after the divorce I started dating an amazing man. Due to my dad living far away he didn't meet him in the beginning but he \"seemed\" happy that I was finding some happiness. After a few months he kind of started to pull away from me, not answering calls and texts or giving me really short one word answers. Then the man of my dreams proposed a year later and all hell broke lose. I called him and he seemed disgusted. We ended that call on not great terms but I reached out the next day and apologized if I had upset him. He started telling me that I'm a \"user\" and now that I was engaged I was done with him and was tossing him aside like trash. I had no clue what to say and we went weeks without talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I find out yesterday that not only have he and my ex-husband been texting (talking about ME, ex let it slip that dad told him he was disappointed in my choices... wtf????), but my ex's new wife has added my dad on Facebook and messages him as well. When I told my ex this wasn't OK he acted like I was telling him to ditch a best friend. These two men never had ANY type of bond but are now friends. And why the fuck is your wife adding and chit chatting with your EXWIFES FATHER?!?! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pissed! I'm mad at my dad though I am starting to suspect his mental health inst in a good place and could be influencing his decisions. But my ex has no excuse.. I feel like there are certain lines you don't cross and they both did. So, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "r/AmItheAsshole\nI quit my dream job for nothing.\nu/Onikem\nSo im 29(m) married to a 27(f) with a 2 year old daughter. I previously worked in the video game industry but it meant a two hour round trip commute. Being games the pay was less then I could get for the same job elsewhere but we had enough money to live and i loved doing it.\n\nAround my daughter 1st birthday my wife had been complaining about not seeing me and that money was tight. This had been going on for a while so i agreed to look for a job that paid more and was closer to home. I then left my job and got one that paid 10k more with half the commute.\n\nMy wife was a teacher and would have earned more then me, but she went part time after her maternity leave.\n\nAfter getting getting my new job she started to complain the we never saw each other in the evenings because she would always be planning lessons and she was fed up with her job. So after talking it through we agreed to try and find her another job and figured out a wage we could manage her going down to.\n\nA couple of weeks later I got her an interview with my current employer which paid the same as she was on part time but it was a full time position. She quit after a month, because she missed our daughter and wanted to work part time again. She has since got another job but the pay is litterally half what she was earning as a teachere.\n\nThis morning w had a huge argument about how she wants to quit this job and that i need to find a job that pays more money. I told her that she was being selfish and that i had already quit my dream career only for her to undermine it and get worse and worse paid roles. That if she was stressed about money she should shut up telling me to get a better job and find one herself. AmITheAsshole.",

      "description": "So here’s the situation. My GF has been having trouble meeting up with her childhood best friend because, for one reason or another, her friend will either flake on my GF last minute or be busy and not available. The best friend is a very social person and has a lot of friends she needs/wants to see and it seems to me like she still wants to be friends with my GF, but my GF is just further down on the list. This has been irritating my GF because she sees the best friend hanging out with other certain friends multiple times on social media without making time for my GF.\n\nIn response to this my GF and some other of her old childhood friends of hers came up with the idea to host a surprise birthday party for the flakey friend. Already assuming she won’t make it,  they would still have the party with all the decorations in the background of their social media posts to show her that she missed her own surprise party.\n\nThis is the part where I need to know if I messed up. After she mentioned the proposed plan which her friends and mom approved of I just asked her if she thought that maybe the plan was a bit too petty. She seemed to be taken aback by the question and proceeded to explain again how she felt disrespected by her friend for flaking on her constantly and that it would show the friend that they both care about her enough to throw her a surprise party but also won’t put up with her actions. My response was to just say that I wouldn’t personally do that for one of my friends. She then seemed visibly upset for the remainder of the night we hung out and I couldn’t tell if she guilty about it or if she was upset with me. \n\nSo guys AITA? ",

Half of them came in my car and the other half took an Uber because there wasn't enough space. \n\nOne of my friends got super drunk. To clarify, me and him aren't necessarily close friends because we recently met, but we are in the same group. When it was time to leave, he needed to be helped to my car. I asked if he was going to throw up because I was paranoid about it and he said he didn't need to. Everybody else said not to worry because he doesn't throw up. \n\nDuring the car ride, I have to pull over so he can vomit. He sticks his head out of the car but he still gets vomit on my car in that space underneath the door as well as the outside of the car.\n\nThe next morning, my boyfriend told him what happened and he called me and said he's going to clean it. He even said it a couple of times. I met up with everybody in the morning because we were all going to spend the day together so I was with this guy pretty much all day. He was in my car this day too while we were driving places.\n\nFast forward to 11 pm, we're all hanging out and talking and I'm getting annoyed at this point because I feel like he's not going to clean his vomit. I said \"my car still has throw up\" and he gave me this straight face that just seemed mad. \n\nI left it alone after that but I complained to my boyfriend. I don't think I was wrong to bring it up and I still have vomit in my car. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So, here's the story. My brother uses my laptop a lot and basically \" owns\"\" it for most of the time, I'm completely chill with it.    \nSo when I took a nap, my brother used my laptop, as usual, and then proceeded to hide it under a huge pile of pillows so that it's \"safe\" when he went to the pool.  \n  I woke up, then I walked down the stairs to my room and saw a huge pile of pillows.  \n   So I did what anyone would do when they see a pile of pillows and laid down on them. They're comfy after all!   \n As I laid down, I heard a cracking sound, then lifted the pile up to see what it was.    \n   I was horrified when I found out it was my laptop.       \n I opened it up and my heart stopped for a moment. The display was broken.  \n  My brother came back from the pool and was pissed at me too because he can't use my laptop anymore.     He said it was my fault because \"You didn't check first\"            \nMy mum sides with him and said it was my fault.     \n It's my computer after all... And my schoolwork is on it, making it very important.",

      "description": "My (f29) girlfriend (f35) and I have been together 6 months and just moved in together. She is an extremely thoughtful and caring partner and I'm so glad she'll be with me to celebrate my 30th birthday in February. \n\nI don't like to set people up for failure and told her explicitly this was an important birthday and that I wanted a day activity and dinner date. I'm always the one who plans our outings whereas she's more effective at beautifying our house and in general just being thoughtful and wonderful. I gave her the heads up because I just don't want to be disappointed but I could tell there was some hesitation / unsuredness around how to treat my birthday. Fast forward to last night and she's sounding out some ideas to me via text. I can tell she's putting some thought into what our activity will be and this makes me extremely happy. As we're discussing what the day is going to look like she goes on to warn me that \"One more thing, that's the day my brother passed away and I may be sad that day.\" This kinda threw me but I wrote to her I was sorry and that we should do something to remember him by. She then responded \"No that's okay, I post one picture of him every year on insta but I'm usually sad all day\".\n\nNow this is where I ask AITA here for feeling annoyed? The timing is shitty and she's fully entitled to feeling sad on this day but warning me she's going to be in a funk dampens any excitement I had about my birthday. Her brother died 10 years ago and from what I understand she barely saw him growing up due to divorce and long distances. That sounds petty writing out but I know for a fact they weren't close. Still she's a sensitive person and I'm sure her feelings of sadness are genuine. Am I being totally insensitive here? ",

      "title": "AITA for saying I don’t want anything for our anniversary?",
      "description": "My husband and I are currently long distance. A little bit of background on this: we were long distance for 4 years before we got married with plans to move in together. I relocated to where he was living on the other side of the world. 2 months after moving there I got really sick and we were paying $$ out of pocket for doctors in his country ( I didn’t have health insurance there yet). When we realized this was something more than a bug or an infection, I decided to come home to get my health sorted out as I have insurance here.  Husband stayed there as he’s going to school there and didn’t have a visa to come home with me. I’m in the midst of being diagnosed with lupus and since then we’ve been long distance again. \n\nOur anniversary is next week. Unfortunately, this year we won’t be together to celebrate it but after talking about it we agreed (in October when it became clear we wouldn’t be able to be together for it) we will celebrate it the next time we are together (kind of like a rain check?). Right now it seems like that will be around March. \n\nThree or four weeks after this agreement I realize something is up. He’s answering questions vaguely, not messaging me when he’s at certain places, my sister mentions he’s been messaging her(they have planned one surprise together before), I see charges on our bank account, etc. Just little things. \n\nLike a week later we end up getting into an unrelated argument about communication and time. That bleeds over into releasing our frustrations on not being together, especially for our special day. \nOf course these little things are on my mind and I ask him again if we are still in agreement on what we decided on. (I wanted to know so if he wanted to do something on the day of I could have some kind of delivery ready for him to receive). He says yes. I inquire about the questionable things I’ve noticed and he’s vague. \nAt that point I didn’t want to ruin any plans or anything he had done (but I was annoyed from the argument and frustrated that I wouldn’t be seeing him) so I said “ All I’m sayin is that weirdness is usually bc of somethin &amp; I know our day is comin up but we decided we’re going to celebrate it whenever we get together &amp; being apart for it is already hard enough so please just save anything for when we’re together “. \nHe assured me about it and we moved on from there. \n\nI didn’t mean to come off as ungrateful to him or snotty I just want to celebrate the day with him in person whenever we get the chance to. I’m fine with waiting as long as we can be together. I already know I will be an emotional wreck that day as I have a procedure scheduled and am going through it alone without him and will be thinking about him the entire day and wishing I could be with him. I’m just looking for the day to pass at this point, it’s like a major bump in the road that I’ve been thinking about constantly for the past two weeks. I know I will have a breakdown and I’m anxious about how bad it will be. I want to get past it and fast forward to March so we can celebrate the day and be together. \n\nHe didn’t take it the wrong way as he knows I’m going through a lot and how much I miss him but recently I was talking to a friend about it and she asked what our plans were and I explained the agreement and she thought it was stupid of me to say. \n\nA big part of me thinks if we’re both okay with it and nothing is wrong then all is well. And the other part of me is questioning it now because of her comments? Am I the asshole for saying this to him? \n",

      "description": "(My first post let me know if I should fix anything.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a little backstory so you know the circumstances of the situation:\n\nMy parents split up a long time ago, when i was around 12, due to my father cheating on my mom. We lived abroad during that time so me and my mom moved back and dad continued to live abroad. I have had a rocky relationship with him due to us not seeing each other a lot. Besides that the women he cheated with moved in with him within a year or two after my parents split up. Fast forwards a few years, I was just 18 and my parents finally get their official divorce. My dad needs to pay child support to me, we did not want to involve lawyers and tried to come to an agreement together. Since I had a hard time figuring out what I would need I asked my dad multiple times to come with an offer, he never did. My mothers lawyer suggested it might be beneficial if she could represent me, and I agreed to let her do that. When my dad found out he became furious saying how 'I chose my mothers side' , and some other things. This was obviously never my intention and I tried to explain that, but I couldn't get through to him or he didn't understand or i don't know. But after that he distanced himself from me, and eventually broke off our contact.\n\nI still have to update him every three months on my studies until I am 23 (in turn I get my child support). But I also send him birthday and Christmas cards every year, and recently I have send him some texts to update him in between the emails in the hopes that he warms up to me again.\n\nNow yesterday I notified my dad through text that I was selected to go aboard for my studies next semester (I got my first choice Hong Kong and I am very happy). He then asked me if he could call me, which was shocking to me since I haven't spoken to him in almost three years. He told me that he was happy for me, and that he was going to remarry. He would be marring the women he cheated with. He did want to me to be at the wedding but the wedding will be held (in Swiss, where we lives) during the semester I am in Hong Kong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn one hand I am very happy that he wants to reconnect, but I dont know how I feel about the wedding. I do not hate the woman he will be marrying, but I also do not like her. I do not want my old feelings or his choice in women stand in the way of our future relation. Furthermore, I would have to fly in for the weekend and going to Hong Kong is amazing but also financially straining for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, maybe disregarding the financial difficulties, would I be the asshole if I do not attend my dads wedding?",

I asked when it was and he said it was in 3 weeks. I asked what the hell the rush was since most people plan a wedding 6 months to a year out and he didn't really give me a great reason.

      "description": "Some background here about my upbringing as I really want to set the stage.  He and my mom have done as much as they can for the family, both emotionally and financially.  They are quite well off and have corporate jobs, but they spent as much time as they could with me and my two older sisters growing up.  My dad in particular has been incredibly supportive of me and my sisters throughout our entire lives.  He's a very accepting kind of guy and tries his best to be BOTH a friend and dad to us (we come from a 100% south asian background so this is a really big deal for me at least).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember when my sister was extremely conscious of her weight during her high school years, he worked out with her in the gym \"to help boost her confidence\".  During my high school days, he encouraged me to join sports teams and make friends and came to my games (pretty athletic, but have sports performance anxiety).  Always gave me and my sisters advice like \"teenagers don't really have much empathy so be aware of that\", taught us the importance of respect, and \"time is the best medicine\" and what not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn many ways, he didn't ask for much but he really really valued education and self-learning.  We were to read books he gave us outside of our school curriculum and if we weren't in some summer learning camp, he always encouraged us pick some summer project to pursue or learn from.  In any case, my two sisters really took on with this mindset and both went to uni and are doing great.  He's paid/paying off tuition for both of them, and was planning on doing the same with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in my senior year, and to my guilt have been lying to both my parents that I've finished my college apps.  I haven't.  Haven't even done one.  I had no interest in college, and honestly wanted to travel after high school.  Maybe some type of gap year?  But even after that, I was planning on going into woodworking or some other craftsmanship (not the 4 year degree kind my dad's looking for) or maybe nothing, but that shouldn't matter, I'll find a way to support myself and I'm not going to mooch off of my parents' wealth.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn any case, I just told them last week of all of this.  After a big argument (me and my sisters almost never argue with him), he isn't talking to me for the time being.  I can tell he's incredibly disappointed and so is my mom.  When I talked to my sisters about it, they didn't have much to say but did call my decision to not go to college \"stupid\" and \"after everything they've done this is the least I can do\".  My parents are really well educated (dad got a professional degree from Cornell) and my sisters are pretty darn smart too, so I understand.  I love my family and I know this is probably the one thing my dad asked of me, but still, I don't know if he has the right to make me go get a degree.",

      "description": "Soooooo... a timeline first,\n\nI put my deposit down around september (the start of term) for a ski trip due for the middle of December. This ski trip is for the course I’m on at uni and in my last year of uni I thought it would be nice to go, so me and my housemates have booked on. \n\n I remember discussing this with my gf when I put down my deposit, and told her that it would be in the middle of December but was non-specific on the actual dates as I wasn’t 100% sure of them at the time. I’m not sure if she was upset about this at the time as granted I’m not particularly perceptive in general. \n\nSo around two weeks ago it comes up in conversation and I let her know the exact dates leaving and coming back and that my birthday falls on one of the days I’m away. So my gf gets really annoyed at me for this and tells me I should want to spend my birthday with her. I said to her that it’s not about my birthday and I would happily spend time with her for my birthday on another day/weekend. I said that it was more that I really want to go skiing and this trip is the cheapest I can really manage and the only time I can go due to the rigid schedule of placement we have to attend in final year uni (and the fact that it’s a uni trip and I have no control over the dates). I’m not really fussed about my birthday tbh, I never see it as a big deal and don’t like a fuss being made over me, though I understand my gf isn’t like this. She stays angry at me through the next few days, saying it’s not because I’m away on my birthday, but she’s upset because I didn’t check with her before I booked the trip (she did know about it but not the exact dates until 2 weeks ago.)\n\nAnd now over the weekend I’ve paid the final balance and let her know, then she became really angry with me again. She says it is a lack of communication on my part (which is fine I accept I’m not always amazing at that), and she also says that I should check with her in future before things like this. I personally get the impression she is just unhappy that I’m going full-stop but she says this isn’t the case. \n\nAnd now she says she’ll be unhappy about this until I’m back home after the trip (in a month and a halfs time). So I feel horrendously guilty now for booking the trip, and it being on my birthday. In my opinion I’ve not don’t much wrong, I’ve booked on a trip I really wanted to go on in my last year of uni and just so happens it’s on my birthday My gf is really mad at me. I could understand if I was missing her birthday but it’s mine and I’m not bothered about my bday. \n\nI Dont want to feel guilty for doing something for me. Judge me please internet people, I’m happy to be told I’m wrong",

      "description": "Background:\nSo I’m in theatre class and our class (Theatre 1) is putting on a cut of Antigone. Half of the kids are acting and half are teching for the show. I’m usually an actor but I wanted to try something new so I did tech. \n\nOur class is really small (14 kids) so I’m in a group of 3 kids and we’re doing set, costumes and hair. \n\nWe finished the set easy no problems we all agreed on what we wanted to do.\n\nThen we started on costumes, nobody was mentioning any ideas so I suggested toga type things. Because it’s greece. They agreed and we set to work on figuring out the specifics for each character.\n\nOk now onto the issue(s):\n\nLater we were thinking about hair, and one of the girls- let’s call her Ally- said we should do braids . I disagree and say that braids aren’t really accurate, I show them some pictures I found when I was researching (mostly updos or hair completely down and curled). Ally says no, she says that it doesn’t have to be accurate, and we can put our own spin on it. I disagree and push her a little more. She won’t budge.\n\nNow looking back I can see that I was too stubborn, it doesn’t really matter if we do braids or updos. And updos would be a lot harder.\n\nI come into class the next day and I tell myself I won’t be annoying about the hair thing, and I’m not I don’t mention it and I go with her ideas.\n\nThen we are coming up with a list of supplies we need for the costumes. When we designed the costumes we decided Creon (king guy) would have a cape/ cloak thing that Greek guys wore. So I ask Ally what we should use for that, maybe a towel or rectangle of fabric.\n\nShe thinks about it for a second and says “why don’t we just use a purple jacket, ya know like how some people wear jackets to look cool?”\n\nI say “I don’t think that’s a good Idea I mean it’s not at all with the times” \n\nShe replies “(my name)! We can add our own take on the costumes I don’t think you get that!”\n\nThen it ends I’m stubborn but I don’t like confrontation so I don’t say anything else. Also the actor kids were doing a run of the show and I didn’t want to distract them. \n\nSo AITA? Lemme clear up a few things I would have been fine doing modernized costumes if she had mentioned it earlier but she didn’t. We all agreed on chitons and toga type things. Also it would be hecka weird if everyone was wearing clothes from Ancient Greece except this one dude with a modern purple jacket! The third member of our group agrees with everything Ally says.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So my friend John and I were in his back yard messing around with a air soft pistol. His dog was also with us but we made sure to watch out for him. We were having fun shooting some handmade targets when he started talking about my girlfriend.\n\nSo for context, John has been upset at me for not\nhanging out with him as much as I used to. I think this is ridiculous because my girlfriend and I don’t even hang out at the same time that John and I usually do. Despite this John decides to constantly talk shit about my girlfriend.\n\nAfter he missed a shot, he said something along the lines of “I’m gonna pretend the targets are your girlfriend, it might help me shoot better”\n\nThis makes me furious. The way he said it seemed so sinister and out of blue. I ripped the gun out of his hand and yelled at him. He acted like it was a funny joke and says I’m overreacting. I tell him to stop making jokes about my girlfriend while threatening to shoot.\n\nHe then says something along the lines of “ok I’ll stop. She’s already ugly enough without bullet holes”\n\nThis pisses me off and I jerk the gun forward towards his dog. Somehow when I jerked forward my finger got pushed back and the trigger went off. I accidentally shot the dog. His dog yelped and started whimpering.\n\nJohn got pissed. He told me to leave and not to come back. I tried to explain that I didn’t actually mean to shoot the dog and was just trying to make him stop but he wasn’t having any of it. \n\nSo AITA? It seems to me that John’s at fault here. I didn’t mean to shoot his dog but he definitely deserved it. I feel like he is overreacting but I’m not sure.",

      "description": "So about a year (maybe even two years) ago I was casually seeing this guy when out of nowhere he asks if anyone would want to take his three exotic lizards in hopes that when he moved out of his parents house he would get them back. Well I asked around and my four friends that lived together said they would take/watch them so him and I packed them up and brought them over. I had my dog with me though so while we went to his house, came back and set up the four foot tanks they eaxh had, my pup was locked in the bathroom so we wouldn't trip on her. While she was in the bathroom she managed to tare a pretty big chunk (about 6 inch by 4 inch) of their lanolioum floor up right in front (behind) of the door. My friends demanded I pay for it and I obviously agreed but I would be hiring a person and paying them because I don't trust them to actually use my money for its intended purposes. WEEEELLLL we agreed to wait until summer to get it done and during the period that we were waiting they told me they needed to get rid of the lizards and asked if I wanted them and I was all like fuck yea give me five days cuz that's my next day off and I'll gladly come pick them up.  The five days pass (It's now the Thursday I'm supposed to come get them), I get there aaand??? \n\n\"Oh we sold the one lizard yesterday but you can still have the other two\"\nLike dude you sold my bfs lizards!? I was PISSED!! They said they would watch them and then when I said I'd take them they sell one!? So I was thinking about it and just kinda said fuck that, they can use the money they got for MY lizard to fix their fucking floor because you bet your sweet ass I didn't see a dime for the 400 dollar lizard or the like 300 dollar tank he came with and it all went towards weed. Honestly though I do feel kinda bad cuz I've been ghosting them since. So Reddit, AITA for thinking I shouldn't have to pay for their floors anymore? Should I just fork over the money?",

      "description": "Really really really don’t want this to become a political beat down in the comments, so please just try to view this in an objective context. Also very long because I’m wordy &amp; can never get right to the point, &amp; formatting bc I’m on mobile. \n\nLittle background (actually a lot of background IM SORRY): I am mixed black &amp; white &amp; very proud of my ethnic background &amp; take pride in being black. My boyfriend is white. Neon white. White as hell. Love him to death but when I first met him in his big ass lifted 6.0 Ford I was like...what did I just get myself into. Despite his very stereotypical white guy tendencies, he is usually very open minded &amp; has grown outside of his pretty sheltered white upbringing since we met. \n\nMy bf &amp; I have been dating for a little over a year, but we were very close friends for 3 years before that. I’ve known his friend group since meeting him &amp; they are all, at their core, kind people. They’re all white as well &amp; grew up in the suburbs surrounding the metropolitan city I was raised in, &amp; thus were surrounded by mostly only white people their whole life with not many ethnic minorities around. They’re the rowdy, bud light, camo &amp; hi-vis, American flags &amp; shotguns type white boys. My boyfriend is arguably the least “stereotypical white guy” out of the group &amp; is *generally* very open to talking about race issues with me &amp; very understanding of how I feel about the treatment of minorities in our country (LGBTQ people, muslim people, Immigrants, etc) &amp; agrees with me on almost everything. I’m of the mind that everyone should be treated with basic respect &amp; that people should be aware of the status quo of white people historically dictating the conversation around minorities, &amp; how thats still relevant today. His friends however...\n\nSince the day I met the boys, it was brought up that I’m black. I don’t mind this at all. I am mulatto, thus I am black. It’s a fact. Don’t mind discussing it at all &amp; I loved educating the boys with their questions about my hair or black people getting sunburns. Because they were ignorant &amp; didn’t know enough ethnic minorities to really know any of that stuff. \n\nFrom the moment I met them they were instantly aware of how much they said the n word. They’d look at me borderline horrified &amp; say sorry &amp; ask if it was okay, &amp; I joked that I’d give them n word passes depending on the context (if we were all being ridiculous &amp; screaming the lyrics to a song, they could say it for example). I can be pretty relaxed about jokes about race depending on the context (when the guys tease me or make fun of me for something I’ll jokingly cry “it’s cause I’m black!!!” which is met with resounding laughter). \n\nBut I also said that I’d appreciate it if they didn’t use the word for the most part. This also extended into the ridiculous racist parody songs one specific friend would play (parodies of well known pop songs remixed with racist lyrics) that he thought were hilarious. Also extended into them seeing gay men on tv &amp; asking “ew what IS that thing?!” (To which I would respond that that “thing” is just a gay man &amp; they would respond “no no that’s not a man, that’s a thing. I wouldn’t even know what to do if something like that walked into the room.”). Also into them calling middle eastern people “sand niggers”.\n\nI’m aware that I will probably never *really* get to them or make them care enough to not act like that in their day to day life, but I asked that they try to keep it to a minimum around me out of respect. I see them once or twice a week for a few hours at a time &amp; all I asked was that they held it back during those times. They’re otherwise cool guys who I honestly would not ever be friends with if it weren’t for my boyfriend because we just don’t have similar interests. I was raised in the city, they’re very outdoorsy, ATV &amp; big trucks kind of guys (I love that stuff but not nearly as much as them). But we all get along well otherwise &amp; I’ve generally prided myself on giving them the freedom to otherwise be reckless, rowdy guys in their early 20’s. I also want to say that the guys have never said anything racist about *me*, at least not to my face. I’ve never felt like they treat me poorly or differently due to my race. But they just seem to just think that because they’re not saying anything bad about me specifically that it should be okay with me. \n\nAfter 4 years of this, I’m tired. I’m tired of it. They tried for a while but when it became hard for them to remember to not be racist or homophobic around me, they stopped caring. I have never been someone to be quiet when I see or hear fucked up shit, so every time they do it or say something along those lines, I tell them to stop &amp; why it’s not right &amp; why it bothers me, which turns into the “nigger is just a word, why can black people say it but I can’t” argument or something. When I’m too tired to argue &amp; I know my requests will fall on deaf ears, I often just go silent &amp; don’t engage with the conversation because it’s just not worth the effort, because they’ve made it clear, as time has gone on, that they don’t care. I never get irate with them or yell, I just keep to myself if that’s how the conversation is going to be, because I want no part of it. My boyfriend will sometimes tell them “ok guys relax that’s messed up” but has never actually put his foot down about it or said he won’t tolerate it because he doesn’t want to alienate them (note that he’s also the ring leader of the group for the most part). \n\nIve been deemed the asshole girlfriend now because I refuse to tolerate it anymore. It puts me in a shit mood for the night &amp; I just sit there quietly (to be fair it’s usually pretty clear that I’m annoyed) when it goes on for too long (I do have a threshold under which it won’t affect my mood because I’ve accepted that they’re like this to a degree &amp; I can’t change that) &amp; then I’m told that I’m ruining the night. As I’m told by my boyfriend, I need to “stop trying to protect everyone (minority groups) because it doesn’t affect me” , i.e when they make gay jokes or Muslim jokes, it shouldn’t bother me because I’m not gay or Muslim. Which is true, but I’d consider myself an ally to those groups bc I think they deserve respect &amp; deserve to exist in the world without judgement. He basically thinks I should be a bystander to bigotry &amp; I just can’t. I can’t do that. &amp; it makes me question how much of an ally he really is if he thinks I shouldn’t care because it doesn’t affect me, &amp; that he won’t demand that his friends do one simple thing in not making those jokes around his mixed (black) girlfriend. He’s not black, should racism against me not bother him because it’s not him? If we have children will he try to protect our mixed-black children from racism? It’s really made me question that he’s not actually racist, or at least doesn’t really actually care. \n\nAnother thing to note is another reason my boyfriend thinks I’m an asshole girlfriend is because I don’t engage with them constantly when we all hang out, which is because the conversation usually centers around mechanical jargon &amp; landscaping &amp; new sports cars &amp; tire treads &amp; shit like that. I enjoy that stuff but I definitely do not have enough knowledge about it to engage in a detailed conversation about it, beyond saying “wow they threw 38’s on that Jeep? &amp; a lift? That thing is huge.” I know enough to get by, but after a minute or two they’re too deep into technical shit that I don’t understand so I can’t keep up. My boyfriend takes this as me not making an effort to “integrate” into the group. Which could not be further from the truth. I have gone on more off-roading trips &amp; been bounced around in more modified jeeps &amp; almost died in modified supercars than I ever thought I would, &amp; I do it for him because he loves that stuff &amp; that’s the lifestyle he lives. &amp; his friends will small talk &amp; joke around with me, &amp; its never awkward when we do, but we don’t have meaningful connection making conversations because they don’t really have any interests similar to me, other than the things I’ve become mildly interested in because of them (trucks &amp; shit). I don’t feel like I’ve integrated into the group fully bc we lack commonalities &amp; they continue to alienate me by not respecting (what I consider to be) a pretty simple request to not be bigots when I’m around. But as far as they &amp; my boyfriend are concerned, I’ve alienated myself.\n\n\n&amp; so now my question is...AITA for calling them out all the time, even though it upsets them to be called out? Am I too sensitive &amp; overbearing with my opinion? Is it ridiculous for me to expect them to not say those things around me? ",

      "description": "Its like 2 am and my friend snaps me saying shes gonna marry my boyfriend and have 5 kids with him. When I asked what she was talking about, she said her and my other best friend were playing that MASH game and that my boyfriend was on their lists. Normally I wouldn't be that bothered by it but my boyfriend and I have been having some slight troubles lately, troubles that they knew about, and I really just felt annoyed and told her she didn't really need to tell me that,  especially at 2 in the morning.  I fully admit I have jealousy issues. However, she told me to chill and not get \"heated\" that she said she was going to 'marry your mans and have 5 kids with him'. I asked her if she wouldn't mind not putting him in their game, as there are plenty of other guys they could use, since it makes me slightly uncomfortable and her response was once again that I needed to chill. \n\nAITA for asking her not to put him in her MASH game?",

He’s struggling financially right now and looking for a new job, so I really wasn’t expecting much. Something small and thoughtful would have been fine. \n\nBut his present was promising to buy me tickets to a game with our local team that I’m a huge fan of. It would have been a wonderful gift but way more than I wanted him to spend his money on. But he didn’t. He just said he would buy them for me in the future when I picked a game. I don’t see him being able to afford it for at least a few months if that. \n\nThe thing that upset me is that he *could* have had the money to get me something if he had stopped smoking weed for a few weeks. But he spent all his extra income on that instead. He could tell I was disappointed with his gift, so I admitted all this. \n\nHe thinks I expected too much while knowing his financial situation and that the tickets are an awesome gift. I pointed out that he didn’t actually get me tickets and probably wouldn’t be able to anytime soon. He believes he will. Now we’re fighting. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Backstory: I use this did mostly to get some perspective of what battles I should fight and to not over step since I'm a bit of a pushover trying to grow a spine.\nStory: so my mom started spring cleaning just before finals at my college meaning she wants me home most of the time and any spare second seems to be spent cleaning. I decided since this kept pulling me away from my studies id take the bus up to the college and study up there. My mom believes that this is an ass hole move on 3 points (I'll try to keep my interpretations of her argument as objective as possible) 1. \"I paied for that bus card so you shouldn't be spending it to get away from me\" (note I got my bus card with some extra money from a grant but she did buy the one for last quarter but when I explained this to her she scoffed at me a bit) 2. It's my home I'm not paying rent there for I should be cleaning. 3. That I should be more worried about my family then school. With that I'll try to sum up my side as much as I can I cleaned 3 rooms yesterday and sprayed down a bees nest yesterday despite being deathly allergic to these striped nightmares. I also am trying not to lose my scholarships to a bad gpa and bordering failing my math class. (I have 2 learning disabilities that make school pretty stuff but I want to be a lawyer so keeping good grades it key for me and something I can't easily do). I also have made it vary clear I don't mind cleaning the entire house once finals are over (on friday). I hope I kept this objective enuf and if you agree with me please give me some advice on dealing with this. \n\n\nTLDR: I can't study for finals at home so I went to my school to study and my mom's upset that I did this while she's starting spring cleaning.",

      "description": "So,  before getting into everything,  there are just a few things that I need to note about my job/situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.**   Currently,  I work in the building I live in  -  I'm the person you call if you're locked out of the building at three in the morning or evacuating the building if there's a fire. My usual hours are from 5 PM - 9 AM during the week and I don't have to be awake for all of them.\n\n**2.**   I work with three other girls  (four if you count the building manager but she isn't here during nights and weekends) and for the sake of this story, I'll refer to them as Emily,  Julie,  Clarie and Sarah (Sarah being the manager).  It should also be noted that these girls are all younger than me by about 3 - 4 years,  most of them not being older than 20 years old.\n\n**3.**   Aside from the building manager,  we're all in university (I myself am in the third year but to add onto this,  I'm an international student)\n\n4**.**   We get our work times a month in advance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo,  I'm not sure where to even start with this story.  I feel as though this has slowly been building up for months and I'm just at a point now where I'm frustrated as all hell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo,  I want to preface things by saying that I really appreciate my job  -  before this year I tried working in a bar to make money (I had worked in bars before) but it was hellish, both the hours and people. This job allows me a lot more flexibility than most other jobs and I can work on my studies while I'm in the office or on shift.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow,  take this how you will but,  my work ethic has always been along the lines of  -  unless I'm throwing up or can't move,  I can still go into work.  I'm also the type of person who'll cover another co-worker if they ask (honestly,  I just need the money,  there's no honorable reason for it lol)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the seven months that I've had this job,  I've come to realize that I'm covering the other girls for the stupidest of reasons.  Perhaps I'm the idiot for not asking why I'm covering when they ask but when I find out later why I've covered. I'm pretty fucking annoyed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere have been a few times where Julie asks me to take her night shifts,  only for me to find out the next morning (when she's late for her own day shift) that she was out partying/clubbing/drinking. There have been a few times where Clarie asks me to cover her because she's going into the city or she's going to see a concert and then Sarah.  There have been a fair few times where Sarah has asked me to cover the office (on days she knows I have classes) because she's 'sick'  -  to put it simply,  that's either a hangover or,  a petty little cough that anyone can work through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically,  I cover for these girls a lot  -  I myself work around the times I'm given,  I'm told whatever days I need off in advance.  For heck sake, I'm even working the Christmas period because they guilted me into doing it,  even though my mum is flying up and I haven't seen her in a year! That ... that's another issue itself though honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this week,  on Monday I start having pain in the side of my stomach  -  it isn't cramping,  it's something more isolated and it's to a point where no matter what position I'm in.  I'm in pain.  I'm still fine to work my night shifts however since it isn't too much moving and I can stay in my room.  I figure I've just eaten something bad and it'll get better in a few days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWednesday comes around and I get a text from Claire asking me to cover the office on Friday (we originally agreed to split the shift) she says she has classes and meetings until 4 PM and to this.  I say that I'll do the shift and it's fine. That night, however, my stomach pain took a turn for the worse,  I was pretty much in bed crying because it was a constant pain and the following morning,  I text the other girls in the group chat if someone can cover me,  even if it's only half the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJulie doesn't bother replying and Emily says she can't because she has class  -  I know this is bullshit because she's worked Friday's in the office before / we've had half days because she has class in the afternoon.  I've explained that I'm sick,  I'm in a world of pain and at this point,  I've also got a migraine  (another thing I need to talk to the doctors about)  I get no response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that night,  I head downstairs because I have to collect the building keys  -  I'm on shift for the third night in a row. Sarah is in the office and she kinda makes this comment after I tell her I'm in a lot of pain  'You know you can ring up tomorrow and get an emergency doctor appointment and  ...  oh wait you're working.  Well, don't forget tomorrow you need to do \\_\\_\\_\\_'  she starts listing off a few things I need to do in the office   -   which to be honest should be her job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told a friend what has been happening and (he knows the situation better than what I've written) he's basically said to me 'You need to stop covering for these girls since they've basically fucked you over.'   and honestly,  I'm considering it.  Not to mention there have been a few times where I've taken their shifts and they kinda laugh and make comments of  'oh it's not like you have a life.'   to make things better,  on the days I can't cover (being when I have classes)  I get guilted heavily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo,  WIBTA if I stopped covering for these girls when they asked?",

      "description": "To set the context: I am an Indian American (first generation American) and my boyfriend is an American. My parents immigrated to the U.S. in the 80’s and we visit them often. \n\nWe spent the night at my parents’ house last night. My boyfriend said that he was cold and wished he had sweatpants. I told him that I could check if my dad had any extras. He told me, “No, it’s ok”. My mom called me into her room to ask me something. While I was there, I decided to check my dad’s closet to see if he had any sweatpants for my boyfriend. He had a pair that had never been worn, still had the tags on. I thought it would be nice to offer these to my boyfriend, considering they were brand new and my dad said it would be ok to let him borrow them. When I offered them to my boyfriend, he got angry and said,  “you didn’t listen to me when I declined them the first time. You blatantly ignored me and I consider that rude”. I just thought it would be nice to offer them, I had no intention of forcing him to wear them. \n\nI wonder if this is a culture clash. My family constantly offers things to people out of kindness, even if they don’t ask for things sometimes. I can understand that it can be annoying if someone is being pushy about offering something. We’re not talking right now. I wish he would have approached the topic in a non-argumentative way, but I’m not sure if I was in the wrong because of what I’m accustomed to. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "There has been no confrontation about this with my family yet (other than from my oldest sister) but it has been weighing on my conscious for a bit so I want to know what you guys think. (TL;DR at bottom)\n\nToday my mom had almost my whole immediate family over, except for my youngest (still a lot older than me) sister who lives about 40 miles away from us, and me. Everyone was pushing for me to come over. My mother prepared dinner for everyone and it looked like an admittedly great time. I however, just didn’t want to come over. I have been having a hard time recently with some kind of depression and I have just been preferring my free time to sulk to myself than to being with family. \n\nThe above paragraph is pretty much the long and short of it. I’m going to go a bunch into the history of other reasons I’d rather be alone than spend time with family, and it may have many instances of poor grammar and run on sentences so I apologize.\n\nWhen I was about 6 years old (2008) my mother and father got a divorce. I guess there is nothing spectacular about that except for the fact that my father fought arm and tooth to get 50% custody of me, and to keep the house we were living in since he made double to triple what my mother made.\n\nThe fact that my father kept the house meant that I preferred to stay at my fathers house. Not because I dislike spending time with my mother, but mainly because I grew up at my dads house and knew the kids my age around there, and because the only friends I’d had near my mothers house were a pair of kids that I can only describe as unfortunately white trash. Whilst at my mothers house, I had just kind of learned to take joy in my days going as such: 1. Do whatever homework I had. 2. Go play Wii or something until dinner time and then read a book.(I was really watching anime on my I-Pod but we don’t talk about that). I had no real friends, I was (and still am) not the kind to like playing sports, and I certainly did not want to help my mother in the garden, although I begrudgingly did most summers since it was my only source of allowance.\n\nAfter my father got me a P.C. In 2012 I couldn’t wait to go to my dad’s house since I could play Minecraft, and I could talk to friends on Skype. This was great and my lack of real life friends really gave me a home on my P.C.\n\nThe years went by and now I spend most of my time at my fathers by a huge margin. My father is gone on business most of the time, and the alone time makes this house great. Back when it was just my step dad and Mom at my moms house I was able to get a lot of alone time as well. But here is where I really feel like there is a possibility that I could be the asshole here. 2 years ago my grandmother moved into my moms house, and last summer my sister and her two children moved back into my moms house. \n\nThis has caused my moms house to be overpopulated, and for it to be really noisy. My sister and mother have a very toxic relationship and it often devolved into yelling. My sister is also a huge pothead and my grandmother isn’t a fan of that. My sister has been using the fact that my grandmother doesn’t support weed as something to hold over her head a lot. It has gotten to the point where my grandmother had to move back out (which she doesn’t have the money to do) and my sister is now threatening to leave my moms house because my mom “doesn’t love her”. \n\nHere is the catch, my grandmother doesn’t like week because she knows people from the 60’s who have been seriously depressed as a result of how much they’ve smoked, not because of anything else. She doesn’t want my sister to stop just because she is old and “not with the times”, but because she cares about my sister. Not to mention my mom “not loving” my sister. My mother has let my sister back into her house multiple times despite my sister using my mom as a free baby care service and not having a job. My sister has multiple arrest warrants in Nevada and she damn near abused my nieces because of the way she treats them. \n\nThis has all lead me to just prefer me spending time with me, my music, and my computer. Because of my love for music I no longer want silence, I need my music. I have formed and emotional dependency on it and it is hard for me to go a long time without it. My moms house is *not* the place for that. With two toddlers and a sister that won’t stop having temper tantrums, I just want to be alone. Given I guess it might be assholish that I spend the time that I do with my dad, but even that is just because we share a need for constant music and we also share musical tastes. \n\nOn top of that I seem to see this concept of people peeing their family their time and I just don’t know. For all I can gather this is really ranty and I’m truly sorry if you think reading this was a waste of your time. Anyway, have a good day.\n\n(TL;DR) My family has been trying to get me to do things with them but I just don’t want to as it stands. It’s not that I dislike spending time with them I just am not in the mood to leave my room recently.",

      "description": "Alright so quick story here - I’m French-Canadian, my boyfriend is Ethopian. Most of my family doesn’t really give two shits about his race, so they don’t comment about it at all. When I say most, I mean my jackass, “I’m not racist but....” aunt is the only one who gives me shit for dating him. In the past she jokingly said I should “stuff cotton down there” as a means of birth control because “he’s black and wouldn’t want to pick that shit to get there”. My family barely tolerates her, my uncle and cousins seem humiliated whenever she opens her mouth.\n\nANYWAYS, family New Year’s party. Everyone’s having fun, I brought my boyfriend along because, well, he gets along very well with my cousins and dad. Then my bitchy aunt pulled me aside and told me “How dare you bring that monkey into your grandmother’s house? I hope you never bring any of your ovaltine-looking children to ANY of our parties when he inevitably leaves you and you gain thirty pounds.”\n\nNeedless to say, the appletini I was drinking ended up right in her face and I left with my boyfriend right away and got drunk at his sister’s house instead. Two days later my mother texted me asking what the hell was I thinking, causing drama at the family party? She demanded an apology to my aunt for my “drama queen behavior” despite the fact that I explained what happened to my mom right before i left the party. Am I really the asshole here?\n\nTl;dr - Racist aunt makes gross comments about me dating my boyfriend, she gets my drink in her face. Mom is PISSED.",

When I ask for help he seems like he is doing me a favor even after he is done working. He told me the other night that he feels like he doesn’t get a break and basically said it’s my job to care for the baby at all times Bc he works. \n\nHe has gotten better about helping mostly Bc I just ask him to do more stuff now and he knows I’m mad and he doesn’t like conflict. But people, he games 4 hours a night with no complaint from me Bc yes he does work and that is a good break. \n\nHe doesn’t understand that I am touched out. Our daughter needed constant contact Bc of reflux. I literally slept on the couch sitting straight up with her for at least 6 weeks Bc of it.  She is slowly getting better but I’m literally with her 24/7.  She still sleeps with me. He rarely takes her for more than 10-20 mins. The longest is an hour ish Bc I took a bath a handful of times. He has started laying with her while she sleeps in the evening. He actually said “ok I’m done” after about 10 mins once. \n\nSometimes he forgets I need to shower when I’ve waited for him to stop gaming then gets a little irritable Bc he wants to go to bed. I also take the baby with me to drop my oldest off at school Bc he gets cranky about not getting enough sleep. He snapped at me like I was a dog Bc I wasn’t going fast enough to get socks to leave. When I said he could take my daughter to school then, he said he wouldn’t and he guesses she gets to stay home that day. I ended up taking her. \n\nNow he is telling his brother, whom he games with and works with, that he got in trouble for gaming so he has to take a break. So he has totally missed what I was upset about. I still don’t care if he games. I just want a break more often and an actual parenting partner. \n\nDuring these short breaks I’m usually cleaning. He does cook and will wash the pans when he needs them. My oldest fills the dishwasher. He will sometimes wipe cabinets off. He washes clothes when he is out and does most of the dog care. \n\nToday he is saying he wants to get up earlier and  basically be more of a partner. But I need to know if I’m just being an asshole and he’s right. \n\n So AITA for needing a break from the baby even though I stay at home and my husband works? \n\n",

      "description": "My neighbor has a black Labrador retriever that is very overweight (113) lbs. The reason she’s this overweight is because my neighbor went through a family tragedy and just began to over feed the dog human food and never took her out for walks. She eventually realized what she was doing was wrong and put her on a strict diet. While she is on a diet my neighbor has trouble helping her lose weight because she doesn’t have the energy to go on the extensive walks the dog needs to lose weight. \n\nI’m the only teenager in my neighborhood. Everyone else is either an adult who works full time or a young child. Because of this all of our neighbors decided it would be best if I helped the dog lose weight because I only work on the weekends and I have a lot of free time. I was opposed to the idea but my parents forced me to help out our neighbor. Walking this dog is very annoying and hard. It takes a lot of effort just helping her get in my car. When we go on walks the dog can’t go more than a few minutes without stopping to take a break ( I carry a dog bowl and some water in my book bag and she spends about 2 minutes resting) For her exercise were supposed to walk part of a dog park trail and I have to take a picture of me and the dog to prove we actually made it to her distance goal. This should only take us about 20-30 minutes but since she’s so fat it takes us 1hr -1hr 15 minutes. I can’t spend time with my friends and I am not being compensated. \n\nI was recently relieved from my duty because my neighbor’s granddaughter and her mom would be staying with her so she would walk the dog. I took her granddaughter to the park and showed her where she would be walking and how far. During this time she was walking the dog. Whenever the dog wanted to rest she would force it to keep going and she would berate it by calling it fatass instead of its name. The dog was whimpering and I could tell it was getting exhausted. I told her that she needed to let it rest but she said the dog needed to work hard at losing weight. I told my mom how she was treating the dog and she said she’ll talk to our neighbor but if this continues I should offer to walk the dog again. I told her that it’s her responsibility to get her granddaughter in check and that I would not be walking that dog again. She said I should go with her granddaughter to check if she’s treating the dog right but I don’t want to that either \n",

      "description": "As the title states, I stopped mid-sex due to something my girlfriend said. Without going into a heap of information I’ll give you guys a little context. We’ve been arguing recently, and the main basis of that is that my girlfriend has a few selfish and entitled tendencies, we’re both women and have been together for eight years now.\n\nA small example of this is when I was working in the office the other day and ended up having to counsel a very good friend of mine through a life crisis that was urgent for about an hour and as a result I didn’t get any work done. Partner enters just after I get off the phone and expresses her annoyance that I’d put time into my friend instead of her, and now was going to have to spend extra time making up for it finishing my work. This is a rarity that I bring work home, I spend a *lot* of time with my partner, it was just a situation that came up. Quite obviously this is bullshit and I told her so. But this is the type of low level crap that I’m having to deal with recently. My friend genuinely needed me, it wasn’t trivial.\n\nSo anyway, back to the asshole moment. We’re enjoying a bit of time together (last night) and I’m in the act of giving her oral, I’d been doing it for about fifteen minutes at this point and moved onto kissing her in other places before communicating that I wanted her to change position so I could do something a little different to her. No hurry to orgasm, I just wanted to shake it up a little. Her response?\n\n“Well I was happy with you just playing with me to be honest”\n\nNow this in itself isn’t an issue, and usually I’d be like “no probs” and go to town down there. But it was the tone. The tone was the same one she used in the office, slightly petulant, a little whiny and entitled. I stopped what I was doing and told her I’d lost the horn, which I had. I was also very annoyed and couldn’t quite put my finger on it at the time (no pun intended). \n\nSo now I’m the person who gave her partner blue balls because she had the audacity to tell me she was enjoying something I was doing and wanted it to continue, but with a tone that would make you want to send her to her room because she sounded like a bratty kid.\n\nAMITA?",

      "description": "My parents own a 3br 2bath home with an unfinished basement. When my siblings and I moved out/got married my parents changed the remaining 2 bedrooms into a children’s nursery/playroom, and a guest bedroom. My brother is single, and owns a house 5 minutes away from my parents so he has no need for the guest bedroom. My sister, her husband and their two kids live 2 hours drive away. My fiancé and our LO (23 months) 2 hours away as well in the same city as sister and BIL. \n\nFor the past 5 years, my sister has assumed at all times that the guest bedrooms are hers to use. She doesn’t ask our parents, she will simply call before the holiday/birthday/event and announce how long they’re staying (anywhere from 48 hours to a week and a half). This has been a point of contention with my parents as my sister expects entertainment for the kids, all meals, and often will plan for our parents to babysit her children on zero notice. My parents have been vocal with me about me, but less so with my sister. \n\nUntil last year, this wasn’t a huge issue as FH and I were living within 30 minutes driving distance or less from my parent’s home. A year ago, we moved away. This is now the second Thanksgiving that we’re needing to travel with LO. I called my parents weeks ago, letting them know that we were planning on coming to celebrate Thanksgiving with them, but would be staying in a nearby hotel. My parents were not fond of the idea and insisted we should stay with them, but said I should also talk to my sister.\n\nSo, I texted sister to let her know what our original plans were and what my parents offered. That was roughly 10 days ago, and my sister had yet to respond or bring up the subject despite me trying to start the conversation in person. \n\nSince I couldn’t get a response from my sister, I called my parents to see who would be staying with them. My mother told me that my sister had apparently gotten a hold of my brother and talked him into hosting the four of them for the entire holiday weekend. \n\nI know my sister is upset at the fact that FH, LO and I will be staying with my parents instead of her family. The question is, AITA here? She’s had 5 years of using my parent’s guest bedrooms like it’s an all-inclusive hotel. I think it’s only fair at this point to realize that they’re not the only family that needs to travel, it’s not their house, and asking to stay VERSUS assuming is just basic decency and manners. \n\nI consider it basic manners to ASK to stay, and accept the response given with respect. Although at this point, I’m tempted just to get a hotel anyways to save on drama. ",

      "description": "Backstory: My wife car pools with a classmate to uni (an hour and a half away from our house, and 2-2.5 hours from the classmates house, they meet up and ride together)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, last night, I had it dropped on me that the classmate mentioned above would be bringing her dog to my house for me to watch while they are in class for four hours. I work all day, and we have 2 dogs (One is a puppy who is currently training and is a huge handful) and 2 cats. I also take my puppy to work with me, which means my work days are very busy handling him AND my job.\n\nI told her I didn't appreciate her volunteering me to do this without asking first. And this is for a number of reasons: I will be having to make sure this dog that I haven't met (And I haven't met her, the classmate, either, only heard her on the phone) isn't aggressive towards my animals. I won't be there when it is left at my house before I get home from work, so it will not know who the fuck I am when I get home. I don't know if the dog will be aggressive to me. It also doesn't know my house and where it should be going to notify me to go outside. There are plenty of reasons not to WANT to watch the dog. I will do it, and certainly have no problems with animals, but there are reasons for me to not be happy about this, imo.\n\nI usually have ZERO issues with being volunteered for certain things. For example, it often occurs where my wife will just randomly tell me she promised family/friends we would go to an event/dinner with them. No big deal. As long as it is a WE thing and not a thing I am stuck doing alone. Not to mention these things are usually fun and not added stress to my already long days of work and puppy-handling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter she told me this last night, that she already signed me up for this, I was a bit pissed. I told her she should never do volunteer someone for something like this - I don't want to spend what little time I have at home having to deal with even MORE than I already have to. She began crying, and last night went to sleep upset, and was upset this morning. I am not mad, because I told her what I thought of the situation and that I thought it was inconsiderate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe keeps saying it's not a big deal, and it's only four hours. I personally feel like she isn't really understanding that she signed me up to watch someone elses living creature without me consenting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologized to her because I did get a bit dickish towards the situation, but I still feel like I am in the right here with not being okay with being signed up for something like this. I mean, imagine if I told her that I signed her up to watch a friend of mines, who she had never met, child. But she shouldn't be mad because its ONLY 4 hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe situation is mostly dissolved and I'll be watching the pupper, but was I wrong for being a bit pissed about this?\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "I'll get this out of the way, I feel like an incredible asshole here, but maybe it's one of those things where she's overreacting a bit. I honestly don't know and maybe it doesn't matter because we have to move on one way or another. \n\n\nSo backstory on this, fiancé grew up in smallish mountain town north of Albuquerque, NM as did her parents and both sets of grandparents. Both grandparents got engaged in the town plaza because it was sort of the thing to do back in the day. Her parents also got engaged in the plaza but in a much more informal \"hippieish\" manner in the 70s, but it was still the same location. \n\n\nWhen we seriously started talking about marriage she told me flat out (to paraphrase) \"I don't care about the ring, I don't care about you asking my dad for 'permission', I don't care how much you spend, what time of year it is or if it's freezing outside; I want you to propose in the Taos Plaza.\" I was like cool...I can do that. \n\n\nSo we've been talking about rings for maybe the last six months and I finally bought one that I feel definitely fit her personality. I stupidly told her best friend and best friend told her. So last weekend we decided to spend the weekend in her hometown skiing. As the weekend came to a close I could tell she was getting antsier and antsier but it honestly didn't clue in what the deal was. As we drove past the plaza on the way back to Albuquerque she even said \"he look, it's the plaza...we should stop!\"\n\n\nBecause I'm an IDIOT it didn't clue me in what she was talking about and I was the good computer engineer and said something like \"no, no we have a schedule to keep, work tomorrow!\" So the whole way home she was that kind of like mad/sad and wasn't really talking to me. I figured she was tired and didn't make much of it. \n\n\nSo next day I saw her best friend at work (she works with me) and she basically said that I really blew it because girlfriend was expecting me to propose on the trip. In an a-ha moment I was like that's what she was mad. So I took her out to a nice dinner Tuesday night and got on one knee and proposed to her in a restaurant. She said yes  but I could tell she was still really upset. I asked her what was wrong and she very openly told me (again paraphrasing) \"I love you and want to marry you, but for almost a year and half I've told you I want one thing and one thing only from my proposal and it's goin to take me a long time to not be upset that you didn't listen to me.\" \n\n\nSo the moment that was supposed to symbolize the start of our new life together ended with her taking most of her food home in a doggy bag, leaving to her apartment by herself and her telling me \"I really love you, but I'm really upset and I need some time before I see you again\" and kissing me on the cheek. I know she'll come around but I don't know when. \n\n\nSo I full on acknowledge I'm an idiot, but am I an asshole?",

      "description": "So to start this off I don't think I'm in the wrong at all. My cousin has a bit of an ego and blames others for his own problems. \n\nAnyways, my cousin for whatever reason can not license a car under his name. I believe it must be because he owes money to the license issuer but I can't be sure. So, he comes to ask his one cousin that might help in this situation. He offers to pay me $100 and I who needs help paying off a ticket a few months ago accepts. \n\nFast forward a couple months later, I unknowingly had my license suspended because I forgot to schedule an appointment for a defender drivers class. I've been driving everyday since and had never been pulled over so I consider myself vey lucky. A couple days ago my cousin got pulled over because they ran the plates on his car that is under my name for a reason I'm not too sure(could be random or recklessly driving). So as they run the plates they see my name and realize that my license is suspended and think that the person driving the vehicle is me only to find that it is not. We live in Canada and weed is legal and they treat weed similarity to alcohol. You can not consume it in a vehicle and can not drive high. Anyways, he gets his mouth swabbed and the police find out he is impaired and impound his car and give him a $750 ticket.\n\nAfter this incident, my cousin texted me with a novel worth of text messages explaining what happened and getting pissed at me, basically saying it's my fault. He was saying that he paid me $100 and couldn't even keep my shit together and make sure my license wasn't suspended. I told him he shouldn't be smoking and driving and it's shouldn't be my fault and he replied that I am the asshole and at least he had the decency to tell me that my license is suspended so I wouldn't get a ticket.\n\nHe doesn't seem to believe he's the asshole in this situation, but I can only see how he is. Sure I messed up by forgetting to schedule an appointment and having my licence suspended, but I didn't have to let him registered his car under my name. AITA?",

      "description": "We live in an apartment complex that has a fitness center on the property. Lately, I've noticed an increase in non-residents driving into the complex, parking their car outside the gym, using it, getting back in their car and taking off back home.\n\nOne side of me is \"whatever\", they're not hurting me or getting in my way so what do I care, right? \n\nBut the other side of me is getting increasingly annoyed at the people who feel entitled to just come in and just help themselves to facilities and property that **my** rent payment is going towards. It feels like paying $20 for a meal and a stranger coming to the table and eating fries off your plate without even asking.\n\nI've noticed the same people coming and going enough times that I now know what they look like and what their vehicles look like. I'm preparing to confront them and ask if they're residents, and if they aren't, that they need to quit coming or I'll be notifying the leasing office and the authorities.\n\nMy neighbor says this is an asshole thing to do because they aren't causing any trouble, aren't getting in my way and I should stay out of it and let the complex deal with it. She is far more easy going than I am and says it's a great thing these people want to improve their health and we're blessed to live in a great place and should share. She also warned me that because the people doing this are of a different race, it's more than likely I could wind up being recorded and blasted on the internet as the latest racist villain - \"Fitness Center Freddy stops people trying to better themselves and improve their health!\". This seems completely unfair to me.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to shut this shit down and tell these people to go run in the park or buy a membership to 24hr Fitness and quit treating a private fitness center that all residents have to pay to use as their own personal gym?

She was super excited and I was happy I got to spend time with her, since she lives alone now. She then decides to invite 2 of her friends and expects me to pay for it. That would be about $400 in tickets. She said her friends would pay me back but they are both wishy washy with plans so I cancelled so I'm not SOL with 2 tickets and no money. What should I have done?",

      "description": "I'll start with some background: We met through a mutual friend 4 years ago when she was visiting with other friends for our University's football game and Halloween. Mutual friend said she thought I was cute and so I decided to go to the club with her and she stayed over that night(nothing happened). She lived and went to school 2.5 hours away and after constant texting, I made bus trips down there through the school year taking turns of her driving up, then once my second year started and I had my car on campus, we took turns driving to spend weekend with each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward 3 years when I graduated, I moved to another state(still 3 hours travel) and the same happened while she was in the last year of her university. She graduated this May and moved in with me in July-ish. She found a job in the same city, but just a retail job as she couldn't find anything in her major. She hasn't really looked since started working.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrough the last 4 years, we only had 1 big incident and have been communicative with each other. Since moving in with me, we've bickered a lot more but not to the point of sleeping on couches or yelling. When I reflect on the past few years, I've come to the realization that I don't have confidence in us lasting and I don't have a \"spark\" with her anymore and feel a little unhappy. I feel like there are better people out there suited for each of us as we don't have many shared interests and just I don't feel a vibe anymore. Another small part is she's been the only girl I've been with sexually and for this long, and I kind of want to experience what other people are about and date around while I can before settling down. This is really a small part though as I'm not sure how much I would put myself out there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still love her, but I feel I'm not in love with her. We've had some communication in the past about how we are doing, but I haven't discussed this feeling yet as I've recently realized what I was actually feeling. It's also coming up on our 4 year anniversary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be the Asshole for breaking up with my GF of 4 years who recently moved in and is much more into me than I am her? Especially when it's holiday season and coming up on our 4 year anniversary? ",

      "description": "My grandfather is almost 80, and in many ways theres a lot to respect and admire about him. Hes one of the hardest workers I know, he came up with nothing and made something of himself, he supported a family of with six kids. \n\nNow hes extremely religious, he runs a bus ministry where he goes to low income areas and gets the children into church, pulling them out of crack houses and drug dens so that they can be taken care of. He has saved so many peoples lives, the pastor of one very prominent church was actually saved by my grandfather. When my grandpa was younger he actually saved the pastor (then a baby) from the pastors abusive father. The abusive dad was high and was holding the baby under water and my grandpa broke down the door with a bat and fought off two guys and a woman to save him.\n\nSo he definitely has a good side to him. However, even though i acknowledge this, he himself was a drunken violent bastard when he was younger, and he abused my mother terribly to the point where she is now a terrible alcoholic herself with insane trauma.\n\nHe would beat her for no reason, just in a drunken rage. He would throw here against walls. He would beat her with a belt until she bled. He would throw her christmas presents away when she misbehaved. Not only that, but he created an environment where abuse and neglect was rampant, and my mother was molested by a cousin. When he found out he put a stop to it, but i blame him for that.\n\nThis was all in the past. Before he was in church. But i look at my mom and how messed up she is, and how messed up she made me, and I cant help but resent him for what he did. Ive cut him out of my life and he may die soon.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Background:\n\nMy best friend and I are really close and we hang out a lot on Discord and play different types of games together. Sometimes these games are good to me and not really that great for him and vice versa. Most of the time, though, we play shooter games. When he’s on and I’m on at the same time, we’ll usually play something together with a few other friends. \n\nQuestion:\n\nSometimes I’ll be doing something like playing a different game, practicing guitar, or hanging out and watching T.V and he’ll be like, “wow always gotta do what you want to do, and not anything I want to do”. Kind of makes me feel bad. My question here is, should I be dropping everything to play with him whenever he wants? We used to play different genres a while back, but I got bored and returned to our main game. Other than that, I rarely really like to play other games, because we have different interests, and I thought I don’t really domineer his choices with mine at all. If it’s a game I enjoy and I’m not doing anything, I’ll hop on. If it’s not, I might depending on the game and if I’m not busy. Recently I think I’m in this mindset where, if i want to play something then I’ll get on it, and if he doesn’t want to then cool, that’s fine. People have different interests. AITA?",

      "description": "Basically, I’ve been friends on and off with this guy for about 4 years. We’re only 15, so that’s like forever for teenagers. The on and off part is due to many major arguments. We’ve always managed to get past it and forgive each other though.\n\nAs for what happened, he bought a set of fairy tail keys off of me for £25. I gave them to him, saying he could pay me back later. Then, it turned out I needed some money for a shopping trip I’d had planned with a friend. It wasn’t an urgent thing but I asked if he could pay me back soon, since I knew he got his weekly pay. He said he wouldn’t and he was planning on saving a ‘comfortable amount’ before paying me back. I told him to give me the keys back until he could pay me back. He refused and when I went to confront him in person (and collect them), he put them down a drain. \n\nI stopped talking to him, having a go at him for it. I had a temporary mental breakdown in the confines of my kitchen. We argued back and forth before I eventually blocked him. Then, he started messaging me on Twitter where he started saying homophobic stuff and just generally insulting me. I stopped all contact and blocked him whenever he messaged me.\n\nI came to a realisation that he wasn’t a great person. He was horrible, cruel and a general bully. \n\nDuring this period where he was out of my life, I was, hand on heart, the happiest I’ve been in a long time. I felt that I had time for myself and wasn’t pressured to hop onto a call as play whatever games he wanted to. I felt as if I could have other friends and play other games. And I did! It was honestly beautiful, to have that freedom. \n\nThen, he started reemerging. A tweet asking for someone to help him write a diss track about me. Then him saying it was solely about the money. The money was just a catalyst to my realisation. It would’ve come eventually. \n\nI kept him out of my mind for as long as I could but today, he tried contacting me 3 separate times on Twitter. Each time I blocked him but in the third, I’d had enough. I messaged him on WhatsApp (I’d forgotten to block him here) and told him to stop trying to contact and annoy me. He said nah and I lost it completely. I took all the screenshots I had of all the stuff he’s said to me. All the insults, the pressuring and how hard he was to deal with. I sent them to him, each with a little explanation. He argued back and gave me more things to screenshot and send back at him.\n\nAfter calming down, I sent him one final message before blocking him for good:\n\n‘Basically, you’re a transphobic and homophobic abuser. You harass people, both verbally and sexually, and you like to think you’re untouchable. You think you’re smart but you’re completely mistaken. Even a toddler can see through all the lies you tell. I wouldn’t be surprised if Jess WASN’T lying. You have all the traits. You’re an arrogant fuckboy who uses physical strength to get what he wants and gets annoyed when he doesn’t get it. Sounds like a rapist to me’\n\nI know it wasn’t right to add fuel to the fire but am I the asshole for going against him massively?\n\nP.S. I do have screenshots so if wanted, and if I can, I’ll try upload them to an imgur album or something. ",

I researched it and decided I want to be a pilot in the Air Force. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe joined Civil Air Patrol, which is an auxiliary of the USAF in January. It's a good way to get introduced to the aviation field and make connections and get the very basics of stuff like drill down, etc. I've been thinking about joining it myself because I want to be a part of something bigger than myself and I want to get a head start on anything that I can that'll help me in AFROTC and the AF itself. I told this to my girlfriend and she flipped out. She got super defensive and tried to talk me out of joining, saying that \"you wouldn't like it\" and \"it would be weird\" among other things. I told her that I didn't care if she thought I didn't like it and that if I thought it would help me in my career or getting into a college then I would do it.

Ever since I met her, another guy, we will call him X, has been around her and was previously interested in her. Cool, fine, people have past interests and that's not a big deal. The problem arises with what happened after we were already together. X continued to make romantic advances when they were out together as \"friends\", and it made my girlfriend uncomfortable. X also has some anger control issues and has attempted to become somewhat violent with her, and has additionally tried to spread a rumor and convince my girlfriend that I was being mentally abusive towards her (she didn't fall for that, thankfully). This all happened during high school, and since we've all gone to university they stopped talking for the most part. Though they aren't much of friends anymore, my girlfriend has become friends with X's current girlfriend. My girlfriend has invited both of them to her Christmas party, despite me saying for years that I don't want to be in any situations around X.

      "description": "Using a throwaway because I know he lurks on Reddit.\n\nSo, when I was younger I'd always get teased by my bother. My sisters never said or did things as harsh as he did but being the only boy I thought it was just something boys did. I'd also like to mention there is a 7 year age gap. One day he'd say or do something that made me cry and the next we'd play video games. I was the only other sibling that really enjoyed playing the games he liked so we'd play together often. \n\nAs I grew up he'd become meaner to me. Not just the teasing kind but actually making me feel bad for being interested in certain things. At this point I had started high school and like some kids, the change was hard on me and I developed some form of anxiety. I started seeing a counselor at school because sometimes going to class was difficult for me and just seeing a counselor was helpful. \n\nOn the first day of my junior year, I had an appointment to see the counselor during my English class. They had called my mom's cell later on in the day, which I was okay with since I wanted my parents knowing that I was having a tough time. Unknowingly my brother had answered. He used this against me saying horrible things about me, things along the lines of me being a psycho. Even going as far as to use that exact word. This was the straw that broke the camels back.  This was five years ago and I've only spoken to him since a handful of times. Each time is a different argument, that has me out of the house for hours at a time. \n\nI haven't since gone back to get help for the anxiety that I still get to this day. This is mainly due to a fear I have of him finding out about me needing help and being made fun of again. Something I couldn't handle the first time.\n\n A few days ago I was getting my car fixed from a minor accident and my mom had to pick me up from work. I was in a bad mood since work hadn't been that easy on me, and she teased me about always having an attitude. I kind of stayed silent and she asked If I wanted to look into going back for help with my anxiety? I told her why I didn't want to, as I had before. She got upset at me asking why I couldn't forgive him if it had been such a long time ago. That I hurt her for not wanting anything to do with my brother. She was upset that I constantly exclude myself from family events because I don't want to be around him. \n\nThis event has left me conflicted. I am not ready to be on talking terms with him, but if it makes my mother so upset. Should I try to? This also causes my sisters to get annoyed with me because I wont attend events if he is there. They say I'm acting immature but they also don't have the full story so I don't blame them. So Reddit, Am I the Asshole for not wanting anything to do with my brother and causing my mother to be upset? ",

      "description": "So I worked on a group home for autistic people, and many of them were ridiculously picky eaters. It was my task to feed them and prepare their meals. Well, they'd feed themselves but I prepared it. Anyway... there were some of them who hated mushrooms. But fuck it, the pre-cut vegetables I bought in the store tended to have some mushrooms in them. I couldn't be arsed to remove the mushrooms so... I just decided to have a little experiment. And cut them really, really small and make them disappear in a sauce so softly and thoroughly cooked they'd practically fall apart.\n\nSurprise, surprise... they never noticed! Emboldened, I proceeded to include tiny onions into dishes of clients I knew hated onions. Tiny enough and all of a sudden they no longer minded it. They complimented me, in fact. Another client hated all things \"chemical\" and insisted I cook using only the freshest of ingredients... I'd do a little bait &amp; switch with bottles and cups and he'd never know what really went in the sauce.\n\nI basically cooked, carefree, whatever the fuck I wanted and felt okay with doing that because I felt a lot of these guys who were 'picky eaters' were really just being childish and hiding behind their autism diagnosis. My superior eventually caught on to what I was doing and wasn't too pleased... but no client ever noticed and they all loved my food! ",

      "description": "This happened years ago and my anxiety forces me to stay up worrying about it all of the time. I was 8 and high functioning autistic. That being said this was before I took classes on facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice to help me interpret other people’s feeling in a situation. \nLet’s get right into it. My family is strictly Roman Catholic (I have since left that faith) and my little cousin had just achieved her first communion so her family (I’m related to her Mom but the little girl was on her Dad’s side so we have no blood relation) I was my grandparents only grandchild there so I was being shown off like the little trophy child I was raised to be. ( I have so many stories about this and how it resulted in the relationship I have with my grandfather and the church today.) I had just started reading the Babysitters Club series and I was talking about how I wanted to be just like them when I grew up. ( Cue the adorable chubby cheeked one front tooth missing smile that made adults love me as a child.) (why I was missing a front tooth for seven years is a whole other tale) When the kids started to migrate outside with their toys they decided to put me “In charge”. \nUc: unrelated cousin\nRc: related cousin\nMom: my awesome single Mother who fought her way through college and career so she wouldn’t have to count on her parents too much as I got older.\nMe: 8 year old trophy child\n\nWhen we got outside Uc kind of rudely reminded me that I can’t boss her around just because I’m older than her. I understood that and just went to the corner because there was a bat and I used to love baseball. I was just trying to hit the ball a few times: (I have horrid vision and I had forgotten my glasses that day) When Uc and Rc come over. Uc was talking about how “I wasn’t good” and “ I should do girly things” I replied telling her to “Stop it” and she was not happy. I don’t remember all of the details as I was young and it was a long time ago but this one quote sticks out like a sore thumb in my head. Uc says “Well those bats only have air in them but this bubble wand has soap that we can pour in your eyes”. My little autistic self had no idea that she was just trying to look tough and she would never actually do that so I ran inside, grabbed the first thing I could find, a pitcher of ice water and poured on her head. She went screaming and crying to her Mom. My Mom and I had to sit in the car while I was lectured on why I shouldn’t have done that and we didn’t go to any family events for several years. I don’t regret it but my Mom and I got into  a debate about how I was older and should have taken the high road. I may have been older but I was still a kid and I was just scared of having soap poured in my eyes. \nWhat do you think people of reddit? Should I find the girl and apologize? Or should I relish in my petty revenge?\n\nTLDR: little girl threatens to pour soap in my eyes, in retaliation I pour a pitcher of water on her head.",

      "description": "Some context:\n\nI'm a female in my 20s. Everyone I refer to is a male in their 20s. I've been working for a place for over 2 years now, and get along great with pretty much everyone. Naturally I've become close with a couple people and consider them my best friends, and the feeling seems mutual. Last Thursday, a coworker (we'll call him Bob) came in not during his shift to \"check on arrangements\" so I could tell something was being planned and I wasn't invited. It stung, but its life. I moved on. Friday night comes around and Bob comes in again not on his shift to \"finalize plans\" and clearly showing they were having a party of work friends and discussing it infront of me without inviting me. This party involves mostly everyone from our department, males and females. Bob is listing off who is coming, and trying to convince another friend (we'll call him Tom) to come. Tom and I are good friends, he was driving me home that night, and Tom clearly wants the subject dropped. I was speaking with Tom at this point, so I wasn't even eavesdroppig - this was right infront of me. Then the bombshell. Bob says this whole party was \"Rick's\" idea and now he wasn't even coming. Rick and I are extremely close friends. I felt my stomach crumble and went didn't say anything else. Tom drives me home, we sit in his car and chat for a while like we do every night, and Bob keeps ringing his phone, to which Tom keeps hanging up and keeps talking to me. Its almost 11, I'm getting tired so I say good night to Tom and head inside.\n\nBut something is still nagging me about why Rick would plan something with a mutual group of friends but not invite me. We're open with each other so I texted and asked why. I didn't accuse him of anything, didn't get angry, just asked why he planned a party for coworkers but not invite me. He denied planning the party or even having knowledge of it, and stopped speaking to me. I've dropped the whole thing and simply tried to go back to our regular conversations and sharing shitty memes but he's only responding \"lol\" and \"ok\" when less than a week ago we spent over 3 hours talking one night. I have no idea why he won't talk to me anymore.\n\nAITA for asking Rick why he planned something for our mutual group of friends and declined to invite me?",

      "description": "So I made this throwaway account to ask this since my bf uses reddit sometimes. I'll try to make it short. \n\nThis morning we made plans to meal prep and then workout so I got to his place before stores opened to avoid rush hour traffic. We talk for a few minutes in his bedroom about me leaving in the afternoon and we might as well workout now then meal prep after. As we start to leave he spends 20 min in the bathroom which is fine no big deal then he makes a smooothie. He makes one every mornign so I'm just waiting on the couch. Then I see him start to empty the trash bin to throw it away. I say with some attitude, \"What are you doing?\" and he says \"Throwing out the trash, its full\". It really was flowing out as there was another bag of trash next to it already but I didnt see the point of him start to clean as we were about to leave. This is where I give him attidude and say, \"Don't do that\" and \"You're wasting time\". And this is when he snaps at me and loudly says, \"I feel like you're trying to control my life right now\" and other sentences about why he cant throw the trash away if its full. I tell him beacause his apartment is already mostly messy and dirty and throwing the trash away when we are leaving and I have a set time to leave wont make a difference. As I'm saying this without even raising my voice he loudly says, \"CALM DOWN\" four times at me and to stop talking. So I do and we move on with the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow he does admit that his place is mostly dirty and that he is starting new daily clean habits to change it. Anyways later in the day its brought up again because I dont feel he should've snapped like that. The exact morning as I got to his place he rushed me in and was rude when I took two stops becase I have a broken toe and I took a second to allow him to unlock the door. I mentioned he can be just as rude sometimes and say rude remarks with attitude and I never escalate the sitaution or get loud or anything. I just ignore it and move on so I expect the same from him. He says that he NEVER wants any attitude at all directed towards him and if he ever gives me attitude again I should call him out on it instead of saying nothing. I feel thats impossible to never give even a little attitude when I dont see it as anything personal. I told him he should act the same way I do instead of always giving attitude back. So reddit am I the asshole thinking its impossible to never give attitude? ",

Sounds good to me, I'm thinking. Can't wait. End of story.\n\nBut then, to paraphrase, my dad says that I probably wish my boyfriend (of 3 years) could come too, but they can't buy him a ticket. I laugh and say of course not, I would never expect that. But then an idea occurs to me! So I ask, what if he buys his own ticket? Then he could come too, right?\n\nAfter a very long silence, my dad mumbles that he \"understands I'm not 16 anymore\" and \"knows I'm physically active,\" but \"still has a hard time dealing with his daughter...\" (trails off, \"having sex\" implied here).\n\nNOW I'm taken aback. I am a 24-year-old in a PhD program living hundreds of miles away from my parents. I understand that my parents are very traditional about pre-marital sex. During the few times that my boyfriend and I both spent the night under their roof, we slept in separate rooms. The whole nine yards. But THIS? My brother and sister-in-law have been married for less than a year, having lived together before the wedding, and she's 3 years younger than me!\n\nEven my mom, an extremely soft-spoken woman, spoke up in my defense, repeating that \"I'm not 14 anymore\" and might feel this is unfair. I didn't say much of anything because I honestly didn't know how to calmly rebut just then. My dad is essentially going to put me in a chastity belt to make himself feel better for 1 week while I get to have everyone else shacking up around me?\n\nBut on the other hand, my dad IS the one paying for my vacation ticket in the first place. So, reddit, AITA?\n\ntl;dr: My dad won't let my boyfriend of 3 years come on a family trip to Barbados, even if he buys his own ticket, because he doesn't like the idea of us sleeping together (I'm 24 and he's 27). But my dad IS the one buying MY ticket. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Ok, so some context here. This guy I work with is part-time; he has another job during the day. He is allowed to use the staff lockerroom facility, and he was vaping (from a mod, which is known for fatty clouds) in the bathroom. He ends up setting off the fire alarms for the entire building, which is a hospital. \n\nI only know about this because he told me, and later showed other co-workers of ours a video of him freaking out in the stall. (He even went as far to tell our boss about it.) I asked him what happened, preparing to hear about a hefty fine or something. Apparently his cousin is a security guard there; helped him sneak out of the locker room, and into the general halls. He walked out of there, while everyone else thought it was a real fire/emergency! He told me the staff were moving patients away from the area and some people were obviously very worried.  \nAuthorities were called as it was not a scheduled fire drill.\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole: this guy was laughing about the whole situation. He also kept bringing it up throughout his entire shift. I had to hear about this for 5 hours people! He made it seem like it was funny and 'totally not a big deal'. I personally can't find any humor in putting people into panic, disrupting patient care, and just wasting time, funny. I heard that the hospital caught some footage of him exiting the hall of the lockerroom, and police are asking people for information. I'm really tempted to call. So, WIBTA if I reported my dumbass co-worker?",

      "description": "I’m almost 26, and I’ve been smoking weed since I was a teenager. \nI’ve never chosen weed over bills or rent, I’ve never done the stereotypical “I missed the big meeting/important job interview/etc because I was busy getting high!” Nonsense. I’ve easily been able to stop smoking for months at a time at the drop of a hat and feel nothing but maybe some slight boredom. I’m more addicted to cigarettes than to weed and I smoke maybe two cigarettes a day if even that much, and not even every day. \nMy mom sat me down one day and very seriously told me that she thinks I need to consider going to an addicts anonymous meeting for my weed addiction. She had gone so far as to find websites and print up information for me and called a few meetings in the city nearby to find out if they had room for one more person. \nAfter the initial confusion and disbelief that it was a genuine suggestion, I was angry. I was offended. Not only at the fact that she would say that to me considering I remember multiple times when I was a teen that my mom would ask me if I had 5$ so she could buy cigarettes. A 35 year old woman asking her 15 year old daughter for cigarette money. And she refused to even try to stop smoking through all 4 of her kids pregnancies. And I told her as much, I said all of that to her face. \nAnd I told her that beyond that, how disgustingly offensive would it be for me to sit in a room listening to people tell stories about losing their children because of their addiction, becoming homeless, becoming estranged from their families etc and then I stand up and go “yeah I mean sometimes I choose smoking weed over like exercising and a couple of times I’ve taken a hit or two during lunch breaks on particularly shitty days at work” and expect to be welcomed back\nShe was very angry with me, it caused an argument that lasted several days and even now (maybe 6 months later) it’s still a touchy subject. She still brings it up sometimes and each time I immediately leave the room/hang up the phone/stop responding to her texts until she changes the subject. \nWas I in the wrong? Should I have been nicer about it? The idea just seemed so awful and entitled in some way, that I couldn’t believe it came from my otherwise usually rather intelligent and open minded mother (especially also considering her entire teens and 20’s were spent bar hopping and doing all sorts of drugs and partying with the type of fringe people who hank from hooks on chains nailed to the ceiling for fun). My boyfriend said he agreed with what I said fully, but thought maybe I should’ve just kept my mouth shut and just said no I’m not gonna do that rather than blowing up. ",

      "description": "I (m27) was at a bar/restaurant with my wife (f26) and our neighbor (m42). Me and my wife have been married for 2 years but together for 10. I have known the neighbor for just over a year. \n\nAlthough we have been friendly - I never quite liked him. He is 42 years old and as immature as a 16 year old. Always making jokes about \"doing my mom\" and \"hit it and quit it\" type of humor. \n\nSo I reluctantly go to a bar/restaurant with him and my wife and he keeps going on and on about \"clits\". It's an inside thing that is not even worth explaining. So he keeps yelling \"clits\" and my wife even joins in. He gets the waiter involved talking about clits, stops the busboy talking about clits - both tables by us have turned their heads looking at us. I am embarrassed. \n\nI start to pretty much berate both of them asking them to stop. They don't. After pleading with my wife, she stops. He doesn't. I then, psuedo-regretfully demean him. Saying, \"wow I couldn't imagine my dad at 42 years old making a scene like this at a restaurant.\" This upsets him.\n\nWe get into a verbal argument with threats of going outside to handle this. He is super passive aggressive about how I'm being a bitch and uptight and dick up my ass. Uh, I just want to eat my food and not talk about clits. \n\nI drove us all there and he just got his check and left. In the car ride home, who gets yelled at? Me. My wife says she was embarrassed because we were arguing and making a scene but wont even comprehend the idea that I was embarrassed about them making a scene long before. My wife admits that he was too much nut is still upset with me. I have absolutely no interest in being his friend moving forward but it seems my wife wants to keep thing friendly. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Am I the asshole? \n\nTL;DR: my neighbor was an embarrassment at a restaurant and wants me to feel bad about it. I get yelled at by my wife - but that's nothing new.",

She’s bad at managing money so she always runs out in a week, but that’s besides the point. She was talking about wanting to make some chicken so she asked me if I could go pick her up some chicken and I said no. She then told me she’d pay me come payday (end of the month - this happened earlier this week). Again, I still said no. She knows I’m vegan so hi, why would I? She then got mad at me and told me that it’s not like I’m spending my own money as if the issue is the fact that I would have to spend $8 of my own money. It’s about about the money lol\n\nAnd all of my other roommates are omnivore and chimed in telling me I’m being selfish and “pushing” my lifestyle onto others and that if I’m getting repaid, it’s not really my money buying that chicken (that’s not how economics works but ok). And even though whenever I’m downstairs eating, my roommates mock what I eat (“ew what is that? Where’s the protein? Ha ha, are you protein deficient? Have some of this steak” as I’m eating a meal with 30g of protein), but I’m pushy? Sure, Jan.\n\nVeganism isn’t a diet. It’s a philosophical guideline. I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to not want to contribute to the exploitation and cruelty of living beings. This occurs often too. she’ll ask me to pick up other animal products like ~~animal secretions~~ milk or sour cream and I’ll offer to buy the non-~~cruelty~~dairy version and I ever offer to pay the difference out of pocket.

      "description": "My father has been an alcoholic for longer than I have been alive. He and my mother had a dramatic and stressful marriage, but aside from a few affairs and passive-aggressive fights, was stable enough through most of my childhood. However, as soon as my younger brother was in his senior year of high school, my father decided to leave after discovering that my mother had been hiding large amounts of debt. My father really fell off the wagon and began to send drunken emails explaining that my brother, mother and I were all trash. He frequently vented about all the times we disappointed him and detailed his extramarital affairs in needless detail. I felt abandoned and hurt during this and eventually blocked his number, email, and everything.\n\nDuring this time, I helped my mother out with her finances, getting a better job, moving to a more affordable place. However, she was a wreck and it took years for things to get better for her.\n\nA few years passed and I got a call from my aunt that my father had drank himself into a coma (Diabetic coma from the beer). She said it wasn’t a big deal and that he would be ok. I didn’t realize how big of a deal this was until someone explained that this was a life-or-death situation for my father. My mother, brother and I went to visit him and be with him. When he recovered, he seemed genuinely touched that we would all make the effort to visit him.\n\nA few months after this, my mother takes me out and drops that she is getting back together with my father. I flipped out and yelled at her. She explained that she never stopped loving him and that he needs a follow-up surgery that he couldn’t afford without her insurance. I told her that if she got back together with him that I would not be apart of it.\n\nTwo months later, I heard from my grandmother that she just got back from my parents second wedding. I was taken back. I couldn’t believe that she secretly re-married my father and didn’t even bother to tell me. I haven’t talked to either of my parents or my aunt that helped plan the wedding since. I don’t feel like I can trust them anymore and don’t want to be part of their drama anymore.\n\nAITA for not talking to my parents?\n\nTLDR; My father abandoned my family when I was younger and drank himself into a coma. After a hospital stay, he reconnected with my mother secretly marrying her to get a surgery he needed. I decided to ghost my parents to avoid more drama.",

      "description": "Title is quite vague, but didn't want to go into much detail.\n\nRecently, I remembered a family vacation to the south of France we had about 3 years ago, and during that vacation, naturally, we went to experience French cuisine. Now at the time I was somewhat decent in French speaking, but not enough to be fluent in it, but my family had no idea on how to speak French. So, we go to a restaurant, and the waiter comes to take our orders. This is where my dilemma begins. \n\nI was too shy to order for my family, so my father decided to do it instead. And instead of butchering an attempt at speaking French, he did, what I thought was the polite thing, and spoke in English. The waiter, however did not like that. He said: \"Why do I have to learn English, if you don't bother learning French\". Nothing too much out of the ordinary.\n \nFor some peculiar reason I thought about it today, and didn't know who was in the right, hence my attempt at addressing this to the public. WIBTA  in this situation if I did not know a language, and resorted to English instead of butchering another language (English is not my first language, but I would prefer someone to speak in this language, rather than attempting to speak in my mother tongue)\n\nTLDR WIBTA for speaking in English, rather than attempting to speak in a language that I do not know or know little about.

      "description": "\nI (21, F) wouldn’t be happy to call the other person, we’ll call her Jan (23, F) in this scenario “the asshole” or the person in the wrong, bc I truly believe she isn’t. I just don’t know if my behavior makes me an asshole.\n\nI recently moved in with a dear friend of mine (my best friend, really. All that lame girl shit: planning to be each other’s maids of honors, etc.) into a city she’s been living in for a while. It’s been pretty lonely, I’m not sure how to make new friends.. Jan’s really busy, working the work week and having extensive plans during the weekends with friends, keeping up with hobbies, etc. I was always excited to see jan when she came home, trying to squeeze in a few moments to chat or maybe watch something together. We’re both pretty “silly” people and so I thought we had a running bit about me play-annoying her. She loves the frozen franchise so I would knock on her door and sing the do you want to build a snowman song.\n\nI have a chronic pain disorder, so I warned her that when I moved in I might keep to myself more than she’d expect. Which I do. But she’s maybe in our apartment for an hour or two a day when she’s not asleep or has her door closed doing other things, etc, and she is my only true person to really see in person to hang out with. So, the other night, I was trying to chat with her about her day while she folded laundry in our kitchen and she said “remember when you said you were gonna keep to yourself mostly laughter I was looking forward to that.” And I said “I’m ... sorry?” And Jan replied “well I’m just trying to get some laundry done and here you are...” And I stepped back from the situation and apologized for bothering her while she was trying to get something done, because she was right. If she only has a bit of time to accomplish task while she’s home, it’s unfair of me to try and monopolize it for myself. It’s no fault of hers that I’m having a difficult time trying to make some new friends. I told her I’d be better at leaving her alone, and went into my room for the night.\n\nI miss her, but I decided not to bother her so I haven’t. I’ve really only seen her when she sought out to see me. \n\nWe’re from the same hometown, and she left earlier this week to visit her family for Thanksgiving. We had a rather awkward exchange about it this week, as she has complained rather frequently about going home for the holidays because of her extended family not being her favorite company. My birthday is around the holiday, so for the last two years we’ve spent thanksgiving together, so she kept mentioning that she hasn’t seen them in a while because of me, so she was going to go anyway. After weeks of this, on Tuesday I asked her to please stop complaining about going home to me, because my Thanksgiving plans included working many long hard hours (work in a Bakery) up until the day, and then going home at about 1 pm to be in an empty apartment by myself. She replied “well, you could have asked me to stay back with you.” But I don’t really feel I could have. She told me she “always” planned on coming back on Saturday “just for your birthday.”\n\nMy birthday is on Saturday but I got off from work so i decided I take the train to our hometown tomorrow morning. she keeps texting me asking what my plans are. I’ve responded honestly, that I’d like to spend it with my parents and my brother, being with my dogs at home, and she’s welcome to join us, and to come over whenever if she’d like. I won’t really have gifts this year, and I don’t plan on making a big deal out of it. It’s just nice to have a weekend off from work. She’s acting as if I’m avoiding her or being rude, and not making a specific plan is inconvenient for her. I told her if she’s busy she can pick a time and maybe a place for lunch or something and I’ll meet her there. This only seemed to upset her more? My birthday was never a big discussion point before the laundry debacle. I think I’ve just made her feel guilty, which wasn’t my goal and I’ve told her that multiple times. But I don’t know if my behavior reflects that. \n\nTl;dr: my friend told me I’ve been bothering her. I apologized, and stepped back. She’s upset that I don’t have a lot of interest in making specific plans for my birthday, which I wouldn’t ... anyway.\n\nAITA?",

No from my earbuds I'm hard of hearing [i know its not good to put it on full blast so I don't do it all the time]. And so yea I turn it to max volume and well I guess you can hear the music when I have my earbuds on if the music is at full blast [i listen to some screaming songs sometimes because its just so incredibly loud on full blast but usually I listen to pop music]. And its loud enough to hear the lyrics I have been told. And I guess it bothers people. But I don't know I'm 14 so I cant afford some really expensive headphones. And I have tried mutiple ear buds and the wrap around earbuds and also headphones I also have airpods to but with everyone when It doesn't keep the sound in. So i just go on having people hear my music i have had people say its not really that loud then others say its really loud. And some people they say its annoying and others don't really care. I have recently had lots of people say that its so loud and annoying. I mean i checked to see if it was connected blue tooth and yes it was so i mean it cant be that loud to others right? I have been told to stop but i don't really listen. So AITA? \n\n\n\nIF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE LOUDNESS:Also so if you want to know what volume then put some [dont recommend if you have perfect hearing it might be extremely shocking loud since its normal loud to me] apple earbuds or if you have airpods and on my iPhone I turn it all the way on normal the buttons but also under the music setting in EQ I have it set to \"late night\" so its supposed to make it louder. And then in \"volume limit\" I set it to max volume which by the way made me push some accept button to do. Then Finially I song I like to listen to just to get itch that part of me that wants LOUDNESS I will start by listening to Floor 555 by.)XXXTENTACION . Ok then I guess ask a friend with good hearing if they can hear it and if they can if its loud or not and if its annoying or not really?",

      "description": "Sorry for any formatting, I’m on mobile. \n\nI’m graduating high school this year, and booked a 5 week trip for this summer. It’s with a volunteer company, and I’m at an animal shelter for 4 weeks. I’ve been planning it forever, and it’s been booked (flights and accommodation) for more than three months. Also, I mentioned it on my instagram once in November. \n\nFast forward to a few days ago. A girl who is in one of my classes (who also follows me on instagram- important because she most likely saw that I’m going to this city from my instagram) casually mentions she won’t be going to grad because she’s not here. We ask her why, and she proceeds to tell us about how she’s going to the exact city I’m in, with the same volunteer company for the first two weeks I’m going to be there. I’m kind of irked because I was planning on spending this time with nobody I knew from home, but whatever. Then, she tells me she’s also at the animal shelter- there’s 10 “projects” to choose from for this particular city, and she chose the one I talked about on my instagram, for the same weeks I’m there, and in the same city. \n\nShe says she hasn’t booked anything yet, and she could be the type to not actually follow through with what she says- but I still really don’t want to spend 2/ my 5 weeks around her. We aren’t friends, I wouldn’t call her annoying but I wouldn’t spend more than an hour with her. \n\nWIBTA if I talked to her about switching cities or choosing different weeks? Or at least asked if she’d be willing to switch projects? \nDon’t get me wrong, of course I want her to experience it and all that but I really wanted these couple weeks away from everyone at home. \n\n",

Anyway, I heard that he later he complained about me at the chaplaincy staff meeting for parking in \"his spot\".\n\nFast forward 1 month when I was bringing the company car back from a trip out and see him pull in to the car bay despite there being multiple other free bays. I stopped my car and asked him to move and explained that the sign is old and this car needs to park here as we get in trouble if it is parked in a bay designated for visitors (our car is covered in company logos and his isnt so he won't be noticed as parking there and won't get in trouble). He refused saying the bay was his to park in. I again explained the sign is old and agreed it was confusing but it will make it easier if he moves his car to another free bay to save me getting in trouble and having to move the car later when he leaves. He again refused. I then told him to move his car and that if he has an issue to discuss with management, he then moved his car. \n\nI was frustrated with the entitled way he viewed the situation and maybe I let this cloud my judgement and be less reasonable?

She has a pile of like 50 of them already picked and she had even brought one of those nice retractable poles with the fruit catcher at the end of it.  (It was a really nice one)\nI was soooooo pissed I just walked right up to her and snatched it from her hand. She had a total 'deer in the headlights' look, but once I grabbed the pole from her she starts yelling at me 'hey! That's mine!! That's mine!' \nSo I tossed it over our fence where our German Shepard was barking. (Good luck getting that back) \n\nThen i got right in her face and screamed \"Well those are my avocados now GET THE FUCK OFF MY YARD!!\".\nI really scared her, I could see it in her face. I'm not hugely intimidating or anything 5'6\"/F 135lbs  but I was livid and I seriously wanted to fight her but she was a thousand years old and looked like Mama Coco from the movie Coco. \n\nSo I got in my car and sped away .leaving her to pick up the pile of avocados she had already picked. \n\nWell afterwards I was telling my coworkers what happened and they all said I was a jerk for screaming at her and stealing her stick since she was just an old lady probably trying to make some money because she's poor. \n\nAnd i'm thinking...am I the asshole?\n\nIf it makes any difference, I also told my neighbors what happened and they said they see her walk around our neighborhood all the time with that stick stealing lemons and other fruit from ppl. \n\nIt's my stick now. \n\n ",

They're the highlight of my day when I get off work. I sometimes struggle with depression and suicidal ideations. Though it sounds dumb, I wouldn't go thru with committing suicide because I'm too worried about who would feed and give my cats treats. But im the working poor. I have enough money to pay for bills, but I don't have an excess of disposable income, or 6 months worth of my income in my savings. \n\nwith that in mind, I would go without something to pay for anything needed to comfortably care for my pets. but I'm starting to feel like that's not a responsible adult decision to make. and I'm beginning to feel like a jerk for wanting to adopt my fosters. I try to convince myself that I have enough money to make them apart of my family. but maybe I'm being too optimistic. \n\nI love all 4 of them so much and am emotional just thinking about having to separate from my fosters. but I also know it's my responsibility as a foster parent to give them to the best home possible.

      "description": "Sorry if the formatting is bad. I'm on mobile. Also, sorry if this is too long. I feel like I need to get this all out.\n\nSo, I've been lurking on Reddit for a few years but I haven't had an account until now. I'm a 17 year old female turning 18 next month, if that changes anything.\n\nI've been friends with this girl (I'll call her Chloe for the sake of hiding her identity) since we were both in the 6th grade. At the beginning Chloe was very toxic and at times she would even physically harm me. Nothing too serious, but it definitely hurt and it made me want to stop being her friend.\n\nHowever, she was always around because we were both in band and had a lot of mutual friends. I decided just to suck it up and pretend like everything was fine between us. \n\nWhen high school started up, I was terribly nervous and shy and didn't have many friends. Again, Chloe was around a lot since we both stayed in band for high school. I hung out with her because I didn't want to be that kid with no friends. \n\nAs the years went on, we actually became very close and she stopped being toxic and never hurt me again. She became my best friend. We would have sleep overs and hang out outside of school. And whenever there was a band event, I'd be by her side when I could.\n\nLast year she started smoking weed very frequently. I NEVER thought that I'd EVER be the type to do drugs. Actually I was against it. But day I was at Chloe's house and her other friend was also there. They said they were going to smoke weed and I didn't have to do it with them, but I could try it.\n\nLong story short I tried it. I ended up smoking weed with her almost every day before school at our friend's house. Somehow we never got caught, but my grades did slip a lot. Never to the point of failing, but I got a few C's.\n\nSo, after doing that all year, over the summer she suggested that I try LSD with her. I was incredibly stupid to ever think it was a good idea. But I was depressed, depressed enough to be okay with smoking weed everyday. So LSD didn't seem like a big deal to me.\n\nI had the worst trip ever. I had multiple anxiety attacks during the trip. Eventually I must have disassociated or something because I thought I was dreaming/having nightmares but apparently I was doing things in real life.\nEver since then I've felt a little weird being around her. (She was apart of my trip in a weird way)\n\nThis year I haven't smoked weed as much. I'm not as depressed anymore. So I don't need it. It would just give me anxiety and remind me of my terrible trip whenever I'd smoke. The problem is, smoking weed is the main thing she likes to do now. I would try to avoid hanging out with her because I knew that she just wanted to smoke.\n\nI also got a boyfriend this year. He's against me smoking weed (mostly because it's illegal where we live) and that has caused a lot of tension between me, Chloe, and my boyfriend. Chloe and I had a few fights over it.\n\nAt one point on of our fights led to her telling me that we aren't best friends anymore. I felt really hurt by that. Things were awkward between us for a while after that. Until eventually we began trying to repair our friendship.\n\nI honestly tried. I really did. But her constant jabs at my boyfriend were getting hard to deal with. Hanging out with her seemed stressful because I didn't want to be that boring friend that didn't want to smoke even though everyone else did. And on top of all that, it just seemed like we were changing into different people. Too different for the friendship to work.\n\nSo I told Chloe I couldn't be friends with her anymore. I gave her some honest reasons why. Now her and a couple of our mutual friends think I'm a bitch.  Chloe hasn't talked to me since, of course. \n\nAm the asshole? I really don't know anymore. I feel like in some ways I am the asshole. Maybe I should've ended the friendship much sooner. Maybe I shouldn't have given up on repairing our friendship so quick. I have a lot of doubts.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This may be unnecessarily long. So I've been best friends with this girl since i was in 4th grade (going on 11 years now) and she was the very first friend I have ever made. We were basically inseparable for most of our lives until I decided that I wanted to go to university in the UK with my (now ex) GF. I've always felt used and just unappreciated but was so terrible at making friends that I didn't really think about it until I got close with my roommates here and they have told me that this girl is in no way my friend. I had a really good think about all the things that have happened over the years and it just confused me more. One of the things that has bothered me immensely is the fact that right before I left the states my best friend and another friend had a girl, who they had never met in person before, move in with them. I could see why, the girl was in need of a place to stay and they were willing to share the space, that wasn't what the problem was. My problem was that they treated this girl about 10000x better than they ever treated me. For this girls birthday they got her a pet cat, Gucci, makeup, clothes, etc. So much stuff, and they have never been to a single one of my birthday parties. Not a single one. I've never had a friend at my birthday party, at my graduation party, going away party, nothing. I had back surgery and asked if she would let my family pick her up to visit me because I was so lonely and she didn't want to. They've known this girl for less than a year and they're already living with her and giving her everything she wants. They've given me gifts, but they're all joke gifts, like broken cds from goodwill. I don't care about the monetary value of gifts, id rather just not be treated like a joke. I'm about to sound like an asshole probably but my family majorly supported this girls family. We would give her mom at least 2 grand every christmas and we paid her to do random shit all the time because she was a single mom and struggling with kids and a sick sister. For christmas I convinced my family to give her a company phone (which was a samsung galaxy not some shit company phone) since she didnt have one and an Ipad, she never thanked us really and gave it away  to a girl that racked up 70+ GBs on it sexting her 50 year old pedo boyfriend. These are things that i really easily looked over before. I never really thought about them as negative things it was just whatever.\n\nThe thing I'm really mad about is that she never messages me, like ever. She has said many times that she is bad at texting and she doesn't like talking over the phone, which I totally understand, but now I don't see her for months at a time and cant see her irl. I would message 7-8 times with no response for days and when i would get a response it was one worded and disinterested. I would usually only get a message from her if i went on a drunken suicidal rant on twitter then passed out, but even then its probably just hi. She messaged me a few days ago and instead of messaging back right away like I usually do I have been ignoring her messages. Shes started tagging me in posts about 'best friends' now and its pissed me off more than anything so I'm continuing to ignore her. I'm sick of wondering if I have been getting leeched off of and actually have no actual importance to, who I thought was, my only friend in the world, or if I'm an overly sensitive brat. Sorry this is so long.\n\nAITA?",

However in the contract we signed in order to successfully leave the house we need to find a “replacement tenant”.\n\nBack when my friend first said she was leaving uni I did all I could to help her find a replacement, and I did find someone. However this replacement dropped out last moment before signing the contract, leaving her panicked and needing someone else to take over from her.\n\nDuring the timeframe from her having a replacement and him dropping out, I then decided I wanted to leave the house too, sending me on a long and tedious search for a replacement.\n\nI finally found one a few days ago, on the exact day that my friend told me that her replacement flaked out.\nShe immediately asked me if I could give her anyone I find, and for me to post ads on Facebook for her. \nI posted the ads on Facebook however I didn’t confirm I would give her anyone.\nI then proceeded to tell her later that day that I found someone for myself (not from the fb ads) and she seemed blunt and annoyed about it (without saying anything).

      "description": "Boss at my work, a delivery company, was selling his old SUV as it sat it was worth around 2500. He said he was going to sell it this guy who always asked about buying it. When he said he only wanted $500 I immediately withdrew the cash and handed it to him the next day. \n\nI fixed it up, it needed a ton of cleaning, new thermostat, brakes, hoses, radio, speakers, transfer case and diff fluid swapped out.\n\nMy boss asked his brother (President Of company, small family business) before selling it if the company could use it, he said no. \n\nFast forward a month later and we are renting a ridiculously expensive truck to take this small route that I could do in this SUV because a truck broke down. Now it’s been months and I take a smaller route in my personal vehicle losing hours and putting wear and tear on the vehicle. \n\nThey are only paying for gas, and they did pay for a power steering pump to be replaced, but that’s work I can do myself. They have no plan in place to replace this vehicle I’m paying for\nInsurance on every month and put work in to fix up. The plan was to give this to my girlfriend or parents who both drive junkers. \n\nAITA for wanting to cut them off and take away the vehicle? I only got it because I work here and couldn’t of afforded it otherwise. I don’t know what to do. I feel like such a asshole for wanting to ask for more money out of a company i hasn’t been profitable in years. I know for a fact me and a few other drivers make more than the President (he’s still rich don’t feel bad) They pay me $15 when I had no experience or even the CDL for cheaper insurance. I can’t get another job quickly that will pay similarly. \n\nI want to be a team player and I don’t want to be selfish but even as I feel taken advantage of my anxiety and feeling of being a dick is stopping me from not bringing the vehicle in or asking for more money.

It's a lot of people and a lot of mouths to feed. Well, every time soda is bought for the house, everyone gets to drink it whatever whatever. So if you like a soda that no one else really likes, then you get more of it. If you like a soda that everyone likes it, you better hope there's some left! I've bought soda for the house multiple times. 12 packs each time, I've bought for the house at least 10 times. Sodas that I like and other people like.\n\nWell, this week I'm short on cash and there's no soda in the fridge that I enjoy. I decided, since I'm using what little money I have, I'd put a sign on the front of the box that says \"Please do not drink, I bought this for me and I'm low on funds. Thank you!\"\n\nCame home from work and the signs ripped up and half my soda is gone?\n\nI dunno, maybe I'm an asshole for putting the sign up in the first place?",

      "description": "For starters, we have a very close relationship with our neighbors. We're all close friends and since we live in an apartment building a door away from eachother, it's a spoken rule that, should we need something, we can march in whenever to grab some milk, or an egg, or some sugar, or a drink, etc. \nLately I've been borrowing their tea strainer as ours broke, so I went on over to grab it. They weren't home. On the counter was sitting a tea cake that I had given to her a week before, which had been sitting there for the duration of said week. It was part of a breakfast I made for my mother's birthday, and I had made too much, so I gave one to her. \n\nI don't know if you would agree, but in my personal opinion it's rather rude to leave someone's gift to you sitting on a counter. By my judgement, that's a sign that you're not intent on eating it (at least that's the way it goes in my household, my father likes to cook Chinese food but my mother hates it, so she leaves it out on purpose and I end up putting it in the fridge). So I thought that it had been left out long enough, and I figured she probably wouldn't have even noticed it gone since she had ignored it this long. I got pissed off and I took it and ate it. It was delicious even after a week.\n\nTwo hours later she walks in and asks pryingly if I took the cake, to which I replied with a yes.\nShe then proceeded to get upset and started to loudly lecture me on why it was rude of me to have taken it back. She was very discontented over the fact that I had taken it back.\n\nI don't know if I was right or not. In my view, when people leave things out, It's rude. But I don't know if it was correct to take it. Am I the asshole?\n\nI have a feeling I'm indeed the asshole in the eyes if many, though I still feel it was just in some small sense. Change my mind, though.",

      "description": "I live with four roommates and we have four cars. Our driveway fits three. A couple months ago, one of the roommates started picking up the habit of parking in front of the mailbox (which means our mail won't get delivered until she get re-parked). It is in the city ordinances that you should not park in front of the mailbox (I'll refer to her as mailbox girl), and I asked her in our groupchat several time over the past months to not do that, to which I have been told \"sorry, I’ll repark\". Apart from that she also picked up a habit of blocking the driveway if she is stopping by the house for a short amount of time, meaning she is blocking the 1-3 cars that are parked in the driveway normally. The only way I can get around her if she is blocking the driveway is by driving through our neighbors driveway, which is rude and extremely annoying if I am in a hurry - besides, whenever that happens I have to do extra maneuvers to turn my car around to get out of my own house. I understand that I can just ask people to move cars, but sometimes they would fall asleep/go to the bathroom/shower, and I would have to wait for them to collect their things and actually leave.\n\nToday I woke up and not only the mailbox girl left for the weekend with her car parked in front of the mailbox with no note on when she's coming back, but the other roommate also did what she tends to do and blocked our driveway (I'm talking the entire driveway being inaccessible).\n\nI once again went on to the groupchat to complain about the parking, to which Mailbox girl told me \"my advice for you is just to park in the street if you are afraid of getting blocked\" - so by her logic, I should not have the opportunity to park in my own driveway because I could get illegally blocked. We got into a text message argument, because she justifies her actions by \"I park in front of the mailbox because my guests need to park here as well\" and \"we only block the driveway for a short time\", with me just trying to get through to her that there is just to places where you shouldn't park per ordinances, them being the front of the mailbox and blocking the driveway, and that it is not hard to just follow these two rules. Our neutral roommate just offered to meet up in the evening and figure out a parking scheme that would be convenient for everyone, but the mailbox girl just said \"well, the only person who has a problem with this is KuolemaLoki, so we will not be able to resolve this\".\n\nTo me, it's not as much a personal problem. It's just not right per both common sense and ordinances in place by our city to park like this, and since one other person in our house already thinks it's okay to block the driveway as well, soon everyone will just park however they want, and make it a problem to everyone.\n\nAITA for wanting my roommates to park in a manner that does not keep our mail or our vehicles hostage?

      "description": "Long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nThis post has been in preparation for a long time. I started to read this subreddit as a getaway since probably last october. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (22) was together with this girl, 23, for roughly 7 months, when our birth control failed. Well, I call it birth control, but she really is alternative and didnt want to take hormones in any way and since she was my first girlfriend and I was a complete doofus, I didnt use condoms. We used a diaphragm with a spermkilling gel. Anyway.\n\nIt failed and she got pregnant, which she did not notice until roughly the fourth month. There were a lot of unhappy circumstances coming together for this, I can explain if you need to know. When we found out I just started an internship away from my hometown, which would have been for 5 months. We were shocked, but decided that adoption was out of question, since both our families supported us 100%.\n\nDuring the next months we prepared and had some rough patches, but in August last year something big happened. She always had, very irregularily, seizures. This time however, i think we are at the 7,5 month threshold, she had 5 in less than 3 hours. And I could not stand it any longer, calling the ambulance, even though she explecitly told me that i should never do that, but I was scared not only for her, but also for our child.\n\nAfter she got to the hospital and needed more than one day to even form a normal sentence, she asked if I would do it again. I said yes, and would not even wait that long again, but would do it directly after the second one. Mind you, she did not have any emergency medication or anything, so I could not do shit on my own. She then said that SHE then has to look for another solution for the future, implying that I should never do that, when I was only ever scared for her and our baby.\n\nFast forward and I am miserable. I wake up and just let the days blend into each other, apatheticly. We then ended it near the end of August, when I told her, that I cannot just always give and give her, but never receive anything back. But I will be there for our child, I will care for here and pay child support as well as try to be a good father. For this it is important that we still have some contact that is not completely toxic. She took all this and decided not to talk with me any further and leave. I called my dad and he drove her to the train, where she told me, that she does not want any contact until we meet one week later, we had an appointment for our child. Then she left and blocked me on all social media.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso important, during the date of birth, I would be away for two weeks. She first was supportive for me, this changed to \"its your decision\" and then to \"I dont want you to go\". I still decided to do it, even my dad supported me in that. To this day I dont regret this decision.\n\nNow here comes the tricky part. Was I the asshole when I broke up?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGive me your judgement. I'm ready.",

To my surprise this dad responded by telling him that there was no way he was gay and that he “shouldn’t lie like that”. Then when the kid said he wasn’t lying, the dad told him that he wasn’t getting any food until he “changed his mind”. And he actually went though with it and didn’t buy him anything to eat!

With little to no knowledge about this, I went on the internet and consulted my two closest friends. Both of them have more experience with women and one of them is in a long distance relationship. They helped me break things down and realize I may have rushed into things too quickly and have no real plans on resolving the long distance part of the relationship. During the consultation, I told them about the std situation. I just realized now that I probably shouldn't have done that without permission as that was a private matter but I didn't do it with any malicious intent and to the best of my knowledge, they haven't told anyone. We also live in a different country. For what it's worth, the girl didn't say I couldn't tell anyone but obviously it was implied that I shouldn't go about making this public.

      "description": "I have trust issues with my mother. I don't normally consider myself a very private person, and am quite open with friends, but when it comes to family it's a different story. \n\nAlmost everything I say to my mother she repeats to her friends &amp; colleagues. Whenever she meets a GF she normally calls her the wrong name and usually manages to get a question in about when she can expect some grandkids. She is a bit hung up about always addressing a person by their name, and says it's a sign of respect. But then normally gets their names wrong. Very cringey for my GFs. I stopped introducing girls to her about 15 years ago.\n\nWhen my sister got pregnant she *begged* my mom to not say anything. The next day aunt's were phoning to congratulate her. Sis was very upset. Felt that my mom intentionally stole her good news and denied her the right to tell (or not tell) who she wanted. \n\nIt's got to the point where I basically just don't speak to my mother any more. She phones me every few weeks but I've not called her in about 3 years. When we do talk I'm always guarded and secretive and I hate that I feel this way. \n\nI'm often jealous of friends relationships with their parents, and whenever I'm at friends' houses I'm completely natural and open. Everyone gets on great and I'm not guarded or cagey at all. \n\nSo AITA for never calling and essentially cutting my mom out of my private life? \n\n",

      "description": "I have this long-time friend who became a mess (like hard drugs and stuff) so after High School, she decided to live off her parents and party rather than go to university or work. Three years later, she is now searching for universities because I guess she figured she couldn't do that her whole life. \n\nShe receives two offers from these \"pay to get in\" universities. She sends me their overview info and asks my opinion, which I'm more than happy to give. By the end, we settle on one university bu then, she starts asking me to look up details like important info, what classes to take, rent, etc.\n\nKeep in mind I'm a full-time student so I don't have that much free-time while she has all the time of the world and considers getting her nails done a \"busy day\". I'm more than happy to give her my input because I believe I can give insight as a student, but when it's something that I know about as much as her, I really don't see the point in wasting my time. So I tell her to Google it and she asks me to do it because I know better. How? How do I know better? How do I know the schedule of your obscure university that I had never heard about until an hour ago?\n\nSo she changes tone and tells me that real friends help their friends, and so I'm not a good friends. And I agree, real friends help friends but she has all the time in the world while I have to study. And frankly, asking me to spend hours doing research for her feels like she values my time less than hers. Again, this isn't a case of me knowing more or whatnot, it's a case of you do my work for me because that's what good friends do, and for me, it feels like \"your time isn't important\". \n\nSo I let her know that but she keeps telling me I'm a bad friend for not \"helping her\". I ask her if she is in contact with an advisor, and she was, so I got really upset. Not only are you wasting my time, but you're wasting my time when you could very well reach out to a professional paid to do exactly this! And yeah, I get quite frustrated and upset, especially since this has been going for a bit now. So I let her know to ask her advisor.\n\nAnd now she tells me she has anxiety, and I understand, I have anxiety too, so I tell her to email him (because that's what I do when I'm scared of calling someone. Also, it leaves a written note to reference to later), and apparently she's too anxious to do that, too.\n\nI snap \"If you're too anxious to send a damn email, then university isn't for you.\" And it just sort of stopped from there.",

In these, she abuses my mother (58) who is her primary and sole carer. Recently (the last few years as she has gotten older and my mother too has aged), she has become exceptionally violent when in these episodes. I've consistently told my mother that although my sister is disabled, she is aware enough of what she is doing when she is in these rage fits.\n\nThe evidence of that is that if my mother tries to walk off or protect herself, my sister will either follow her or start throwing things at her. Just now, she had one of these episodes and purposefully tried to gouge out my mother's eyes. There are scratch marks on her cheeks.\n\nI've been telling my mother for a while now that my sister is simply too dangerous for her to look after and after this I feel like just calling the police and asking what they can do, specifically if they can take her to a government facility for mum's protection.\n\nSo... am I the asshole in this situation?",

Class was minding their own business its towards the end of it and everyone's talking. I had my hand in my back pocket holding my pocket knife in case he would go for a cheap shot. I said \"I asked you nicely and you flashed that shit in my face.\" \"I dont care pussy\" he replied and walked away kinda pissed. I thought I was cool with this kid so I said, \"thanks for showing me your true self dick.\" And he came back I stared him down as I sat and said, \"lay a finger on me and I'll have my lawyers handle you.\" With the smuggest smile on my face. I dont know why I said that. Not to be a stereotype but I'm Jewish and have good lawyer relatives. \"Your lawyers wont protect you\" and walked away.\n\nAfter that happened I wondered why I said that and asked my group mate if I was in the wrong.

Since it's far away, I went their with my bike. My friends I worked with came by train.\n\nWe were going along a path in the park looking for a place to film, my friends walking and me driving slowly next to them. The path was like 5-6 meters wide. Since we were mostly alone, I didn't pay attention to leaving space for someone to pass me by very easily.\n\nAfter some time, a young lady on her bike comes behind us, looking to pass us. Being like five meters behind us, she rings her bell so we let her pass. (note: traffic laws here make it so that you are only allowed to pass people while driving to their left) At that point in time, I am quite far left, leaving a big gap in the middle. As the lady rings, I drive more to the right, because I don't exactly know where she is coming from and thus want to just obey the traffic laws. That is when I hear her moan because she wanted to pass us through the gap, but suddenly has to stop.\n\nI mean, traffic laws are for traffic, but they are the only laws that are reasonable to follow. My friends insist on me having acted wrong. And I still feel like I was right. Wouldn't they lady rather expect me to follow the laws when she rings? Why would she ring in the first place?",

In order to console me in the immediate aftermath of the breakup, Friend X lets it slip that there is someone in the school who likes me, but Friend X will not reveal who it is for privacy's sake, and expresses that he does not want me to look into the matter.  I'm obviously intrigued, but I give myself time to recover from the breakup, and respect Friend X's wishes.  A few weeks later, I bring up the subject again, looking to find a new relationship (the breakup was after a relatively short \\[although intense\\] relationship).  Friend X still will not give me any details, so I begin to investigate on my own as to the identity of the mystery person.  After a bit of deduction (I talked to one friend, but I mostly \"figured it out\" myself), I decide that the person is Friend Y, another friend of mine who I would be interested in dating.  I ask Friend X whether it is Friend Y, and Friend X gives me no information and asks that I \"act as if he never told me anything,\" which, to me, seems like a literally impossible task, especially given that I am somewhat interested in Friend Y.  In order to figure out whether or not it is truly friend Y, I ask Friend Z, who knows Friend Y.  Friend Z reveals to me that it is actually them, and feels irritated (though not too angry) at Friend X for partially leaking their secret.  Friend X is now upset with me, because he told me to act as if nothing had happened.  AITA for bringing the situation up with Friend Z?",

      "description": "Across the street from my house, there’s a small field with a walking trail running through it. There’s a few houses that have backyards the back up against the trail and the path is pretty well used. The middle house has a large German shepherd (nothing against german shepherds, they’re such sweethearts when trained) and they leave the dog outside for most of the afternoon and usually all night. The problem with this is that the dog is extremely territorial and every time someone uses the path or even the sidewalk that leads up to it, she barks and lunges at them. She’s kept in her yard by a tethered cable, but this just causes her to bark even more.\n\nI know it sounds so petty and stupid but I have had it with this dog. For over a year it has been barking at all hours. At first it wasn’t too big of an issue, but lately the owners are letting her bark nonstop at midnight and not doing anything about it until 3am. Even across the street, the barking is keeping me awake and frankly, I’m getting pretty sick of it.\n\nSo would I be the asshole if I tried to do something about this?",

      "description": "Hello again AITA, you guys have previously weighed in on the long running battle between me and my sister so I figured I'd turn to you again to see if I really messed up. I'm always on my family's bad side so I appreciated the neutral input last time.\n\nSomehow it's become a tradition in my family that one family member host a Friday night dinner once a month. Last night was my night. My oldest sister and I have not been speaking since our vacation (click on user name to see why if you're curious) and I was able to avoid her at the January and February dinner at other's houses. I really, really didn't want her in my apartment. So I decided since she hates spicy food and her kids are allegedly allergic to peanuts, I could side step the  issue and make this Thai peanut noodle dish that I love. I announced it well in advance in the group email what I was planning. \n\nWell since my sister is much more diabolical than I give her credit for, she had her husband drive the 2 hours to my place, feign that she didn't know I was making something that allowed her to say \"you know my family can't eat! Isn't the point of a family dinner so all the family can enjoy!\" While clutching her pearls (literally). Then my niece claimed she could feel the \"peanut residue in the air\" and it was affecting her ability to breathe. So my sister dramatically took her to the emergency room where all turned out to be fine.\n\nBut again, I lost. My sister played me like a fiddle and the entire family took her side. Dinner was ruined and I'm the bad guy. Again. I honestly just tried to side step the issue of having her around but making somthing she and her kids couldn't eat--and announcing it well in advance.\n\nMy family thinks I'm the asshole. Am I the asshole?",

They told her to get a piece of paperwork filled out by a doctor confirming or disproving her vision fail. She was able to immediately get seen by an eye doctor who stated there was nothing wrong with her eyes, although wife admits part of her vision is blurry and her other eye helps to compensate. She and I were both worried that this would lead to a series of surgeries again to correct her vision with possible time unable to drive. Crisis averted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI choose this moment again to bark up the same tree and tell her this is a good time to go see doctors to just get a baseline reading on where her numbers are at with a variety of health issues. She responds as she usually does, that the doctors won't tell her anything she doesn't already know (eat better, lose weight, your cholesterol is high, etc) but the action side of already \"knowing\" this information is lacking, IMO. She also has major foot pain issues due to constant dry cracked feet and all 10 toes have some degree of athletes foot. It's painful. and yet she's NEVER been to a podiatrist. Then she cries, as usual, because this wasn't how she expected to be spending her birthday, getting lectured on her health. (we went out over the weekend). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Wife has a mini health scare on her birthday, I use it as a chance to remind her to go see an actual doctor, and she cries, because it's her birthday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hello everyone. \nI’m (F, 21) currently having an argument with my boyfriend (M, 21) of over a year about how I am apparently unreasonable for wanting presents from him. It all started because he is refusing to replace the perfume he bought me (and then lost before he could give it to me) for my 21st birthday last March. \nHe originally said he’d replace it, but it’s been 11 months and he hasn’t. I asked if he’d buy another one for me on top of a birthday present for this year, and he seemed to find this unreasonable. \n\nWhat makes me even more annoyed, is that he told me today that he’s been paid and has a rather large sum in his bank account. He lives in his family home and pays £80($100USD) per month for board, so it’s not like he’s skint. \nI’m not asking for anything big- just the perfume (which cost like £50), and something else small on top- even cheap flowers or chocolates would do!! \n\nHe also didn’t get me anything for Valentine’s Day, until I begged him to buy some chocolates (coating £4). I paid for our meal and was happy to do so as we hadn’t done anything for our anniversary in November. I would’ve just loved a card with a heartfelt message, really. His excuse is that his handwriting is awful, and I told him that I don’t mind, and would be fine with him typing it if he was more comfortable with that! \nNope, nothing. \n\nSo yeah, that’s it. I know I sound materialistic as fuck, but I would just like a bit of effort? \nHe brought up the fact that he’d paid for many drinks when we’ve been out, and paid £50 for a train ticket to meet my family, but my response was that that’s what any normal couple would do. \n\nI honestly just don’t know anymore because apart from this, he’s usually a wonderful boyfriend and we have a (usually) great relationship.

      "description": "My boyfriend suggested I posted here about this. So uh, here it is.\n\nYesterday I got an email notification from Netflix stating that they were glad I was back, and a confirmation of a phone number change. I had only signed up for the 1 free month, and deactivated it after. I instantly knew something was up, especially because I had been sleeping the previous 14 hours. \n\nI got up almost immediately and logged into Netflix. I got the person's number and called it myself. A lady answered and immediately after she said \"hello\" I said \"Hi, can you explain why your number is now associated with my Netflix account?\" I heard her shuffle to hang up, and when I tried to call back, it went straight to voicemail. At this point, I figured there was no way this was some scammer putting in a fake number. I called Netflix, explained the situation, and they cancelled it and logged out my account on all devices. I changed my account password/phone number and they refunded my money.\n\nYou see, dear reader, if that was all, I wouldn't be posting here.\n\nSo I called again, and left an angry voicemail along the lines of \"nice try bitch.\" I proceeded to figure out everything about this man- his name, home address, and a confirmation of his phone number. I called from my bfs phone, and the lady picked up and didn't speak more English than \"hello?\" and \"what?\" After trying to interrogate her, a man with a very thick accent said \"Stop fuckin' callin' me.\" and hung up immediately. Alright, fine. I'll stop calling you.\n\nI proceeded to sign him up for as many wake up call sites as I could, with times ranging from 5 minutes away, to 4 in the morning. I sent his number to as many of my friends as possible, encouraging them all to call him. The final call by a friend was placed at midnight, in which he answered, \"What the FUCK do you want?\" I was finally satisfied... Or so I thought.\n\nI'm still filled with ideas on how to abuse this guy. Next time anyone asks for a phone number for ANYTHING, I'm putting his in. A friend suggested putting him on casual encounters on Craigslist, but I think that's illegal, so I'm not gonna do that. I have all his information I need to do literally anything. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation? Should I just let it go? Do you have any suggestions on how I can make this guys life even worse? Many thanks.",

      "description": "I posted this in r/offmychest and decided to post here as well.\n\nMy in laws are well off people. They both work, make $150K combined, mortgage has been paid off since 1994, no auto loans, credit card debt, etc. Just monthly bills.\n\nMy wife and I are doing somewhat average financially. We have a mortgage, student loan debt, CC debt. My wife's vehicle was on its last leg and our credit is decent so we were going to look a buying a used vehicle around $10K. My father in law offered to loan the money at 0% interest if we paid it off in three years. We found a car for $9K. That means $250/ per month for three years. Also, my wife was out of work for a short time and he offered to pay on one of our CC debts until she found employment. That total was around $400.\n\nWe were paying the note as promised on the 10th of every month. On the 1st, he would be texting me to remind me that the note was due in 10 days. Every month this happened. After a year of paying the note, I was involved in a head on collision with a company dump truck. I was in the right, had a broken arm and some neck and back pain. I ended up getting a settlement for $160K. I paid off all of my debts, except my mortgage, including what I owed my father in law.\n\nAfter paying all of my debts, we had around $75K left. My father in law texted my wife and said that \"it was a shame that we couldn't give them any money\" when they helped us out in our time of need. I, personally texted him back and said, \"if you need to borrow any money for whatever reason, I will loan it to you, just as you did for us.\" He never responded to my text.\n\nOur relationship now is civil. I keep the peace for my wife and children. I really have no desire to associate with them but do because of my family.",

We live on the main floor and they live in the basement. Our contracts are 1 year in length.   \nAround this time last year, they found out they were pregnant and when it came time to renew our contact both of us did. Now fast forward a few months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife and I are generally pretty quiet in the evening and maybe have guests over once a month. Never anything too crazy just playing cards or watching a movie and talking. They never stay later than 10:30 as my wife an I are not late night people and we are never super loud or have music playing. Just general conversational get together. Yeah, it can be louder when people laugh but that would be about it.   \nEver since they had their baby when we have people over we both get texts asking us to be quiet, that they can hear everything we are saying and we are being way too loud and their baby is trying to sleep. Keep in mind these texts come in around 8-8:30. My wife and I have ignored them every time as our life didn't change when they had a baby. We pay rent just along with them and they knew our habits for a whole year and still decided to keep their current living situation.   \n\n\nSo AITA? ",

      "description": "TL;DR at the end.\n\nSo it's Friday night. SO and I are playing video games when he gets a call at 9:30pm from a work friend who lives one street over, asking if we want to go over to his house to drink and hang out with some other friends.\n\nI'm really not in the mood to go over there. I take medication every night for nausea and it doubles as a sleeping pill. I'd already taken this medication, plus I'm in my pajamas, about ready for bed. I told him he should go without me and that i was going to bed instead.\n\nAs he's leaving, I tell him not to do anything with any girls. He has never done anything with another woman as long as he's been with me, so I have no reason to think that he would tonight. I was mostly joking, but I'm also feeling a little self conscious. I'm in my second trimester of pregnancy, so I've started to get a little bit of a bump, plus I'm not pooping regularly and I'm extra gassy today. I just feel really unattractive and my anxiety brain was telling me he might think this as well. He obviously didnt find my comment funny, however.\n\nCut to about 10 minutes after he left. I'm in bed, getting settled in, and I hear glass breaking. I automatically imagine someone watching my SO leave and, thinking the house is empty, break in through a window. I jump up to lock the bedroom door and immediately call my SO, asking if he was in the house because I heard glass shatter. He didnt even seem phased by this, from what I could tell. He tells me he'll walk back and for me to get his gun by our bed. \n\nWhile I'm waiting for him to get back, I start to realize a couple things. 1.) We have a dog who barks if he hears anything strange at night. He w as s suspiciously quiet. 2.) The shattering noise definitely wasnt loud enough to be something big, like a window breaking. I started to feel pretty stupid right as my husband walks into the apartment.\n\nHe clears the house and doesn't see anyone, so I go to check the living room. Yup. Our dog licked a bowl off the coffee table and it shattered. He *never* does this, but the table was pulled a little closer to the couch tonight, so I guess he took his chance.\n\nAs we're cleaning up the mess, my SO says \"there aren't even any girls there!\" I was sincerely confused by this, so he explains that the only women at the party are there with their husbands. The way he says all this to me, I can tell that he thinks I broke the bowl so that he would have to come home. I told him, \"I didnt do this so you would have to come back!\" But he just muttered something that didnt make sense and then left for the party again. Didnt seem like he was in a great mood.\n\nI do feel pretty stupid about not checking the house to actually see if someone was breaking in, but was I really being that big of an asshole to put him in a bad mood like this?\n\nTL;DR: SO went to a party while I stayed home and I told him not to do anything with any women there, even though i have no reason to say this. After he leaves, I think I hear someone breaking into the apartment, so I call him home to check. After finding out it was just our dog, he thinks I tricked him into coming home and leaves again in a bad mood.",

I've had matches where, in casual conversation, the number of women the man I've matched with has come up. In one particular case he had told me he'd slept with 80+ women in the space of 9 years. This made me incredibly uncomfortable and I said that I wouldn't like to go any further with this man but that I'd be open to staying friends because we have a lot in common otherwise. He went nuts and was saying my view was unfair and that I shouldn't be judging him based on his past and I was close-minded and an entitled bitch for rejecting him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA similar scenario happened more recently. Another match, he'd had a lot of hookups but had \"never kept count\". This has also made me uncomfortable and unwilling to take it further than a friendship, but I'm now scared of the fallout that could happen if I tell him the reason behind why I don't want to take things further.

      "description": "Some context: my older sister is almost 30, and I’m 24. We both used to live with my parents. Our parents don’t ask much, they don’t charge us for rent, but they do ask to to pick up bills here and there, clean the house for them, and run errands for them. It’s not unreasonable in the slightest, seeing as they don’t charge us for rent.\n\nHowever, I’m the only one who does any of that. I clean, I pay my share of the bills, and I run errands. My sister does not. If she’s asked to run an errand, she’ll go out to her friends houses before coming home without the errand being done. When it comes to chores, she sits around until I get fed up of waiting on her to do her share, and I end up doing it.\n\nShe has an overnight job. I get it. I do too. But if I can do chores and errands while juggling an overnight job and college classes, she can make time to help out too.\n\nLately, my parents have been cracking down on her laziness and not helping. At first, I thought they were being hyper critical and too harsh on her, but now I’m seeing where their frustration stems from. And I got fed up too.\n\nSo when my sister came to me, ranting about how unfair my parents were being, I told her unless she starts pulling her weight around here and stop acting like a victim when she’s rightfully criticized, then they have every right to be so called “unfair”.\n\nMy sister got upset with me, shouted at me, and practically ignored me until she moved out a week ago. She’s pretty much ghosted me and my family. Last I heard from her roommate, my sister has been having a hard time emotionally and mentally. \n\nAITA for this? Or AITA for believing that she brought this on herself and moping over it doesn’t change anything?",

      "description": "I had a major fight with a friend, because he was being dishonest and lying a lot to me. \nDespite the fact that I still believe I was right to confront him about the lying and deceiving, I realized I could’ve handled the situation better and that I fucked up. So I apologized multiple times but he said he is done with the friendship and that he doesn’t want to ever talk to me again (this was in October/November). \n\nHe was actually really important to me so I decided I’ll give him some time and try again. We met up a couple of weeks later and he totally shut me off and told me he is moving away in April so there’s no reason for him to talk to me again anyway. I was sad about his choice and tried to accept it.  The reason I tried so many times was because the things I said were really hurtful (despite being true), plus I know him very well, he usually needs time to calm down.  \n\nAround Christmas I saw that his favorite artist is going on tour and I managed to get two really great seats, the concert was sold out shortly after. So I wrote him a card of how much our friendship meant to me and told him maybe we can still work things out and that I wanted to take him to said concert.\n\nHe instantly forgave me and told me maybe we should have another talk after Christmas to work things out. Even tho it was kind of a surprise I was really happy that he forgave me and I looked forward to talking to him. \n\nWell, he never contacted me again, so I asked him in February if he still wanted to talk about things, but he made excuses and said he was super busy.\n\nAnyway, we met three days ago (after three months) and I realized that he doesn’t want to be friends again, he just wants to go to the concert and I’m pretty certain go NC after. He couldn’t care less about me or our friendship. \n\nSo I am thinking about not taking him and not telling him. Will I be the asshole if I do and if so, is it ok to be an asshole in my situation or what should I do?",

Well my friend and I planned this out a few months ago and recently just said screw it and decided to start it. Well our other friend overheard and asked to join and we had open arms because we love her. Let’s call the new person np. Well np tends not to be on her phone often so we can’t contact her like ever. Well it’s now spring break and we’ve decided to make the slime so then we can go to school the next week and get some money (we already had a few requests). But me and my friend tried contacting np over and over again but she never answered so she didn’t come and we made all the stuff without her. Now let’s make this clear, is expensive to start making slime, my friend had gotten basically all the supplies and I make the stuff but np doesn’t really have a purpose in it. During the sleepover my friend and I started talking and decided not to pay np her portion of what the slimes would cost because she wasn’t present and didn’t have any supplies to offer. Am I the asshole for not paying her in the thing we had planned together?",

      "description": "Our service club held a fundraiser one night where we rented out our university's bowling alley and charged a $15 fee to allow people to bowl for a few hours (we also provided snacks and refreshments). We were raising money to purchase wheelchairs for children in Tanzania who weren't able to afford a wheelchair. We called it \"Bowling for Wheelchairs\" (I know, we lack creativity). \n\nWhile I was in charge of admissions, two students arrived in wheelchairs (legit disabled, and members of the university wheelchair basketball team). They were like, \"Whoa bowling for wheelchairs? Cool! Does that mean we get to bowl for free tonight?\" I thought they were just joking so I laughed and explained our fundraiser and said the admission price was for a good cause. But they got kind of affronted and said, \"What, you're really going to make us pay?\" I was flabbergasted. I figured THEY of all people should understand how essential a wheelchair is to the independence they now enjoy and would want the same for these children. And I know we're all broke college students but $15 ain't going to break the bank.\n\nI was just about to reiterate what a good cause it was when my club president and two of my fellow event organizers walked by and the wheelchair guys asked them if they could come bowl for free. My president shrugged and said sure and let them in. He has final say obviously, so I kept quiet. But as soon as they were out of earshot I turned and asked my fellow organizers if they didn't think it was ridiculous that these guys didn't want to donate and they all just shrugged and said it's fine and that it might look good to have some people in wheelchairs at the event. \n\nI let it go but I'm still so mad about it and shocked that I was the only person who objected at all and it made me feel like I was being unreasonable or being an ass. Was I??? Those guys never donated by the way. -_-",

      "description": "I [22M] used to work at Target a few months back and had a male coworker who was about mid 20s. We weren’t exactly friends but we talked sometimes and we were cool. As someone who has Asperger’s and struggles with communication and have doubts about working with people, I asked him if I was awkward, and he said no. I guess that showed I trusted him and he wanted to talk more. Soon, it was common for him to text me during our shifts about whatever and even offered to “Netflix and Chill.” Being surprised but kind of finding it funny, I jokingly called him out on the obvious hint and said if he ever wants to hang out, let me know (probably a big mistake).\n\nHe continues to text me for a couple of days and I continue to be friendly. However, it started getting awkward with the homoerotic but not sexual gifs, I’m not exactly mad or freaked out but I started giving excuses for not being able to text anymore. \n\nA day later, I tell my mom about it to get some advice and she was weirded out about it, she’s just that protective. With great damn timing, he texts me right in the middle of the conversation. Wanting to weasel my way out of it for the time being, I got my mom to text him that I was out with my brother and I forgot my phone, using my phone, giving me plausible deniability. He replied “ah.”\n\nDuring my day off, I go to pick some things up and I see him going into the store. I talk to him to again be friendly and while he didn’t seem mad, he ended the conversation abruptly. On my next shift, we small talked but walked away in a hurry, it’s important to note when this kicked off, I was greeted with a hug. It was clear at this point, he was probably upset. I felt bad and tried to get some advice, but I got nothing useful. \n\nEventually, I left Target and while I do still shop there, I kind of sneak around Metal Gear Solid style while feeling a mix of guilt and awkwardness hoping I don’t run into him.",

      "description": "      So some back story. I met my best friend my sophomore year of high school in the girls locker room. I had BRIGHT pink hair at the time and her favorite color was pink. So is was instant best friends from there on out. And were inseparable.\n     Fast forward 7 years, we have both graduated and have jobs. And still see each other almost every day. \n     I had just gotten relationship and had being living together for a few months. My SO, BF, and I hung out daily. And we finally talked about her moving in. We heavily talked about house rules and chores and rent. We all seems to be in agreement.\n     She agreed to $400/m in rent, cleaning up after herself, no people in the house without one of us being home, and cleaning her cat litter box. \n     She moved in and all was well...... For a short time....\n     Our house was happy and peaceful for the first 2 months. We went shopping together, went to dinners, and just generally had fun together. \n     Around month 3, she had gotten an army boyfriend and she started coming home at all hours of the night. She even tried to sneak him in our house when she thought we were sleeping.  \n     Slowly she started staying home less and less. She only came home to change and eat food. The dishes in her room started to pile up with half eaten food in them. They were my brand new dishes. If she cooked food in the kitchen, all the dishes sat in the sink until my SO would clean them. She never once lift a finger to help us clean the house. \n     The litter box in her room started making the entire upstair smell putrid. I would gag walking by her room. Her poor cat was locked in her room with no food or water and was shitting wherever he wanted because the litter box was overflowing. \n     Since she was never home, I left I noted on her door telling her she needed clean her room and take care of her cat and stop treating our house like a storage unit. That it was extremely disrespectful to my SO who let her move into his house after I have to spend a month begging him to let her move it.\n     Her rent was due 2 weeks after I wrote her the note.\n     She left and didn't clean anything I was furious! My SO and I both agreed to give her the legal 30day eviction notice. \n     She didn't pay rent and refused to pay so her 30days became a 3day notice to move out. \n      I haven't spoken to her since. Am I the asshole for being too harsh? I miss her at times and want to reach out but then I think about what she did to myself, my SO and how to almost starved her cat to death, I get so mad. \n  *I didn't let her cat starve, I would give him food, water and let him out of her garbage landfill of a room\n\n",

He went from kind to this bigoted monstrosity of a human being. the final straw happened two years ago when he told my brother he should go kill himself for dating an immigrant and when I confronted him about his behavior he full on hit me.  I called the cops and he screamed and broke stuff.  Take that as the basis for the rest of the divorce.  Anyways, turns out William had some kind of brain lesion that no one knew about until it killed him a few months after everything was finalized.  His brother told me about it and tried to say that maybe the lesion was the reason my ex acted the way he did.  He wants me to come to the funeral, and I really, really don't want to.  A few friend are telling me I am an asshole for not going.  They keep saying 10 years of marriage should count for something.  That his family is my family too.  I am honestly torn.  Am I the asshole for not wanting anything to do with Williams family now?  Is it really that bad to just want to be DONE with it? ",

      "description": "I just graduated college in May so I’m a brand new 22 year old teacher. My school is urban and very small- there are 60 kids and 10 teachers. I’m the only English teacher. I’m very sarcastic and make a lot of jokes. However, there are certain things I don’t joke about. We do not make jokes about race, gender, gender orientation, etc. My school is all black so they understand the equality for race, however, most the kids (and a number of staff members) still think less of women, gay people, trans, etc. There are a few other teachers new to the school, but they’ve been in teaching for years now. \n\nAnyway, there have been a few times where the staff who have been there prior to this year complain how they miss their old math teacher. Apparently, he was fired for a student accusing him of inappropriate acts, which has actually been a problem in our school district. I just minded my own business for awhile because he doesn’t work here anymore. I never met the man and I don’t know anything about him. \n\nRecently while talking about him they all started saying how there is no way he could do that. I sat there for a little, but eventually I had to say something. In essence I said, “I get he’s your friend, but you can’t assume he’s innocent. That’s kind of how these things start. The only people who know what really happened are him and the student. You can’t disregard the accusation because he’s your friend.” One guy responded saying I have negative thinking. Another staff member responded saying if I knew the student I would get it because apparently the student had some problems at home and possibly mentally. To this i responded, “well to me, it sounds like he could’ve found a vulnerable student who you guys would discredit.” \n\nThere were a few teachers who were like “we think he didn’t do it, but you’re right.” Others think I’m just super negative and rude and assume the worst of people. Obviously I’m a young female (and am a pretty strong, independent young woman) so one accused me of being ultra feminist. \n\nSo, honest people of Reddit, AITA?",

There is a ton of food at the party, but I have allergies, and chose to bring my own food, to avoid any cross contamination. One of the things I brought for myself was a bowl of chili, everyone else was eating pizza. The pregnant woman knows I have allergies. When I heated up and began eating my chili, she started making pointed comments about how good it smelled and how “the baby” wanted it. I mostly ignored her, as there was no way I’m giving her my food, when I can’t eat anything else. She continued making comments, finally involving her husband, having him take me aside and ask if she could just have a little bit, since it smelled so good to her. She involved her husband to ask me, as well as publicly making a fuss about how I wasn’t sharing, despite me explaining the situation.  \nMy gut says I’m NTA, but I’ve also never been pregnant, so I’m not sure how intense the cravings can really be.

Nothing overtly sexual and I didn't give the pictures any thought after liking (because I liked the picture as a whole) and scrolling past. Both of those pictures are mainly focused on the cars imo.\n\nYesterday, my girlfriend sent me Screenshots of the two posts with the \"Merkel4Lyfe likes this\" at the bottom. She said that she doesn't want to see that from her boyfriend, that it's to be expected of me to think about what I like and that she has noticed this before and hasn't said anything earlier.\n\nAITA for liking an Instagram post without calculating all possible outcomes that double tap could have? \n",

      "description": "So this has been brewing in my head for a week or so and on &amp; off for a while in general. The thoughts all started when I brought up having a will and she said she would immediately take the pets and go back to Germany if I died tomorrow. I'm from a major city in America and she's from a major city in Germany. \n\nEvery time anything doesn't go her way or people are a special kind of asshole she goes down the road of \"this country *such n such*\" and \"in Germany this would be different\" which kind of hurts because, ya know, this is my country. She talks to her family back home just about every day (which is fine) so it's not like she has a bad relationship with them. She tends to look forward to seeing them more than anything else we do all year. I understand it since I would be homesick too. It's natural, right? We do have pretty good communication. She is 100%fluent in English. \n\nThere have been the tirades of \"I didn't plan on staying here\" and \"I'm only here because you're here.\" I've told her on numerous occasions that she makes me feel a ton of pressure when she says that. She even says \"I know I'm not being forced to stay here\" and I get a chin hair away from saying \"then fucking go already\" but I wouldn't do that because I love her and that's a true dick head thing to say.\n\nToday was the day where I found the correct words to not sound like an attack (IMHO). I said \"what can we do to help you feel better about being here?\" and \"How does it sound to have kids and for 10 years you're saying to them 'yaaayy we're moving to Germany in X amount of years!' while we wait for my retirement even though we don't know what our lives will be 15 years from now\" with the conversation continuing along the lines of let's get you invested in being here. You hate your lack of vacations and my health insurance? Maybe start looking in to better jobs (I'm a government employee). I also said \"I know you got excited when I said 'I could see retiring in Germany' on our trip but we can't go the next 15+ years waiting for that when we're supposed to be starting our own family since we said our vows.\"\n\nHer short and general response is she knows and she feels she needs green card stuff to work out before going for a search for passions and career stuff but I softly called bullshit because nothing distracts from stress like new stress or trying new things. So for the next 4 hours we silently are dinner and watched TV while she practically forgot I was there while focusing emotions towards the pets. Damn near went to sleep without saying a word. I asked what's up with all that and she said \"I'm just in my thoughts\" (bit my tongue to stop from saying \"no shit, Sherlock\").\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR - wife of two years seems to be holding out for us to move to Germany when I retire in 15+ years and I finally give a push for her to invest some effort in enjoying life here which has resulted in silence and being ignored for the rest of the night.

      "description": "So my mom and I have been living in a 1 bdrm for some years. I turn 17 in a few months. My mom first couldn’t afford to get a second bed when we first moved but i was young (9) so it didn’t matter. Once I turned maybe 13-14 I started to speak up at how most kids my age at least sleeps in their own bed.\n\nLet me clarify we are in no way, shape, or form broke. My mom earns a decent amount of money every week. Each time she has an excuse as to why she can’t get a bed for me. I know I might sound ungrateful but there’s many reasons why I NEED my own bed at least. \n\nFor one she snores, so there’s nights i’m up til 4 am tossing and turning. 2, she likes to cuddle me and I do not like that. I’ve told her maybe a 10-15 minutes is fine but not no 2-3 hours. She’ll get angry at me and call me selfish for not wanting to hug/cuddle her. \n\nWe’ve got a futon couch in the living room. But i can’t sleep there because she says it’ll ruin it... even though it’s made for sleeping. There’s been nights that I slept on the floor in order to get a good nights rest. \n\nI don’t want to make it seem like I hate her with every bone in me because i don’t. I just hate her for making me share a bed with her for almost 10 years. She even brags about it to others like it’s something to be proud of. “Well MY daughter and I still sleep together” it’s quite embarrassing. \n\n",

      "description": "So I go to college in the South and I live in our university’s apartments. At the beginning of this semester this new girl, we’ll call her G, moved in above me during the early days of January and made SO much noise.The walls are incredibly thin, so if someone talks loud you can hear them, if they walk loud you can hear, etc. Once I realized what was going on I gave it a few days to die down on its own. My thought was, “well, she’s just moving in and is moving stuff to get settled. I probably did the same thing.” Unfortunately, things did not calm down…things got worse.\n\nTurns out, G is not a very quiet person. When she walks, her heels dig into the floor. I can hear every conversation she has with her friends on the phone, her bf, etc. she has very loud sex and is quite vocal. Her music is turned up so loud my ceiling fan shakes. She got a pet (no animals allowed), and the poor thing sits there and cries for her whenever she goes out, regardless of if her bf is there or not. The bf also shouts at it..I feel bad for the poor thing being stuck there all day with the bf. The dude never leaves the apartment. The apartment complex has a strict policy about only the tenant living in the rooms and no one else, so technically he’s not allowed to be there. I wouldn’t care, except when he walks he also slams his heels into the ground, only louder.\n\nBetween the two of them, I wake up EVERY single night between 11-3:30. They’re so loud I can’t go back to sleep until they do, so I’m averaging 4-5 hours of sleep per day. Whenever I’m home, they’re home. The girl is a public relations major but I don’t know how she is still enrolled in classes because she never goes. She sits at home all day and rarely leaves, unless she’s going out to party at night. I can’t nap because the noise literally never stops. 2 weeks in to her living there, I went up to introduce myself. I explained that I lived below her, the walls are thin, etc. and to please keep it down. She just looked at me,  said okay, and closed the door. This was 8 weeks ago. I’ve been to the manager’s office with evidence. They gave her a verbal warning, but I know they’re not going to do anything else because they don’t want to lose the money they make from the rent every month. \n\nIt’s midnight and she has her friends over and at the moment they’re singing/screaming what I think is Ed  Sheeran. \n\nI’ve run out of options, she won’t open the door when I knock on it. I want to call campus police and submit a noise complaint but at the same time I feel bad doing it....but I need to sleep.",

      "description": "M(24)Don't like talking about this, so I guess this is the reason for a throwaway.\n\nIt's been more than 6 years since then, but this still bothers me a lot. We were a prefect family, me and my sister both top of our classes, I went to elite high school and was doing great, never in my life any problems etc. Then I got into gaming and became really good. So good in fact, that before I even turned 18 I managed to earn twice the minimum monthly wage of my country by playing, once I earned minimum wage in less than 3 days of playing. To maintain my form I had to play a lot and stay focused, which resulted into my high school performance becoming more average. I was still very social, but really spent most of my free time behind the computer. Needless to say this irritated my parents a lot. Combine that with father's distaste for computers(even today he still has no smartphone) and relations became tense. While I had to stay focused and calm, parents came to my room and insulted me, disturbed, sometimes even cut off power.. But as I was being paid for winning every such action actually resulted into me having to play more. Was even at school counselor who asked my family to give me a break, after all I was outspoken and underage kid with such income is rare.\n\nBut situation at home deteriorated. We fought, while I still loved my father it meant that his actions hurt me that much more. Now the moment that makes me wonder if I'm an asshole.. In one specifically heated argument later in the evening, which of course started while I was still playing power was cut off and I was told few defamatory things, combined with the knowledge I'd have to make up for this intrusion the next day, and the fact I was told that I should stare in the ceiling instead of this pointless sh-t this enraged me. I am super calm person, but that day I exploded. I demanded a break and an apology and threatened to stop doing all my school work, something parents were very proud of, felt like there's nothing else I could do. I swear that when I was ignored, I felt something shift in my brain and since then I am very apathetic. I finished high school without ever studying and skipping most of classes(was actually ill and had some surgery, which also made me quit \"pro' gaming), but with exception of final country wide exam, most grades were bad. Sadly this attitude didn't help me with university so for a while now, so I'm just changing them every year, as I am not allowed to exams for my low attendance. Sometimes I regret it when exams are near, but never in time to actually do something about it. My parents actually supported me for the most of the time there.\n\nAnd after all this time, I still blame my father for that. We don't talk much, but every few months when we argue about my performance I don't even say sorry for being a terrible son these last few years, I just demand an apology for his \"ruthless\" behavior. Still didn't get one.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My girlfriend is going through some fairly erratic emotions in the last few weeks and so sometimes she is really happy and good to chat to and then, almost like a switch has been flicked, she changes to being upset or annoyed. \n\nEarlier my girlfriend asked me in a very confident manner If she could have a selfie from me, I would be happy to oblige but I decided If I'm sending one I'd also like one myself. Therefore I simply asked if I could get one and received the answer 'nope' which to me sounded pretty certain of her decision, I then tried to persist ever so slightly (message:  😇 Plz)  but I get a small list of why I can't get a selfie from her which are about her insecurities and her being exhausted from earlier in the day. She said it may be unfair \\[on me\\] if she asks for a photo when she didn't intend on sending one herself.\n\nVery rarely will I not send a photo, admittedly sometimes I might ask for a pic as well and a considerable amount of the time I don't even need to ask and she sends a beautiful picture!\n\nI then tried to move the conversation away as to not make it awkward but receive a text swiftly saying goodnight. I doubt there is going to be any issue and I do realize this is a incredibly petty post but I'm still curious, AITA for agreeing that it's unfair for her to ask and not oblige to do the same given her insecurities?",

      "description": "So, I should probably put the title into context here...\n\nMy boyfriend of 3 years is well aware that I'm highly allergic to weed. As in, can't stop coughing up a lung with body wracking coughs long enough to catch a breath, both types of asthma constriction kick in, and mucus glands kick into high gear, filling my lungs with fluid. It's an understatement to say that this is not fun, and something I desperately try to avoid.\n\nBoyfriend's closest friends tend to like the ganja when we have a gathering, and also know I'm highly allergic. They have watched me go through this more than once, watched my lips turn blue and debated on if an ambulance needed to be called (I always resist an ambulance call because there's literally nothing they can do besides give me pure O2 and rush me to an ER, where again, not much can be done that I'm already trying to do on my own with inhalers, caffeine, make-shift humidifiers, and an EpiPen in case shit gets that sideways), and yet they still smoke up in the same building as me, and just hope it doesn't carry to where I'm at. They regularly don't even take the effort to open a window or go outside. \n\nBoyfriend also likes the ganja on occasion, and usually tries to partake in ways that the smoke won't find it's way to me, though he has in the past partaken inside our apartment in his bathroom either when I was asleep, or at work, and felt this was not an issue because it was contained to his bathroom (which has the A/C control over his tub) and should dissapate before I'd come in contact with it.\n\nRecently we all met up for a celebration for my boyfriend, and again they broke out the green, went to a back room,  and hot boxed it. I started to notice a small amount of the smell, and asked the host if we could do anything to keep the smoke to the back room, so the front door was opened. Then the partakers came back into the living room, with a cloud of smoke billowing with them, and immediately setting off my allergy. I barely saw the look of horror on my boyfriend's face as I dashed out the front door to collapse in a coughing/wheezing heap out front.\n\nOnly my boyfriend came out to check on me. Everyone else continued laughing and partying inside while I sat outside fighting to breathe. When I finally could stop coughing and the wheezing minimized enough that I could catch a semi decent breath, I went back inside and collapsed on the couch from adrenaline rush and inhaled steroid shakes. No one said a damn thing to me or even asked if I was ok. The party just kept going.\n\nOn the way home, I asked my boyfriend to relay to his friends that it's not ok to smoke inside anymore if I'm going to be there, and preferably only partake through edibles or something else that is much less likely to set off my allergy, and he looked horrified that I'd ask that. I really want to ask him to stop hanging out with them because obviously they neither care about me or respect the fact that my desire to keep breathing trumps their desire to enhance their party night. FYI, we are not in a green legal state.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This happened awhile ago and my friends think I'm petty for disowning him, but awhile back me and 3 friends were going to a concert to see an artist that we like. We all buy tickets at the same time and the concert is in 5 months. Fast forward 4 and a half months later , one of my friends (michael) gets a girlfriend (sally). Coincidentally sally also likes this artist that we're going to see and had already bought a balcony ticket, but the four of us had bought floor tickets. Michael and sally quickly became the insufferable kind of couple that sits on the same side of the table at restaurants and wear matching sweaters, so naturally they really wanted to watch the show together. Turns out that William (another friend in our group) says that he found a new job and had to go on a business trip on the date of the concert so he couldn't make it and offers to give away his ticket to sally, and sally was gonna give the ticket away on twitter. The day of the concert I ask william if he remembered to let sally have his ticket and he said that he did. We all have a good time at the show but a few days later I was third wheeling michael and sally and he offhandedly mentions that he bought sally's ticket from William. Both Sally and Michael don't think its a big deal but it makes me upsets me because william made it seems like he gave it to them, but instead he sold it them after he had told me AND michael that he would just give it to sally. I'm not upset that he sold the ticket, I'm upset that he SAID to me and michael that he would just give it to sally, and then later on changed his mind AND lied to me about giving away the ticket after he had sold it to Michael. I brought it up to William once but he blew me off and told me I was overreacting, and I haven't talked to him since. Am I being an overreacting asshole!?  \n\n\nTLDR: Friend **W** said he would give Friend **M**'s gf a free concert ticket since she had the wrong one. When i asked said friend **W** if he gave it away he said he did but I later found out that he (**W)** sold it to **M!** When I confronted **W** about it he blew me off and told me I was being ridiculous. AITA for no longer wanting to be friends with this guy.",

      "title": "AITA for not supporting my sister's efforts to emigrate to Canada from &lt;third world african country&gt;",
      "description": "Background: My sis is married with two kids - four and six years old. She's 33, eleven years older than me, and is the first of four kids while I'm the last. I recently moved to the US from the same TWAC (third-world african country) for work, and I'm earning earning relatively well, and am able to support family back home now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's not in a good position financially, as things are worse than they used to be in Nigeria. She graduated ages ago, but her degree is pretty much of no use, so she's been running a business which right now, is producing nothing. Her husband is also self-employed, but times aren't so good either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver a year ago, she got this idea to attempt to emigrate to Canada for a better life, and started trying to go through the permanent residency process. She has no roots in the country, and no plans on how to survive, however. She's the optimistic type. Due to her lack of credentials and age and whatever, she pretty much didn't have enough \"points\" (there's some sort of points system, I think) and would need to do a bunch of stuff to get more points (take exams, learn a language, etc). I've been happy to help out financially when it comes to whatever expenses were involved in doing all that stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, she's become more and more desperate, pretty much abandoning any effort to improve her immediate environment. She even considered getting to Canada illegally, and when we dissuaded her from that plan, got involved in a shady scheme to obtain masters degree certification. It even caused friction between her and her husband (who was being dragged along in the process) - he felt like she was so focused on the emigration thing and didn't mind abandoning him (she literally said that, albeit tongue-in-cheek), and made him feel unimportant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's my standpoint on why I don't support her efforts:\n\n* The kids: This is one of the most important periods of their lives - their formative years - and I don't think it's responsible to gamble with the stability they need in their lives right now.\n* The odds of even getting the visa are low.\n* What if she gets trafficked? Trafficking is a real problem here.\n* She has no roots in the country. No skills. No plans. What's the plan to survive? There's so much she hasn't educated herself about and is so focused on \"we'll work hard and survive, let's get there first\".\n\nI keep asking her what her motivation is, and all she has to offer is that \"Things are bad here and I don't want to raise my kids here\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo recently, she sought my financial help to take french classes for six months (also with some shady guy), so I had a serious conversation with her and made it clear that I don't support what she's doing and I feel that crazy amount of dedication would actually get her somewhere if she sunk those efforts into thriving back home. I still offered the funds for the french school, but tried to make it clear to her that I'm not behind what she's doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt didn't quite end on a good note, with her in tears and quite defensive of her efforts, and she even sent the money back and said she'll do it on her own. I'm worried I didn't handle it well...",

      "description": "This issue has divided my family and has just become urgent as I heard the guy is ring shopping.\n\nMy sister started dating this guy she met at a strip club. In my mind, he was just some new dude until my mom commented on how serious they seemed and her concern with how he makes money.\n\nMet him at my mom’s and... weird impression right away. Doesn’t make eye contact, drops your hand during handshake, grumbles instead of conversing. Gives off an arrogant thug vibe.\n\nMom and sis both ask what I thought and I said he made it hard to know but I didn’t like the first impression. My husband had stronger opinions. \n\nI’m pregnant at the time and they also move in together. So my sister starts becoming very insistent that we get to know him and asks to bring him over so the guys can “bond” over football. I refused over and over, knowing my husband, but once my child was born I felt obligated to say yes since he was supposedly excited to see the baby. Instead, he sits on the edge of the couch, eating the food they brought, not talking to us. He even left trash on the floor.\n\nWe were both so disgusted but the holidays were coming up and so we decided to be “extra nice” to him at the family gathering as an experiment. This time, my cousins noticed his weird behavior and decided he wasn’t welcome at their upcoming family party. My mom talks me through the conversation she’s going to have with him, but it never happens. \n\nI planned to talk to her next time we’re alone. She doesn’t drive and would take Ubers everywhere until this guy started driving her. So she’d be out “running errands” with him until 11pm and then ask to come see the baby and throw a fit when I refused, saying “he’ll only come in for a minute.” \n\nIt all blew up when I asked her to take an Uber and come spend time us. My best friend was over and we could have girls night. She waited until she was walking up to my door to text me that she brought her boyfriend, saying they won’t stay long. I told her no, forget it, I wanted to see my sister alone. Stay and I’ll take you home. \n\nShe then told me if I couldn’t accept who she was spending her life with, that I had no place in it. \n\nMy mother didn’t talk to me for three days, then told me it was my responsibility to fix my relationship with my sister. That they’re going to get married and have kids and it’ll be my fault if my kid grows up without an aunt. That my sister and I didn’t have a great relationship growing up and now I’ve ruined our progress. That the guy didn’t do anything bad enough to warrant being banned from my house, and I hurt his feelings. That he treats her so amazing and she’s finally happy, and now I’ve ruined that too. That she is so excited to finally be an aunt. She really made me feel like shit. Meanwhile, their pictures on social media make it seem like they’re having a great time.\n\nAfter months of radio silence, I’m feeling like I might be the asshole. \n\nAm I?\n",

I feel as though this is completely uncalled for, as it has been a year and that message did nothing but drive my dad away from my brother even more. Their relationship has been strained, but my dad has been working to maintain some contact. He did something despicable but she was making him feel bad for no reason other than she wanted to hurt him. I feel like I should talk to her and tell her to stay out of it, and leave him alone because it’s not her place to make him feel bad, but I don’t want to ruin my real with my brother.\n\nTL;DR: my brothers girlfriend chewed my dad out for leaving my mom a long time after it happened and I want to tell her to mind her business.",

      "description": "Our 1 year old relationship has a lot more going on that I won’t post here, but the gist of it is: my gf comes from a less financially capable family than mine, so she has to work and study. She can also be very childish, probably my fault as the result of coming to see her everyday and buying her almost everything she asks me to buy, from food to make up and so on. Recently, she has the idea to go to Spain on an academic exchange for which she needs to pay for the plane ticket.\nShe recently got into a job that pay really well, like she earns about 5 times as much as I do (which is not much, but still) and that is good enough to pay for her plane ticket and more. It is also very far away from her house. Furthermore, this and the next week she’s doing the night shift, so her shift begins at 10pm and ends at 6am.\nLike in past jobs, she’s asking me to drive her they there, which I agree to do because it’s late and I don’t want her to go by herself on the bus. Also, her pay is so good that she has agreed to pay me back some of the gas. However, since at work in the morning, I can’t pick her up on weekdays.\nThese last two nights, I’ve had trouble sleeping, and I have chess club on Saturdays at 9am, so I would like to have some sleep tonight. However, a few minutes ago she asked me to pick her up tomorrow at 6am because I don’t work on Saturday and can do it. I resisted, didn’t even get to say no outright or give my reasons, and she got furious. She wouldn’t talk to me at first, then she stormed off the room, and now is back and putting her make up on, saying that I should go and that she doesn’t want me to take her tonight.\nI think it’s perfectly reasonable for me to refuse to pick her up so early on a Saturday, especially since I’m low on money, low on gas, she gets paid in 10 days (which means another full week of taking her to work at night), and it will probably make me lose chessclub. She told me she was willing to sleep in the car if I picked her up and then drove to the club, but for her safety I said that it wouldn’t work. She’s acting like it’s my obligation to take her to work. I feel like a lot of times she doesn’t even consider what I want or need. This is just one of many times she’s done something like this.\n\nI’m trying to talk to her but she still won’t talk to me back. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half. I'm 26 and work full-time from home, and she is finishing her final semester of university. We live less than a mile away at the moment, and we go to each others places typically 5 or 6 nights per week. I really need the 1-2 nights per week to myself to recharge, but usually whenever I suggest we spend a night apart I'll get a text from her at 7pm saying the neighbors are being loud or something. I usually give in.\n\nRecently we've been getting into arguments about living together. I feel like it is too soon in the relationship. The fact that she pushes me to spend every night together makes me feel like she won't respect the fact that I need some alone time when we live together. This would also impact my career: because I work from home, it's important that I'm alone during the day, but I just don't see how this would work logistically, because she works nights. I'm looking into getting an office, but I don't have that worked out yet.\n\nI told her that I thought it was too soon to move in together and she got upset. She said I'm not supporting her, and that she would do the same for me. She doesn't make good money right now because she is a student, so she can't afford a great place on her own. I live in a rather luxury studio that costs around $1400 / month total. I explained that she would be expected to pay half of the rent (700) if she moved in, which she was fine with. But when I asked her if she would consider getting her own apartment for 6 months, she refused saying that she could not get anything close to 700/mo. Currently she is paying 600, so this is pure BS. She wants to move out of her current place because she apparently has allergies to mold in the building (yet refuses to take allergy pills). She's been pinning this whole thing on me like I'm not supporting her, which is not true — I'm willing to help her move, find a new place, roommates, etc., but she doesn't see it that way. And on the topic of roommates: she absolutely refuses to have them. She doesn't have friends that need roommates, but she won't consider finding a student or young professional to live with. I think this is absurd, and seems very privileged to me. **The icing on the cake was when she suggested she could move in with her ex as a last resort.** They are still friends, which I am fine with, but they don't ever meet up in person. The fact that she even threw this out there as a realistic option blew my mind. She acted offended when I told her I felt she was manipulating me. IMO if she did even talk to her ex about this, it would be the end of our relationship. I don't know in what world she would consider this over living with random roommates. It's like she's giving me an ultimatum, either move in together, or our relationship is done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being skeptical about her pressuring me, and for telling her that it's too soon to move in together?",

      "description": "I recently left my first relationship with a trans male. We're both in high school and we have a class together. I broke up with him cause I don't like guys saw that he frequently whined about going nowhere in life and hating himself over it, but doing nothing about it. I try to make him feel better and tell him he needs to own up to his responsibility in a nice way, he does that for a few days, repeat\n\nToday in class I was working and I let him use my pencil so he can work, only taking back when I needed to draw out some lines. He gave my pencil back when he was done and then kept trying to take it from me despite saying no. He tried grabbing and I shooed him off\n\nM: You need to know when to stop and to grow up\n\nH: ?\n\nM: When I asked you to stop grabbing for my pencil. You didn't know when to stop and you were being a child about it\n\nH: I'm sorry, I was just joking around. I thought we were goofing off and having fun. Once I knew that you were serious, I stopped. I kept on goofing off, but I stopped grabbing for your pencil\n\nM: Well you gotta learn when people are serious. You took too long\n\nH: At least I stopped, would you rather I had kept going\n\nM: No, I'm glad you stopped. But you still need to learn when people are serious\n\nH: Maybe I was just trying to have fun with you? Like I haven't been able to for weeks now. Do you have any idea how many times I've fallen apart because if I hadn't told you how I felt you would still love me? You would still do stuff with me? You say we're still friends but it doesn't feel like it and I'm trying my best but it's not working and it never will. I'm sorry that I'm a royal fuck up and all I do is ruin everything I'm a apart of. I don't care if I'm wrong at this point. I don't care if blowing up is wrong, but I have wanted to do this for so long that I don't care. I've been tearing myself apart cause everyone I've ever loved is leaving and I'm stuck in the hole I dug. I don't care anymore. I hate myself more than I ever have in the past year. This is probably going to ruin everything between us, but let's face it. We never had a chance. I was eventually going to fuck up one way or another. I'm so fucking sorry that I'm the biggest fuck up on earth and that I fucked up everything we had\n\nM: You're not a fuck up. You just need to mature a bit. You may have dug a hole, but whining won't help. I'm sorry I didn't realize that me not doing much hurts you. Don't torture yourself over your decision. I'm not into guys. \"I'm alone and a fuck up,\" I've been there. But I realized I wasn't living up to my potential, and I was dissapointed. That game you wanna play, it can wait. Your grades, your life, they won't. I don't wanna date a kid. Choir, chem, and Alg 2 were some of the best classes I took cause I learned something. Choir: it doesn't matter your situation. If you have a responsibility, own up to it. Chem: nobody knows what they're doing. Alg 2: keep at it\n\nI feel I was too harsh. AITA?",

      "description": "So a friend of mine (18) who absolutely loves k-pop idols, asked me to tell me which idol i ship her the least with (which i did with the reason 'he kinda ugly'). This resulted in her consulting me about how mean i am to this 'poor teddy' and he gets all the hate and she didn't ask me to insult anyone and reacted immature in general (caps locking, irritated emojis, quoting songs etc). \n\nShe proceeded to not react to any messages in our group chat with another friend (where this happened) for about a day or two. This has happened before after i explained good things that happened in my life (i had a really rough time) and she took it as an insult because she 'didn't have good friends at school' for example. I was just proud of the things i accomplished and wrote them after she made some 'do you have a life' joke as far as i remember. This resulted in a fight. After which she ignored us.\n\nShe is prone to playing the victim card too, and writes things like 'I'm used to being ignored' after we don't react to her k-pop ramblings. \n\nSo i was done with her bullshit, and texted her that i won't be doing this anymore if she didn't stop her immature behavior.\nTo summarize everything: she was busy with school, but she posted alot on her story and Twitter. I told her that she argued childishly and she told me that was mean because she's a child. Told her she has to take the not so fun adult side and argue maturely if she goes out to concerts and drinks alcohol. She's an adult by now. \n\nI got back at her being offended at me calling an idol ugly and then ignoring us. She said that's how every fan would react and i told her it's not an excuse being a sensitive kpop fan to fight a friend over some stupid statement like this. \nShe told me i was mean, mean, MEAN for saying this and guilt trip her and that was a totally asshole way to 'win an argument' and i didn't care about her feelings while she did about mine and then she told me to leave her alone and didn't text me back. AITA?\n\nTLDR: Friend got offended at stupid sentence. \nI consulted her in private chat about her generally immature behavior. I'm the mean asshole now. ",

      "title": "AITA for telling my dad to get over his feud with his in-laws?",
      "description": "My dad is usually a very sociable person who is friends with what seems like literally everyone, but he refuses to be in the same room as any members of my mom’s family (her sister, brother, and their parents). I have always been a bit bothered by this because I haven’t seen any of them do anything that could warrant such a reaction. I have been asking my dad to tell me what exactly happened and he finally did. \n\nFor context, both of my parents immigrated here from India before I was born. My dad told me that he had one investment property in India that he bought before he got married. About 8 years ago, he and my mom were having a financial crisis and my mom had just been diagnosed with breast cancer. They were having trouble paying for everything, including maintaining the property. Finally, after trying everything to get back on their feet, they decided to ask my mom’s parents for some help. This was difficult for my dad to do because he had grown up believing that a man that relied on his in-laws was a failure. However, he had no other choice at this point so he asked for some money and he told them to keep the money from the property in India until their loan was subsidized. \n\nAbout one and a half years passed, and the money was subsidized, so my dad asked for the property back. My grandparents ignored him. Since he had some bigger fish to fry at the moment, he left it at that. A few more years passed and they still ignored his requests for the property back. My dad tried very hard to speak with them but they flat out ignored him. My mom did not want to get involved. Finally, after trying everything, my dad went to my mom’s sister and asked if she would reason with her parents. She asked them and they gave the property back to her to give to my dad and it was all settled.\n\nHowever, after that, my aunt refused to speak to my dad. She would completely ignore him in public and he felt humiliated. When he asked my mom, she told him that it was because he had said some rude things about her parents. He tried really hard to patch things up with my aunt, but she refused for six months. After that, she tried again to talk to him, but this time he refused. He said that after ignoring all of his efforts to patch things up, she only talked to him when she wanted to. He finally decided to just cut off all contact with my mom’s whole side of the family. \n\nThroughout all of this, my mom had been battling breast cancer (don’t worry, she’s cancer free now) and my dad had been in a lot of pain seeing her like that and not having anyone to confide in. His whole family was still in India and he did not have any close friends here. On top of that, these issues caused a lot of bad arguments where my mom considered going back to live with her parents. In the end, she chose to stay with my dad. \n\nNow, my dad still refuses any contact with my mom’s parents or siblings. When we visit India, my mom will visit her parents while my dad stays with his. This part I am ok with and I understand. However, my mom’s sister lives in the same area as us and we see her a lot more often. My dad cannot even be in the same room as her. This bothers me a little bit more because I believe that this level of a grudge is a bit unwarranted for the situation. I once helped some friends throw a surprise anniversary party for my parents by providing a guest list, and without thinking I invited my mom’s sister because she and my mom are still close. After the party, my dad confided in me that he was not able to enjoy even a second of the party because she was there. Not interacting with him, just there.\n\nThe biggest problem in this for me is with my mom’s brother, who lives in the UK. She and my mom are very close, but she hasn’t seen him in years. It’s been even longer since we’ve seen his family. He has two kids, and I have only met the older one because the younger one was not born yet. The main reason we can’t go see them is because my dad refuses to come. He claims he is not preventing my mom from going without him, but knowing her, it would be hard for her to go without him. She has never gone on a solo vacation before. This is what makes me upset and this is why I told my dad that he should suck it up. I said that he doesn’t have to interact with my aunt, but he should be able to be in the same room as her. And I told him that he is holding my mom back from seeing her brother because of this relatively small and long-ago issue. AITA?\n\nTl;dr: My dad had a property that he temporarily gave to my mom’s parents and they refused to give back. He asked my aunt for help and she helped, but then gave him the silent treatment because of how he spoke about her parents. He has ever since refused to be in the same room as her or any other member of my mom’s immediate family, which is preventing my mom from seeing her brother, who lives in another country. I told him to suck it up.",

We carried on drinking and talking the conversation was about the people in the group. She said \"oh theirs a secret within the group\" so I started pursuing this secret because I'm the \"Human resources\" side of the group due to my background.\n\nSo plenty of \"what's the secret?\" from myself the truth spills out she had really strong feelings for me. This really caught me off guard and pretty much went into fight or flight mode now don't get me wrong she's great to be around bit on the quite side but when she's speaks she makes a point.\n\nSo in response I basically said that \"I'm not emotional ready for a relationship\" which I'm not bullshitting I'm currently see a therapist for my wellbeing (Christmas till end of January is a rough time due to losing a family member) and I'm a firm believer if you don't like yourself how the hell are you be in a relationship. \n\nHowever as soon as I said it I could see her heart break in front of me. \n\nSo I'm an arse or not",

      "title": "AITA for getting angry when the group chat I was in and its leader became toxic?",
      "description": "So to preface this, this is my first AITA and I’m on mobile right now, so sorry for formatting.\n\nSo this first started around a year ago when I joined a group chat all my friends just made (We were 13 and it was an iPhone group chat).\n\nEverything was nice and we chatted from time to time and were generally positive. But around 6 months into the group chat’s existence things started to get, just a teensy bit, haywire. \n\nIt first started when the Admin(or leader/ creator) of the chat threatened to kick me, for spamming. *now* you’re probably thinking, *that seems like a good reason to kick someone*. And it is a good reason to kick someone, the only problem was that other people had been spamming images and texts but he (admin) hadn’t threatened to kick them. This made me a tiny bit mad.\n\nThese occurrences happens relatively frequently. I would get into and argument sometimes and would say some things, but I never was outwardly mean or hurtful to anybody. I also would NEVER cuss someone out or try to hurt their feelings. Now keep in mind that this group chat had around 9 people in it, so if the whole group except you was talking and \nyou were lying in bed or with your parents it could get a bit annoying. This had happened several times and was a little inconvenient but I never got mad about it.\n\nHOWEVER, if the leader of the chat who we shall henceforth call M, was caught in a situation as described above. The first thing he would type in the group chat was saying bad things about me and threatening to kick me. This started to get on my nerves after the first few times so I started to get mad.\n\nWhile this was all happening M had started to not be as nice as he normally was at school. M treated everyone else fine but always acted a little, apprehensive, I would say, towards me.\n\nSo all of this eventually led up to today, where I had a big argument with M and possibly ruined other close friendships.\n\nRight now I posted on the chat that I was selling some things to get some money. One person ( called W) said that he didn’t want to buy it. However, M said that he had one of the things I was selling and thought that it was complete doodoo (as he put it). His exact words were “I had one there are complete dodo”.  After that, a person in my group who we will call BY, posted a picture of a gun he drew. BY liked to draw and thought that he was an amazing artist, kinda like the one in r/delusionalartists but he was not as bad as some of the ones on there.  I told him that his artwork was okay but not great. He got angry at what I said and got angry at me. BY then said that he spent hours on it and then W asked him why he spent so many hours on it. A person who we will call BO then used what W said and made it into an insult against him. BO said “why do you spend so much time on fortnite even though you are trash”. Now, I don’t play fortnite, but it is quite popular in my friend group and being called “trash” at it was my groups idea of insult. So now we had BY angry at the chat for not complimenting his artwork and W and BO angry at each other over fortnite.\n\nAfter a few more times back and forth M finally steps in and says (and these are his exact words) “y’all shut the f&amp;ck up”. Before this I explained to BY that we (the chat) did not think his artwork was bad but not as good as he thought.  Anyway, M then tells me (specifically) to shut up. Then W, M, BY, and BO argue about the art, fortnite, and people acting salty. I then offer BY the chance for me to give constructive criticism on his artwork which he never answers. BY then says that a certain text will answer my question. I then type that the text didn’t answer the question. Now please stay with me, this probably seems like some pointless 13 year old drama (which it mostly is) but it goes to show how the whole group just fell apart.\n\nNow this is when it starts to pick up speed. M tells me to shut up or he will kick me from the chat (he threatened it before, but this time he was serious) He said NOTHING to the other people furiously arguing about stupid fortnite.\nI then say (and again, these are my exact words)  “why are you getting mad at me when everyone else is trying to be mean and getting salty”.\n\nhe then kicks me\n\nYou probably think that this is the end and I just explode, or something. But nope. You see... I had just gotten a phone (pretty late I know) and joined the chat, but I had also gotten my old iPad connected to the chat. So when M kicked my phone from the chat, he forgot to kick my iPad from it.  So I added my phone to the chat through my iPad. And everyone was was like *woaahh* *how did you get back*  but this isn’t important. M then says “ I removed your iPad from the chat, ha” but I could still type. He then says that he will give me another chance. But right after that, he private messages me.\n\nFrom the point in I am getting very tired so I am just going to do a text version of the chat with no pictures. If you want pics you will probably have to wait until tomorrow.\n\nM:Shut up (in replay to me speaking [but not spamming] in the group chat.                     \nMe:maybe \nM maybe what bitch \nMe:maybe I’ll call you out on your treatment of other people in the group chat. ESPECIALLY ME\nM:I don’t care\nMe:you don’t care about the environment of hate that you created and allowed to fester and make a toxic chat\nM:👎\nM: Still don’t care \n(30 seconds pass)\nMe: Looks like he’s out of responses\nM:Who\nM:Me too\nM:me \nM:well go cry to your mom then\nMe:Fine, ignore the monster that is slowly going to creep out of your phone and slowly invade your social life in reality\nM:Man shut up with that gay shit \nMe: that’s not gay\nM:still shut up\n(30 seconds pass)\nM:who couldn’t think of a response now\nMe: What issues do you want to bring up that we can have a reasoned discussion about.\nM:shut up \n(Short time passes)\nM:do something then\nMe:you just told me that you were looking for an argument\nM:no\nMe: so you don’t want an argument then\nM:you just need to shut the fuck up\nMe: you just need to learn that your actions have consequences\nM:ha get trolled \nM:I have been trolling you this whole time\nM: but please don’t correct folks\nM:or\nM:don’t be annoying \nMe:who was I correcting\nM:annoying \nM:about grammar \nM:don’t be annoying \nM:and stop crying \n(End of conversation)\n\nWoot that’s the end. I am sooooooo tired. If you have any advice or tell me am I the asshole. I will hope filully respond in the morning am I the asshole for what I said to M\n\n",

      "description": "My family used to have a shitzu and it was the most miserable thing ever, bit and growled, etc. \n\nSince said dog passed away, I was given a cat for my birthday and graduation. He is four years old, used to having the reign of the house, and doesn’t do well with other animals from what I have seen. He also hides from my nephew whenever he is over and refrains from eating or going to the litterbox when the nephew is over. But obviously this is only temporary. \n\nNow that we are suddenly getting a dog, and a bigger dog at that, I am worried about how my cat will do with a new animal. I am nervous that he will have to hide 24/7 and will not be able to be as comfortable as he has been in his life thus far. I feel as though this is unfair to our current animal and that my parents are too optimistic that everything is going to work out, ignoring the possibility that the cat could get hurt or risking having to separate the two of them indefinitely if anything goes wrong. Sure, they could end up buddies, but I’m still terrified that something might happen and that my parents sprung a new animal on the cat without even thinking of the possibility. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for being upset in this situation and wanting to protect my fur baby?

      "description": "Throwaway because I don’t want to stir up more drama. My fiancée has, let’s say, an interesting mother... constantly breathing down her neck, highly critical of every decision she makes from career, hobbies, college major, choice in men (ahem, me), etc. I’m talking crazy manipulative. She used find my friends to track my fiancée all through high school and the first half of college, and would remark pretty frequently that she “didn’t approve” of her doing things like staying out past 10PM at so and so’s house. Or “what are you doing at Starbucks still?”\n\n\nFast forward to junior year at uni. We’re engaged, pretty tumultuous process because the timing did NOT fit her parents expectations for her life. (This is where I have messed up. Craziness aside, it’s a mistake to make enemies with your S/O’s parents). I found out that she was being tracked when she rolled her eyes at a text saying “what are you still doing at stalker-in-laws’ house? I couldn’t believe it. From the other side of the country, she was watching like a hawk. So I told her to stop sharing location. We argued a bit, and then I got her to come around. I feel like it’s a pretty huge invasion of privacy, even if snap maps and other stuff has become the norm. This was just weird. The fallout was a huge argument with her parents and in the end, they backed down. \n\nThen cut to today. I find out her dad still has her location. He casually mentioned that he saw we were at a restaurant he liked. She brushed it off and said she figured I just didn’t want her mom tracking us. I’m currently holding my tongue. This is insane to me. Am I crazy? This woman has unprecedented access to her husband’s phone. She’s probably just kept quiet about it. I feel frustrated and a little mislead. What do you guys think? Is it too much to ask for some privacy? I have nothing to hide, but I also don’t want to live with the knowledge that every move we make together is out in the open for her mom to watch.\n\nTL;DR fiancée’s mom tracked her with find my friends. I told her to stop sharing location with her parents. She mislead me and only switched it off for her mom. \n\n\nSorry for mobile formatting. ",

      "description": "I just watched \"Us\" and it was awesome except for the two highschool girls that texted, whispered, and chuckled throughout *the entire film*. I'm only 24 so it wasn't some old-man rage thing. These young ladies were causing the other people in the theater to shift and look back. It was honestly the second worst experience I've ever had watching a movie in a theater (second only to the time I sat behind and Arabic crowd that translated \"Captain America: Winter Soldier\" in real time to their friend).\n\nAfter the movie ended I kind of lost it. I just yelled \"SHUT THE FUCK UP!\" as the credits started to roll. Got close on them and chewed them out for having zero respect for the other people in the theater. I guess I'm a bit menacing because they seemed afraid for their safety and one cried. Then I just left. So not sure if I'll end up with cops at my door or not yet. I was just so angry at their blatant disrespect and the fact they ruined the premier for me so badly that I'm driving a town over tomorrow just to watch it again without such annoying people in the theater. \n\nI don't feel bad about what I did. I sincerely hope those two never act that way in a theater again or better yet just never go to the movies again and save the rest of the world from dealing with them. But I do feel like I might have gone to far by basically blowing up at the two ignorant kids (I say that but they were 16-ish).",

She failed out of college despite her parents paying for all her needs, refuses to work, and never tried to work hard to improve after high school. Last year without consulting anyone, she decided to try for a baby with a \"rich\"  man she had only been dating for a month and unsurprisingly he left and doesn't pay child support because she refuses to take him to court. Her parents and her sisters constantly and furiously berate her, insult her, and talk down to her for her failures in life and since she lives with her parents and they support her and her child, she's expected to do the chores and cook so she's kind of like a maid. They've treated her like this since she dropped out of college, but I can't sympathize because she's had so many opportunities to work or further her education at no expense and turned them down out of laziness. Like in the past 10 years she's only worked maybe 8 months and has turned down or didn't even apply to around 10 entry level jobs. If she was really upset with her treatment then she would have left years ago right?",

My girlfriend, my brother &amp; I each pay for ⅓ of the cost of the account, which is too expensive for me to pay on my own, yet this way is cheaper than me having a 1 person account. \n\nRecently, my dad asked if he could jump in on it, since it can have up to 4 people watching at once. I said sure, and told him it would cost him $6 each month. He then called me ungrateful and selfish, explaining that he shouldn't have to pay me at all because it doesn't cost me any extra to have him on there, because I was already paying for a 4-person account.

We started being friends at the end of the school's summer program, and ever since she's been sitting at lunch with me and all my free periods. It was nice at first, because she always wanted to hang out and help me out with schoolwork (of course, i helped her too.) However, she started becoming for of a nuisance than an eager friend. She would drag me to places when I have to study, and talk about anything and everything whenever I tried to do work. It seemed as if no was never an option. Due to my horrible temper, I've shown my annoyance multiple times. We've already fought recently, because I tried to apologize for my behavior and she then told me she never cared and thought it was funny to see how annoyed I could get.\nAfter that fight, I blocked her on every social media platform and on my contacts. She then texted my boyfriend, who had to basically play messenger for two weeks. She couldn't take a hint and even sat with me as if nothing was wrong. This happened until Halloween, when she gave me a stuffed animal and refused to take it back. I did not ask for the gift, or her \"apology\", yet she believes that I have. My other friend tells me to just tell her flat out, but I still feel guilty. On the other hand, seeing her just ruins my day and I immediately feel like screaming. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for reporting a coworker to HR after she wouldn’t take no for an answer for a date with me",
      "description": "I am a male employee at a fairly well known technology company in Silicon Valley and we have a policy about dating that goes something like this: if you are interested in dating a coworker you can request once and only once if they’d like to hang out after work or on a weekend. If they decline for any reason, even if they say they’re busy, then you must accept it as a lack of interest on their part. Obviously if they say they’re busy but offer a date and time that works better for them then it can be considered an acceptance but if they say no or that they’re busy (full stop), then you are not allowed to pursue it further.\n\nThere is a fairly attractive woman that worked in a department located near mine and we met in the break room a few weeks ago. She is cute however I have a strong policy of not dating coworkers. Full stop. (I have had horror stories happen to me and friends with office relationships and drama).\n\nShe sent me an email about a week and a half ago asking if I’d like to grab drinks after work. I said I was flattered by the offer but that I’m busy.\n\nShe responded with “oh okay is there a better time for you”? (Which is against company policy to even ask). I cut her some slack and said “not really to be honest but I appreciate the invite!”\n\nI thought that would be the end of the situation, but on Saturday morning at 2:45am I got a text message that said “are you sure you don’t wanna grab drinks with me? 😉 “\n\nI responded in the morning when I actually read it and I said that thanks but I’m good Ann’s have a great weekend. She responded with a “oh ok sorry to bother you”.\n\nI thought that would be the end of it, but then on Sunday at 1:30am I got another text saying “hey just so I know... what did I do wrong? Was it something I said? I’m so sorry but like, I feel like I should know why it was?”\n\nI ignored the text message and on this Monday first thing I did was walk straight into my bosses office. Her attitude was “sounds like she likes you man! She’s hot why don’t you go for it”.\n\nI told him that (a) I’m not interested and (b) I don’t date coworkers due to my personal experience.\n\nShe advised that reporting it to HR would cause drama that the neighboring department really cannot afford because it’s a busy season for them and that she’s a really nice girl anyway. Also I should reconsider maybe dating her and if not then I should at least be flattered and not pissed.\n\nThis caused me to wonder why my boss would have taken HER side and not her own employees (she is not the girls boss). So I looked at the members of one of the extracurricular social groups for Latin women, and I think they know each other through that group.\n\nShe’s trying to protect her friend. Last night I got a text from my boss that said “please don’t get her in trouble she’s a really nice girl and if you’re not interested then just please tell her”. But I already have told her why? And I don’t feel like I need a reason to reject a date or a person anyways - they’re not owed that. No is a full sentence, right?\n\nI milled it over last night and I decided to report it to Hr this morning. I have had no contact with my boss since, in fact she has deliberately avoided me and said nothing to me all day.\n\nThe rest of my coworkers have all suspiciously ignored me as well, one even cancelled a subteam meeting that day that I would have gone to.\n\nI have a feeling like there will now be intense social backlash over my decision to report her. And now I’m regretting it and wondering if I may be opening up myself to further issues and possibly bullying and harassment by the guys and girls I work with.\n\nNow I’m starting to really really dwell on this and wondering if I did the right thing.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My boyfriend's twin brother had his bachelor party on Saturday. We discussed boundaries before he left, I said I didn't mind if he went to a strip club, but I did not want him to touch any of the dancers or get a lap dance. No problem, he readily agreed and I thought we were done with it, I totally trusted him.   \n\n\nSunday afternoon we're laying in bed, and he confesses to getting a lap dance. He said the other guys bought it for him and he was super drunk, and that he was sorry. He also said he got up after a minute and she didn't finish the dance. I appreciate that he told me the truth, but I'm still really mad that he disrespected that boundary after agreeing to it. He didn't have to accept the dance, he could have stood up and left. Shame on me for asking for more details, but apparently he had his hands on her the whole time, got an erection, and enjoyed it. Now I can't stop picturing it. I'm totally grossed out and super disappointed in him.   \n\n\nSo guys, am I the asshole for being mad and having unrealistic expectations, or am I justified in being angry?",

      "description": "OK a bit of background - I do occasional commission illustration work either for framing or for tattooing, it seemed to pick up after my last Inktober run got a bit of attention from my social media circle.\nAt the end of October last year a friend passed me onto someone who wanted a custom tattoo piece designed, “great” I thought, I loved what I was doing and was excited to get more work.\nThe piece was finished very quickly and time came to ask for payment. I know I should have taken a deposit because this guy wasn’t my direct friend but I thought “how bad can it be?”... contacted the client and he says he will pay me in a few weeks time at pay day. Pay day came around and apparently his has been delayed by another few weeks. I don’t know what he does for a living but fair enough, I’ll wait a bit longer.\nAnother couple of weeks go by and I contact again, and now he has lost his job. Absolutely terrible thing to happen and especially in the run up to Christmas, so I leave him to it and not add to the stress.\nFast forward to now, 5 months after the work was completed. He posts on his Facebook that he’s getting a new tattoo, and it’s not my design! Naturally I contact him. Maybe I was a bit curt but surely that’s understandable! I get excuses about his mother paying for this one - why not pay for the work already completed? He tells me he gets paid in three weeks, I end it on that and say I’ll contact him in three weeks.\nI then get messages from the mutual friend saying I’m being an ass hole, so I figured who better to ask than strangers online!\nSo am I the asshole here?",

Come internship season, which he had already gone through last year, I thought that it would be helpful if he could send me a list of companies he had applied for. I knew he maintained a list because he had told me that I should keep a track of companies that I had applied to, as it will be easier to manage. I remember him saying he had applied to around 120-130 companies himself. I had myself applied to around **100 companies before asking him for the company list. \n\nI had asked him for the list to ensure I do not miss out on any company he might have applied to, because I had indeed missed out on a few deadlines.\n\nHe got angry and told me that it was disrespectful of his hardwork to ask him of something like this.

Since we have only been with each other our entire adult lives, all of our friends are mutual. We agreed to make sure we don’t do anything to make them split so we don’t lose them. Last night however, he kissed one of our mutual friends which says to me that he doesn’t intend on keeping his side of the deal. I wasn’t physically with them, but my other friend - whose New Years party he was at - posted a video of all the couples kissing at midnight. It was upsetting and embarrassing to see him in the background hugging and then kissing her pretty intimately. It was the first thing I saw on Facebook and Instagram when I opened my phone to settle in for the night. In an effort to stay cordial but still take care of myself, I removed my ex from all social media and asked my friend to take down the video. I am obviously upset, and it’s not that he kissed someone, it’s who it was and that it was broadcasted on social media. Am I the asshole for not wanting to have that on social media for my other friends and family members to see?",

I did this because frankly, I didn’t want to have to type the info out multiple times, and so that if there were any questions, I could just answer them once. Basically, for efficiency. \n\nTwo days later, I get a text from one of my direct reports demanding an apology. It takes a few minutes of back and forth for me to figure out the issue, but it turns out that she’s upset that one of the other parties in the group text has her number now. I apologize, and ask if he’s been harassing her. She responds that he hasn’t (she shows me her phone, and the entire exchange is him sending her a meme related to our field of work, her asking him to only text her if it’s work related, and him saying “okay sorry”).  At this point, I think the issue is resolved, but she’s been making snarky comments about it since then, and has generally been cold toward me. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here?",

I will admit I’m a judgmental asshole, but that’s obviously not my business and it’s his choice so I ignored it. It’s college and there are plenty of people like him.\n\nFast forward to test 2. I crammed and prepared for days because I did not need another test to fuck me raw like the first time. Important note, these are not multiple choice exams. You are given the topic the week of the exam, you do your research and write yourself a pretty outline at home, and on exam day you crap out anything you remember in essay form. Difficult but it became manageable when I put the work in. \nAnyway, I’m about halfway through this exam when for some reason, my eyes wander to frat daddy next to me. That’s when I notice, underneath his essay packet is his ENTIRE ESSAY OUTLINE. The whole fucking essay, pre-written, and he was sliding it from underneath to copy word for word. Idk but I didn’t spare a moment to consider my next move. I immediately got up and went to a TA (teaching assistant)\n\nMe: “hey, so I’m gonna pretend I’m getting more writing paper from you, but the guy next to me is cheating, hardcore”\n\nTA: *starts to fucking walk to the dudes aisle*\n\nMe: *stops him* “DUDE give me the paper please”\n\nI thought I did this artfully. However, from the TA’s vantage point and disadvantage of having to seem nonchalant, they didn’t catch him. I was informed after the class to let the professor know if it happens again. \n\n(For the record, since he didn’t get caught he still got the grade on that exam, and of course made a grade higher than me and got to fucking keep it. A+.)\n\nFast forward one more time to the 3rd and final exam. I’m in my own head, furiously word vomiting about colonization or something. Almost forgot about frat man next to me. Chuckled in my head thinking there was no way he could be doing it again. Nah. No way.\n\nHe’s fucking doing it again. \nThis time, I don’t get up. The professor was already hovering in the vicinity. All it took this time was dead eye contact between myself and the professor, followed by a swift eye jerk in the direction of the cheater. Professor stormed down our aisle, demanded the dudes papers. Could feel the guy practically shit himself. Hesitantly follows the order and finally gets dragged out of the class.\n\nIn my uni, the honor code states that punishment can range from a failing grade on that exam or being failed for the whole class. It can even, on request of the professor, be taken to the honors council where they can make an even more serious decision of removing said person from certain university programs or even the university itself. Honestly, the professor seemed fucking fumed about it, so I don’t know to what extent he took it.\n\nLooking back at it now, part of me realizes that this wasn’t high school; a days detention and a smack on the wrist was not all this guy was gonna get. But at the time I was PISSED, being someone who actually worked for the good grade just to have someone who did nothing to blow through the class was entirely.\n\nBut, I snitched. That’s the basic offense against me but really, Am I the Asshole?\n\n\nTL;DR I got some dude next to me busted for cheating and his consequences were probably really bad",

      "description": "Throw away account :)\n\nSo some back ground: My girlfriend and I (m19) have been happily dating for 8 months. I have been 100% supportive of her being bisexual and that is no problem to me. However, one issue that has arisen is our views on kissing others. While she says she would never kiss another random girl because she knows it is the same as kissing a guy, she seems to think it’s okay to be kissing her female friends because they are friends. Also, these kisses are mostly just like quick kisses goodbye and not full on making out at this point. \n\nI on the other hand, feel like any kissing should be considered intimate and should not be shared outside of our relationship. She has said that she understands and would not push it because I am uncomfortable with it. But it still makes me uneasy that she is okay with this.\n\nAITA here in saying she should not be kissing her female friends?\nThanks everyone",

      "description": "It's not what you think. I mean, it's probably not what you think.\nShe wasn't in her right mind, and I kind of panicked.\n\nLet me backtrack a bit: It's high school, I was a closeted lesbian and we kinda had a homoerotic friendship(?) thing going on (small homophobic town, etc etc). We would text constantly, cuddle excessively, she'd call on Fridays and we'd talk for hours. The problem was, I had other friends.\n\nShe didn't like that. To be honest, they weren't so fond of her either.\n\nShe was possessive and expressive, always making drama out of the smallest things. Just one slight would send her over the edge and she'd corner me between class hyperventilating and beyond reason.\n\nBut we finally graduated, more importantly it's Friday. I'm out with my other friends after work when I hear my phone go off. It's her.\n\nThe thing is, I'm not really one for confrontation, and it's gotten to the point where I know if I answer she'll want to know if I'm free, why I'm not free, why I'm hanging out with Them instead of Her, etc etc. We've done this song and dance before, and I didn't have the energy.\nSo instead of answering, I let it go to voicemail and I turn off my ringer.\n\nAbout 4 hours pass, and one of my friends gets a call from my parents, complaining that I'm not answering their calls and that my inbox is full.\n\nSo I check my phone.\n\n28 missed calls.\n\nI feel a bit sick at the sight.\nI dial my voicemail, and sure enough it's full. One is an old saved message from my grandfather, but every single other slot is filled by Her.\n\n- \"Hey [my name] I'm just calling to see what you're up to! Call me back!!!\"\n- \"Hiiiiii!!!! You're probably busy, just wanted to chat! Call me!!!\"\n\nThat's how they started out, simple enough, but only spaced about 15min apart.\nThey started getting more desperate around the fifth message. \n\n- \"Hey, you haven't called me back. Are you ignoring my calls?\"\n- \"It's [blank] again, why aren't you answering????\"\n- \"Are you ignoring me? Should I drive to your house? Call Me Back!\"\n\nTo be honest I was deleting the messages pretty fast by that point, not really listening to them. The last message in my inbox is stuck in my mind though. 20 seconds of heavy, upset breathing, followed by her saying my name, then hanging up.\nIt's only been 4 hours! I couldn't wrap my head around that fact. I was freaked out and more than a little bit scared.\nI emptied my voicemail and told my other friends what had happened. They said that she was being \"really creepy\" and I \"should be careful\", so I turned my phone off.\n\nLong story short, she kept calling my mobile, when I got home I found out that she'd called my house phone another 20 times. Then it was 12-30 times a day, every day, for the rest of summer.\nI felt paralysed. I couldn't pick up because at that point I really had been avoiding her, and I could not just tell her that she was acting strange.\n\nI know she has emotional stability issues, but I was scared. I never contacted her again, and eventually the calls stopped.\n\nWe were friends for years before this incident, and I never gave her a reason why I broke contact so suddenly. \n\nThe worst part is, I kind of want to make contact again.",

      "description": "My mom married my stepdad when I was 10. My bio dad was an abusive and OD’ed when I was little, so my sister and I took to our new stepdad really quickly and started calling him “Dad” etc really quickly. My mom didn’t stop us but she didn't actually encourage this behavior, in hindsight I actually think she either felt threatened or she didn’t want us to get overly attached. \n\nWhen I was 16, he cheated on her and they got divorced. It was bad. There were issues on both sides as there almost always are in these kind of situations, but cheating is still a huge transgression regardless. \n\nMy mom was livid, and my sister and I were both pretty much angry at everyone. \n\nMy now ex-stepdad made it clear that he still cared us about my sister and I, but that it was on our terms and didn’t push us. My older sister moved out not long after and keeps our whole family at arms-length anyway, but after high school I started cautiously resuming a relationship with him. I didn't tell my mom but I think she sort of knew if that makes sense and just wanted to pretend like it wasn't happening.\n\nFour years post-divorce, I can accept that someone can be a terrible partner but a good father. If he was my bio dad, I feel like it would be 100% acceptable for me to keep seeing him. But because he’s my stepdad, it feels like I’m betraying my mom. The other thing is that he’s richer than my mom and his extended family is generally more stable so it's like I’m trading up. And he’s married to the woman he cheated on my mom with. She and I are never going to be BFFs, she’s sort of on the periphery and my relationship with her has reached the point of cautious friendliness. And my sister has already half-abandoned my mom (and me) so it would be another blow. And my mom was a really good mom, despite her issues and the awful parenting she had herself.\n\nI want to continue having a relationship with him. I want to have a dad. I'm in a serious relationship right now, and I can't help thinking about how nice it would be to have him walk me down the aisle and I know he would be honored, but that would be a huge slap in the face to my mom and how can I do that to her?",

However, I'm the overall sole parent and spend the most time training and taking care of her. Though the coparenting is really helpful with a busy schedule, I'm worried his time with her may become toxic and she won't be cared for appropriately. \n\nHe's getting back together with his ex and they've had a toxic relationship from the beginning. I often had to help him when they fought. His ex is extremely manipulative and emotionally abusive (even though he may not see it), causing him to excessively drink to coup. I don't think he remembers the continuous emotional toll it took on him and romanticizes this past relationship. She also suffers from sever psychiatric issues and has not gotten help. Previously, she has spoken poorly about me to him, making up scenarios that never occurred and attacking my character. They also both do not know how to coup with their anger issues, often hitting walls, screaming and causing damage to other things. \n\nI'm worried this type of environment may be problematic for the puppy and I do not want her to normalize aggressive behavior like that. I also do not want the excessive drinking to inhibit proper care. Now I'm not trying to make an ultimatum, I simply want to lessen the dog's exposure to this toxicity. I also know I cannot control whom he dates nor do I want to. They only dated for a few months before she broke up with him and I doubt this time will be any longer. I also haven't spoken to him about this yet because I'm worried I'll sound controlling and manipulative.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting our dog-child to live in a healthy environment?

      "description": "Been with my boyfriend for 3 years, and although we had SO many ups and downs, and he was very hard to be in a relationship with (very petty about everything, temperamental, emotionally abusive, etc) I always deeply loved him and always thought we would be okay. When we were good we were amazing, and when we were bad, I hated him so much. But recently. Something changed. I just felt this urge to be single, to explore my options, I am only 21, he’s 3 years older. I have never really properly been single and I just felt so tied down with him all of a sudden. I suppose I felt I could do better than be tied down with him. He made me happy when he was treating me well, but i kept wondering what it would be like to be happy ALL the time in a relationship. \n\nSo I kept thinking about ending us, and I just kept getting so so scared. I don’t know why, I just couldn’t do it. I said to myself I would do it late January when his exams were over. We agreed not to do Christmas presents etc because we were both very low on cash (I had just completed a semester abroad). But Christmas came, He bought me very expensive presents. He treated me like a princess the whole Christmas season, his family too. They were all so exceptionally lovely to me. And I thought maybe I can power through these break up thoughts and il be okay, il get over it! \n\nHowever he text me yesterday, New Year’s Day. Asking why I had been acting so differently over the past few days and the week before Christmas. He said he felt like I had no interest any more and he basically described how I felt. And I couldn’t lie. I had to tell him. So I text him to please meet me to talk, but he wouldn’t. He said he knew what was coming. And so he wouldn’t listen to me, and I had to text him and explain how I was feeling (he gave me no choice, said he did not want to see me). He obviously has taken it so so badly. He is so angry, so upset, so disgusted, says I just used him over the Xmas period etc. And in a way it’s true. I should have ended the relationship as soon as I had doubts but I didn’t. \n\nBasically I feel lowest of the low, I feel like absolute shit. I feel so guilty. Who the fuck ends a 3 year relationship on New Year’s Day after being treated amazingly like that over Christmas? \n\nAll I know is that it was a long time coming, and I just picked the worst timing ever. \n\nHe says his family hate me and are disgusted with me. \n\nIt literally just looks like I stayed with him for Christmas and then on the first of January was like nope, see ya, I want a new life now. \n\nI already think I’m an asshole, even though I just did was was right for me. I think I just handled it badly.  I just want your opinions. \n\n",

      "description": "Soo,\n\nI Have a friend group that I met about 2-3 years ago. (they already knew each other for like 2 years i guess). I met this girl before the dude and I instantly liked her quite a bit. After that i met the dude and we got along really good and he eventually told me that he had a crush on that girl and from that point on I was helping him try to get her because he is a really cool dude and I think he deserves it although i really liked this girl (maybe a bit too much). So both of them talk with me about the problem with others and in the end they didn't get together although they both loved each other. You should also know that they both have \"strong characters\" so they and really stand each other. That whole process was 2 years. Now is where it becomes tricky. For those whole 2 years i had had to live with the burden of having feelings for her and i finally decide to confess to her. Right now I'm living away so didn't really think it would become anything and I didn't even know if i wanted us to be more but i just had to tell her because i couldn't hold it anymore (maybe kinda selfish). so i call her and confess to her, she is silent and hangs up after like 30 seconds. I realize that she doesn't feel the same for me so I write her that i don't want us to get together or anything but that i had to get this off of my chest but i see that she doesn't receive the messages. A few hours later she sends me this huge text and also says that she had told it to a few of her friends. I ask her if she could ask those friends if they told anyone and tell them to not tell it to everyone. ( I wanted to tell it the dude from earlier first before he hears it from someone different). She agrees and asks them but they haven't told anyone and they promised they wouldn't. The day after I tell the dude that i had feelings for her and he seems super cool about it, we at this point have a super long talk also about trust and that i would never and have never told her anything that he didn't want me to tell her, but then he says like \"i also kinda knew about it\" and something that I can't translate to english very well bit it is like \"I heard it somewhere\" and he also said: \"but you don't have to tell her\". So at this Situation I know that one of the girls closest friends lied to her and I tell her immediately after that he knew it from someone. Apparently she asked him immediately after that where he knew it from, and this is where he gets super angry at me because he had \"clearly told me not to tell her\"  so the \"but you don't have to tell her\" was a \"don't tell her tho\" but i didn't think of it as that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso, people of reddit, Am I the asshole? and please not just about this last situation but about the whole story.

He doesn't remember every detail, but he remembers the location and some of the people involved. When he first told me about this, it didn't even occur to me that this shit could still be ongoing with other kids (I was just focused on trying to support him).\n\nHe just sort of casually mentioned yesterday that he has no idea where his abusers ended up when we were talking about a famous abuse case. I sort of just assumed they were jailed or died, but then he told me he never actually reported them. I was instantly like \"how do you know they're not still doing that stuff?\". And he cringed a bit then was like \"Well, I don't...\". We sat in silence for a minute. Then I said something like \"you should really report them, right?\" \n\nAnd he told me that he didn't think he'd be believed and he had no proof, and he really didn't want to talk about it to anyone who isn't me. I told  they'd investigate it - and there'd be DEFINITE incriminating shit on their computers or something, right? There'd be some form of proof. And then I told him I knew how awful this must be for him, but he deserved justice and other kids deserve to not be hurt. He just sighed and said we could talk about it tomorrow (it was pretty late at night).\n\nWell, it's tomorrow. I don't know what to do. I know it's not his responsibility to report it, but I don't want those sick fucks to walk free after what they did or hurt anyone else, and my boyfriend deserves so so much more. Did I do wrong by trying to get him to report it? Should I drop it? I'm not sure. I can't stand the thought they might still be doing this shit. I feel personally responsible.",

      "description": "I wanna preface this by saying that 1. I’m using a throwaway and 2. This situation is a little bit similar to a popular post on here from the other day. However, my situation is a little bit more nuanced and I was wondering if I’m still an asshole. Four months ago, I met a girl on tinder (she’s 22, I’m 23). We texted for a little and we had a lot in common and she seemed pretty cool. We hung out once and she was hot and easy to talk to, I asked her to come over and she said no. She was going on a trip for a month and I told her to text me when she got back. I got a vibe that she wasn’t really experienced for some reason. She ended up texting me when she got home that night and we texted the time whole time she was away. I’m not really looking for a relationship because they never really work out well for me cuz I always put myself first. She eventually asked me what I was looking for and I told her that I wasn’t looking for anything but I was down to hook up repeatedly and see where things went. She said she’d be open to that as well. I’m not sure why, but from the conversations we had, I came to the conclusion that she was a virgin and I brought that up and she told me that she had been a virgin, but wanted to have sex she just has a hard time meeting nice guys. I told her that i’d be a good fit for someone to lose her virginity to. I was really nice to her and always responded to her texts.  When she came back, we started hooking up. We only actually had sex a few times and we stop whenever I finish. I know that she has feelings for me though so she continues to come over whenever I ask her to, sometimes I’ll ask her to come over but tell her I don’t have condoms and she’ll offer to give me a blow job, but I think she eventually started to feel bad about that. She also never expected much from me and never got upset when I cancelled on her or when I took too long to respond. One time i went a whole day without responding and she asked if she had done something wrong but that’s it. i feel like I’ve given enough hints that I’m not that interested because i usually prioritize my pleasure, i don’t really invite her over during the day, and I’m not an affectionate person and she still doesn’t get it. She did tell me that she has a hard time taking hints and that if I’m not interested I need to be blunt with her but how can she not see? shes also annoyingly insecure and will say things like “yeah IF you’re still interested in hooking up” or she’ll ask me what I consider her in relation to me but I don’t like to overthink that much. \n\nA week ago I asked her if she wanted to come over and give me head (i was out of condoms) and she said she didn’t think it would be worth it to come over just to do that, i told her that we’d be hanging out too and again, because she likes me she agreed. We talked for a little and then got down to business. Afterwards i kinda was hungry and wanted her to leave. I told her that i was going to go get some food and didn’t extend the invite to her. She looked kinda sad and asked if I was leaving now and should she go. I said i had to put pants on first. Before she left she told me that if she didn’t text me when she got home it’s because she didn’t wanna annoy me and told me to text her if i wanted to. I kind of didn’t want to so i just didn’t text her. About a day ago she texted me asking if i was still interested in hooking up and i ignored it. We previously had a conversation where she told me she liked me and i told her i liked her back, i just didn’t want to be in a relationship. I feel like she’s starting to become a little bit needy and I don’t know how to break it to her. I told her my intentions and made it clear who I am as a person. Yeah, I’m her first, but she is an adult making her own decisions so am I really an asshole?",

I've been looking for someone to do me and my Demanding Instructor (DI) to tell me and to make the decision.\n\nWhen I try to explain to him what I'm doing that I can do to make a mistake without it, I have been told to only make a diarrhea treatment with a muscle and compressor to something . This can not be done for many reasons. For one thing, it was a great surprise for me to miss the joy of such a solution. Secondly, the risk of such a course will stimulate long-term exposure. As a result, I need to get RETURN at any time to give me a portion of the program on every product if I do and do the next thing.\n\nAfter finding a search for an inventory site, DI got another one to fix it and told me that I had missed my opportune time because I was not listening. He was convinced that I had done something he had to say was a horrible counterfeit that he wanted to correct, but it was not done for the player who made the download and it was only a bit strange to what I was saying, how to accomplish it. I tried to think with DI but only complained about listening to hearing. Am I the asshole in any way?",

      "description": "I've been a lurker for a while, but decided to post because of how much this situation irks me.\n\nSo I'm a pretty heavy Weezer fan, as my post history and username show (kudos if you get the song reference), and my friends and I decided to throw a party on a Saturday night. It was just going to be 10-15 of us, and so that everyone could enjoy the music played, we decided to let everyone add 4-5 songs to a playlist that we'd have. I decided to add \"Pink Triangle\", a Weezer song that I enjoy, not thinking much of it. \n\nThe party rolls around, everyone's having fun, until this song plays. A friend of one of my friends who I didn't really know started to get really disruptive, and told the person who had the speaker to turn the song off. I was troubled because I really enjoy the song, so I approached her and asked what was wrong. She said that the lyrics were demeaning to the LGBTQ community, were making being lesbian into a stigma, and perpetuating male-driven thought because the woman's life is viewed through River's eyes. I felt so embarrassed and surprised that the song could be offensive that I turned it off, and apologized. However, I thought it over, listened to the song a few more times, and thought it to be harmless. AITA for playing it? \n\nFor those who don't know the song or its lyrics\n\n[https://genius.com/Weezer-pink-triangle-lyrics](https://genius.com/Weezer-pink-triangle-lyrics)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rScMI1dypQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rScMI1dypQs)",

I recently accepted about 6-7 months ago that I am a transgendered male to female, after years of denying, overcompensating, and subsiquent depression. \n\nI haven't started my transition yet as I've been talking to a therapist trying to figure everything out beforehand and solidly make sure I'm not just have some mid 20's mid life crisis.\n\nShould I wait and let her know further along in the relationship. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I decided to wait and tell her months in?\n\nI don't want her to feel like I lied about who I am or misrepresented myself to her, but I feel that if I let it sit and we do develop a strong bond it wouldn't matter.",

      "description": "So I'm 19 living with my grandmother, my aunt and her 2 daughters. Both of them are from my mother's side of the family. My Dad got my mom pregnant when she was still in high school. They never got married and they aren't together anymore. Needless to say my mother's side of the family isn't particularly fond of my dad, or anyone else in his family for that matter. Sure they'll act nice to them at family gatherings like my birthdays and things like that. But when they're not around my grandma and aunt talk bad about them. My aunt in particular always has a few \"jokes\" to make about my other aunt (my father's sister). I put joke in quotes because her definition of a joke is a harsh insult about her weight or size followed by \"haha just kidding\". And whenever I get on her case for it, she gets all condescending like \"Calm down, I was just kidding. Can't you take a joke?\" I tell her she's not funny and she needs to stop because I don't like it, but she does it anyway. My grandma doesn't make her stop either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day I promised the next time she did it I'll give her a taste of her own medicine. It's important to know that my aunt is one of six siblings including my mother. And that she's the only one of my grandmother's kids who hasn't gotten married and/or moved out of the house they grew up in. Not to mention she and the father of her two children had a nasty break-up after a 12 year relationship some years ago (They never got married in that time BTW). Which is something that she is still upset about to this day. On the other hand, my other aunt is married. I decided to use that as my comeback one morning when we were all drinking coffee. I got a call from my other aunt to check up on me and how I was doing. She also was telling me she'll be off work in the coming weeks and I should feel free to drop by her house for a visit. I tell her that's great and I'll be packing my things so I can stay for a few days. After I hang up my grandma and aunt were anxiously waiting to hear what my other aunt told me. I told them what she said, but I was unwilling to do so because I knew my aunt would use it as an opportunity to make fun of my other aunt. And surprise! she does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy aunt gives me a smug look and says \"Oh, you're gonna go and spend some time with miss piggy?\" I stare at her very harshly. I do my regular rant and she goes into her condescending routine. Still smugly she says \"Well Megaque, you have to admit she does look like Miss Piggy.\" that's when I made my comeback \"Yeah, and you have to admit she has a husband and you don't.\" Her expression changed faster than Usain Bolt running a 50m race. She started yelling at me and storms out of the dining room sreaming. My grandmother was shocked and insisted that I apologized but I never did. She didn't talk to me for a few days and she hasn't made fun of my other aunt since, at least not yet. But was I an asshole for saying what I said? Please let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I sent a text then called later and said, “hope everything is okay. Have a good night.” I get it things happen. \n\nBut, I see her at work the following weekend and it turns out she was spending time with her friend all week. Yet, she never mentioned not following up on Tuesday, apologized, or anything. She made awkward conversation about how my week was and I didn’t want to bring up her standing me up. So, I just decided we couldn’t be friends beyond work because of her lack of integrity. \n\nAnother week rolls around and she texts “how are you?” I don’t respond until the next day and say “good,thanks.” The weekend she works I feel like she thinks I was being an asshole for not being responsive. To be honest, she didn’t even deserve a response, but she makes me feel like an asshole because she made the effort to reach out and I shut her down. \n\nBut, she seems to lack self-awareness. Can’t she tell when she fucked up? Can’t she tell the reason I’m being short and distant is because I can’t trust her word? This was the reason it didn’t work out between us in the first place. \n\nNow our interactions are cold and awkward, but I’m not that person. I want things to be normal, but I feel like I have to be a bit of an asshole to protect my feelings, self respect, and mental space. Am I the asshole for shutting down my coworker?",

      "description": "This argument involved me and my housemate (H), we have not had the best relationship in the past but we're civil and still talk to each other.\n\nEarlier today I had lunch with a couple of friends, one of whom was gay. I posted on a picture my story with only the gay friend in the shot as it was mostly about the food. H commented to me in a message, saying that my boyfriend had gotten cuter, joking about how I was not dining with my boyfriend but some other guy. I replied with 'lol he's gay you know, hint hint', since he'd JUST called my friend cute, and H was recently single. That's all I said. \n\nHe became incredibly angry at me, saying how I was being very offensive by assuming he would be attracted to any other gay guy. He said and I quote because the messages are saved: 'it’s the same as me pointing at a random homeless guy and saying u two are straight, wink wink' (no idea why he needed to use the word homeless, felt that was actually more offensive). I told him it was just a joke like how he'd joked that my friend was cute (I was actually joking, it was more to make it known I wasn't just having lunch with a single straight guy idk). He replied and I quote 'but it was a bad and offensive joke' 'like that’s like me using some racial slur on u and being like it’s a joke' (I'm Asian). He said he was trying to educate me so that I did not offend other gay people. \n\nThis happened earlier and I have yet to reply to H. Who then asked me 'that was wrong if you, don't you understand??'. \n\nPlease tell me if I'm actually crazy for not understanding how what I said could be offensive in that way. ",

      "description": "OKAY my english isn’t very good take that in mind while reading this \n\nI will refer to my friend as “lia” \n \nAnd her friend as “bob” and *his* friend as “tim” got it? Okay \n\nSooo every other week we have this lesson in a specific room that has a desk and chair in the corner of the classroom (the classroom layout was pretty awkward)\n\nSo anyways Bob once sat in that desk in the corner and did pretty stupid stuff  \n\n2 weeks after me and lia got to class before bob did so we decided to sit in the seat in the corner. In comes Bob he acts pretty angry (which I believed at the time but that was because I barely knew him like at all) he started to take away our bags and pencil cases , this went on for maybe 15 mins? And then Tim threw a baseball at us (OH! Also Tim is lia’s ex) so i * attempted * to throw it back and ended up hitting another guy in my class  (okay this is where i know i was in the wrong for not apologising to the guy immediately, sorry dude) ANYWHO Bob was joking around with lia and trying to take the desk from us (yes JUST the desk) and then he proceeded to stab my friend’s water bottle with scissors and because she was holding the bottle in her hand it ending up causing a little injury (nothing too bad really) i didn’t really know bob was joking around but i think scissors are one of the many things you *don’t* joke around with so i told the teacher and he got put into remove . \n\nCUT TO after he came back from remove . Tim &amp; Bob gave me a hard time calling my snitch every chance they get  but that wasn’t that bad so I ignored them . I thought they would stop after a while , CUT TO french lesson i sat next to lia again and near the end of the lesson , i got hit in the head with a baseball , tim had thrown it at me (which i guess is pretty fair so ill give him that one) . \n\nI once sat by Bob in IT and the “conversation” went like this (not specific i cant completely remember it)\n\nBob : why’d you snitch on me? Even tho lia didn’t want you to\n\nI kinda didn’t respond sooo\n\nCUT TO last lesson {GEO}\n\nI was sitting next to lia (again) meaning i sat *directly* in front of Bob by the end of the lesson Bob threw a pen at me (twice) and that was the last straw for me \n\nI kept silence about this matter or if it was bothering me to my friends and family , but one day i told my dad and he was insistent on filling out a complaint i was reluctant to say yes knowing that i might be called a snitch again and get ridiculed , but i said yes anyways \n\nA few days after i got called into the head teacher’s office to discuss their “punishment” i didn’t want them to be put in remove cuz that would do more harm than good so we settled on a “warning and if they do it again they’ll be removed from your form” sort of “punishment” \n\nThey got talked to and ever since then they had never bothered me \n\n\nAm i the asshole for telling them off the first and second time?

      "description": "We've lived together for over 6 years and she seems to have a real issue with cleaning up after herself in general, for example leaving food all over the kitchen when she's done cooking and used tissues all over the house. In particular though, I find it disgusting that she can go for a shit and leave it all over the toilet bowl then leave the bathroom without attempting to clean up. I wouldn't even do that in a public toilet, but when I ask her when she's going to clean it up, she becomes defensive, lists all the things she does around the house and says she was too busy to clean it. \n\nIs it unreasonable of me to expect that she should clean her own shit out of the toilet regardless of what else she does or how busy she has been?",

      "description": "I’ve been talking to this girl in a long distance relationship — before anyone says it’s a bad idea and it’s hard, I know the risks so it’s alright — both me and this girl are Muslims but we ended up liking each other through a group chat we’ve known each other on for about 2 years. \n\nWe’ve been dating for 5ish months; done all types of communication, calling, video calling, our parents have even talked to each other so there isn’t a big taboo type of strain on the relationship. \n\nThe other night we were watching “me before you” and ofc when you’re watching sad movies emotions run high and questions are asked at the end of movies, but my girlfriend dropped the question “do you love me?”\n\nNormally when I talk about feelings I prefer to call and talk about them through like that instead of typing in a rabbit (movie streaming site) chat. So I responded that I would prefer to call and talk about the topic instead of just typing “I love you”.\n\nSo immediately she didn’t take this the best way and threw a fit that I didn’t just directly say I loved her and was acting difficult that I had even responded any other way instead of a direct yes or no question, which then I said okay I do love you but like I said it’s something I’d value more saying vocally instead of merely typing it on a screen. \n\nSo the whole day she decided to be angry with me about not being direct and ignored me for most of it until I attempted to fix it. I explained that I had no bad intention and she’s known me long enough to know that I wouldn’t do anything to hurt her. It was just that I preferred to express my feelings in a different way. She understood and took in all of it but still said she didn’t care about my side and that she’s hurt. I told her I understand and that I’d understand her point of view too but I would also prefer my method as well since it seems more intimate? idk if that’s the right word. \n\nSo Reddit AITA? \n\n\n",

I guess she thought it was ok after I laughed it off the first time, so it was alright to keep doing it? When I pointed it out to her, she asked me why I thought she farts so much, and I responded that it probably has something to do with her diet. She only eats cold cuts, guac by the spoonful, McDonald's, and pizza rolls. She then laughed it off but refused to change her diet, but resumed asking me the same questions later.\n\nThis morning I got fed up, and told her I just needed some time for myself, but honestly, I just couldn't handle all of the farting.\n\nShe won't stop texting me and I had to block her calls on my phone. I feel bad but it's just too much.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nTl;dr: my gf farted, I laughed it off and she took it as a green light to do so multiple times an hour, which prompted me to leave",

      "description": "Some background: \nMy ex and I split up about 6 months ago and I moved in with my mom. While pregnant we moved in together I gave him 15k to pay off his debt so his credit would improve (since I have none), helped with repairs of the place we were leasing, furnished it and paid for most of day to day needs. We had agreed he would pay me back 500 per month, which would go back into savings to eventually buy a place. \n\nI had a high risk pregnancy so I stopped working and eventually ran out of savings. Even though I helped manage his business I never received compensation or any repayment of the debt. When I moved out I took most of the furniture, but left the washing machine (which he sold and didn't tell me about until I asked for it since I wanted to sell it to pay for my car registration).  Whatever money my father sent would be spent on clothes for the baby, groceries or help with payments of his car (I own mine, he got a brand new one 3 days after our baby was born). You get the picture... \n\nPresent dilemma:\nHis credit card is still linked to my paypal and amazon accountd to pay for formula and diapers, which is the only things he pays for. I pay for everything else, except on the random occasion where he spends 40/50 dls on clothes for her, or her $200 convertible carseat that he purchased in november. We had talked about buying a good stroller, and he agreed to pay for half. I really wanted a good stroller since I have purchased two regular ones and have found them to run down fairly quickly. His half of the stroller would be 250 dls, and the stroller just went on sale for 450. I asked him to buy it before the sale was over, instead of giving me the 200 he owed from the washing machine he sold. We had a fight about an unrelated topic regarding his control issues, and now he is refusing to pay for the stroller, says he will give me the 200 later. Knowing him, he is hoping I forget. \n\nSo, will I be the asshole if I just order the stroller using his card? \n\nTL/DR: Baby's father doesn't pay for much but I have access to his credit card, will I be the asshole if I it to pay for a stroller he had previously agreed on but refuses to get because I reminded him of money he owes me?

      "description": "Hello friends, I have been a subscriber to r / aita for some time, and there is no reason to release it to the present. I don't speak English, so it's not good to talk to me. I live with my wife and children in a very rural farm in East Asia. We don't have a dairy farm, but we do have cows. My son, I will call dicky, it is my responsibility to see our cows, we call drimmin. Ok, dicky didn't hold our cow while feeding her, causing her to run away. When he came back, it made me yell at him violently, he cried in his room for a while. Losing my cow has caused my life to get worse. I don't have milk to soften my bread or butter to make my tea sweet. I know that my yelling is wrong, but at that time I felt a lot of emotions and let them all go out. I apologize, is my bastard yelling? Am I a jerk because I am angry with my son? My son is 16 years old and usually very responsible.",

      "description": " \n\nLittle background, I'm a 5th year senior who's graduating in December 20th (so like eight days). Me and three other fraternity brothers were taking a course together. This course was notified early on that there would be a group project worth 65% of our grade and that we should pick 1 - 2 partners accordingly. I asked one of brothers who I will call M to join my group since I know he's a smart person and we were friends. He agreed to be my partner and I thought that was the end of that. The project gets released a month later and it turns out M asked another fraternity brother to join our group and now it's a three person project. The projects difficulty scales according to how many people are in each group. I was surprised but he assured me it was no big deal and that we would be fine. Fast forward to a week before the deadline and zero progress had been made by the other two partners and I had done a fair amount of the starting work. Decided to hit them up and tell them we need to finish it as it's a large chunk of our grade. We meet up lets say on a monday and nothing was really done so I decided to go home and complete it on my own. I didn't end up completing it but luckily it got extended by three days. Great, I hit up my partners again and they both claimed they'd work on it again.... nothing had been done. The last day i'm scrambling to get even a 40% of the marks, but i did not finish. I e-mailed my professor after he had graded it (as i got a 20/100 originally). He emails all three of us to come to his office hours and to present the project, we all agreed today to go. But yet again the same theme, I'm the only one who went. I cannot possibly pass with a grade under a sixty ( The weight of the project is way too big), and I fail I would have to take another semester, pay thousands of dollars, and retake the course so I decided to tell him that I did the majority on my own and that I wanted it to be graded as a single person project instead of a three person. He ended up settling on giving me an eighty instead of a forty five.\n\nTLDR: Did entire project on my own, screwed over friends to save my grade and to graduate on time.\n\nThis happened earlier today and these guys are my friends (though not really that close). I feel really guilty but I did what I had to do in my opinion, my other two friends contributed nothing significant at all. They are younger and can retake the course without having to extend their educating. But I still feel guilty, I want to hear your opinions. AMTI?",

      "title": "AITA for thinking my mom doesn't deserve the majority of my dad's inheritance?",
      "description": "My mom and dad were married for 20 years before my mom decided she wanted a divorce. I could tell for most of my life that my parents didn't get along, but in my 20's they seemed to be fighting more frequently. I believe my mom was emotionally cheating on my dad and asked for a divorce. \n\nTheir divorce was not pretty, my dad was a bit of a basketcase over it and became very depressed. The only thing that seemed to bring my dad's spirits up over the years was the birth of my children. He wanted to spend almost every weekend with me, which was sometimes annoying but looking back I'm grateful and miss our adventures. (Over the years my mom received a nice amount of alimony every month and was entitled to a portion of his pension when he retires.)\n\nSeveral years later, my dad died due to heart complications in his sleep. He had a heart attack a few months after they split and his heart was weak. After his death, we had been contacted by his retirement system regarding his death benefits. Since my dad never retired, my mom will receive some of his inheritance. Well, most of it. I am my father's only living child and initially my mom told me if she were to get anything she would give it to me. Then she said she wouldn't be recieving his pension and is getting part of the inheritance but would like to use the money to help me buy a house or buy a new car, new furniture for my children/house, etc...\"something my father would want.\"\n\nHer and her boyfriend (who I don't care for) are planning on buying two houses, farm land, farm animals, planning on becoming medical marijuana growers, fixing up these houses, among other things. After hearing this I asked her if she was still going to help me out and she got angry and said she doesn't have any left and needs it. I asked her how since the money hasn't been divvied out yet and she began to explain what she needed it for and would have nothing leftover. It made things uncomfortable between us, so I dropped it ...but I've been brewing over it. Not only did she not speak to my dad for several years, but is planning on setting up a nice life for her and her boyfriend with my dad's inheritance. \n\nAITA for thinking my mom doesn't deserve the majority of it or am I being unreasonable and spoiled? I don't think she shouldn't get anything and I understand legally it may be what's  right, but I don't feel like it is ethically. I'm not going to push her on it. But I know if my hubby and I were to split, I would want my children to receive most of it, not him. \n\nTldr- my mom and dad had been divorced for several years prior to his passing. She will be inheriting the majority of his benefits, which she initially said she would like to use to help me and my family out. Now she plans on using it to buy two houses among other pipe dreams her and her boyfriend share and gets angry if I mention what she previously said. AITA for thinking this is wrong?",

But at the same time he calls everyday and just goes off about every detail about what this person said, what this person is asking him to do. He just called and in the middle of his ranting started screaming that someone is calling him...like it's your job to have people call and ask you questions. My issue is he's not even trying to manage his stress. Like he told me that smoking weed makes him more stressed out, but continues to smoke everyday. He is also just a naturally nervous person so it's hard to tell if something is actually a problem or he's just blowing it out of proportion. Then he gets mad when I tell him to just breath, or not smoke weed. Also I have stress in my life too, but I just handle it. I don't feel the need to rant and rave about every issue. It annoys me because, like today it's my day off. I'm at home relaxing, working on art. Then he calls screaming about this and that and my blood pressure goes up, then he gets mad at me etc. So aita for feeling this way and not being more sympathetic?

      "description": "This is a long one, so be prepared.  A bit of background..... My wife and I got married pretty young. We both belonged to a very conservative religion where that was normal.  But sexual repression was also a part of the religion, and thus we were both pretty in the dark as to what our sexual needs were/ had some serious guilt complexes about some \"experimenting\" we did while we were dating.  The first couple years of our marriage were pretty rocky, with both of us doing some things that although most people wouldn't consider infidelity, definitely damaged our marriage (I had a problem with porn, she drunkenly experimented with another girl).  \n\nWe both avoided the discussion we should have had for a long time, but we eventually had some serious talks.  We both knew rebuilding trust was going to be a huge issue, but decided we were going to try to make things work.  \n\nShortly after that, she told me that her depression was pretty bad and that her PTSD had been pretty unbearable (she experienced sexual abuse), and she told me she would like to move closer to her parents, partially for support and partially because they have health problems that would require someone to care for them eventually anyway.   I agreed to the move, and began slowly preparing.  Then she calls me a few weeks later crying, telling me that she quit her job because her co-workers were treating her badly, and her manager was siding with them.  I told her it was ok, and assured her I wasn't mad.  She asked if we could just rush the move, since we were planning to anyway, and just stay with her parents for a month or two while we got things in order.  Against my better judgement I agreed, and within a week we were there. \n\nWell both got jobs right away, and everything was going ok.  But right before we were going to move into the place we had found, a serious health emergency caused me to have to leave work for a couple months, setting us back a bit.  We were starting to get back into a good position when we found out she was pregnant.  This was a complete surprise, because she had been told that she would probably never be able to have kids. I didn't know quite how to feel, but I supported her through the whole thing.  Facing the prospect of so much added expense kind of delayed our plans to move though, so we put life on hold for a bit.\n  Eventually she approached me with the idea of buying a house with her parents, since she would inevitably be caring for them eventually anyway, and them splitting expenses with us so it wouldn't be so hard on us or them.  Again, against my better judgement I agreed (I really just wanted her to be happy, and I was ok doing whatever would achieve that goal.  So we did, and our baby was born shortly after.  \n\nThings were ok for the first few months, and although we had a few arguments I thought things were ok.  But a few days after our anniversary I found out she had been talking to some other (married) guy.  I found it because she left her phone at home and when I picked it up I saw the messages.  I confronted her, and she admitted it.  She swore it hadn't been going on long, and that they had never been intimate.  But then she started blaming me, saying she was lonely, and that's why she turned to someone else.  I reminded her that I had spent our entire anniversary day (only a few days before) trying to talk to her, and she lied and said that her friend was having some kind of crisis and needed her, when the reality was that she was ignoring me for this guy.  \n\n  At first after this I tried to fix things, and she told me she would cut all contact with the guy.  But she then started saying that she wasn't happy, and that she couldn't let the problems we had in the past go.  She bounced back and forth between wanting to end things and wanting to try and repair things, and since we now had a child I patiently waited, hoping we could fix it.  But eventually it came out that she never even cut contact with the guy, and that a week or so later HE told HER he wanted to cut contact and try to fix his marriage. \n\n We were still living together at this point, since we had her parents living with us.  But she said she wanted to just end things.  At this point I  agreed with her completely, and we decided we would just slowly figure stuff out, and separate when we had everything in order.  Later, come to find out, she had been seeing another married guy during this time, and although I wasn't horribly upset, when she told me and asked me if I had been, I told her \"no, I have enough respect for you to at least wait until we aren't living together before I do that\". It's one of the few times I said something pretty hurtful, and it definitely made my point.  She confessed that she felt like an awful person, and I just kind of told her honestly that I thought her breaking up two marriages and two families just to have what she wanted was pretty shitty.   \n\n We are finally at the tail end of the whole thing, her parents resent her for forcing them to move (she can't afford the house on her own, even with their help, and neither can I) and for basically making a promise to help take care of them that she's now going back on.   And for my part, I'm just angry that she took so long to decide she didn't want this, and couldn't let the past go.  Was I a perfect husband..... Not by a long shot!  We both fucked up, and agreed to put that behind us.  I resent her, not for wanting a divorce, but for putting me, her parents, and our child in this situation, and waiting until the point that she did to decide she didn't want to be together.   AITA for holding resentment when I damaged our marriage too?  ",

      "description": "Hey guys! \n\nFirst of all; sorry for posting two AITA in a row, but I just found this subreddit and I do have a few moments of \"did I go step to far?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nANYWAY! For a short intro: \n\nMy family is religious. Very religious! Like table prayers every dinner and church 3 times a week kind of religious. Being Gay has never really been something we talked about in my family, so I don't actually know if I'm just the one black sheep. \n\nI got this new \"friend\" some time ago (I'll call her Moonlight, because that's my nickname for her :3) and we started  getting really close. Before I really noticed I was falling for her, we spend a weekend alone and I ended up kissing her (She kissed back! XD I didn't just jump her with smooches! XD).\n\nIt hits me like a fucking sledgehammer that \"OMG I'm gay!\" (or bi, I don't know yet....)  and I feel fucking horrible! SO HORRIBLE I decide \"HA FUCKING NOPE!\" not gonna tell my family. NOPE! NOT GONNA FUCKING HAPPEN!\n\nThen, around Christmas we have this family dinner, where some of my closest family is over, and my mother asks \"So, how is it going between you and Moonlight?\" (I'm not good at making friends and she knows this) and without thinking I blur out \"I think I love her\" only to realize like .0005 seconds to late I said it out loud. \n\nI'm mortified! \n\nMy family is mortified.\n\nSilence.\n\nEveryone is staring.\n\nI'm freaking out, starts crying like a fucking toddler and leaves the table to hide in the guestroom (I don't live with my parents so I don't have my own room) having a minor panic attack. \n\nMy mother comes in 10 min later and calms me down until I can breath normal and asks me to \"forget that happened and come eat with the family\". I spend almost 30min getting my shit together. \n\n(NOTE: I know how \"wtf just happened?\" this situation looks from an outside perspective, but Imagine your whole family being the KKK and you just blurred out \"I'm dating a Black person!\" Cause that's what it felt like.)\n\nMost of the dinner is really awkward, people are tiptoeing around me and I'm trying to avoid conversations at all costs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to almost a week after and I find out my family has been complaining about me \"ruining christmas for them\" because I couldn't let them celebrate God in their own house without spreading my Gay propaganda. \n\n(Not word by word, but I'm translating to what makes most sense).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: AITA for telling my highly religious family that I'm gay, in the middle of a christian holiday and (potentially) ruining their entire Christmas?

      "description": "Throwaway account for privacy reasons.\n\nMy little sister committed suicide a year ago. It's been hard and has caused a lot of emotional tension within my family, but we are slowly working through it with therapy and family/grief counseling. My mother and I went to visit my sister's grave yesterday, but we had a last minute guest: her boyfriend.\n\nThough I hesitate to call him her boyfriend for reasons that will soon become apparent, it is true that he was the last person to see her alive. They did mutually care for one another and spent time together, so it wasn't completely out of the ordinary for him to want to come with us on the eve of her passing. \n\nHowever, there are a few things that have further soured my already not-great view of him:\n\n* Despite saying how deeply he cared about her, he says that this is the first time that he has visited her grave since her passing. My family has visited several times over the past year, either as a group or individually/in pairs. He had plenty of chances to join us, or even come on his own.\n* They \"dated\" for only 4 months, yet says that he \"knew her better than anyone\". He says this in front of a mourning mother and a brother that not only spent a good portion, if not their entire, life with her. Taking her to and from counseling, hospitals, police stations, and so on.\n* I say \"dated\" because he convinced her to leave her boyfriend to be with him. He also impregnated her, which she later miscarried. I cannot know for sure if this had any impact on her final decision. \n\nThere are other things that have led me to my negative view of him that I won't get into for the sake of brevity. However, my mother wishes to continue inviting this man into our life and home. I can only assume that this is because he is the last person to see my sister alive. From what I understand, it wasn't anything of note, nothing extraordinary, he was just as shocked as we were. However, given his attitude and his role in my sister's life, I want nothing to do with him and would rather him not bother my family again. I have encouraged my mother to talk to her therapist about this, as I don't want her to become codependent on him. And maybe I'm being paranoid or cynical, but I don't want this guy to try and take advantage of my family.\n\nI'm dreading the next time she invites him into our home because she will see how not-thrilled I am, will ask why, and will invariably becomes upset if I tell the truth because I'm denying her the opportunity to indulge in what I think is something potentially unhealthy. \n\nI know she misses her daughter. I miss my sister. \n\nAm I The Asshole?",

      "description": "For context, this was a really bad day.  I had just started that time of the month (I am a girl) during an in-class essay first period.  I'm talking really bad cramps, some of the worst I had ever felt.  During second period I was talking to the friend I eventually got mad at about the pain since we sit next to each other in that class.  It was a science class and we were supposed to do a lab, but all of a sudden I simultaneously felt nauseous and like I was going to faint.  I went to my teacher to ask to go to the nurse, but she could see how bad I felt, apparently my face was really pale.  I was eventually fine, had some juice and pain relievers before taking a nap in the nurse's office before heading to my third period class.  The incident with the friend occurred afterwards at lunch.  This friend had previously teased me about how I ate the same foods every day for lunch (I'm picky, sue me).  A few other friends have also done this, but the difference is they did it in a teasing, friendly way while this friend was almost insulting me.  I had told her a few times that it annoys me when she does this, but she kept at it.  I had a gut feeling she would do it again, and sure enough, right when I approached my friends' table she immediately made a snide comment.  I was still stressed after the experience I just had so I just went off.  I had a twenty second rant, basically saying I didn't want to hear another word about what I eat from her.  When I finished and sat down to eat, she turned to a mutual friend of ours and whispered, \"well you know she does eat the same thing everyday\".  I called her out on it and her defense was that she wasn't saying it to *me*, to which I responded by saying that I can still hear her.  She was quiet after that and never made a comment about my eating habits again.  However, the year after that, I was talking to her and the mutual friend when the incident somehow came up in conversation.  They proceeded to tell me how *funny* my reaction had been, even though they both knew I was annoyed by comments like that and were aware of experience I had gone through that day.  I chewed them out, reminding them of what happened and later I finally got an actual apology from both of them.  The only thing I regret is doing the rant in the cafeteria where everyone could hear, but I'm just glad it stopped and I got an apology.  I might be an a\\*\\*hole for getting mad over a comment, but I was honestly at the end of my rope.",

      "description": "I had my license taken away due to seizures a few years ago, with the help of good meds I've been able to get the seizures down to 12-15/month.  These are all around my cycle (known as catamenial epilepsy) and a simple progesterone IUD \\*should\\* end most if not all my seizures.  Hopefully.  Maybe.  After my body adjusts, 6 months.  We will have to see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order to get my drivers licence back, I need to stop having seizures for a noteworthy amount of time.  In order to qualify for a dog, I need to have seizures.  These run $40,000 and the organization would have me pay a fraction of that (about $2,500 + travel, food, outing expenses).  One of the sucky but necessary things is that you go out with \"your\" dog during training and they try to trigger a seizure with all the distractions around (for example at a mall, park, theme park).  So, if my seizures are bad enough in public, the clock on when I can get my drivers licence back gets reset, but if I stop having seizures altogether then I might be taking a dog from someone who needs it.  The devil on my shoulder says that if I have a dog that can alert me a few mins before I have a seizure (so I can pull over) then I have a better argument for driving, as well as ease my anxiety over having a seizure.  BUT is that even an excuse?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, I have no idea until 6 months after I get the IUD how my seizures will be.  ",

      "description": "I’ve known my step mother (referred to as SM) for 4 years. In that time my reputation of her has gone from indifferent to a perpetual disliking and avoidance. Whenever my dad got remarried to my now SM I tried to be friendly, making casual remarks I thought were funny, playing off mistakes I made as being a goof, and looking past her mistakes. Despite that, SM always had a seemingly bias opinion of my brother and I. She would crack her own “jokes” daily (which consisted of mocking my brother and I’s weaknesses). Whenever my brother and I would voice our displeasure, she would get incredibly defensive and reply, “I was only joking”, “It was just sarcasm!” Sometimes the jokes wouldn’t even be about our weaknesses, but just plain out lies about our hobbies, habits, etc. Recently SM has even been testing us. Misplacing items so that when we don’t find them, she can say “Just goes to prove how imperceptive/lazy you are”, “Just shows how much men rely on women”. The house has felt very women dominated and man demeaning ever since she got here. Because of SM, I now have a lack of confidence in my own skills like if I’m perceptive or not, lazy or not. \n    I ask because I want to know if I’m being to selfish about this. TBH, she does do things for us like cook, clean, vacuum, etc. for us. \nAm I being too negative? Sensitive? AITA?\n",

      "description": "Mobile post, formatting, blah blah blah.\n\nBackstory: I’m currently student teaching high school English and have had issues with my mentor teacher all semester. She sits in the back of the class and texts or distracts kids whenever I try to teach, which undermines me and makes me look like the bad guy when I attempt to get on task. I’ve talked to her and it got better for awhile. She’s awesome at building relationships with students, but it often crosses the boundary of “friendly vs. friend” and disrupts my class. \n\nNow to the situation.\n\nEarly in the day, my mentor had the idea to play a prank on our last class of the day by pretending they had an essay due. I told her that I didn’t want to, but that she could. I hate April Fool’s day, but I’m not about to rain on anyone’s parade. She decided to do it. \n\nLast period comes and her prank is funny and easygoing, the kids laugh, I’m finishing some work while it happens, all is well.\n\nI’m then attempting to start the lesson when two girls - who have a long history of fighting - start shouting and squaring up in the back of my class. My teacher runs out saying she’s getting admin, and I try to keep everyone’s attention off the girls. \n\nShe re-enters with a male teacher and they take one of the girls outside. Again, I attempt to start my lesson and the class follows.\n\nAs we’re getting into our reading, my mentor bursts through the door and starts screaming at my class, “SHE IS OUT THERE BAWLING. WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER? I NEED ANSWERS, NOW. KATIE (the other girl), WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?”\n\nI felt completely embarrassed for my mentor, as I felt like this outburst was completely unprofessional. I finally snap and say, “If you need to have that conversation, take her outside. You need to get out. We’re trying to work.” and my mentor takes her outside.\n\nWe again try to get on task.\n\nMy mentor then comes in with the girls about ten minutes later and the girls say “It was a prank.”\n\nMe: “Okay”\n\nI keep teaching.\n\nThe girls: “That’s it?”\n\nMe: “We’ve already wasted over half our class on pranks. I’m not interested in wasting anymore.”\n\nMy mentor comes up to me in the English office after class, laughing, and I say “Did you help them plan that?”\n\nMentor: “No, but I was told to play along.”\n\nMe: “Yeah, well, you’re the teacher. You’re the adult. You should’ve shut it down. I’m so angry that I’m ready to walk out. That was completely disruptive and disrespectful. How was I supposed to know what that was?” \n\nMy mentor got sheepish and apologized, saying that it wasn’t her attention to disrupt things and make me uncomfortable. I can’t help but feel like a giant asshole, but I felt completely helpless. So Reddit, AITA for being so sensitive? ",

      "description": "So I’m 15 and I have five older sisters, all of which are adults now and have attended the same high school (I’ll call it HS A) that is across the street from us. HS A doesn’t have the best reputation, but has clearly gotten better over recent years. I have always expected to attend HS A, but last minute my parents decided to make me go to HS B, which is a medical science academy located 1 hour away from us. I argued against this all summer, saying that it’s too far and I don’t want to study medicine and because of the distance I won’t be able to do extracurriculars nor get enough sleep (which has all proven to be true) but my parents argued that I shouldn’t attend HS A because “look at what happened to your sisters” (my sisters are all somewhat struggling with their careers and the oldest, age 28, is still in college and living at home), “HS A is bad, HS B is good and YOU’RE GOING TO BE A DOCTOR WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT”\n\nNow let me stress this: HS B is NOT a good school despite the pretty “Academy” logo that makes it seem prestigious and fine. It has possibly one of the WORSE reputations in the district. There are constant fights, lockdowns, and ironically there was a fight in my medical science class that lasted 3 minutes and the teacher didn’t do anything.\n\nMy parents are under the impression that I’ll go bad if I go to HS A, but unlike my sisters, I’ve always been the “good child” who gets straight A’s and never gets into trouble, and I know that that’s not going to change.\n\nIt’s been a semester now that I’ve attended HS B. I’ve always been really bad at making friends so I’m lonely, I’m depressed and I’m always tired, but when I try to communicate this to my parents they call me selfish and stupid for wanting to transfer.  I’m only 15, and maybe I dont know what’s best for myself, but is it wrong for me to want to go against my parents wishes because they make me miserable?",

We have spent a lot of time together and she has pretty much moved into my place now. We also recently went on vacation together. I give this contact so that you know that I've spent a lot of time with her and I've seen her interact with a lot of different people in different context. For the most part, things are fine. However, there is one thing that she does regularly that bothers me. Namely, she steals tips.\n\nwhenever we go to a bar, a restaurant, or take a taxi, I will try to leave a tip for the person working. I only noticed a few days after we started dating, that she would go to the table after we left and take the money off of the table. After I caught her stealing tips from me, I asked her, \"why are you doing this?\" She then told me, \"they do not deserve the money. They were not working hard enough.\"\n\nsince then, I have caught her taking the tip almost every time we have gone out. She will give me the tip back about 20-30% of the time. The rest of the time she will keep it.\n\nI feel like she really doesn't understand how hard it is to work in the service industry, and that she's being a bit selfish.

      "description": "Hey everyone,\n\nAnyway, so I began talking to this girl who was new this year, and she seemed really nice and chill, all in all someone I thought I'd vibe with. Long story short, we began flirting and I asked her to the ball. We were beginning to get to that \"more than friends\" when I realised that she's very clingy, not really what I look for in a relationship. So I told her that I'd be better off with her as friends and that I'd still like to go to the ball with her as mates, but then stuff got even worse. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, I was having shit time as I had lost a friend of in the Christchurch terror attacks.  She fully what I was going through. she sort of just ignored it and sent memes about the topic which I found pretty offensive. As a result I told her I was upset (not about what tho) and just started sort of easing off contact with her - not replying to her messages etc. Around about this time she also told me about how much she liked me and how she wished we were more than friends and could be together and all that.  Remember that clingy part I said? Yeah, that came out full force. She messaged me on snapchat, text, Facebook messenger, both my instagram accounts, created a post on Facebook that only her and I could see and said to talk to her. After all this had failed she emailed me which I just ignored again because I really wasnt in the mood. I began to notice how she was low key very very VERY obsessive with me responding. \n\nI'm a pretty laid back guy, so all considered I decided that i didnt think it was a good idea for me to go to the ball with her as we'd we would ruin it for each other, which I didn't know when I asked her as I hadnt gotten to know her properly. But obviously saying that I didn't want to go to the ball with her because she was over attached would be a huge dick move so I wasnt going to say that, so I thought that I'd just go along with it - I've made my bed, so I should sleep in it I thought. But then she kept telling me how much she liked me, but then she had sex with another guy and told me again that she liked me. At this point I was sort of just confused, and I didn't want to go to the ball with her so I said that, but instead of telling the truth I said that I felt manipulated and hurt when she had sex with another dude after saying she was head over heels obsessed with me and that I don't think it would be a good idea to go together, because I dislike hurting peoples feelings more than necessary but still, that would not have been fun to hear and I sorta regret it because she is really sad now and angry at me. At the same time, I don't think it's fair for me to put up with her ruining my best memory of my last year of school, especially after she memed something very close to me and sort of creeped me out with the obsessive messaging. \n\nAm I the asshole? Should I have just sucked it up? Was it wrong for me to lie about the reason I didn't want to go with her, even if it was to hurt her less?\n\n",

      "description": " \n\nI begin my tale with the death of my mother. She passed away in June 2018 from a very long battle with MS and other complications. She had been sick for over 10 years and handicap for most of that time. During that time my father took care of her all the way to the end. They would have been married 40 years at the end of 2018.\n\nAbout a month later he began dating a woman who was a friend of the family, who has lied to my wife, me, and my brother repeatedly about things. So we were not the biggest fans of her. \n\nFast forward to now, they got engaged, in which my dad broke down my mothers ring (after 40 years of marriage and my pleading with him not too). She came to all of the family holidays (the first ones without mom and that we had asked if she would abstain from coming because it was already hard enough). And now they are married (literally 6 months after mom had died and we buried her). And Dad literally got rid of all of mom's things, even Christmas ornaments that had him, my brother, and I on them still, because it had moms name on it.\n\nSince the step-mom is from a big family, they decided to break 30 year family traditions  without consulting anyone, and said that they are renting a house in the middle of nowhere and they are requiring everyone to be there kids, spouses, and grand-kids (15 people) , so that we can stay indoors all weekend with each other and play games together. Not one of the kids wants to go to this forced mash up of yule-tide-awkwardness. The whole reason behind this gift is because my father is a control freak and because he didn't get his way last Christmas (my brother and I left earlier than we usually would because we didn't want to play games with him and his fiance, like we used to do with mom).\n\nMy wife and I literally scheduled a vacation around the scheduled time they told us so we wouldn't have to go. My dad said that I \"had to be there\" and that they would reschedule to January.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my father that I will not be going to his \"Christmas gift\" to us? AITA for not going?",

      "description": "Sorry about the length but I feel like this needs a large amount of context to understand the actions taken at the end.\n\nSo this happened a while ago (just under a year) and still bothers me to this day because I feel like it m the asshole but I’m not totally sure. Anyways: \n\nI (M18) was friends with a girl (F17, We’ll call her Jen) for around a year and we got along really well. We would talk an excessive amount for around 6-7 months about anything and everything. All the stuff from her past, her dreams and plans for the future and everything in between. I knew every little detail about her. \n\nAfter the 6-7 months, she started dating a guy (M20, He can be called Alan). Now I was completely ok with this and honestly encouraged it because she always seemed to want a relationship and her and I had no interest in dating each other. The relationship seemed to be fine for around 3 months until things started to go a little bit south on her end. She began complaining a lot to me about him and the fights they had. They fought almost every night and I had to constantly be there to pick up the pieces and help her recover mentally. \n\nThis continued for another few months. I tried to give different advice such as to try to be more accepting and reasonable and even suggested she should leave him on one occasion (it was a seriously petty fight that he cause) and I was starting to get slightly sick of how they treated each other as it just seemed childish. It’s also important to note that I had never really met or spoken to this guy however we were aware of each other and I’m fairly convinced he didn’t like me as he was paranoid that she would cheat with me and said this on multiple occasions which caused some of the arguments\n\nThe day I finally met him, we were doing stuff with a few of my friends and he decided to join in. It was all going ok until he ended up starting a verbal fight with a friend of mine. Long story short, he ended up leaving and taking her with him. After the fact, he had the audacity to message me with something along the lines of “nice friends you’ve got there” in which I was furious at and responded with a statement outlining how shitty he treats Jen and how much of a dickhead he was. This caused a fight between Jen and Alan and around 30 minutes of no communication between me and them later, I received a call from Jen in which she was in awful state, one of the worst I’ve ever seen her in. She was saying that I destroyed her relationship and that I was “the biggest cunt on the planet”\n\nI immediately felt an immense guilt so I decided to bite the bullet in a hopes of fixing the relationship. I contacted Alan and we basically came to the agreement that he would forgive her and move on with the relationship if I cut all contact with her. I agreed and then explained in a short message to her that we couldn’t speak anymore and that I hope she’s ok, I then blocked her on everything. \n\nAm I the asshole for arguing with her boyfriend and sharing some of the private information between us? \n\nTL;DR\nI got into an argument with a friends bf and called him out for mistreating her which caused an argument and caused her to hate me. AITA? \n\n",

      "description": "There are 4 characters involved. Adam, Sarah, Karen.   \n\n\nIt's my senior year of college and I'm elected President of my college club. I get pretty close with all of my board members, Adam, Sarah, and Karen. I end up getting vibes from Karen that she likes me. I don't like her back so I maintained a professional relationship with her.   \n\n\nWe have a group chat where we're all quite comfortable with each other. I act like myself in there but 1-1 with her I act professionally. We have a numerous late night calls in the beginning of the fall semester and got pretty close.   \n\n\nOn multiple occasions, Adam brought up people's personal lives. He told us peoples names and their secrets. We felt uncomfortable and told him to stop. But the three of them continued. We end up talking about the people we like. Turns out Adam likes the girl who I got rejected by. I don't really say anything cause I didn't want Adam telling the world all of my secrets.   \n\n\nAdam tells me that he got mad at one guy when he found out he liked his crush. Solely because he liked her. He stopped being friends with that guy. Then another guy liked her and he said he felt sad. Whenever I had an issue with him, I would tell him. But the following days, he would just give me the cold shoulder. I would end up apologizing for things that weren't even my fault, just to save our friendship.  \n\n\nFast forward a couple months and I find out through Sarah that there's a group chat between the three of them where all they do is gush over me for Karen and Adam's crush. I found this really odd so I kept more of a distance between Adam and Karen but I became close friends with Sarah. Sarah tried telling them, \"hey I don't think it'll really work, maybe reconsider\" to save their feelings knowing that I don't like Karen.   \n\n\nSometimes it got extremely annoying. Karen made a comment in the group saying how I looked hot in a sweater. Adam and Karen one night went to where I normally park my car to see if I was still on campus. Karen would analyze my interactions with girls to find out the girl that I liked before.  \n\n\nRecently I confronted them. I told Karen that when she analyzes me, it makes me feel uncomfortable. She  said it was a joke. I told Adam that his crush was the girl who rejected me. I told him he needs to stop talking shit about ppl being their back. I told him that if he has an issue with someone, tell them. I was blunt and didn't sugar coat anything.  \n\n\nI felt bad a day or two later cause I thought I was harsh. Turns out today, he posted a photo on his IG, \"Toxic ppl are like '70% off' sales racks. It all looks good from a distance. But up close, it's just a bunch of useless crap that you don't need.\"  \n\n\nKaren said Adam wants an apology. Adam yelled at me today when I asked if we could talk about what happened. He said, \"CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME SPACE AND NOT TALK TO ME.\" So I got up and left.  \n\n\nI'm graduating in a month. I can't be bothered to apologize anymore. AITA?",

We were on the street in front of the other bar we wanted to go to. \n\nMy boyfriend, 29M, was trying to get the attention of a girl he apparently knew. Which he was successful at, and when she realized it was him, she hopped up into his arms, wrapped her legs around him, and held him for probably 15 seconds. Afterward she introduced herself to me, and she said o hi, and went back to talking right next to his face, as if we were in the club. But we were outside, away from the club. \n\nI got super uncomfortable and decided it was time I went home, so I opened the uber app and walked away, I was planning on just peacing out. But my boyfriend and his friend ran up and started saying “this is just who she is”, which I said was fine but I was uncomfortable with my boyfriend being fine with holding her up while she straddled him... I started crying here so I walked away. \n\nMy boyfriend followed me yelling at me about “what was he supposed to do, drop her???”. Him yelling made me cry more so I just ditched everyone and caught an uber. I’m at a calmer bar now, but I’m just wondering, am I in the wrong here?",

      "description": "This is a crazy long post but I feel like you need the whole picture. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nSeven years ago, I met a guy in my college dorm and we quickly became best friends. Toward the end of the year, we started fooling around. I wanted a relationship but he didn’t. Fast forward about 6 months (and a summer apart), and we decide to get together. At the beginning, he didn’t treat me very well, not because he was a genuine asshole, but just generally immature and I think he still didn’t like me as much as I liked him. However, it is important to note (and you’ll see why in a minute) that our sex life was definitely healthy at this point. \n\nThen, his behavior toward me started changing and I could tell he started to like me a lot more. He started doing things like waiting for me to get in my car before going back in his house and texting me nice things during the day. However, the nicer he gets, the less frequent sex becomes. By year 2-3, it gets to the point where we are having sex about once a year, not even exaggerating. By year 5, this has taken a massive toll on my self-esteem. During a summer abroad, I cheated on him. I’m not trying to defend my actions here, there is no excuse for this. After I got back, I came clean and we tried to work it out. We sat down and wrote out all the things that needed work in our relationship. Things like he needed to pay me compliments, I needed to quit smoking, and most importantly, we needed to have sex much more often. We set to work putting our plan into action. \n\nA few days later, I realized I was super uncomfortable having sex with him. I had no physical attraction to him whatsoever. I think after a couple years of not feeling good enough, I stopped being attracted to him as a defense mechanism. We broke up. However, he was still my best friend, and at this point, we still had 8 months on a lease that neither of us wanted to pay to break. For a few months, things were awkward and sad, but after a little while, things got much better. \n\nFast forward to today. He has been an absolute sweetheart to me these last few months, however, I am still not sexually attracted to him at all. We are best friends, go out to eat all the time, talk on the phone almost every day, etc. He has bought me flowers once before when I had a really bad day, but yesterday, he sent me a beautiful bouquet for Valentine’s Day. This is where I started evaluating behavior over the last few months. Occasionally, he has used sweet nicknames with me or called us going out to eat a “date” (but like sarcastically? Like he definitely knows it’s not a date), but I always would say “no…” and kind of laugh it off. But now that he sent me flowers…I don’t know, I just feel so guilty, like I’ve been leading him on all this time? He knows I’ve gone on a few dates with other people so it’s not like he thinks I’m just waiting to get back with him.\n\nIt’s also worth noting here that he has extreme social anxiety and never goes out or meets new people. His group of friends is the exact same people we met freshman year of college, which would be completely fine, except they are almost all gone. The last two left in town have plans to move in the next few months. I have no desire to cut contact with him not just for my own selfish reasons, but also because he doesn’t have a single other friend left in town. I’ve tried to suggest ways for him to meet new people but every time I bring it up, he gets irritated and defensive. If I cut contact with him, I'm afraid he would spiral into a deep depression.\n\nOkay, holy shit, I’m so sorry for that massive wall of text, but if you’ve made it this far, thank you so much! So Reddit, am I an asshole?\n\nTLDR: Ex and I dated for five and half years. Broke up due to no sexual connection/attraction but have stayed best friends for a year and half. He has occasionally said or done “romantic” things that I tried to shut down but I have not cut contact or anything. I want to stay friends both because I love him (as a friend) and because he doesn’t have any other friends. Does this make me an asshole?",

      "description": "I never had the best relationship with the parents of my gf. They are a bit overprotective of her daughter and never attempted to get to know me better. Even my girlfriend admitted, that she is sick of their behavior, so we stopped trying to get better with them.\n\nYesterday I was about to leave with a few of my friends to train, when suddenly my gf said, that their parents are about to come over for dinner. I asked her if she invited them, but she declined, saying, that they just texted each other and they practically invited themselves. I was a little bit upset, thinking about them just coming over without an invitation after 2 years of practically ignoring me. So I said, that I don‘t want to eat with them and instead go to the gym with my friends.\n\nMy gf got pretty mad, unusually mad for her, and said, that I wouldn’t even try to better the relationship to her parents. Ok, I thought, it’s obviously important to her, so I stayed.\n\nA few hours later they arrived (almost 40mim too late, but whatever) and instantly demanded something to drink. Not even a simple greeting, just an order. \n\nI was already really mad, but played along. After a little bit of smalltalk, my girlfriend made dinner for us. She likes to cook and she likes to do it herself, as she needs her space and peace in the kitchen. Needless to say, her parents used that to lay into me again. That I would never do sth in our flat and so on. I just told them to shut up and went to the kitchen to get a few more drinks.\n\nMy girlfriend finished cooking and set the table. It looked fantastic, but for some godforsaken reason, her parents started lamenting AGAIN!\n\nSo I snapped and yelled at them for being ignorant and arrogant c*nts and that I would throw them out, if it were solely my flat.\n\nWithout listening to anything all of them had to say, I packed my bag and went to the gym. After coming back a few hours later, my girlfriend was asleep and locked the door to our bedroom. I slept on the couch and this morning, she left early without saying anything to me. We haven’t talked since.\n\n\nAITA for leaving all of them alone?\n",

      "description": "I’m getting old. Making regular plans for 6am on Sunday mornings, going to bed at 10 every night, taking care of my parent old.\n\nMy wife and I live in apartment.  After an exciting night of Mario Party on the Wii we went to bed... only to be woken up at midnight to loud bass EDM from one of the neighbours.\n\nThis hasn’t happened in a long time so I just tried to get back to sleep, with some success tossing and turning until about 2 AM.  \n\nBy 2 I had about enough and decided I’d go find the culprit and ask if they could keep it down.  In our hallway I could hear muffled shouts along with the music so I went up stairs, it got quieter, and I couldn’t hear the shouting, went downstairs, down the hall, through the fire doors, around the corner, and now I could make out exactly what was being shouted from outside the apartment.  \n\nThe slurred shouting was from a couple 20 something guys swearing about some confrontation they had already had with someone else.\n\nNow I’ve dealt with some alcoholics in my life and this brought me back - the slurring, the misguided bravado; and I didn’t see coming away from a discussion as anything but an annoying neighbour.   So I went passive aggressive and stopped by the building entrance to buzz their apartment.\n\nNeedless to say not much changed.  Other neighbours were banging walls but their racket just continued, either oblivious or uncaring.  \n\nAt around 2:30 I gave the non emergency police number a call for a noise complaint. After a few minutes they showed up and shut the party down.\n\nNot at all certain what the best way to handle this was.  The music started up again today at noon with singing at the top of their lungs so I just went for a walk.  I’m all for them enjoying themselves but I’m so grateful that I’m not their direct neighbour.\n\nOpen for judgement and suggestions on next steps if the party continues into the evening tonight.",

I lived at home for quiet some time due to that fact.\n\nHowever, I have two older sisters, they both have kids and thus higher expenses in general. But I feel like its not my responsibility to make up for their family expenses?\n\nI have assisted my mom with an average of 800 USD per month and some additional expenses, for instance: dentist bills of 1-2k. And buying flight tickets etc.\n\nNever really mentioned anything, after all shes my mom and my sisters helped her a lot in other ways, mental support with grandkids and taking her out for lunch or to holidays etc. Also, my oldest sister gives her monthly 500 USD. But thats actually for taking care of her son three times a week and also preparing meals for him. So its not really a supportive addition. \n\nHowever, I am currently in a phase where I just dont feel like slaving my ass off anymore.  Its really not how i see my life going. Also I had a tragic breakup with my GF recently.\n\nSo I am planning to go for some travel, while I am still young. But I know there will be a financial gap in my moms books. And I dont wanna put her in any trouble. I ve tried to reach out to my sisters and their standard response is that they have no money... due to kids etc. We will have a session to talk about it, but I can already see the same answers coming...\n\nI am even willing to assist with 50% of what I did until now, but when I am jobless I will just burn through my savings.\n\nShould I just go and let my sisters take care of it? It would not be nice for my mom though since I am sure there would be a discussion that will involve her.

      "description": "Hi there! I’m a 21 yr old female who works a part time student job at my school. Basically, while I was working, a man who I had previously helped about 5 minutes prior came back up to me and said “You’re really cute, can I take you out/have your #”. I simply said “no, I’m sorry, im working.” He then said “oh you must have a boyfriend?” And my immediate response was “No, I’m single.” He looked shocked, like he expected me to have a better excuse for rejecting him. Are you supposed to lie about having a boyfriend to ease the pain of saying no? \nJust curious what other people’s etiquette is like during these awkward moments! Thanks :)",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nMy brother got married recently and he had to deal with my grandma having concerns about his marriage. Mainly the fact that my new sister-in-law isn't particularly religious. My grandma is a devout Catholic and most of my family is as well. She was hounding my brother about how are the children going to be raised, what the ceremony would entail, etc. \n\nDuring the wedding I looked into the crowd(I was a groomsman), and I could see she was visibly upset and beside herself since the ceremony wasn't very religious. My grandma on the other side of my family officiated the wedding and just read some bible verses.\n\nNow I am not religious at all, I'm an atheist but I don't like to say it. The last time I told someone close to me my religious beliefs, they ended a 4 year relationship just a few months later. So needless to say, I tend to keep it to myself. \n\nI'm not currently in a relationship so marriage isn't in my vision right now. I love my grandma, she's a sweet old lady and she's done a lot to help me over the years.\n\nI know that if I do start planning a wedding, that information is coming out one way or another. She may just be upset about a non-religious person marrying into the family, but having one in her family would be devastating. \n\nAm I an A-hole for not wanting to marry until after she's passed away? She's pretty old but if the right person comes along and I do want to marry them, is that a valid reason to delay a wedding?",

No problem, but months later he’d still been forgetting to pay me back. When I confronted him, he told me that he felt like “all the times he’d fed me” (he ordered pizza and I had two slices, two times) meant we’re more than square. I feel like friendship stuff like that shouldn’t come with a price tag, such as the multitude of times he smoked my weed, or when I drove him to his doctors appointment 4 hours away on my day off.\n\nFriend 2 asked my girlfriend to babysit his 2 kids, last minute, for a few days since she was on leave due to a work injury. He’d intended on paying her $300 for 5 days, or $250 for 4, but since she could only do 3 days, she said “How about $200? and he said “Okay”. He tells me that he might not pay her the full amount since he was planning on getting overtime Saturday. I tell him that’s unacceptable and a breach of their agreement, he seems to agree, but when picks the kids up he fights with her for 30 minutes trying to talk her down to $180. I feel like that was incredibly disrespectful to both of us.\n\nMyself and these two friends have the same job, so I feel like our valuation of money should be the same.

When i tell her to shut up because she's being annoying and obnoxious she doesn't care and just continues talking and talking and talking. My parents tell me that I am being a jerk for telling her to shut up and for saying that literally no one f*cking cares.

We each have separate bank accounts but I write the budget. \nYesterday, she gave me her cc (holds debt has been paying down for years and we are  within four months of being clear of it.) to hold on to due to the fact that she has ran up another 500$ or so in Oct and doesn't want to be able to spend on her card. That's not something I have taken control of before. Only a few hours later she texts me at work and asks for me to send her a picture front and back of cc so she can order some stuff for one of her coworkers who says he'll pay her back. Usually she will forget to take that kind of  cash to the bank and instead spend it at her discretion. This has led to the cc not getting paid down. I tell her that until she gave me her card to prevent this and ask why he can't just order it himself? He apparently doesn't work there anymore so cannot. Weird, but whatever. Still a no from me dawg I am holding on to your card for a reason.\nThis leads to a large blowout where she has called me a number of horrible names and made many insinuations that I don't trust her. and it still hasn't cooled down.

      "description": "I work for a medical supply company that does oxygen concentrator checks at a customers home every six months. I have been working there for 2 years and when I was given the task to do the check ups, shortly after I started I was told by my immediate supervisor that we have a log book that tracks what supplies the customer gets and other information from the concentrator. I was told to use the log sheets as my guide for the supplies and all the other information. For instance if Joe Smith in the past has received 2 cannulas and 3 tubing then that is what they get the next time.\n\nThis February I started doing the checks when I came in to work Monday and checked with my supervisor about scheduling customers that I didn't have done yet, he told me that I'm not doing them anymore and that he will be doing them from now on. \n\nThe owner of the business received 2 calls from customers that needed more supplies, both of which I had seen already. One of the customers is at a nursing home who stocks the supplies for the customer and calls when supplies are needed. When I went to check the machine I asked the nurses if they needed supplies while I was there and they said they didn't need any, the customer had inherited another customers supplies after he had died. The other call was from a woman who used up the supplies I had given her (2 cannulas and one humidifier bottle, which was what she had been given in the past) because she had condensation in her line from the old bottle.  \n\nThe owner was livid after getting these calls and wanted to know why we were not leaving 6 months worth of supplies for every customer. (which totally makes sense) I explained that I was doing what I was instructed to do and as far as I know according to the log sheets we had never left 6 months of supplies. My direct supervisor told me that he had talked to the owner and said he had my back and tried to defend me but that the owner still wanted me off the service checks. I doubt that he did this and more than likely covered his own ass but I wasn't there for the conversation so I don't know for sure (he has a history of covering his ass). I felt like neither of these situations were something I had control over and feel like I am being unjustly punished for it. I explained as much to my direct supervisor but all he said was I need to talk to the owner and my direct supervisor seemed not to want to talk about it at all other than saying I made mistakes.",

I said no, they were  'angry, little shits' and she said they were cute and we were messing about. She said they were like cats disguised as dogs, and I said that was why she likes them (she constantly talks about how catlike she is.) Instead of laughing it off, she got offended, so I said I was sorry and I really wasn't trying to be offensive. She said it was fine, but didn't speak for the rest of the ride home. \n\nthe thing is aside from the fact I said sorry, she constantly makes fun of me for being short.

      "title": "AITA for moving out when my parents needed me to financially help?",
      "description": "I graduated from college about a year ago and got a nice job in my hometown in my field. My parents said that I could move in with them and save up money. \n\nAbout a month into living back at home my father was in a car accident that made his already existing spinal issues worse. He does physical labor and could not do his job anymore. His doctor wrote him a note saying that he was unable to work and his place of employment gave him six months of full salary/benefits.\n\nAbout this time he also started a lawsuit with the insurance company since he would need to have surgery on his back.\n\nWe live in a trailer on a piece of land that we don't own. Our landlord passed away recently and her son is from out of state. He is trying to sell our land instead of collecting payments. My dad pulled $12k, which was all he had, out of his 401k to help pay for the land, but he spent all of it on random things (mostly vehicle related) before putting anything down on the land.\n\nWhen he was unable to work I agreed to help pay some bills. I have paid about $400 in bills per month, taken myself off of his insurance plan to get one from my workplace, and got my own cell phone plan. \n\nMy mom only makes around $2.2k/month as a store manager. He would periodically take money out of her bank account before the next month when he got paid.\n\nAbout last September I realized that my dad was living paycheck-to-paycheck on $6k/month when our bills are around $2.5k/month. I knew he bought prescription drugs but now it seemed like that was all he was spending his money on. I had a chat with him and asked him to think about the future; if he was struggling to make ends meet with $6k/month how would he do it with nothing? Then he broke down to me saying he wants to quit buying pills and he swears they help with his back.\n\nHe also had back surgery around October. The surgery did not help his back issues at all and now he has $30k in medical debt to pay off. He applied for disability, but that could take 6 months to kick in.\n\nJanuary 1 was his last paycheck. I thought he had been saving up after our chat but apparently not. He said I needed to pay off my mom's car by putting $5k down. He promised he would pay me back when the lawsuit goes through (which I don't know if it will and even if it does, he has never paid me back before). I refused to pay off my mom's car. I told him I was living at home to save up money and I have tried to make it easier by paying bills and reducing the cost of their bills. Then I told my parents I was going to move out and began looking for a new place to live.\n\nI was not about to go down with my parents because they lack financial planning. Now they both don't have a 401k, one has a meh job, and the other cannot work. Neither have savings.\n\nI moved into the new apartment yesterday. Something else also happened yesterday, my workplace began offering early retirement plans to everyone over 62. I think this means layoffs are in the future, but I do have enough saved up to live on until I find another job if worse comes to worse.\n\nMy parents haven't spoken to me yet, but I know they are upset. I feel bad too because I love my parents, but I felt like I had to put myself first. \n\nTL;DR: My dad lost his job after an auto accident. Pulled all of his retirement money out and didn't spend it on anything meaningful. He got addicted to prescription drugs. I tried to help with bills. When his money ran out he wanted me to pay off my mom's car; I refused and moved out.",

      "description": "As a bit of background information, my family is divorced and I am living (90%) of the time with my sister and my mom. I love them, but I feel as if I don't get along with them or agree in their morals or ways of thinking. My mom has a good heart, but she has caused me so much trouble in life when it comes to relationships with others, emotional / physical abuse, and her narcissistic behavior that has just broken that close bond that was previously there. My sister also has a good heart, but our personalities differ greatly. As I briefly mentioned earlier, she genuinely cares about me and wants the best for me. I had surgery this past Friday and she was crying for me and bringing me food / water when I was unable to do so. This being said, she is irresponsible when it comes to partying, her friends are bad influences, and her boyfriend doesn't care / encourages this type of behavior. I recognize this isn't all her fault as her boyfriend and friends aren't good influences, but I believe she knows some of what she does is wrong and I have told her before. She's very immature and doesn't take criticism well. Objectively, I believe my mom and sister can live whatever life they want. Have at it. I just don't want to be a part of it. The reason I'm asking if I'm an asshole is because today my mom and sister both were upset with how much (they claim) I am an asshole to them. They claim I take their company and care for granted, and I treat them like shit. To an extent I feel as if I do take their company and care for granted ; but only due to the fact that I literally can't sustain myself as a 17 year old kid in high school. I have no other choice. This conversation originally derived from my sister asking me what I was talking about with my friend in my room and I told her to mind her own business and I didn't want to talk about it. \nI don't yell at my family or argue with them much, I just avoid them and keep conversation to a minimum. After college, I plan to move away and start my own life; without any of their interference. At all. Am I an asshole for wanting this? Am I an asshole for not liking my family in general?",

While shopping I finished both of my water bottles, so breathing became very difficult because where \n\nWhere I live the air is very dry and that didn't help my throat. I then told my mom about how it was becoming painful to breathe and talk, and she ignored that and continued shopping. 5 minutes later I told her again and she told me that we needed to go to Bostbo so I had to endure it longer. \n\nAt this point I couldn't swallow.\n\nBefore she drove me to Bostbo, I could barely breathe at all. I told her again and she very angrily agreed to going home.\n\nJust now I saw her again and she gave me very dirty looks.

      "description": "A bit of background here.. we’re both in our mid 20’s and we’ve been together for nearly four years, lived together for the past three. In the beginning of our relationship, I’ve been working a stable, average office job for the past several years, while my gf was working random jobs to get by. She wanted to get into grad school, but she needed experience in the field so she ended up taking $10/hr jobs bathing and cleaning butts all day in a nursing home lol.\n\nFast forward a year later, she gets into grad school. She completely relies on her student loans, so she’s pretty broke. I don’t want her to take out anymore loans, so I let her stay in my place for free. I own the place, and she pays for groceries, gas, etc from time and time so it works out. She eventually graduates and finds a job she really likes. We decide then to split bills 50/50.\n\nHowever, she still says she’s broke pretty much all the time. She tells me she has 100k in student loans and that she has to continue being frugal. She doesn’t buy any new clothes, clips coupons, eats beans and rice everyday, still drives her 10 year old car, etc. I feel bad for her because I live very comfortably, so I ended up paying for a majority of our date nights. I love to travel, and saw that my gf would work overtime a lot (which really stressed her out) to pay for her share of the trip, so I just offered to pay her portion. \n\nThis continues on for a couple months until I came by her paycheck on the kitchen table. It was nearly double what I made!! I’m feeling pretty deceived, so I confront her and ask about it. She says she does make a good amount, but she has nearly a $1k student loan payment every month as well. She says she’s been making 3x the min payment to get rid of the student loans ASAP. At this point, I’m just thinking about all the expensive dinner dates I paid, all the trips I paid for, nice gifts, etc. It adds up to be a lot. She doesn’t see it from my point of view, saying she never asked for expensive dinners or trips.. but she would constantly say she was “broke,” which led me to think she was struggling.\n\nAnd yes, I never asked about her salary because I thought she was going to be making an average amount like myself. She’s in the medical field, which I’m not familiar with and she has the word “assistant” in her job title. I didn’t think someone could go from making $20k/year to six figures, honestly.\n",

      "description": "Every year, the upperclassmen at my high school participate in a huge Assassins tournament. It's a great school tradition and I had great fun doing it.\n\nStudents compete in teams of three, and each team submits a $15 registration fee. With at least 100 groups, that adds up to about $1,500 in the hands of one Senior, with no oversight from staff. The official manual, published via Instagram, stipulates that 60% of the proceeds go to the first-place team and 20% to second place. That leaves 20%, or about $300, not accounted for.\n\nI commented on the Inatagram post, politely asking for clarification. She immediately lashed out in very insolent, derisive terms against \"y'all,\" presumably the Juniors or the student body in general and said we're lucky she doesn't take 50%. I reposted the comment thread and stated that I don't approve of her profiting off of student money in a way which was not disclosed beforehand and which no one consented to, but no one wanted to hear it and everyone thought I was just complaining about something trivial and trying to run their game.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "title": "AITA For Having Slight Road Rage While Driving To Work During A Snowstorm?",
      "description": "I live in Wisconsin and we have a Winter Storm Warning going on currently where we are expected to receive 7-13 inches. The heaviest snow was supposed to fall last night and into this morning which made the roads pretty bad. I was expecting all this going into my drive this morning, so before I begin to complain, I will admit, I am the asshole. However, I want to see how many others feel the same way as I do when driving along others during snow storms.\n\nSo the first thing that started to tick me off is that I was driving on the freeway in the left side lane. The freeway has 4 lanes, but the two far left lanes were the best in terms of mostly cleared of snow. You could see the actual road in my lane so it was smooth riding for the most part. I was pleasantly surprised by all of this and was starting to think it would be a quick ride until I caught up to the car in front of me (lets call him X). There were literally 0 cars ahead of X for at least a mile, but he/she decided to continue going 20mph on a 70mph freeway. Normally I just cruise behind cars like this at a safe distance due to the circumstances of the snow, but we were literally driving on solid pavement, with snow in between the tires and the road, and there were 0 cars in front of X. I didn't do anything reckless; I just stayed behind for the 10 miles I had too before finally finding a clear lane to pass him in without causing any issues.\n\nThat was the first thing that happened that started to make my road rage boil. I thought that was the worst thing that could have happened, but no. Shortly after passing X, three cars entered on the same freeway about a mile ahead of me. They all went into the second left lane (the one to the right of me) as it was the clearest compared to the far right lanes. No problem. I was cruising around 40 mph with no one ahead of me and was happy. But, for whatever reason, the 2nd car (Car Y) from the 3 that entered on the freeway ahead of me, decided to merge into my lane about 1/4 mile in front of me. Now, I was going 40mph while all 3 of the cars were going around 25mph, but Y apparently didn't care about me. Right when he merged, I had to brake as Y decided to stay at 25mph, max. Again, 0 cars in front of Y!\n\nI can't say for sure, but after my experience today, I bet that majority of accidents during weather like this is caused by idiots that take too much caution when driving which actually create more dangerous situations. The same rules apply when driving in terms that the left lane remains to be the fastest while the others are slower. This rule should still be considered if the two left lanes are cleared and if there are cars that want to go faster in the left lane! I'm not saying this for my own good, but more for those drivers who don't care about their safety, or others, and will ride your ass until you move over. Situations like this usually don't end well. Also, if you want to switch lanes, make sure you take into account the speed of the cars in the lane you are switching too. If I hit a patch of ice when I had to brake, I would have just rammed Car Y due to their lack of awareness. Even though I probably would have been at fault, I would have went ape shit on the person for being a complete idiot.\n\nSo, I'm curious to know how many others feel the same as I do when driving in snowstorms.\n\n  \nTLDR; If it is snowing, don't just think driving slow is what you need to do. Be considerate of the other drivers on the road because not everyone is going to drive slow. Don't trust other drivers.",

Also concerned that 5 years down the road they might want to transition or something as they're \"genderfluid\" which I don't really buy into myself.

      "description": "So I’ve been talking to this guy for about two months now. I have some trust issues, so to cope I start building trust with some smaller stuff. And since texting is a little hard to read subtexts with, I much prefer phone calls. Usually guys either say they aren’t into those, which is fine and I don’t push it. Or they call me a few times before we get more ‘serious’. Never had any issues with this before... until Ryan. \n\nFor a little background, I’ve recently had a small surgery and I’m home recovering. He said he’d keep me company and that he wanted to meet me so he could make sure I’m eating well etc. But I haven’t heard from him most of the weekend.\n\nAlso, we matched on Tinder and haven’t met yet. \n\nOk...\n\nIn the beginning, I asked him if he’d be okay with having a phone call.  I told him I prefer it over text especially if I plan on seeing that person. He said he’d love to! But every time it came to call, he’d ghost me. Then the next day he’d have an excuse as to why. “I was really tired”, “I didn’t have my phone, I went to hang with my roommates/play video games”. Eventually I told him I didn’t like that he didn’t do what he said he would do, even if it’s a little thing like a phone call. Then he told me he’s just been single for awhile and would really like me to bear with him while he gets used to having to ‘answer to’ someone else. I decided that was a really valid reason, and understood his anxiety. \n\nHe did call once after that and it was really nice. We had a great conversation and I told him I appreciated his honesty with me. \n\nHowever, since then he’s bailed a few more times. Most recent being last night. We were going to discuss plans for our first date... which was supposed to be lunch today. But I haven’t heard from him since he said he’d “100% call me after Walking Dead”. \n\nI’m starting to get the vibes that he just isn’t into me, and is too nice to say anything. Or maybe I’m just asking too much.  I’m thinking if he nails again, but on IRL plans, I should just give up and set my sights on someone else. \n\nWIBTA if I do that?\n",

      "description": "A throw away cause of course, but AITA for hating the hotel room we are staying at (and currently in) for the last night of our 10th anniversary trip even though I said don't cheap out?\n\nSo it's the last night and the plan was to stay close to the airport so it's easy to hit our morning flight.  But this place sucks... Just to start the bathroom has impressions of pipes (of the glass smoking variety) melted into the top of toilet seat.  And everything, I mean everything, is rusting in there. Even down to the electrical sockets leaking blue rust because I assume someone smoked a ton of meth in there.  You can't set anything on the counter cause someone leaned on it and it tilts so forward everything falls off.  Also the glass from the bathroom window pulled away from the frame and I had to kill a bunch of bugs in the bathtub before giving our kids a bath.\n\nWhen I mentioned to my wife I didn't like the hotel she picked out she freaked out and got mad.  Said \"We are not rich and can't afford to stay in the Best Western Plus down the road!\".  I'm a software developer and we can afford the $200 a night stay.\n\nTL,DR; wife got pissed cause I didn't like the hotel she picked for our 10th anniversary trip.",

      "description": "Hello everyone! \n\nSorry for my English, I’m not a native speaker. \n\nI’m not sure if this fits this sub, but I couldn’t think of any better ones so here we go! \n\nI am a home cleaner. After every gig, I can go to my work profile to see my ratings. I have lots of regular customers, for example one customer wants a cleaning 2 or 4 times a week, etc. \n\nSince I started my job (around November) I was a regular cleaner for this family who I instantly fell in love with. There was a pregnant woman, a toddler, a grandma and the husband. They were all extremely sweet and friendly, one of my best customers. \n\nWe get rated for our quality, behavior, on time and overall. The first time I got a 4 star rating on my quality. The woman asked me to use the bigger vacuum cleaner instead, since the smaller one isn’t that good. She said there were some small stuff and dust near the shoes area. I understood and was still happy. \n\nThe next time I paid extra attention to the floors and did everything else really well too. I went home to check my rating and I got 4 stars for quality. I was confused as to what was wrong, and next time I asked was there anything I missed, was she satisfied etc. She said everything was perfect and nothing went bad. This time I’m a bit upset because the ratings affect my pay. During this time my boyfriend didn’t have a job and we were struggling hard. \n\nThe time after that I wanted to make her extra happy and hopefully get 5 stars. I stayed a bit extra to make sure everything was perfect, cleaned the kitchen sink and got rid of yellow stains (we don’t need to do deep cleanings so this wasn’t necessary). I go home and check my ratings, I have 3 stars from her. This time I cry a bit (I’m a bit sensitive, this is also my very first job) because I like them so much and try so hard to make them happy. I feel like she didn’t appreciate what I did for her and she didn’t even say what was wrong in the comments.\n\nNext time I ask her if everything went well, what was the problem, etc. She said everything was perfect, she was really satisfied but there was a tiny speck of dust under the nightstand. I asked her multiple times if anything else was wrong, she said no. Now her house is very big, a 2 storey house. It takes a lot of effort to clean it, and I put a lot of hard work into it. It hurt me a lot because she ignored everything else I did and focused on the small speck of dust and gave me 3 stars for it. \n\nI tried to try again with her. Next time I went there, she wasn’t home but her mother was to watch her toddler. I paid extra attention to under the nightstand, checked everything many times and had some extra time so I scrubbed the kitchen and bathroom floors to get rid of deep stains and also ironed the clothes that were out of the drying machine (?). \n\nI go home and I see 3 stars AGAIN. I ask my company to call her and ask what was the problem. They said that she wants me to pay extra attention to under the dining table, because there was some food on the floor. The thing is, her toddler and her mother went to eat AFTER I cleaned. I know she drops food on the floor because I always clean that area up. At this point I felt I was treated very unfairly and that she was ungrateful. \n\nI told my company to remove her from my list and to find another cleaner for her. They said this and that, because customers want regular cleaners and changing cleaners/customers is hard. I stood my ground because I was so stressed and I felt so bad about it. They removed her in the end. \n\nNow my question is (I’ll try to sum it up), was I in the wrong? Or was I reasonable for not wanting to do gigs at her place anymore? \n\nPlease tell me what you think, I would really appreciate it! ",

Its just so much easier for everyone involved. We have plans to meet my Husbands side of the family tomorrow for lunch.\n\nMy SIL and her Husband have chosen not to partake in any alcohol. Part of this is in solidarity with her FIL who is a recovering alcoholic (15-20 years sober). Another part of it is because they are very religious and they believe it is a sin to drink alcohol. Not like Jesus made wine or anything, but I digress. Their lives, their choices. \n\nToday while my husband was asking where they would like to go for lunch my SIL asked us not to drink anything alcoholic in front of her children (3+4). The big kicker here is that she requested that we go to a local brewery for lunch!! I just cannot get over the irony in her texts today. \n\nMy knee jerk reaction was anger initially. Who the hell do they think they are? I simply told my Husband that I am an adult and will be ordering whatever I feel like during lunch. We are all in our late 20s/early 30s, and plenty old enough to decide what we would like to drink. Husband said the choice is mine, but that he wont drink out of respect for his sister.\n\nTL;DR: SIL and family chooses not to drink alcohol, but wants to do family lunch at a brewery. Asked us not to drink alcohol in front of her kids. \n\nWIBTA if I ordered a flight of beers to sample while at the same table as my non alcoholic in laws? ",

      "description": "I’m currently in high school even though I dislike it I still try to be in the best mood and nice to people. For the past 2 months I feel as if my Spanish teacher secretly hates me and has showed the class for the past month or two. For example I had my papers out and she ether takes them away or announces obnoxiously to the class how I have them out. And I will admit sometimes in class I crack a joke try to fit in with the crowd you know, but whenever I peep she gets pissed off at me. She also doesn’t seem to mind any students that say bad things about me or threaten me. It’s especially annoying when the students she likes the most are annoying when ever I try to make a joke or say something out loud she gets extremely mad at me. I’d also like to mention I don’t take the class seriously because the teacher hates me and I’m not going to be a total asshole. Today I had some one paper in the ground she picked it up took it and read it too the class while trying to sound like what I wrote down was absurd or foolish. At the end of class when everyone left I asked her can you please not be obnoxious or rude to me? She looked very shocked and started getting mad at me she said we’ll discuss this later (lol suspension). I feel bad now after considering the fact that sometimes I technically am rude in the class from earlier about the jokes and saying the wrong things etc. ",

      "title": "AITA for telling my roommate no one cares about anyone and that she needs to go outside more?",
      "description": "Okay... So I (22m) have this random roommate (20f) who is a little socially awkward. She is extremely nice, but was home schooled her entire life so there are certain things about social dynamics that just go entirely over her head. A lot of times, I think these misunderstandings cause her to get taken advantage of especially since we live in a party-centric college town. She always brags about how in high school she used to rob people of their drugs and a lot of her friends were in gangs etc. She brags about it like she ran the game, but from an outsiders perspective it sounds like her insecurities caused her to confuse friendship with people who manipulated her into committing crime for them.  The first week she moved in she was breaking up with her abusive boyfriend who she only dated for 2 months but supposedly hit her and cheated on her for the duration of that time. She doesnt have many friends, and is always talking about how people in town use her and how nobody cares about her. \n\n\nNow, a few months ago I also broke up with my partner of 3 years and was also left in a situation where I had very few friends. There was a short period of staying inside and grieving but soon I decided I needed to just leave the house and start working on myself. I made a point to regularly walk out the front door without any plans and figure out something to do other than mope. I made a point to \"do my own thing\" and spend my time doing activities I enjoy and by doing that Ive almost unintentionally met a lot of really cool people with similar interests and I would say that I have a very positive/thriving social life at the moment. \n\n\nMy roommate has been in this anti-social grieving period for 4 months now and I have to say the amount of time she spends laying around the apartment (watching my tv...) is not only unhealthy but its gotten to be a little gross frankly. Shes turned the living room common space into her depression pit, and shell literally spend all day watching tv, going to work, and then watching tv all night. The whole room is covered in food wrappers, weed crumbs and spliff ash, and she sits on the same spot on the couch for so long that i think shes single handedly ruined it. When I ask her to clean up shell either pull the depression card, or clean up and let it fall back into a state of disrepair almost immediately. \n\n\nI also have depression so I get this entirely, and I've tried to be kind and understanding of how easy it is to get caught up in negative thought pools like this, and shes expressed before that shes particularly sad she has no friends so Ive always tried to be nice about it (youre doing good! dont worry so much about other people! do your own thing! work on yourself people flock to self positivity! youre a cool person!). Well...  About 3 nights ago she tells me shes going to drive 7 hours to pick her abusive ex up from the airport because she is still friends with the guys grandma... \n\n\nI lose my cool a little bit, mainly because she left the apartment in terrible state and my ex had also tried to get back into contact with me recently so it hit home. I tell her \"thats the worst idea ive ever heard, thats super counterproductive to this whole self respect/positivity thing. why are you still talking to this dudes grandma? thats kinda weird you should just cut ties. Shes only wants to still be friends because old people are kinda lonely and vulnerable like that and you shouldnt because her grandson abused you so its kinda a bad look and also a bad idea.\" She agreed and thought what I was saying was funny, because I think she appreciated someone shit talking her ex. \n\n\nSo that situation settled down but then last night she was telling me about her friend, lets call him Ben, who supposedly was a pretty bad dude. She bragged to me about how one time they robbed a kid of his drugs, and how he had been shot once, and how last time he visited he threatened to pull a gun on someone for saying something racist. Im spooked. In response to this I let her have it. I tell her how dumb it is that she glorifies crime like that, and that everyone in all these stories sound like theyre just taking advantage of her, and how petty it is to think I would be impressed by her friend pulling a gun on someone because they were offended. I tell her this dudes not welcome to visit ever again because I dont want to feel on edge in my house. \n\n\nto this she says \"you know hes my best friend right?\"\n\n\n\nI flip out. I tell her hes not, I tell her how naive she is to think that, and how shes just looking for someone to care about her and thats futile because if shes really looking to get out of this depression pit and find a healthy social circle shes got to understand that nobody inherently cares about her (other than her mom). I told her she needs to grow up and stop seeking fulfillment from other people, and to instead try to find it in herself otherwise literally everyone will take advantage of her if they see her just riding peoples coat tales begging them for affection. I tell her that she cant find fullfillment if shes sitting around smoking weed and watching tv all day, and that theres freedom in understanding that nobody cares about her because it means she has the ability to find whatever it is she likes and to do it with the knowledge that everything is her choice. I told her that this requires organization and that organization is socially valuable, and that whether she likes it or not, being friends with someone is inherently an exchange of resources (tangible and intangible) so she cant expect to just be innately favorable in this social hierarchy simply because she exists. It told her even though it sucks and its a sad game, its just the way it is so she has the choice to sink or swim but that shes not allowed to bring sketchy people into the house ever because I promise her theyre not her friends and I dont want to be robbed..\n\n\n\nSo anyways this morning (while i had friends over....) she put on a public display of crying on the kitchen floor about how nobody cares about her and how I agree no one cares and how mean I was. I told her I wasnt trying to be mean but Im very honest about the advice I gave her. Honestly I dont care about her enough to seek friendship, but empathizing with the place shes in, I want her to get out of it and I want her to respect herself. And I want to have a not disgusting living room.\n\n\n\nTLDR:\n My roommate is depressed and doesn't understand shes making bad choices imo. I was extremely blunt about the way I viewed her situation and offered some prickly advice about how not to be, because depression is something I understand. \n\n ",

      "description": "In college I had a friend named \"Jane\". I miss her, but I stopped talking to her because of two incidents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 1st one was dealing with her long time crush, \"Stan\". She had already told to him that she liked him. He never responded to her so she moved on and still was friends with him. Good for her, right? No.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe kept being a jerk to her about her hanging out with other guys (platonically or romantically). Before he graduated, their mutual friends had an intervention and asked him what his deal was. He confessed that he liked Jane but didn't feel like he could ask her out. Once Stan graduated I thought it would get better. But he came back. He just hung around campus all the time and looked for her. I was started to get annoyed because it was clear he was a creep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Jane graduated, a couple of friends wanted to go to a concert in my hometown. I didn't want to go but I didn't want Jane to go alone. Then Stan was going to go, too. The first thing he said in the group chat was how Jane couldn't stay at his place. I clapped back that she was staying with me. I thought the whole thing was a bad idea but she wanted to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the concert rolls around, I drive Jane to town and we hang out the whole day.  Our other friends ditched us even though they had our tickets and hadn't given us a meet up time before the concert. I was happy because fuck Stan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen Jane's friend texts her that Stan is sending out pictures of dildos saying that Jane needs one. I told her that he was being a fucking creep. It's messed up that he would be so openly disrespectful about her. We agreed to skip the concert. Thinking it was over I took a quick nap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater, Jane wakes me up and asks me to take her to the concert. I just got up and drove us to the concert. During the ride, I told her that I didn't understand why she wanted to be near this creep. She said that she wanted to prove to him that she was fine without him. The kicker is that he didn't even show up until way late. And he showed up with another girl. Who he ignored in favor of staring at Jane the entire night. I was so upset that she put herself in that situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2nd incident was years later. After I graduated, I could only get part time work. She wanted to have a reunion between me, her, and another friend (never involved Stan). She wanted to fly to Atlanta and spend the weekend there, but it probably wasn't going to happen. She was asking me the week before she wanted to go and I didn't have the funds. I couldn't book any affordable flights andI let her know the next day. She got pissed since she had already got her ticket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I lost my patience. I couldn't believe that she was being so unreasonable. I stopped talking to her.",

      "description": "I have been at my job for about 6 months now and have never been late or taken any sick days. Last week I started feeling lousy near the end of the day. About 10 minutes before the day was over I said to my boss “Hey I’m not feeling well and have like 30 minutes of overtime. Mind if I head out a bit early?”. Now just as a side note, if you have overtime leaving early is no problem, but still should ask. \n\nOn my way home I was like “Alright need to get this hair cut out of the way and then I’ll just go home and go to bed early.”. After my hair cut I ate dinner and then started vomiting the rest of night. I tried to head into work the next day, but was still very sick and decided to use my first sick day in 6 months. \n\nI go back to work the next day and about lunchtime my boss says “I need to see you in my office”. She is upset and tells me she feels “very taken advantage of” because I had gotten a haircut after leaving early. I tried to explain to her that I meant no disrespect and that I really wasn’t feeling well. She said “well when I don’t feel well I don’t go get a haircut”. I then explained that I wasn’t performing at 100% and thought it would be best that I left rather then sit at my computer for the next 10 minutes working slower than normal. She wasn’t having it and started to get frustrated at my explanation. \n\nI decided to apologize again today and reassure her that I would never take advantage of her or lie to her. When I told her this she said “Well what am I supposed to think?” And stuff like “sick people don’t get haircuts” so she’s basically calling me a liar I feel like. She also said something like “quit making excuses and accept that you are wrong” which really irked me because I’m not wrong (or am I?). I was sick... Anyways she started talking about how HR takes this stuff very seriously and that I shouldn’t have said I wasn’t feeling well if I was able to go get a haircut. \n\nI was just casually telling her the truth and didn’t think it was going to be a big deal. I was well enough to get a haircut, but wanted to leave work a little early because I was feeling blah and wasn’t working at 100%. I honestly feel like what I did was MORE ethical than what she is asking because she’s basically saying that I should have just said “Hey I want to go home” when in reality I was just saying the truth “Hey I don’t feel well mind if I head out early?” \n\nI am extremely upset and offended over this because honesty and integrity are like core parts of who I am. If my boss can’t recognize those qualities after 6 months, I feel like I am wasting my time working for this company. In my mind if she is giving me so much grief for this, there’s no way I’m going to be able to progress at this company. I’m 27 so getting lectured about a haircut is extremely belittling.\n\nAm I the asshole for leaving work early and getting a haircut? Was it unethical for me to get a haircut? ",

      "description": "First, she is more of a lady I used to hook up with then a friend. She is someone I met on a holiday resort and she lives a few hours away from me, so it was never anything serious. It ended badly but we recently got back in contact and agreed to put water under the bridge and try and be friends. She had a bit of a nervous breakdown last year and is trying to build her life back up. If you want any other details on the back story, ask and I'll answer.\n\nThe other day, she texts me to tell me she is planning a massive road trip all over the country, where she is hoping to meet with as many friends as possible. She was hoping to meet me during this road trip. Last year, I opened up my own business with a friend. We have a shop and we work a lot of hours. In fact, we both only get one day off a week. The days we do work, we are usually there for 12+ hours a day. We are still in our first year so we are still finding our feet. We have a few staff members but can't afford to have them work full time &amp; cover for us to have more time off. That's the situation. I don't like it but it's what I have to do to make it work.\n\nShe texts me to try and arrange the possibility of meeting during her road trip and see if she could make it round my way. I told her my only day off is a Wednesday, so if she happens to be near where I am on a Wednesday I'd be happy to meet her.\n\nThis did not please her. She got really shitty with me. She seemed to be upset that I wasn't doing more to try and meet her and said that I didn't respect the fact that she would have to travel so many miles to meet, yet I wouldn't change things so I could meet her. The thing is, this is the best I could do. I get one day off a week. I don't want to tell her it's ok to come my way when I can't guarantee I would be able to get the time meet her.\n\nI got very frustrated with her because she then kept blowing me off, telling me she doesn't care. But when I left it alone, she would start having a moan at me again, complaining that I'm not willing to change things to be able to meet her, even though it's beyond my control. Remember, she is the one who has decided to take this trip. I never expected her to come all the way here just for me. I merely told her that the best I could do was for her to let me know if she was able to make her way near where I live on the day I have off. If she can't then we could always arrange to meet another time.\n\nPerhaps I'm not explaining it very well. If you guys wants to read the chain of texts between us, here they are\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nJs4cOi\n\nI'm feeling bad because as you can see, I went off a little bit on her. I know how her mental state can be. But I really feel like she was being unfair and was angry at me for something I can't control.",

Immediately I got upset and he apologized and said he meant to say my name. They broke up like 8 months ago and supposedly haven’t been talking. I was upset and said I needed time alone. He said I was overreacting and it was no big deal. I wanted to be mean and yell but I just asked for him to leave for a bit so I could down. Am I overreacting to the situation?

( I already tried before to socialize with them but it didn't really worked ). I am the social ankward type of person and I'm really afraid to be left alone at a place where I would be  stuck\".\n\nI do realize that it means a lot for her to be around the one she loves but I know I will be uncomfortable and I will not enjoy her party , but I said to her that she should go and have fun with her friends even if I'm not here. \n\nI told her we could do something only both of us but she told me that \" She didn't want to choose between her friends and me \". I still don't understand what she meant by that.\n\nNow she's upset at me and told me that she will cancel her party and all our other plans ( We were going to a three day festival and to a concert in a few month ).

But I wanted to ask this anyway\n\nSo around 9th Grade (Canadian guy) in the fall of 2016 I met this guy, who we’ll call M. Now at first, he seemed like a really cool guy and we immediately became friends. And we hung out a lot.\n\nHowever, around the beginning of 2017, I started to notice the signs of trouble. As soon as I started talking to him, my grades began to go downhill. I barely passed any of my classes that year. His behaviour was beginning to take a toll on me.\n\nNow in Canada, we have exams at the end of every semester. Exams in January and at the end of June before summer vacation starts. And he skipped ALL of them. He began smoking weed and drinking and this obviously took a toll on his academics. He even skipped classes frequently. Worst part is that he would lie about getting laid by like seven different girls which I believed only because he’s my friend, I obviously knew he was lying.\n\nIt was around the end of the year and many people who knew M or have heard about him have been wanting me to stop being his friend due to his behaviour. So that’s what I did\n\nHe thought I was a nice guy and always had my back and I feel bad for letting him go, but I had to cause he was destroying my future. Am I the jerk?\n\nTldr: Had a friend, enabled his destructive behaviour which took a toll on my grades, cut him off around 10th grade \n\n",

      "description": "Hello everyone, I would like your opinion on this matter as I am at my wits end lately. My bf (m32) and me (f30) have a son (19m) together. \n\nIt has always been a rocky relationship and our son was not planned but very much welcomed by me and the bf didn't want him, had abortion in mind but when he realized I was keeping him no matter what (I told him it was his decision alone and I would accept whatever he wanted to do and make it work that way for the 3 of us, everything from not being in his life to continuing on living together) he decided to stay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have different backgrounds. He has 5 other siblings, his mom is somewhat NOT a housewife (despite having 6 children weird right?), he has not been raised to be a fucntioning adult. The kids always were on their own as mom decided to go work when the youngest one was a year old and dad was always away at work as well. \n\nSo these kids, are all nice people, but have not gotten any proper bringing up. Rules, consequences, and especially cleanliness were never an issue at that home. There was a lot of lying to get out of trouble. I understand, that that is what happens when you leave 5 little kids mostly to their own and I try to understand when the bf lies or does not clean up properly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was raised by a mom who went to boarding school for 2 years to learn how to be a housekeeper (but for the industrial sector meaning she was employed mostly in say old people homes and the like). \n\nI have a brother who is 9 years older so I was raised mostly as a single child one would say but I learned to share and all that as my brother obviously was there we just didn't have much in common. \n\nI was raised to make my own doctors appointments instead of just letting the issue get worse and worse, was raised to look after my posseions propery, to take care of things and clean them and keep a clean house (and when I say clean I mean just clean, not sparkling, not perfect, but clean). There were rules at my house, simple ones, f.e. homework had to be done before doing anything else. \n\nMy mom was and is a very patient, loving person who always discussed situations with me and taught me to talk about things that were going on and she taught me how to handle my emotions and share them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBf and I met, fell in love and 2 yrs later I got pregnant. The first year and especially the first months were very, very, very, extremely hard on us and me especially. My bf never learned to show sympathy. I had had a horrible birth (I thought the baby was dead and I was going to die) and a hard time breastfeeding, the baby would scream a lot and never sleep and I was a wreck. I knew I \"signed up\" for it, but I think so did my bf when he decided he would stay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow comes the part that bothers me. He does not take proper care of our son. He never has. I wanted to trust him, from the start, but he always messed up somehow. I could recite a thousand things where he put my baby, our baby, into serious danger. I can very well say that that kid is just lucky that nothing bad has happened to him yet while being in the care of his father. I have talked and talked and talked to him about child safety. We even had a special midwife assigned to us from 8 weeks on as I was getting worse and worse and needed help and wanted a professional to be there whenever I had questions. My mom sadly does work a lot and is rarely there to ask. His parents were no option as they live too far away. Even our midwife told him repeatedly what to do and what not to do. He never listened. He had no bad intentions but he simply, imo, thinks \"oh well things will be okay\". \n\nThere was a situation were, we would bathe our son and then dry him of A LITTLE with a blow dryer, his feet especially as he hated being touched there to dry him off and we didn't want any fungus problems. The midwife told us to be very careful, as babies, especially boys, have died because of electrocution from peeing into the blow dryer. So I made Sure to always put a towel around babys privates to prevent this. The bf never bothered which bothered me. In that one situation, he took care of our son after bathing and when I came into the bathroom he turned around, lifted the running blow dryer up, luckily, because right then the baby started peeing. I was mortified to say the least. I practically saved that kid from getting electrocuted. He had not used a towel on him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur son has hit his head so hard on our coffe table that he chipped of a front tooth at 8 months because his dad couldn't be bothered to look what he was doing and he had just begun to stand and hold onto things. I heard the hit and my bf was lying on the ground facing into the opposite direction of the baby. I was livid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis summer I saved our son from falling down into a concrete pit, as he was standing on the ledge ALONE while his father was off talking to friends, having left our son out of his sight. If my baby would have fallen a certain way he could have broke an arm, a leg, or done serious harm to his face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend almost drowned as a kid because his mom left him with his older brother at age 5 and 6 alone at a public pool and he couldn't yet swim right! Because she had to go \"take care\" of the other kids. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father in law once thought it was appropriate to hand my 6 month old son a lid of a honey jar! My mother in law was sick with the flu, did not tell us, let us come over for \"tea\" and spent the day on the couch coughing into my sons general direction, then went on to give my bf a brown, dried up, top part of a lemon squeezer she probably coughed onto as well while making hot lemon tea with it, to play PLAY for my son with and CHEW on it! She thought it was a great idea and so did my bf! This all happened while I was out for 2 minutes taking a bathroom break. I had JUST explained 30 minutes before, that we had started feeding him solids and were taking it very slow with introducing new food as my family is prone to allergies. Also no one in that damn family knows about the dangers of honey for a 6 month old. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father in law also doesn't listen to what I say. Our son reacts extremely to sugary food. If we give him anything, like a yoghurth with sugar in it, he will go berserk for hours. Hyperactivity due to sugar consumption. So my boyfriends parents were over for coffee and cake and I said our son could have a little cake because, of course, he will want the same food we eat. No biggie. Let the child have some cake. But the FIL spent his time feeding our son his little slice of cake while he could have eaten it very much on his own, so my fil's cake was still there when we were done. And he kept on feeding him with his cake and I said no. My bf stuck to his dads side and said a little more won't hurt. Then WENT AND GOT MORE CAKE FOR OUR SON. I said I don't want him to eat THAT much sugar, my fil dryly said \"well you could make a cake with less sugar in it the next time I won't mind.\" I was furious. Again. My son can have cake. But a child sized portion and not his grandpas slice as well. Of course that night my son went to sleep at 10pm instead of 7pm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur latest arguments were about:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- my bf allowing our son to handle our extremely sharp knifes while sitting in his high chair and eating. Of course our boy wants to \"cut\" things now and he is welcome to, but with a childrens knife. No my bf lets him take our sharp adult knifes. And of course our son cut himsellf with one of them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- my bf giving our son his own blow dryer (our second one in case the first one breaks and for travel) and actually plugging it in and letting him handle it while he his blow drying his hair after bathing. Again I had to take matters into my own hands and took that damn thing away from my son as he started pointing it towards his privates and wouldn't you know a second after I took it he peed again. I flipped. I told him he could have the blow dryer but NOT plugged in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- our son having an eye infection needing eye drops and bf simply not administering them and waiting for me to do it but I was at work and could only to it later than he was supposed to take them. We had already switched to heavier ones as the first ones did not help the infection and it was crucial to stick to the times administering them. \n\n\\-our son got stung by a wasp, becuse my bf let him pick up apples from the ground while wasps and bees were swarming around them (this summer was so hot here and the bees and wasps were so crazy this summer). He did not even have his cellphone with him. What if my son had an allergic reaction? They were out in the woods and he had no means of communication. He didn't even tell me when they got home. It was me who realized our sons finger was swollen and he said it hurt. The bf told me \"oh well he came up to me crying and I didn't know what was wrong. I guess that was it then\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-our son was allowed to run around with a screwdriver, playing with it unsupervised, while the bf was reparing something in the other room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could go on, but I don't want to think about any more about these things. I am at my wits end. People have asked me about how my partner watches our kid. I have been asked why our kid wasn't wearing a jacket when it was cold (I put one on him and his dad took it off). I have been asked how I feel knowing my son runs around by himself while my partner talks to friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo of course, over the past 19 months I have developed a fear of leaving my son with my bf or letting him visit his parents with ihm without me there as well. I TRY to get over it, somehow. I know I migiht be on the extreme side, but...it's my baby. There is a time and place for everything, I unde",

      "description": "So for some back story, I’m gonna try to make this as less confusing as possible. \n\nI have a group of 3 friends and we all work together and live in the same area: \nLet’s call them: \nChris\nLisa\nJohn\n\n\nChris and Lisa are my best mates in the city I live in, but they aren’t close with each other. \n\nChris and John are good friends and that’s how I met John\n\nLisa &amp; John met at work about 8 months ago and began dating about 4 months ago. Since John &amp; Lisa are dating we all go out together and chill. \n\nNow to the story: \nL talks to me about J allllll the time. She has been looking for other jobs in other cities around Europe but is now considering staying in Germany for J. She also in her 30s so looking to settle down soon. J is 27 and not super interested in that atm. \n\nAbout a month ago, J told C that he wants to break up with L but is terrible at these things. C then told me this information. So I have been sitting on this behemoth of a secret while L chats away about planning all this stuff for J. I try to casually slip in that she should really plan things for herself and maybe reevaluate the situation before putting plans on hold for a guy. She is not picking up on it.  Girl to girl, It’s hard to watch her doing this when I know what’s really going to happen. \n\nFast forward to last night. We are all out one last time since I got another job and am moving to another city. During this time while L is away, I asked J if he really is going to break up with her, because he should do it sooner rather then later. He says yes, but doesn’t really know how or when etc. he wanted to do it after Christmas, but then she is going back home for a few weeks... etc etc \n\nThe night continues and many drinks later - L and I are outside the bar and she is complaining about J not wanting to make plans in March for a weekend away and other things. I try to tell her that maybe she should call things off since she is not really getting what she needs from this relationship. She says “she loves him” etc and my big mouth just blurts out that he is going to break up with her and she should just end it. \n\nShe shouts at me, I go back inside, she runs to J crying, he looks at me, they walk out. \n\nI feel like the worlds biggest asshole and also like I am in grade school again. \n\nI apologised to both of them but feel like a massive idiot and an even worse friend. Neither will speak to me and I have no idea the status of that mess of a relationship. \n\nTl;dr - found out a friend wanted to break up with another friend- got drunk and told her that he was gonna do it. Neither are talking to me. ",

      "description": "In my English class, we have only a select few people who actually take notes during class. We were told to watch a movie and take notes on it as we had a test on said movie. During the movie, no one except a select few bothered to even watch the movie and decided to go on their phones and play iMessage games. Toward the end of class, we finished the movie and my teacher reinstated that we had an incoming test based on the movie. Not to my surprise, many people started freaking out and some asked me for notes. I told that I would give them as long as you pay me $2 (everyone who took notes all agreed that they would charge everyone too). They shouted back at us claiming that all the notes were the same and that it didn't take much effort to make the notes either way.  \n\n\nSo I've been wondering, AITA for charging people for notes as they were not doing what should've been done.",

      "description": "Maybe a couple of times a year my wife will say something really hurtful and it will upset me. Then she'll realize that what she said was mean and apologize but I can't just be like \"Oh, you apologize, cool. All better now!\" Then she blames me for making her feel bad by being upset.\n\nThe latest example just happened. Tomorrow is our anniversary and we were talking about the present she gave me over a month ago because that's just how she does things. She asked me what I was going to get her and, after a long day at work, a busy evening and trying to get in bed we both forgot that I gave her a very thoughtful, very expensive (not that this should matter) present two weeks ago. I panicked and said I didn't know and that I had been really busy at work. She said \"Do you just not care anymore?\" And that broke by heart because I felt like such a disappointment to her. I said that I was sorry and excused myself so I could go have a quiet moment. Once she remembered that I did get her a present she apologized for making me sad but then expected me to just snap out of it. But I couldn't. I was hurt and angry because she just jumped to the fact that I don't care about her because of a present. I was withdrawn because I tend to shut down in these sorts of situations and she got mad at me for making her feel bad about what she said.",

      "description": "My (25M) sister-in-law (18F) has been on my wife's (24F) phone plan for years now. I have a separate plan, mostly just because we came into our marriage with separate plans and never changed that. That said, we've always shared our finances, since before we were married, so for all intents and purposes, our plans may as well be joint. We've been married for almost 5 years now, and we've been together for well over 8. \nOriginally, the purpose of having her sister on the plan was to ensure that her mother could not control or take away the phone. We live in another state, and it was the only method of contact she had with her sister. Their home life was sufficiently terrible to warrant such action, so I had no issue with it, and I even backed that play. \n\nFast forward to now, and my sister-in-law has moved to a completely different state, still far away, has a job (though she is couch-surfing right now), and yet for some reason we are still paying her phone bill. I think as an adult, living on her own and getting her own income, she should be responsible for that kind of thing. I feel like my wife blames me for possibly leaving her sibling without a phone.

Have I been too sensitive in this situation and acted like an asshole? If my brother sees this he will know its from me so hi!  \n\n\nIm currently having a miscarriage. I was at my parents the other day and my mum kept talking about a holiday we are going on all together (siblings, my hubby and children etc). She is always wanting to get her next holiday fix. Anyway I was trying to be positive and not a debbie downer as that very morning my hubby and I had been told our babys heart beat had stopped and it was a matter of a waiting game.  \nIn my group chat with my mum and siblings I informed my two brothers of the sad news and they offered their condolences. My mum immediately followed up with a comment that said, 'Great news guys I was able to get that holiday house in blah blah blah!!' I felt that was an incredibly insensitive thing to follow up on my miscarriage news. She also continued to keep talking to me about it even though I kept telling her I might not even be able to make it as I might need a D&amp;C if my body hadn't miscarried by then. She blew up at me for being rude or something I don't know I was too pissed off at this time and commented on how I hadn't even seemed that upset. Keep in mind she had suffered miscarriages so should be quite aware of how I felt and that I wasn't exactly in a happy mood wanting to talk about holidays etc. She said I take it for granted that she watches my kids (she does watch my kids...but maybe a total of 10 times in the whole year and 2 nights in this whole year).  I told her I do appreciate it and I was not really in a mood to talk about holidays as I was trying to keep it together in front of my other kids.  \n\n\nAITA in this situation and too sensitive?",

This bothered him. He agreed to work harder on our friendship. So far so good. I am still upset and just tired of everything. I noticed myself getting annoyed and frustrated with him quickly. I didn’t like the fact this was happening. I sent him a text saying I think I need some time and distance from him. I told him I don’t want to feel like that towards him, but just do right now. He went bonkers. Saying he’s tired of me flip flopping back and forth. I make a big deal out of everything, and his personal favorite “there’s something wrong with you”. Long story short he loves to point out what he feels are my shortcomings as a person. Fast forward. My dumbass who never learns, made the mistake of calling him. Trying to understand y he’s so mad. He proceeds to go ape shit on me. Never lets me speak. Hangs up the phone in my face. Blocks me. Furious, I decided to go over his house. I was able to restrain myself and stayed calmer than I thought I would. I tried talking to him. He just kept harping on how asking for space was such an insult to him. That he’s been trying etc. Again, I never said he wasn’t trying. All I said was things still bother me, I need some space. The funny thing is I was trying to do right. I was trying to take time and get to a point where I don’t get annoyed/frustrated with him. I care about him. I thought the right thing to do was tell him I need space. Instead he told me I should have never said anything and just ignored him. He even called me selfish for not doing so. Keep in mind we see each other literally 5/7 days a week. Am the asshole for asking for some space? Was that such an unfair request? Keep in mind I never accused him of any wrong doing. ",

      "description": "When I was in highschool I was best friends with this guy. We got on so effortlessly well, had the same sense of humour and just felt so comfortable in each others company. We were both kind of awkward teenagers and so we found solace in each other. He was my first major crush and I got the impression that he liked me too but neither of us were brave enough to admit it.\n\nFast-forward a few years and we both left highschool. We kept in touch and met up often to go to the cinema. One day he sent me a text asking if I would consider going out with him. I had never had a boy express any interest in me before and I still felt so immature at that point (I was probably about 17) and even though I still liked him I turned him down. I think I just panicked at the prospect of it. He agreed to remain friends and was really nice about the whole thing and we continued on as we had. \n\nA year or so after this my highschool friend asked me out again and I was surprised that he would still feel that way even though we hardly saw each other anymore. I turned him down again because we weren't as close as before and, again, he was happy to be friends and I thought that was that.\n\nIt was a few months later that I noticed something strange. He had lost a lot of weight and was acting very oddly. I thought his personality had just changed over the years but when he messaged me later saying he was glad we were still friends and that I had stuck by him over the years I told him I was glad we were friends too. \n\nHe took my response to mean that I wanted to go out with him now and made very public declarations on Facebook as well as an endless stream of bizzare updates. It turned out he had developed cannabis psychosis and everyone saw the progression of it through Facebook. He messaged me constantly and they became graphic (“where's my bush”) I was so out of my depth and panicked that I messaged him to say I didn't want to hear from him again until he got help. His sister discovered what was happening and messaged me some time after to inform he had been admitted to hospital.\n\nIt was about a year later when I heard from him again. He had gotten out of hospital and got in touch to say he would like to meet up so we could talk about what happened. I agreed and we met at a bar. He apologised for all the messages and I asked him questions about what he had gone through but it was just so awkward. We had both changed a lot over the years and the whole “incident” hung in the air leaving awkward silences. I could barely look him in the eye and after about an hour I messaged my friend to ask that she phone me and pretend there was an emergency. That was the last time I ever heard from him again. \n\nI recently shared this with a couple of friends and they had conflicting views on the whole thing so I wanted to know for definite closure, AITA?",

I've waited an hour and a half without them replying or reading it until I said \"Okay I guess\". Then one of them answered with no, the other didn't. It is really important to know that both of them were online on Snapchat and Instagram at the time (one of them even sent me a snap) but decided to just not answer. Then the answering friend said, that our other friend maybe couldn't too but after waiting 90 minutes I didn't want to meet them anyway so I just said \" Don't want to anymore tbh\". Then, 3 hours late the third friend joins and answers \"oof thank you\" in an ironic way. It is 8pm by then. I was pretty pissed at that point, since she sent me another snap without answering so I just answered \"no problem\". That was apparently pretty asshole like and both say I was behaving like a \"son of a bitch\" (we use it like asshole) the whole conversation on. \n\nSo am AITA for being pissed after 90 mintues of waiting while they could have answered me? I maybe shouldnt have reacted in a pissed way but I was also angry since this was not the first time both ignored me and I wasted time inside by waiting while it was sunny outside.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my fiance his mother is a sack of shit?",
      "description": "For context, we've been together for over two years. I adore this man. He's so loving, caring and overall amazing. Unfortunately, he has a major fault, though: his spine is rubber when it comes to himself and Mommy dearest. He'll make a very visible effort to stand up to her miserable ass if she fucks with me, but he will forgive her any trespass.\n\nWhen we first started dating almost a year after my abusive parents threw me out his mother started sending me nasty texts calling me a whore for stealing her baby (who I might add was 27 years old, 8 older than me). I showed them to him, and he threatened her to move out if she didn't stop. She left me in peace for a few months then sent another...And the cycle repeated even after he moved in with me.\n\nI should have known something was up with the bitch then, but our lease ran out, we had nowhere safe to go and she, FIL having just remodeled their house, insisted that they'd built a room for us to move in and we could bring the dogs. Hoo boy, was that a bad decision. Since moving in, she's screamed multiple times at my fiance that I'm useless, to \"make me\" do things, telling him to \"control your whore\", complained that he \"lets me walk all over him\" but he doesn't let her do it (!), told me I should stop working because my job only benefits me and my dogs, physically assaulted me for correcting my dog while she abuses hers, asked my fiance constantly to buy groceries and other shit for her while complaining that we \"spend too much\" on OUR dogs, taken MY dogs out to show off to her friends against MY instructions and called me names when I told her off for it, actively undermined my dogs' training by uncrating them when told specifically not to or by physically restraining them when I called them to me, tried to get my mother to FORCE me to birth a child to GIVE to her, fed my smaller dogs shit they're allergic to, allowed BIL to raise hands, threaten and insult me, taken me aside for \"talks\" where she tells me I can't love my fiance because I \"don't do enough\" for him (I work twice as many hours as he does, he helps me and her out tremendously around the house) or that I'm disrespecting him by not having children...when we aren't married yet, are still struggling to build our lives AND agreed before dating we'd be CF...And so much more.\n\nHe's been super supportive of me. I now make more than he does, and we share everything equally. But for a long time when I was out of work he supported me and our furry children with never a word of complaint. He won't go to the doctor without a lot of urging when he needs to, but if he's even slightly concerned about me off he goes right away. We've agreed to share everything, yet he will tell me to take any money I need from his earnings, while he ALWAYS asks before taking anything from my earnings even though I've told him he doesn't need to. He doesn't fully understand mental issues, having been raised in a family where they taught him (and still do) that mental illness is shameful, women should submit to and serve men, and that you \"can't\" be depressed if you don't have a \"reason\" to be. (Hell, his brother and mother tell him he's a \"faggot\" and \"not a man\" because he protects me from them and never makes me do anything I don't want to. He knows I have food related anxiety, and while he doesn't understand it, he knows I often don't eat because of it, ESPECIALLY not with his family around; and he'll bring us both food to our room to ensure I eat. But I do wish he would say more to her than the occasional mumbled \"shut up, mom\" or \"you can't say anything because you don't take care of your own dogs\". When she's going off bitching about me very loudly I might add, he'll ignore her or try to placate her. I know he wants to avoid trouble, but AITA for wishing he would tell that bitch to shut the fuck up and stop referring to his partner in that way?\n\nThe kicker came last Saturday. The bitch was annoyed we weren't cleaning up fast enough for her liking, so she OPENED THE YARD GATE and just stood there like a fucking idiot letting my husky run out into the street! SO and I ran after her and the stupid old hag continued to stand there. The only reason I didn't elbow her in the ugly bulldog face as I ran past was because I was too afraid she'd grab me and not let me catch my baby who was halfway to the busy avenue that's only a block away. Now I couldn't say if my Weim pushed her way out on her own, but I doubt it because as I ran out I remember distinctly that her crate was closed; and while we ran after the husky the weim also ran out the gate and went straight for us thinking we were playing. Luckily we caught both of them unharmed, and by the time we got back my Monster in law had closed the gate and gone inside. \n\nMy fiance loves our husky. We raised her from a puppy and she is one of his favorites. As annoyed as I'd ever seen him with her, he told her this is why nobody wants her around and she responded with a low blow at me, saying my parents threw me out because I'm a terrible person and they didn't want me. I saw red and I fired back she should thank her lucky stars my baby wasn't hurt or her ass would not see daylight again. She screamed back that I'm a \"pendeja\" and that \"it's her house and she will throw my dogs out onto the street if I don't want to clean up after them\". Mind, SO and I were both exhausted and there was ONE poop in the corner. ONE. We clean at least three times a day...she lets her own dogs fester in piss and shit and NEVER cleans so he has to do it for her. Of course I told her exactly what I thought of her irresponsible ass. Even my fiance temporarily went from \"she won't do anything, take the dogs to pee and play in the yard\" to \"I'm going to look for a house for us to buy, keep the dogs' crates and our room locked when we aren't around\". I say temporarily, because he now says she does what she does and doesn't clean her own dogs because she's \"getting older\" and \"it's just how she is\" and he \"talked to her so it won't happen as long as we clean\".\n\nI told him exactly what I thought of that. I told him my grandma who died of cancer at 84, over 25 years older than this bitch, still took excellent care of HER dogs and never pulled shit like this. I reminded her how he talked to her before and always said she'd never do this and now she just did. He went silent and promised me we're leaving ASAP. He also agreed to go to therapy with me, but I can tell he's still in denial that his mother could do something like that. (Might I add he was sexually abused as a child. I don't know who did it, but his mother's entire attitude is making me think it was she. Urgh.) \n\nI haven't spoken to the bitch since. I don't greet her when I walk in the door after work, I don't even look at her if I can help it. I would love to give her a good smack upside the head. I hate her with a passion. And I told my fiance straight up that she's a sack of shit who makes me feel like a trapped animal and I wish I were free of her right now. I don't feel it any less intensely, but I feel bad because I know he loves me and also has some trauma bonding with her and I know firsthand how difficult it is when you realize that your birth giver is a steaming puddle of slimy frothy diarrhea.\n\nAITA for saying this to him and secretly wishing the woman would just disappear or die already?",

      "description": "So hear my out. My dad’s mom has always been a little weird. She is from the south of Italy so from starters she has a very peculiar character, but she was a really warm and loud grandma when I was a kid. As I grew older I realised things she was doing, such as always talking shit about my grandma even in front of me, even though they are still together. My mom never really liked her cause my grandma told her so many things like “you stole my baby (my dad) from me” and such. \n\nNow, a couple years ago my dad told his family that he was depressed, and my grandma blamed my mom for it. I remember one day my grandma called my mom yelling at her telling her she was the reason why dad was depressed cause she sent him to DO THE GROCERIES. Now I’m like, don’t touch my mom, she did so much for my dad. So I was upset at my grandma and I really didn’t want to answer her phone calls or visit her. Also she demands so much respect like me and my cousins have to go and visit her and call her, not the other way around. And she is so tight with her money. She has some, but she always asks my dad to pay for her holidays. \n\nNow my parents are divorced now and I don’t have to talk to her nor see her basically ever, but since my dad moved to the city where she lives, sometimes when I call him she hands the phone to my grandma without even asking me. Also my grandma keeps messaging me and trying to call me. I barely answer and that makes me feel guilty but when I do answer she makes my blood boil by passively aggressively talking shit about my mom. Would I be the asshole if I just decide to cut her out of my live and block her and never see her again?",

My now-boyfriend (at the time we were seeing each other) was on r/gonewild and I said I was uncomfortable with NSFW subreddits. We had a bit of an argument, but he said he understood my point of view. He said he didn't really go on them much anyway and would unsubscribe. He then unsubscribed in front of me then and there. \n\nToday he was sitting next to me on the sofa at my parent when he suddenly looked worried and clicked onto something I knew wouldn't interest him. I asked him what he was looking at and he kept trying to show me pictures of a demolished building. He eventually showed me he'd been looking at some half naked teenager. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've said I wasn't enjoying the film and gone upstairs but I'm livid that he lied to me about unsubscribing.

      "description": "I’ll try to keep this short. My boyfriend was hospitalized last week. This obviously made me upset and I was also home alone the whole time.  My parents called to check on me. They asked me when I was going to visit my boyfriend and I told them my plan. I was going to visit him in the morning, hangout with my friend during the afternoon, then visit him again at night. The hospital is 45 mins from my house, and my friend lives close to the hospital. I wanted to do this so I didn’t have to drive 45 mins back and forth twice in one day. \n\nSo the issue is with my friend. We were best friends and had a falling out (too long to get into this post) Recently she contacted me and apologized and I forgave her. So I didn’t tell my parents we were friends again, and realized I had to when I was telling them my plan to visit my boyfriend. So when I began to tell my parents about being friends with her again, my stepdad replied “oh that asshole?” So I hung up the phone. \n\nI’m 26 years old, i should be able to pick my own friends without backlash from my parents. My brother called me recently and told me my parents were upset how I hung up on them. Since then, I’ve talked to my parents but none of us have brought up what happened. I think if they’re truly upset they should confront me. Am I being the asshole?",

      "description": "Ok. I’m a single/divorced 31m teacher. BORING existence; work, grad school, laundry, etc. I had given up on dating in general. I have my shit together in the traditional sense; own my home, nice car, pretty content with my life. Just giving some backstory as to why I wasn’t interested in pursuing anyone necessarily, kinda comfortable with the occasional fling and that’s it. \n\nI have a friend with an older sister. She also has her shit together; owns a home, steady job, nice car, fun hobby, etc. I’ve just never viewed her as a potential partner. She made initial contact with me. Started texting daily, then it became every couple of hours, and eventually it was constant. She would best be described as a kinda plain/homely woman, and I’m not judging, I don’t exactly peak the look meter at a 10. It is known she’s never had a relationship, a date, a kiss, or anything else in between those. I began to slow down my responses to her texting as I realized she was probably viewing my friendliness as interest, and then I very directly made it known I wasn’t looking to date or have a relationship. I pumped the brakes hard. She took the hint, but would still text at least twice daily each day. \n\nFast forward to a few months ago and I meet a woman, a former colleague, who I considered far out of my league, in multiple areas. She had apparently asked around for my number. We hit it off right away. Many of the same interests, outlooks on life, political viewpoints, etc. I was shocked. We took it slow, but it soon became apparent to both of us we had feelings for one another, so we’ve kinda moved into that weird relationship phase where it’s not really labeled, but it’s not just casual sex. All the while I’m still fielding texts from my buddy’s sister, but none of them are anything remotely indicative of interest in her. Just friendly texts every few days when I would respond to 2-3 days worth of her texts at one time. I also clearly indicated I was once again not looking for a relationship or interested in her. She’s been blowing up my phone the last few days as I have pumped the brakes pretty hard again, but, to reiterate, I haven’t implied or stated any interest in her at all. \n\nThings are getting more serious with the former colleague and that’s what I want for sure. I feel I’ve been pretty open about my intentions and not leading at all with my comments with my buddy’s sister. So..WIBTA if I simply “ghost” her? WIBTA if I just bluntly tell her that I’m dating someone, even though I’ve clearly stated I have no interest in a relationship? The implication of that being she wasn’t good enough for a relationship, which isn’t true, but I’m not looking for one with her.  It’s important to note she has kinda mentioned some dark thoughts/mental illness and I’m trying to figure out which way would also be less damaging for her. ",

      "title": "AITA for being upset / hurt over my friend cancelling plans?",
      "description": "So my main passion is camping and hiking, and I mostly do it on my own since not many of my friends are into that sort of thing. I also don’t have many friends. A couple summers ago, my best friend was expressing an interest in camping and we started toying with the idea of going on camping trip. He started to date someone later that summer and started to spend all his time with his new partner (he has a history of doing this). I tried to make plans with him to camp like we had talked about, but he always had plans already made with his new partner… and they ended up going on a couple camping trips with each other.\n\nWe drifted apart, and then a couple years later we start talking and hanging out again. We start to talk about camping again and we make plans this time on a specific date. I’m getting really excited, but as the date approaches he ends up cancelling on the plans because it turns out his partner’s family had a camping trip planned that same weekend. I’m a bit bummed out, but I understand and we decide that we will go camping in the fall instead. As the fall is approaching, I pick out a weekend and propose it to him and he seems quite enthusiastic about the idea. I bring it up multiple times to him (“Yeah I am definitely interested!” / “I don’t think I will be working that weekend so that could work!” / “Yeah I’m down as long as I don’t have to work that weekend!”).\n\nA week before the camping weekend, I reach out to him about it and he doesn’t respond. I reach out again, and he ends up saying “Oh I’ll have to pass” and doesn’t expand on why (it wasn’t because he was working because he had the weekend off). I’m a little ticked off and say that I thought we had plans. He gets mad at me and says he never made plans and that he only expressed interest and he started to vent all these issues he has with me. It turns into a fight, I get frustrated and start airing my grievances.\n\nI’ll admit that I should have kept my cool, but I think I was bottling up some issues I had with him. It really seemed like we had plans, and I was very excited to get to go camping with a friend since it’s something that doesn’t happen very often. It was also kind of shitty since he cancelled on previous plans and this seemed like a trip to make up for that. He accused me of prioritizing my own feelings over his (he said making plans makes him anxious, which I was oblivious to.. he seemed quite receptive every time I reached out to him about the proposed camping trip), but doesn’t that go both ways? It didn’t seem like he was being very considerate of my feelings. I would have been way more understanding if he gave some context as to why he cancelled. He was very unapologetic too. Overall, my feelings were pretty hurt.\n\nSo, AITH for being upset and hurt by this? I keep thinking about it and wondering if I am in the wrong, or if I do have the right to be hurt by this.\n\nThanks!!",

      "title": "AITA for telling my uncle how much of a deadbeat my dad is?",
      "description": "**Context:** As the title says, my [17F] father [55M] is a huge deadbeat. The usual kind: Almost never has helped my mom financially, rarely, if ever calls to check on me, visits even fewer times, etc, the list goes on. And of course, he lies to people about what's up with me, says he sends money when he doesn't, that he calls me constantly, and to people who are close enough to notice he doesn't visit me at all, he says that he can't because my mom forbade him from seeing me, which couldn't be a bigger lie. This has been a consistent pattern since I was a baby.\n\nWe're from Venezuela, but he left in mid 2017 to Dominican Republic. Surprisingly, he started texting me more (still was about once every two weeks or so) and started sending money, still was very emotionally absent but for a wild moment I thought that he was trying to be a father for once. In early december of this year, he told me he was coming back for like a month to visit family and spend christmas here. He also promised he was coming to visit me as soon as he could, and gave me an specific date in which he was coming to my hometown. He planted me all day, didn't return any of my calls or texts, same thing next day, and I eventually had to call a friend of his who I suspected he was staying over. He was there and proceeded to tell me (without an apology) that something (didn't explain what) came up and couldn't come. He also wasn't coming because he had made plans to go to his hometown first and couldn't pass for my place. So if anything I'm seeing him in january. I fucking cried for days. That was almost two weeks ago and he also hasn't called me once.\n\n**Actual situation:** One of my uncles, his brother [53M] was travelling to their hometown (to visit my dad) and decided to stop by my place. I really love him to I was very happy to see him, but I decided to try to don't say a thing about my dad, they already have some beef going since they have very opposite personalities. We talked for a couple hours, and he asks about my dad, if I'm visiting him etc. I didn't know what to do so I tried to change subject. He noticed and asked again, so I told him that most probably I'm not seeing him until january. He goes \"what the actual hell\" and starts asking why, isn't he stopping by here? So I decide to tell him the story above. He is getting pissed (not at me, *thankfully* ) I reach the part where he hasn't called me once since he came and he is both shocked and livid. He asks if maybe we had argued, because why would he behave like that, and I tell him that this is nothing new, he has always been this way. Very thanfully, my uncle fully believes me, says he knows I'm not a liar and that he always noticed something was off about my father's stories about me (he can't see me because of my mom, etc) but of course couldn't get more detail. He also told me a shocking story about when his family found out my mom was pregnant and how he behaved. At this point he is very pissed, makes a point of how he would never behave like that with his children, that most probably my dad has damaged me a lot, etc. Also tried to apologize on his part, but I told him it was ok. He eventually left and is meeting my dad and the rest of the family tomorrow.\n\nNow, I didn't think of it before, but know I'm piss scared. At first, I didn't want to tell him out of fear he wouldn't believe me and ruin our relationship, but later I realized I probably set off a confrontation between my uncle and my father. My uncle is very impulsive and very confrontational, so I'm almost sure ( **more like very sure** ) he will call him out at some point, and not in a good manner. And it can only go two ways:\n\n1. My father denies everything, my other uncles and aunts side with him. My uncle ends up arguing with his family and won't talk for them for a while.\n\n2. My father denies everything, but my other uncles and aunts believe my uncle and call the fuck out of my dad. My father gets resentful, and doesn't speak to them for maybe years.\n\nEither way, I feel like a big fucking snitch. Maybe my uncle didn't need to know, but it would also be wrong to lie and say \"oh he is a wonderful parent, calls me everyday and such\". I don't want to be at fault for a possible fight, and I really don't want my uncle to argue with his siblings. My mom has reassured me I did the right thing by saying the truth and it's not my fault if something happens, but I keep having invasive thoughts and nightmares about it. Thoughs? Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "Didnt expect it to be this long, but it's long. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nOkay to preface this, I just wanted to say that I was never really close friend with this housemate. 3 people from work and I moved into a house together about 2 years ago, but I was only really friends with 1 of them (let's call her A). A couple of months passed and I ended up dating one of the housemates I wasnt previously friends with (we'll call him B). This becomes important later.\n\nAnyway the first few months are fine but as expected, tension started to grow in the house. Everyone felt like they were pulling more weight than the others in terms of house cleaning, and we were not getting along. At this point, myself and B were working 70 hour weeks so were barely at home, and when we were, we slept. A had quit her job due to personal issues, and was home all the time. The last housemate, C, was still working, but was working standard 40 hour weeks.\n\nA and C were in a on and off relationship and were also heavy pot smokers. When A quit her job, we assumed C was supporting her financially, including the drug use (which is far from cheap). Then A finally ended it with C and moved out, leaving the 3 of us left in the house. C did not deal with this well, which is fair enough, and took up alcohol to drown her sorrows. She was drinking A LOT and was still keeping up with her pot smoking and heavy cigarette smoking. It became almost unbearable to live in the house, as C became incredibly bitchy and would make snide comments about B and me and the way we lived our lives. Also at this point, our workplace had just been taken over by a new boss who was far stricter. We all had to get along with him for the sake of our jobs, but C could not bite her tongue and eventually was forced to transfer to another store where she got fewer hours. She would even sometimes call in sick just to sit at home and get high and drunk.\n\nAnyway when we decided enough was enough and gave the real estate our 2 weeks notice. B and I were in a really bad place due to the negativity in the house, and would be scared to leave our room in fear of being scolded or told off about something we did wrong (which was everything apparently). It was affecting our lives and our relationship so we decided it was a good time to move. C needed a new place to love because our current 3 bedroom house was too expensive to rent on her own with all her other recreational activities and her hesitance to show up to work. She asked B and me if we would pay her part of the bond back in advance so she could rent a new place and we said no. We had no trust that she would repay us when the real estate finally released our bond, and the bank account that the real estate had was linked with her, so she would get the lump sum of the bond when the time came around. She told us we were selfish because she couldnt afford a place to live and we were going to make her homeless.\n\nKeep in mind that when we all moved in, we were all in the same position; full time hours at the same workplace. Because she is about 5 years older than B and me, she was actually receiving a higher pay rate. While she wanted her money or drugs, alcohol and cigarettes while barely showing up for work, B and I worked out ashes of doing 70 hour weeks working 6 days a week to get the money we have now. And B stupidly had showed her how much he had in his bank account a few months ago (he didnt realise the money situation she was in at that point and was just excited about the amount he had saved up because we are trying to save for a deposit on a house). So she used this against us, saying we could afford to repay her the bond in advance because of that money we had saved. \n\nI did feel bad at one point because she didnt have money, but that didnt stop her from - in the last 2 weeks after we gave notice - drinking bottles upon bottles of spirits that are not cheap at all. She was wasting her money and then asking for ours.\n\nAnyway now she stays half living in her car and half at a family members house until she can find enough money for a bond on a house. Honestly, our job doesnt pay good but it's good enough to work for a few weeks and save up enough for a bond. Likely she is calling in sick or still blowing her money on drugs and alcohol, which is why she hasnt found a place to live yet. Bonds are usually a few weeks rent, and should be not more than 1000 for a one bedroom flat. Anyway, I've been wanting to get this off my chest for a while now. We still havent received the bond back (it's been over 2 months since we left the house) and shes now parking her car in the same parking lot as our work I guess in an attempt to guilt us into giving her money.\n\ntldr: ex housemate wants us to pay her part of the bond in advance which we think we will never see again because she'll blow it on drugs, alcohol and cigarettes.",

      "description": "I adopted a beautiful, sweet kitty about a year ago. I didn’t notice that she had a mild limp until they brought up the fact that she had a broken front paw when she was given to the shelter at one month old. According to their records, the vet they employed thought it was 50-50 whether she would adapt fully/grow normally or require an amputation.  As a result they did nothing. Regardless, I was smitten and adopted her as well as a litter mate. Flash forward a year and she’s a semi-active cat who has developed a deformity not only on the fore-leg that was broken but in the other foreleg as a result of carrying extra weight. Now the AITA part... Originally my vet told me that she should adapt just fine and at the very worst develop arthritis at a very young age requiring medication. But almost everyday I see her get less and less active and it’s very obvious it’s because her fore-legs are painful. She is unable to fully use her paws (e.g. sharpen her claws) secondary to atrophy and is unable to climb and jump like a normal cat most likely due to pain. Now, she is able to move around, feed, go to the bathroom, get onto her favorite/comfy locations in my apartment, and even run around and play. But it is clear that it is painful and hard for her to move around at times. AITA for wanting to keep her around because she is such a sweet and loving cat who is mobile and able to care for herself even though she is clearly arthritic and in pain with no long-term solutions to her problem in sight?",

      "description": "Let me start this off by saying that this is in the grand scheme of things relatively minor, but it has been really bothering me for some reason. To start off, I work at a local pet food store. We pride ourselves on having high quality foods at good prices that help pets live good lives. Since I'm an employee, I'm entitled to a very generous discount towards food items. \n\nWhen our family bought a kitten in September, I tried to explain why I thought it would be better for me to buy healthier food for it. It was agreed upon by everyone in the house that I would buy food for the cat. Some time in early December, my dad and stepmother took a 2 week long trip and I was in charge of taking care of the cat. During this time, I fed the cat mainly one brand of food from the store, just getting different flavors for variety sake.\n\nHere is where the problem started. I noticed my stepmother had started feeding the cat Purina, and I brought it up with her. She said that the cat was refusing to eat the food I was bringing home,  which I thought was weird because he seemed to like it when I served it to him. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be confrontational and start an argument, but I got her to agree to let me try out different brands so we wouldn't have to get lower quality foods like Fancy Feast. All was well for a while.\n\nOnly now, without telling me at all, she has gone back to getting the Purina. I only knew because I happened to see it in the storage closet next to the litterbox. I can get much better food for the same price, and I pay for it because it's much simpler that way. I want to look out for the health of our cat, and I don't understand why she is taking it into her own hands to feed him with what I view is crap. I have yet to bring this up with her for the second time. AITA for feeling strangely upset about this?",

But I make sure to either hop off or go super slow in darker areas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I was skating in front of the fairly lit main quad and made sure to slow down as I neared the dark crosswalk. I notice out of the corner of my eye this white bearded old man dressed in all dark grey walk in front of me. It was difficult to see him, but I was able to stop in time. I didn't hit him, in fact I made sure to stop a good several feet away. As I walk by him he slows down and gets up in my face and yells, \"Why don't you get a light?!\" to which I tried to calmly respond \"I will\" and skated away, hearing a faint \"hmph\" in the background. As I leave I saw two bikers riding towards his direction without lights and hoped for their safety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLowkey afraid this old white guy will be a future professor of mine lol. Am I the asshole here? I know I didn't have a light, but I was still trying to be as careful as possible at night without one, wore a huge bright red jacket.",

      "description": "In mid January, my boyfriend of 4 months and I broke up, it was my longest relationship and I took it very hard (I went to the local inpatient mental hospital, which my best friend recommended). Also note that I'm now in a new relationship, it kind of just happened. Since I got back (i was gone for a week), she has invited me over multiple times and I haven't been able to go, usually due to sports. Later in the evening, I go on snapchat and usually see her, her brother, or their mutual friend post something that has my ex in it at her house. This kind of bugs me because I really dont want to be around him. What really makes me irritated is the fact that he usually comes over per invite of her brother, but he was out of town yesterday and my ex was still at their house with her and their aforementioned mutual friend. This upsets me because my ex and my best friend dont get along at all, shes known him for a while through her brother but when I first started dating him, she told me not to because she genuinely believed he would physically abuse me (he didnt). \nI know that she is her own person and can do what she wants, but shes supposed to be my best friend and I feel hurt that she spends time with my ex. She also tends to not be able to be friends with a guy without at some point doing something sexual with them. I feel like I'm also frustrated at the thought that it could happen, despite the fact that she insists she doesnt like him. To me, it would make me question her feelings during my and his relationship.\n\nWIBTA for bringing it up to her as something that bothers me?",

We told him before he moved in that he needed to find a place by February 1, 2019. For awhile everything was going well. He had a stable job, helped around the house, and even gave us money from time to time to help with rent ($100 here and there). \n\nBut a months ago he lost his job because he failed a drug test (cannabis use). He hasn’t found another job. He hasn’t found a place the live. He’s also constantly having friends around at all times of the day and night, even though we have two small children and work/school schedules to maintain. \n\nSo today, February 2, my husband asks him what his plan is because we’re buying a home within the next few months and wanted to let him know he is not going to be able to move with us. Plus his date is up. His response was “maybe I’ll just have to buy a tent with my tax return and live in the woods somewhere.”. \n\nI just feel like he’s trying to guilt trip us. We’ve already given him a bed, a TV, an Xbox, an older laptop, and we let him borrow our cars. \n\nIn my mind I’m just wondering “why the hell haven’t you been saving money this whole time?”. \n\nSo are we the assholes for telling him enough is enough?

      "description": "I have a neighbor, who’s condo unit is directly above me that I haven’t really talked to.  They have two dogs.\n\nFor the past few months, one of the dogs has gotten into the habit of howling at the top of its lungs when the owners are out.  The dog will howl upwards of a hour or two, only stopping for a few minutes at most.  I can hear the dog fairly clearly throughout my unit.  I have had a dog in the past (not now), and it seems to me that the poor dog upstairs has pretty severe separation anxiety.  I can only confirm that this occurs when I am home in the evenings, when the owners are not at home.  For example, last night the dog cried straight from 6:45-8pm.  \n\nAlso, I asked a few other neighbors if they heard the dog.  The neighbor above the dog owners unit said that she didn’t hear the dog, while another neighbor said that he couldn’t hear the dog from his unit, but heard the dog when he was outside walking by.\n\nWIBTA if I talked to them or sent them a letter asking to take care of the issue?  How do I approach them about this?  Should I just stop complaining about it?  ",

I then calmly explained why I thought religions such as Christianity and Islam were dumb, which made the two students look even angrier at me.\n\nTeacher had a word with me after me class and said don't pull that shit again. I said okay, but it's still within my free speech to say all religion, especially monotheistic ones (Islam, Judaism and Christianity) are evil. My teacher is a Christian and he looked a bit pissed so said I need to stay on focus/topic.\n\nAs it stands, I already get good grades. His class is the one I don't take seriously tbh, mostly because of the nonsense subject matter on the module and partly because he's a Christian but I calmly explained my points AITA? ",

      "description": "We broke up over a year ago, and for a really long time she was horrible to me (bitching to my friends, telling people stuff about me etc) but I would be lying if I said I gave a fuck tbh, I have really thick skin and I had made my peace with it being over, it didn't upset me and she looked stupid so i let it slide.  Like 8 months into this our friends are starting to really get sick of it and it's showing, and around this time she apologises and says she knows she's been terrible and we had a nice chat, cool. At this point my feelings are still neutral, although I was glad things were amicable. I could have sat there and been like \"oh wow, now that people are starting to get annoyed you wanna make up\" but like I'm not going to extend drama, esp when it didn't affect me.\n\nliterally 2 hours after this apology she gets drunk and tells one of my close friends something personal about me, which they then tell me. This is the point where I think it went to far, sure I'll let shit slide if it doesn't bother me but I won't be taken for a fool, I ask her to meet me the next day and I break down the last 8 months of awful shit she has said and done to me, demanding explanations (ofc she had none) and basically tell her that she's had her chance and can fuck off. I tell her that I know everything she's said about me. I tell me friends that I'm leaving the group and that I don't expect anyone to come with me, but they all did which essentially left her excluded. To be honest I have to admit that I was almost certain this would happen.\n\nAnyway I kinda realised that it was wrong to retaliate like that, apologised and we left it at that.\n\nMy issue is I dont actually know if i'm the asshole here, because my friends, although I love them, are such fucking yes men. Like when she was talking behind my back they never acc spoke up (fair enough they knew i wasn't upset) but then would tell me everything she was saying, obvs giving her the impression that what she was doing was alright. Then when I told them that I was done with her shit they were all like \"woo yeh well done. she's been horrible and deserves it\". When I decide that my conscience isnt comfortable making someone feel entirely excluded they were like \"hmm yh that was pretty fucked up\". I wanna add that when I had the conversation telling her that i knew all this stuff, it was a quite clear knock to her confidence that ALL her friends had kinda betrayed her.\n\nSo i realise that im now in this echo chamber and it's playing on my mind.  I feel like ESH but i would like some outside opinion because god knows im confused",

      "description": "\\*I don't post much on Reddit, so I am a little new to formatting. \\*\n\nI'm having a debate with one of my boyfriend's friends. He thinks ITA, but I disagree. You decide.\n\n \\&amp;nbsp; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stopped stripping last year, but I used to travel a circuit between Vegas, AZ, and CA based on what was in season. A few years ago, when Tinder got super popular, I hit upon the idea to use my dancer FB page to create a tinder account. Everything about it pointed to the fact that I was a dancer, and it actually kind of looked like a bot page, but I wanted to make the message as clear as possible: This is business.\n\n \\&amp;nbsp; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy profile was really short: \"Hi, my name is CentsandCensure, and I'm an entertainer at \"Club Whatever\". Come and party with me and my friends, we'll have a blast! Here are my hours and the days I'll be working &lt;3\", and that was it.\n\n \\&amp;nbsp; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt worked superbly, but I always had a few guys that couldn't quite get with the program. They'd message me over and over, saying \"Oh I'm definitely coming in tonight. I'm on my way!\", but they'd never arrive and end up saying they got stuck somewhere else. I wasn't upset, I had more than enough to keep me busy, but they were wasting A LOT of time. Hundreds and hundreds of messages all day and night with no return. In a big city, I'd block them, but in small towns I was loathe to loose a potential customer. One of the reoccurring themes was \"I don't go to strip clubs ...I just want to buy you dinner!!!!\" \n\n \\&amp;nbsp; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, one slow week night we were all pitching in for a pizza and I thought, \"Whats the difference between using my tips for food, and just letting them buy the food?\" The next time a guy told me he wanted to buy me food instead of coming to the club, I said ok. I would show up, get my food, eat it with them and leave. And of course I'd invite them to the club with me. It worked decently, some of the customers got miffed, but hey, that's life. Pretty soon, I had almost every meal lined up, and it decreased much of my traveling expenses. Eventually I got the customers to start bringing me food to the club, which was even better since I always preferred to have my bouncers handy when interacting with them.\n\n \\&amp;nbsp; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't feel like I was the asshole here. I was not deceitful, I didn't lie and I never promised anything extra. If someone asked me if I would consider dating them, I just told them I preferred to get to know people in the club because it was my safe zone. (This is true, all my boyfriends came from those customers I decided I'd rather date.) I tried very hard to be upfront with my customers without spoiling their fantasies. But, I'm probably not objective about it, so you tell me.",

      "description": "I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting\n\nSo to start, I'm in highschool, this is my junior year and I just got off a call with my girlfriend of about a year. We didn't break up but we did fight. Here's the run down.\n\nIt's late right now and I have to study for an anatomy test tomorrow. Enter GF. GF wants to call for the night and I tell her from the start, I have to study for this test, I have a coffee and a lot to do so I need to make this quick. She then tells me to pour out the coffee and go to bed because I always get mad when I'm not well rested (and she's right. I get a bit snappy), and that it's going to make her feel bad because there's nothing she could do about it. I say it doesn't matter whether or not I'm well rested and no matter what there's nothing she could say to get me to change my mind.\n\nWe go around in circles, her telling me to stop and go to bed, me telling her firmly and calmly something along the lines of \"I know what I'm doing is selfish and irresponsible but it needs to be done. I need to get off and do this paper. I love you, goodnight,\".\n\nAgain we go in circles as she will not let this go. After three or more time of this I say as firmly as I can \"Look. It wouldn't matter if I was well rested tomorrow, it wouldn't excuse the fact I don't know what the fuck a sclera is.\"\n\nI will admit. I probably should have said it in a less tense tone but I didn't yell at her. She of course goes silent and says that she hates being yelled at. I appologise and she's just mad at me. I tell her I love her and I hope she has a good night. She responds with \"bye\". I know that's a bad sign but I know there's nothing I could do, so I hung up.\n\nTLDR; stayed up late studying, gf wanted me to sleep, I refused, we go in circles, I shut it down, she gets mad.\n\nSo, AITA?\n",

So B is actually uncomfortable about my mom being in the delivery room, but my brother, let's call him D, apparently had a two hour conversation with B on why he wants my mom in the delivery room. B does not like this at all and has confided in me multiple times that it makes her uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom has repeatedly said that SHE WILL be in the Delivery room no matter what, going as far as to say Brailee can have one person in the room from her family but she was going to be in the room regardless.

She's very critical, blunt, and can be rude in a lot of situations that leads me to believe she shouldn't be in the room. On top of the fact; B is uncomfortable with it, and my mom is not her mother. It should be B's choice when it comes to her comfort on giving birth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation? Should I mind my business?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She has a concert tonight and told the group of friends we’re apart of (6 including us) letting them know where, when it was and how much and what they’re playing. The other 4 friends are going to go because they said they like that kind of music too.\n\nHowever I didn’t want to go. I do not like that kind of music and the concert is at ~19:30 which is when my friends (from back home) and I play games online. That’s pretty much the only way I keep in touch with them and Video Games are really my only hobby/ interest. \n\nShe came to my room before to ask me if I was going. I explained why I wasn’t and explained that I can’t understand why my presence or absence would change anything and asked what exactly me being there brings to the concert. I genuinely do not understand why my presence matters. She did not seem very happy and left after light arguing with me and did not say anything as she left so she sounds pissed off.\n\nI just want to play games with my fiends, I don’t want to walk through the rain to pay for a concert of music I do not like.

The project for this class had multiple deliverables throughout the term culminating with a final report and presentation. She was having complications with her pregnancy I assume and did not attend any group meetings and did no work for the deliverables due throughout the term nor the final part of the project. She always said she was in the hospital or not feeling well or some shit. I never cared and nor did the other group members we just all pulled extra weight. Come time to due peer evals on our group members I basically wrecked her in those and told the truth on how she did nothing and never made the effort to do anything. I told the other group members this after we all submitted the evals and they were like you dick/asshole she's pregnant and had complications and said I was an asshole. I feel like they had more sympathy because they're all girls lol. So AITA?",

I'm in my 20's. So I tried explaining to them that I'm still saving up for a different car, and that I'd like them to take the car back when I do. They couldnt understand why I would want to keep saving when they got me a car. \n\nI just feel like i dont want anyone to get me a gift if they're gonna put restrictions &amp; hold it over my head.

      "description": "I'm a senior, and in my high school we do this thing where we ask people that were somehow meaningful for us during our school years to write a personal or a good luck message in a ribbon. We then give the ribbons to our representatives so that they can attach them to our school diploma. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI gave one ribbon to my mother and a few days before I had to turn them in I asked where it was. She replied that I hadn't said or given her anything and 'besides I hadn't even let her read the other ribbons'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI replied that I hadn't and I wouldn't because they were MY ribbons. Although I know that there's not anything compromising or awkward there, I feel like that is something meaningful and that I want to keep for myself. When I said that to my mother my father sided with her. During the event in which we received or school diplomas they again tried to read the ribbons, and I asked them to give me the diploma and kept it with me throughout the event.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I've been drawing and when my mom arrived I had a few sketches folded to later throw in the trash bin. She took them without asking, opened them and started commenting (something that she does a lot - later exhibiting and sharing them, because 'since I threw them out I can't no longer decide what happens to them', most cases I'd be ok if she had just asked). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked her to put them down, since they are mine and were folded, and she got offended asking why I always do this to her, as she can barely see and just wanted to see them better. She then mentioned that I took the ribbons during the event while she was just trying to understand what was written, and I replied that I had already asked her not to do so, and I have the right to set some boundaries. She then said that she was not a controlling mom, to what I disagreed, as she gets easily offended when I'm not home for more than one day (all previously arranged events usually for 3 days to 2/3 weeks) and don't call her daily to let her know what I did, with or where I was. She did the same to my sister, so when she started doing the same with me 2 years ago, I just text her letting her know that I was well. She would then send emotionless texts (which is not like her). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt got to a point where I would dread calling my mom, so I'd just text her and call my sister instead just to give an update every two days or so about how things were going and where I was and how I was feeling, and to know how everyone was - and it is not unusual for my sister to send me a message when I'm out saying that my mom called her and is a pissed out and worried, asking me to call her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm worried that because I have been mad and hurt with her for a long time, I might not have reacted properly by telling her she was controlling... I have clearly hurt her (she's been passive aggressive with me since. AITA?",

Started with forgetting small things to complete short term memory loss to now she's basically nonfunctional, rarely speaks and when she does it's to tell people she doesn't want to go to family events.

I haven't done so since she really went downhill. I feel it's a miserable experience seeing her like this and when I see her I feel completely lost. I don't really want to remember her like this. But I feel like I'm an asshole for doing it. No one in my family has mentioned it to me and they may not even be aware I haven't visited her (I'm in my twenties).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think some people will tell me to make the most of her being around while she is but I don't feel I'm making anything of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this make me an asshole?",

      "description": "So I have this very good friend who is also my classmate. We are different in many ways but nevertheless we get along great. He's much more extroverted than me, and often this causes some sort of 'conflict' between us, especially lately, when he started to call me on the phone more and more often (even when we don't really have anything to talk about that can't be discussed at school the day after), inviting me to see his basketball matches and so on. Of course, as you might imagine, these things have started to annoy me quite a bit, because I need a pretty large amount of alone time after school to sort of recharge, so I started to make all kinds of excuses. I'm afraid he could think that I'm avoiding him because I just don't wanna spend time with him or something like that, when it's just not true, but I don't really know if I'm doing this right or if I am right in the first place.

      "description": "Sorry somewhat long, trying to put all the facts out there. Not the most scandalous either, but enough to start a disagreement with my wife. \n\n*Obligatory: on mobile, sorry for formatting. Also not a throwaway account because people should be comfortable owning their quirky and weird thoughts and stories. TL/DR at bottom.\n\n\nBackground:\n-It's currently winter where we live and it's cold out today (in the 30's°F).\n-We like to support local businesses whenever possible.\n-Our town has one really good small business bagel shop that has been aroumd for years and we love their bacon/cheddar cream cheese and unique lox spread.\n-The bagel shop doesn't have indoor seating.\n-Two store fronts down a new coffeehouse opened up. It has your typical coffeehouse hipster vibe and more importantly indoor seating.\n-I prefer to not eat or drink in my car because I feel it's an unneeded distraction while driving, I don't get to enjoy the food/drink as much, and it usually makes a mess.\n\n\nSituation:\n-My wife went to the new coffeehouse on a weekday morning off to do school work and enjoyed it.\n-That night she suggested we go get bagels from the bagel shop and then coffee at the coffeehouse that weekend.\n-Last weekend we do just that. Get our bagels and head to the coffeehouse for coffee. We have no issues; drink our coffee and eat our bagels at the coffeehouse. \n-Having had a great experience we leave thinking, \"what a nice Sunday treat, let's do it again next weekend.\"\n-This weekend we again get our bagels and head to coffeehouse. After ordering and promptly paying for the coffee (with tip), before the coffee is poured, I tell the owner we would like to drink it there. The owner (who was there last weekend, although he didn't personally serve us) tells us us we can't eat outside food in his coffeehouse because they serve breakfast sandwiches and pastries (no bagels). He does this by saying something to that effect while simultaneously (I felt somewhat rudely) showing us the menu. We politely say, \"O, ok. To-go then.\" Nowhere is this policy posted on the menu or in the coffeehouse.\n-After we get our coffee and are heading out the door, I quietly tell my wife I'd rather not come back to the coffeehouse because they won't let us eat our bagels there.\n-Although we both prefer bagels to the coffeehouse's menu offerings this aggravates my wife. \n-I'm disappointed too because I like the coffeehouse coffee.\n-We take our coffees and go back home to eat, which breaks up our morning errands plan.\n\n\nMy thoughts: \n1. We bought coffee there, why can't we enjoy it there, even if we do have outside food? It's not like we brought our bagels in just to sit, eat, and use the wifi while not ordering anything.\n2. The owner could have said you can eat outside food here this time, but please no more outside food after today. (Especially because we did it last week and there was no mention of this policy then). I mean c'mon do you expect us to throw the breakfast we already bought away to order more stuff from your coffeehouse?? And call me unreasonable, but I'm not going to drink my coffee there and not eat a perfectly good bagel until later because of a policy I didn't know about.\n3. Other people there bought only a coffee and were allowed to drink it there without purchasing food.  What gives?\n4. What if we had a food allergy and couldn't eat the food they served there? Then could I bring my own or outside food?\n5. There are other local coffeehouses that allow outside food, we could just go there.\n\n\nA few aggravating asides:\n-Bought two coffees and wife only got one frequent customer punchcard punch. For those counting at home, she now has four punches, lol.\n-My wife spilled her hot coffee on her while in the car. She's fine and car is ok too. (Thank you bagel shop for a paper towel roll's amount of napkins)\n-My wife also spilled the coffee on her at our house while sitting on the couch. She again was fine, was just another thing to clean.\n\nWIBTA: For not wanting to go back to the local coffeehouse?\n\nTL/DR: New local coffeehouse has a (not posted) no outside food policy and wouldn't let us drink our coffee there because we had purchased bagels (which they don't serve) from two shops down.

      "description": "I don't want to be labeled as a control freak. My girlfriend has confronted me a few times now and asked how I would feel if she began stripping at a nice club. She has a close friend that strips and says that if she were to work at the same club she would only have to be shirtless and there is a no touch policy.\n\nShe argued the point that mens and women's nipples are the same thing and, while women's are more sexualized, they're just nipples and it's easy money. I expressed that I would still be pretty upset with the fact that she's getting topless for other mens' pleasure when we're in a relationship. \n\nSo my question is: Am I selfish for saying no? I realize that it's an opportunity for her to make a significantly larger amount of money than she's making right now. And I realize she is an adult and I don't control her. She says she would never cheat and I trust that but the question I ask myself is what borderline stuff would she do if she were to be offered more money? How far would she go? \n\nWould you be comfortable with your girlfriend being a stripper?\n",

My then-gf came with us on the last two occasions.\n\nShe broke up with me in September (we're supposed to stay on kinda good terms, vaguely saw each other a few times, even got laid maybe twice since), as since then I struggle to find her  place in the group. She definitely is a recent addition to our group as my friends and I know each other since we're 13 (we're all 21-22 now).\n\nI'm staring to feel uncomfortable with her coming along with us this summer because I feel it could ruin my time. Last time she was there, right before the breakup, she was already rather distant and we had a few arguments. That's just shitty for everyone who wants a nice vacation.\n\nI know the problem for me is that she's going to be quite distant with me again (which is normal after all, we're not together anymore) but she was always very friendly with one of my bros. I know that's gonna piss me off. It's take me months to get my shit together after the breakup, I don't want to feel like shit almost a year later for no reason.\n\nSo yeah I guess you could say it's an egoistic way of seeing things, but after all I value my vacations more than hers now, I have no reason to put up with shit just to be nice.\n\nAITA?\n\nBONUS ROUND: I sent a message to the bros saying I think I'd rather hike without her this summer, formulated in a really not-decided-yet-but-I'm-listening-to-my-guts kind of way. Should I tell her now too? Wait a few months until the hike comes up in the group chat? I'm hesitating, maybe something will come up or I'll have a change of heart. (Probably not but eh, I'm looking for any reason to delay having this discussion with her) ",

      "description": "My girlfriend was raped by a close family friend about a year ago (i was dating her at the time). She refused to press charges or make anything of it because she didn't want to cause divides between their family. Since then she has avoided all events that he showed up to. \n\nMy girlfriend and I went to a New Years party. Before going I asked her to get a guest list to make sure he wasn't coming. She did, and he wasn't on it. When we showed up at the party he was there. I expressed the desire to leave because 0% of me wanted to be in the same room as him, and I didn't want my girlfriend to have to re live any of that. \n\nShe told me I was being silly and promised me she'd stay the hell away from him.\n\nLater on in the night he came up to her. I walked up and straight up told him to get the fuck away from her. She told me not to make a big deal of it and continued talking to him.\n\nI understand that she's a victim, but to me this is still a huge betrayal. This man has no respect for her, for our relationship, for consent, for anything. I don't think I'm being unreasonable by not being okay with this. She claims that she got raped not me, and can therefore talk to him if she wants. If that's how she sees it, I can respect that, but I can't be in a relationship with someone who is rebuilding a friendship with her rapist.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So I’m 15F and out as a lesbian to my parents and other sister (13), as well as various relatives and friends. My parents are extremely accepting and amazing about it and I really appreciate all they’ve done for me. \n\nMy youngest sister is 9 years old and I’m talking with my parents about coming out to her in the next year or two. There’s no rush, there aren’t any real plans, but it’s on the radar for the distant-ish future. I may even postpone it until I have a serious girlfriend later in high school. \n\nBut the thing is, she has no idea what any of that means. I’m not looking to teach her any labels or terms, I just think it’s appropriate for her to know, in simple phrasing, that some men and women can marry each other just like mom and dad do, and it’s the same kind of love. \n\nI’ve brought this up to my parents once or twice in pretty much the same wording I used above. They aren’t opposed to this idea, but seem to view it as something that would come further in the future. I think she should have this knowledge just as a reference point so that when I do come out to her in the future, she doesn’t find it weird and understands that I’m talking about romantic love, as in, someday I’ll grow up and marry a woman instead of a man, and we won’t just be _good friends_. \n\nI should probably add that my sister isn’t _immature_ per se, but isn’t the most mature in the world. I think she can handle it, though. She’s logical and empathetic.\n\nSo AITA? Do you think this is a reasonable request of my parents, or is it not urgent?",

      "description": "My parents are normally lovely people and I wish this was a shit post. \n\nSo this morning I was walking the dogs and because everything was made of ice I slipped backwards onto the back of my head. I did not black out bit along with the headache I felt nausea and dizziness. \n\nStill... I kept coherent conversation and my balance the rest of the dog walk. But my head did not stop aching until two hours after. \n\nNow It's eight hours after and I have a throbbing headache. My friend told me I should go get it checked considering I'm Canadian and have it covered so I think \"I should, at worst I just get knowledge of how to treat a concussion from somewhere other than webMD\".\n\nSo I tell my parents I plan to do this. Some highlights. \n\n\"Don't expect me to wait several hours with you\"\n-after quick searching downstairs-\n\"  If you were going to die from it you'd die before you could get to the hospital or die in the hospital\" \n\" He's not going to die from it! You're kind of a hypochondriac (my name)\"\n\nI plan to walk or bus there and admittedly I am a bit of a hypochondriac. But of the two incidents that I suggested a hospital or doctor for, one was a cold induced nosebleed that lasted for almost an hour. The other turned out to be a condition that is abnormal for my age range. Granted that one could be treated at home and the other did stop before we needed to go to the hospital. \n\nBut seriously...

      "description": "So of course throwaway, altough my boss is a senior off all social medias, so no chance in hell he will ever see this. Happened 3 months ago, land of the free in a medium size town. \n\nI (m 38) work as a dentist assistant. Worked the same place for 14 years, pay and work has been pretty nice for the last 13, before new owner came into our lives around 1 year ago. \n\nThis is the biggest dentists office in town, really no competition. 4 dentists, 2 secretaries, 2 dentist assistants. Boss is the 5th dentist. \n\nWork environment have for a long time been cordial and nice. We are having lunch breaks together, and every 4 months or so a really nice barbeque with colleagues and their SO's. Really chill vibes.\n\nInitially the new owner seemed nice, really positive and what at first i viewed as flirty in a charming \"old guy\" way (he is around 60, silver fox long hair, slim and tall, james bond kind of guy - i am not in love with this guy as i am happily married with 2 kids, but you know the kind of guy even texans could find charismatic). \n\nSo first 4 months runs smoothly from what i can see. 5th month, im starting to see patients coming out of this guy's office in minor distress (somewhat red faces, avoiding eye contact, at one point almost tearing up). Hard to notice at first, but one of the secretaries makes me aware of it, and then it is unavoidable to see. One of the old timers came out very angry, confided to one of the secretaries that \"this guy have serious attitude problems\". Turns out he had been really demeaning to the guy (sighing during work-up, rolling his eyes when asked questions, seemingly acting like the customers problems were ridiculous). I had a hard time taking the customer seriously, as he was basically fuming and ive seen my share of high demanding pricks trough my days. This happened multiple times through the months, most patients just didnt want to talk about it (a lot of these patients speek poorly english). \n\nOne day one of the secretaries tells me she has increasing amount of phone calls of people wondering about high bills. Turns out mister boss man is the one generating the higher bills. He does this in not an exactly illegal way, but highly unethical: he adds the most expencive materials (for the customer, not for the office - because of patents vs generica), he xrays the shit out of everything altough not called for, and so on. He is sweeping in probably per month around 3-4000 bucks this way, while really not adding to the treatment or his own costs. The customer takes the bill. \n\nSo a while back i came in from the kitchen as i see this guy is brushing into one of the secretaries asses. The secretary is a quite young girl new to the office, around 26 years old. He notices me and just stride along smiling, as nothing ever happened. The secretary is standing stiff looking bothered, her eyes down. I ask what's up, and she just breaks down in tears (luckily no patients in the waiting room). Turns out this guy has been making aproaches for weeks. She had told him she was happily in a relationship, but he didnt let of and had basically been saying 'good luck on getting another job here without moving out of state'. She didnt know what to do as she has not a lot of education and is really depending on a good reference if she were to move. \n\nThis shit pissed my right of. This guy have thrown this office out of ballance. However, he is the owner, and new owners in this part of the country is hard to come by. Legal actions against this guy would and should be taken, but the truth is it will fuck all of us up in some way or another.\n\nNext days my passive anger kept on growing, and one night i snuck up to this guys house and keyed some good and deep fucking ripples into the door of this guys smooth ass black 2000's porsche 911 turbo. \n\nBossman came in red and flustered to the office the next day, couldnt stop talking of how shitty this town is and that he should have never come here in the first place. Got his car sprayed decently fast, and now its starting to chill down again.\n\nSo, am i the asshole here? I guess i am an asshole for not calling him out, but small waves here would have disastrous consequences not only for me. I am tempted to repeating this in some way. Of course i will have to be extra carefull as he now is probably on high alert. What do you guys think?\n\n\n ",

      "description": "This happened months ago. \n\nA little background on my neighbor I find out after the first incident. The neighbor lives on the street behind me and we share an alley. I'm told by other neighbors that he has sever brain damage, lives alone, and is in his mid 50's. Let's call him John.  John lived with his mother until she passed. The will stated that the house was to be sold and that money go to take care of John. John's brother decided rater than sell the house, he would \"wait\" John out and sell the house after John passed away. John is left alone in the house for weeks with the exception of when his brother visits to drop off necessities. John's brother has locked up any access to any utilities that may cause him or the house harm. John does not have a car and has to walk to the nearest fast food restaurant when he is out of food, which he walks to through the alley. John has also been known to walk around the front yard without any clothes on and leave pennies on neighbor's vehicles and fences for \"good luck.\" \n\nI should note that Adult Protective Services has been called multiple times and nothing has come of it. \n\nthe first time I encountered John was he was in the middle of one of our busier streets trying to control traffic with a shopping cart while picking up change. I slowed down and want around him making sure I was as far away as possible just like all of the other cars. \n\nLater that night my wife and I go out to eat and when we pull up to the driveway, we hit a bump. when I got out of the car, I should see a large concrete block that had narrowly missed my car. The impact point showed that it came from the direction of the alley. There was also various sticks that were thrown over too with some smaller stones. No damage, but concerning as It was a foot from going through my windshield. \n\nI know what you're thinking...\"what makes you think it is John?\" \n\nWhen I stepped into the alley, John's shopping cart was parked next to my garbage cans.  There was not only stick and stones in my recycling bin all of the sudden, but fast food wrappers from the restaurant nearby he frequents. \n\nOk no big deal. It's one time thing, I'll keep my eye out I guess.\n\nA couple of weeks later I have rocks thrown over with sticks and the same stuff into my recycling bin. no shopping cart. \n\nNo alot I can do here, I leave it alone again.\n\nA couple of more weeks pass and I'm doing lawn work when I here shuffling and mumbling in the alley. I look out there and sure enough John is hanging off my fence to get around a puddle of water. I say hello and close the gate. When John gets to my recycling bin he begins to mumble and stay there messing with the bin. I tell him to please leave or I'm going to have to call the police. I even told him that I'd give him 5 minutes to leave the area in case he was out of breath. 5 minutes goes by and I call police who intercept him at the end of the alley and I don't know the rest of the story. I haven't seen John since then.\n\nAm I the asshole for calling the police on John given the entirety if the situation? I haven't seen John since this incident and I'm hopeful he finally got the assistance he needed.",

      "description": "I am a lady, and have been good friends with a lovely couple for almost 20 years.  Let's call them Jake and Barbara.\n\nJake is a computer programmer, and occasionally is a little 'off' in his social interactions.  He fits the caricature really well.  Barbara is successful in her own field, and gardens and bakes as a hobby.  We get together to bake crazy things and have fun.\n\nThe weekend after Valentines Day, Barbara mentioned this beautiful 'Cookie Bouquet' she saw on a TV show (The Orville, for the curious).  Jake was going to order it for her then decided shipping was too expensive.  I told Jake I was going to make Barbara some cookies and steal his wife.  It is a running gag that us girls are going to run away together.  There was a group of six of us there, and we all laughed.\n\nThey left at midnight, and I started baking.  By noon the next day I had made an absolutely gorgeous cookie bouquet.  I joked with my husband that the funny thing about teasing Jake is that he actually thinks I am trying to steal his wife.  I texted a picture to Jake and said \"I hope you brought your A-game, cause I brought mine!\"  I texted Barbara as well, asking if I could come over.  Jake was supposed to be out at a sporting event.\n\nThere was no response, so after about a half hour I phoned.  To my surprise, Jake picked up.  He said \"You cannot come.  You are causing problems in my marriage.\"  I chuckled, but then froze.  \"Wait... like for real?\"  \"Yes.  For real.\"  He then hung up on me.\n\nI proceeded to have a full blown panic attack cause I am a bit of an anxious person, and assumed I had lost my friends forever.  I did not contact them, but I was in a pretty terrible state. \n\nJake and I have since both apologized and made up, but talking to my friend I was surprised to find that he has forbidden her from even looking at pictures of the cookies.  I have gone from being scared and sad to being kind of angry at this man and his issues.\n\nWho's the ass here?\n\ntl;dr - I made cookies for my girlfriend, knowing that it would tweak her insecure husband.  He went full nuclear.  AITA?",

      "description": "I've been doing online dating for a while without anything serious, then ended up meeting 2 interesting women during the same week.   Woman \"A\" I was talking to for a few days before I started talking with \"B\" but I ended up meeting B first due to our schedules.  \n\nAnyway, the first date with B went really well but I already had a first date scheduled with A.  I went on that date and also had a great time.\n\nOver the next couple weeks I went on a couple more dates with each of them. Nothing sexual until finally 4th date with B we did hook up, and we have been together a few nights since.  We haven't discussed exclusivity at all but still I feel kind of committed.\n\nNow I've got another date scheduled with A and pretty sure it's intended to be sexual as well, already invited back to hers after we go out.  Is there any non asshole way to also be intimate with her? Or is that just not possible?  I feel like telling her I just started sleeping with someone else will be the end of the relationship, is that the only non asshole option tho?\n\nBTW this is not about just having some sex.. I feel like both of these women could turn out to be long term partners. but I'm going to lose the chance with one of them just due to timing.  Also in case it's relevant, everyone here is an adult. All 3 of us are divorced and have been dating around for a while.",

About a week before the lunch we all pick a name out of a hat and that’s who you get a gift for. We also pick 3 things $20 or under that you would like and write them under your name on this list in the break room. We all do this.  I asked for gift cards because they’re easy to get. On the day of the lunch, I know it’s a secret Santa but the person who got my gift brings me this big bag with these things to put your cell phone on your dash??? I pull it out of the bag and look at it like wtf? And I say to her what’s this?? And she says you don’t like it? I say didn’t you see the list? She says no. And I just walk away pissed off. I felt kinda bad I didn’t just say thank you but I got my person a $25 gift card so I was expecting the same. Anyway what y’all think?? \n",

      "description": "Just to begin, I want to make clear that although I am am atheist I respect and support people’s beliefs. As long as someone’s belief doesn’t harm anyone else, I’m fine with it\n\nI’ve been friends with this girl in my group for around 6 years now, and she never used to be religious. She was fun and caring and friendly, super awesome friend. \n\nIn the last year or so she became very religious (she’s Muslim), she begun wearing a scarf and started praying and such. No problems here, if she wants to strengthen her relationship with God I support it\n\nThe problem started around the start of this year. She has slowly started become a bit more “hardcore”, if we all hang out together she’ll leave when it’s time for her to pray and go to an empty park or the back of a restaurant to do so. If we want to hang out at a restaurant (just for a nice dinner, we don’t really drink), she won’t attend because there is a bar/alcohol present. No one is drinking or forcing her to drink, it’s just the fact there is a bar present. She’s also beginning to refuse to carpool with us because we play music when we drive, which is apparently against her beliefs. She’s also started to not attend our birthday celebrations because there is music/alcohol present\n\nMy problem is really that I’ve invited friends and family to my birthday party in a month, it’s a buffet lunch kind of thing not a party, and she is refusing to attend. She insists that it’s not “her scene” and that there is a bar there and drinks will be served. Again, no one will be forcing her to drink, and I’ll have little cousins at the event also it’s not a rave or something\n\nI take the fact she won’t attend my birthday quite personally, and I’m just over her pushing her religious beliefs on us and not supporting us if it doesn’t suit her beliefs. I don’t appreciate the fact that someone who is meant to be my friend would put their religion over me after all we’ve been through, just because there is a celebration happening with music and drinks happening\n\nAm I the asshole if I end the friendship after this? (It won’t be just because of this one event, it’s kind of been building up to this, but this is the last straw for me) ",

      "description": "Im 18F and my boyfriend is 23M. Earlier this year our living situation changed and we've been kind of bouncing back and forth between his mom's couch, my aunt's place, and my mom's place. For context, we don't spend a lot of time at my aunt's because she lives a few towns over, about 30min drive away. We mostly stay in this area (near our mom's) because his work and my school is closer. \n\nMy mom's landlord said my boyfriend isn't allowed to stay over at all, so it's mostly been us on his mom's couch for a while. \n\nI'm not working currently, but I have a 2nd interview at your favorite anti-beef fast food restuarant, and i go to university full time. He works in landscaping. \n\nHe makes $10 an hour, but doesn't really work a whole lot of hours. Some weeks are better than others, but his last paycheck was $40. I keep trying to push him to get a better job, but he gets almost angry at me. I know if he shops around, (landscaping and general labor pays big around these parts) he can be making hundreds of dollars a week. I don't know why he just doesn't. \n\nBut i keep letting him know how badly i want a place together. I hate sleeping on peoples couches and it makes me horribly depressed. It's kind of fuckin embarrassing and we have no privacy.  I keep thinking if i let him know how much I just want our own space, he'll step up and fight for more hours at his job, or find one that will pay him a decent living. I was consistantly making more money than him at 8.50 an hour at a call center. I don't know why he stays there. \n\nIm also coming into a bit of money from my grandmother's estate. Not a crazy amount or anything, but enough to easily cover first and last month's rent and security deposit on a place, and at least 1500 leftover for emergency savings. \n\nI figure, if we really put our heads together and worked decent hours, we'd be able to easily afford a 1 bed 1 bath place. We live in a pretty cheap area and rent really isn't bad around here. \n\nMy aunt has tons of furniture leftover from my grandmother's old place that i know she'd be happy to move out of storage. (She talked to me about selling it) And i own a king mattress and a little TV so things like that arent an issue. \n\nI know he's miserable like this, too. But i just dont know how to convince him that we can do this if he stepped up and took it seriously. \n\nAnother factor of this is, his lifelong friend and his mom is having a new house built, and this friend prematurely said we could stay in the guest room, saying he was gonna see if his mom would be okay with this after the house was built. I really hope he isnt counting on this since nothing is confirmed. \n\nWe had a serious talk about it today and he said \"I dont know why you keep pushing this on me. We can't afford a place, we'd be barely scraping by. You'd hate it and we'd struggle and be thousands of dollars in debt and be right back where we were. We cant even afford $8 right now. Now i feel like the asshole because im just telling you no\" \n\nBut now I cant help but feel like the asshole. I obviously upset him and now im questioning if this is even realistic. I feel like ive done my research but, fuck. I mean even if we both worked more its still a lot. Not only rent but utilities, food, car insurance, phone bill. Am i the asshole for unnecessarily stressing him out over nothing? ",

      "description": "(Sorry for shitty formatting and writing, I’m on mobile)\n\nSo for context my grandmother is 82F and I’m 17F. Her health has been declining for the past few years and now she’s been getting blood transfusions about every 2 months and she’s been slowly but steadily getting worse. She’s also in what my brother (doctor) thinks is beginning stage dementia. I have anorexia and endometriosis, which sounds irrelevant but it’ll make sense later. \n\nAnyways, on with the post. I love my grandmother, I really do. We had an almost perfect relationship for 13 years and ultimately she’s family and I love her. However, lately she’s been really getting under my skin. \n\nIt all started about four years ago when I first met my lesbian cousin. She began making comments about how she’s “Nice for a lesbian” “kinda fruity” “better than most of her people” and it really disturbed me. I’m gay, I’ve always been gay but always been terrified of telling her. This seemed to open the floodgates, because she began making more and more comments about gay people and becoming intensely homophobic. If I try and redirect the conversation she just brings it back or begins accusing me of ignoring her, so I’ve just begun retracting in conversation and don’t really initiate anymore. \n\nAdditionally, she makes a lot of comments about my body. She knows I struggle with anorexia and body image issues, but I can’t seem to win with her. When I lose weight she says I’m too skinny, and when do I gain she calls me fat and says I need to watch my figure. I’ve told her multiple times that it makes me uncomfortable, but she just brushes me off or accuses me of being too sensitive. She calls my anorexia “fake” and says I’m “looking for attention” and says that mental illness doesn’t exist,  which sets off a whole new argument. \n\nAs she’s become more sick, she has been trying to encourage me to stop taking my medication because it “works for me” (it doesn’t) and starts accusing me of not listening to her when I try to redirect the conversation or refuse. At this point, almost every visit I’ve had with her in the past year has ended in tears. \n\nShe’s become more critically ill in the past six months, and only become nastier as time progresses. I’ve started refusing to visit her in the hospital because I can’t take being around her anymore. I don’t want to have to deal with coming away from every encounter crying and the awful feeling that comes with it. My mother has begun calling me selfish and a bad granddaughter and my aunt will barely speak to me. I’ve been getting texts and calls from my family telling me to see her and calling me selfish and cold hearted and I’m not sure what to do anymore. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to see her? Should I suck it up and see her? Is my family right? Should I stand my ground? Am I just a bad person? ",

      "description": "Background story: so my GF and I have been together for a little more than a year. We are very much in love and everything is going fine. She also broke af. She has a shitty phone that’s half working and can’t take photo at all. She’s the kind of person that is too kind, giving and giving to everyone everything, the type of person that you encounter very rarely.\n\nSo today, I had the news that I could have a new phone by renewing my phone contract. I have a very recent phone that is working perfectly fine, so I don’t really need to change. But I wanted to switch to sell to my GF the previous phone. I could easily sell it for at least 350$. So, I offered my GF to cut the price in half and sell it to her. She was shook by the concept of selling stuff to your SO. Is it?\n\nI need some money but on the other hand, I want her to have a good phone. AITA?",

      "description": "Honestly I can hardly believe this really happened myself, so I know it probably looks like a shp, but bear with me here.\n\nSo, my friend, let's call her Kallie, is on the debate team. There's this guy, let's call him Josh, that has a crush on her. I want to outline here that Josh is an asshole (he gossips, backstabs, and uses people to get what he want, and he's also *so* dramatic) and we've been snapping at each other since freshman year. However, and this is important, we're co-captains of the speech and debate team (he's in charge of speech, I'm in charge of debate). So we have kind of an uneasy peace going.\n\nSo, as it turns out, Josh decided to ask Kallie to prom. She tells me about this and is really mad. I asked why. Here's how our conversation went:\n\nKallie: Well, he asked me out before and I said no\n\nMe: But that was at the beginning of the year. Anyway, what did you say to him then?\n\nKallie: I said I was just really busy and not looking for a relationship, maybe later. \n\nMe: Well that isn't exactly the clearest way to say you have no interest... but what did he say this time. \n\nKallie: *shows me the text he sent her, and it says 'hey, I was wondering if you want to go to prom with me'*\n\nMe: That's not that bad...\n\nKallie: He asked me out even after I clearly said I wasn't interested.\n\nMe: *didn't think this would come up again, so I decided to drop it* Sure\n\nBut a few days later, Josh gets called to the principal's office for 'harrassment'. He says he didn't harrass Kallie in any way. Kallie says he did.\n\nNow, I get dragged into this. Why? I'm Kallie's friend, and co-captain with Josh, and I have a pretty good rep with the teachers and principal, so they call me to ask for another perspective.\n\nSo I had to think about what to say. On one hand, Josh is normally an asshole, and Kallie's my friend. But thinking of it logically: Josh asks her out at the beginning of the year, she instead of being clear about her feelings just gives him a vague answer about being too busy and even says 'maybe later'. He then waits more than half a year without bothering her, and then politely asks her out to prom. That doesn't sound like harrassment to me.\n\nSo that's what I told the principal, and when everyone in the club asked me how I answered the principal, I was honest with what I said. Most people, including Josh, were happy, and most people said I was being reasonable. But a few people, including Kallie, were mad.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I value my friendship with Kallie, but I honestly don't think Josh was harassing her. \n\nAita?\n\n",

And it’s not from a lack of trying on my side. He just isn’t as into it as I am I guess.\n\nHowever, he has no problems with wanking it every single day. And then will give me shit if I do it.

      "description": "As the totals suggests, I [28m] and my wife [27f] have been trying for a child for about 6 months. There are a couple factors at play here as to why we may be having difficulties, so my thought is to rule out as much as possible. She has a bleeding disorder and a family history of ovarian cysts, and I am a bit concerned about whether or not we will even be able to have children. \nYesterday, we found out that for yet another month, we were unsuccessful. In my frustration, I put my hands on my head and she immediately followed with “why are you making this about you?” I tried to explain that I was struggling with each month getting our hopes up and that she probably felt the same way. She didn’t want to hear my side and it ended in an argument about how I “make it about me.” I can understand how I could have put my feelings aside, but in the moment after hearing a “no” again, I was a bit distraught.\nI followed up by suggesting that she go and get a check up. For the last 9 months she has been without insurance (quit her job to pursue a dream of hers, and has no benefits). I recently was able to get her on my benefits, and so this is a possibility. She is making the claim that it is her body, and that it is her decision. I can’t force her to go get checked up. \nHer big Hangup is that doctors typically say that you need to try to conceive for 1 year before bothering them with any concerns of issues with pregnancy. We are at month 6. I suggested that my wife tell a white lie (how will they know when we started anyway?) in order to find out if there are any issues with her bleeding disorder, or cysts. She again reiterated that it isn’t my choice, and that she wanted to wait for a year. \nAgain, I am only hoping to rule out medical concerns for conceiving. I in no way an accusatory or think that it is “her fault.” Hell, the problem might even be me? But AITA for asking or requesting that she goes and gets a checkup for issues conceiving? ",

      "description": "Im a 22F and my Husband is a 28M. About 6 months into dating I rescued a kitten someone found in a dumpster where I work (the apartment complex where we live). I tried to rehome him at first but the couple returned him to me after only 24 hours. I became too worried someone would dump him again so I decided to keep him. He grew into a gorgeous huge tabby cat.  \n\nMy husband went out on the patio two nights ago and didn’t shut the door all the way and he got out. I told every resident that came in to keep an eye out for him and my office staff. \n\nThis morning I was driving up to the office and found him. My poor baby was stuck violently by a car. I immediately started hysterically crying. I called my husband bawling and told him. He was crying too. I parked with my hazards on until he walked to where we were I didn’t want him to get hit again. After work we are going to my parents home in the country to bury him. Several of my residents saw me sitting on the curb bawling and have come in to give their condolences. \n\nHe has apologized 100 times in the 4 hours we have known. I have told him it is okay. He texted me asking what he could do to make me feel better and I said, “honestly nothing will make it better, but it happened. I just want to spend this time mourning instead of talking about whose ‘fault’ it is. It is a horrible accident. I’m heart broken, but I just need space alone to come to terms with it”. He told me he understood. That is not apparently the case.\n\nInstead of letting me spend my day alone at work, has come up here twice going on and on about how it’s his fault and whatever else and *again* asks me what he can do to make me feel better. I told him that him coming up here and doing the opposite of what I asked earlier is only making it worse for me. I am rather numb and emotionless atm so my calmness right now may be the issue. \n\nHe got super offended and started talking about how he’s never had a pet die before and I have  (as if that makes it any easier for me?). It sounded like he wanted me to pity him and magically absolve him of the guilt he is feeling. I didn’t say much and just kept nodding. Then he said, “I guess we will forget he ever existed then” as if I was sweeping it under the rug and I told him to stop trying to make this whole thing about him. That it was “a really shit thing that happened, but I’m not going to keep entertaining this blame game. I want to mourn alone and bury him after work” and told him to please leave. He told me, “You don’t have to be such an asshole”. I didn’t even respond to that. I just went into my office and shut the door and he stormed off. \n\nI understand he feels immensely guilty about this. However, he asked what I needed to cope and instead of doing what I asked he did the opposite and made me feel like the asshole. I’ve in no way made him feel like it was his fault, but now he’s mad at me? This is the first pet he’s ever had pass away. I get that, but am I really the asshole for this?",

      "description": "I met my ex through steam, and we very quickly become very close friends, and we both admitted that we had a crush on each other, and we were both around 13 at the time.\n\nNot too long after that, he came out as trans to his family, and on Christmas, his father did the unspeakable thing that I will never forget to this day, which you can probably guess what it was.\n\nI was devastated, and asked him to call the police, but he refused to. I continually begged him to call the police for months after that, and the situation continually escalated. He tried to kill himself many times and was even sent to a mental institution after he almost succeeded.\n\nI did everything a 13 year old could possibly do. I talked to him constantly about how I loved him and wanted to help him. I tried to help him think of places to hide. I sent him a blanket and emergency food when they started kicking him out in the snow. I talked to him through all of his emotional breakdowns. I sacrificed every free moment of my life to talk to him and help him through his situation.\n\nBut the situation kept escalating to a point where every single day for a month he’d have a breakdown and I would do my best to comfort him and convince him not to harm himself. I kept on begging him to call the police, but he wouldn’t. He eventually lied to me that he called the police and said his father went to jail, but fessed up after he got drunk one night. At this point, I was continually having breakdowns because I wasn’t able to get him out of his situation, and I went into a really bad state of depression due to my father trying to get in contact with our family again and making my mom go to court.\n\nAt this point I was 15, and was just tired of trying to help. Nothing I did improved the situation. We ended up breaking up, and kept trying to be friends. It didn’t work out, and I ended up blocking him because I couldn’t deal with the emotional stress anymore, and I told him that I hoped he would get help.\n\nI tried to talk to him recently, because I wanted to reconnect and see if he got help. I asked him to please not ask me for help when something happens, because I had already done everything   I could to help him. He said that I was being very selfish, and that he had nobody else to talk to about it. I’m still trying to get over what happened, and it’s wrecked me emotionally. We’re both 16 now, am I an asshole?\n\nNote: He lives in a different country than me, if I was able to call the police for him, I would have a long time ago.\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for choosing myself when friend is having a hard time?",
      "description": " I am doing a fulltime internship to graduate, doing homework in the evening and dealing with the aftermath of ptsd. I take it slow, plan one or two times a week to meet friends and family. If I do more then I have energy for, my body protests by a panic attack and throwing up. I watch myself, am doing fine 90% of the time and have started therapy again cause I noticed I still have triggers I would like to overcome. I can manage this internship this way because I take it slow, they assist me, are very understanding and I can work from home if I want. \n\nOne of the things that trigger me is unexpected touching and someone claiming my attention or demanding my time at the moment when I am already very busy or in a not phone friendly environment. That is just rude behaviour, in my opinion.. \n\nThis one friend kept pushing it, called me multiple times while I was driving, making me think there was a death (family of mutual friend was hospitalised day before). I tried to call her back but couldnt get a hold of her. She had said in a groupchat to call her immediatly. So I blurted out, ‘glad someone is not death, I am very busy today’(as I was having a busy day with family) when she did answer over chat. Apparantly she was having a really bad time herself but had already planned to meet up with mutual friend and spoken on the phone to two other people.Before I left home I had told them about my busy day and that I wouldnt be available. \n\nThis friend has pushed my boundaries multiple times, she is one of those people thats hit you out of the sudden in a playful way. I asked her to not do that to me cause I can react badly to being touched like that, even from friends or family. She would have heated arguments when she and boyfriend where over(at my place), made me and everyone uncomfortable so asked her to tone it down til they got home or take it outside. I dont like being around people screaming at eachother, I dont like fights, I freeze or panic as I am still working on it. I am not telling her how to live her life, I just asked her to keep me in mind as I work on myself.\n\nNow she and boyfriend broke up, she expects a lot more from me and mutual friend. Today we had an argument over the phonecalls and my reaction and she said that I abandond her and is hurt. And that I put her problem in a bad context by asking if someone had died. I am having a hard time seeing it from her point of view. All I want is peace and quiet and graduate succesfully. I feel like I didnt abandon her because I knew she had spoken to 3 other people and I did try calling her back. She said it was unclear to her that I wasnt available, I dont know how that was unclear cause mutual friend did know this from the same group chat and I told her personally as well. She then said I got more from the friendship then she did and I have no idea what that means? I did not tell my friends most of what happend to me, when I felt rock bottom depressed I got help from professionals or called my assigned buddy. So I never ‘claimed’ someones time and would never do so.\n\nI cannot tell her how to deal with this break up, I do wish she was more independent, it would be better for her own happiness as well. I am not saying she cant grieve or talk to me about the break up, she does and I have seen her two times the week of the phonecall to let her vent. One of those times I got a panic attack she witnessed.\n\nI tried to not get in on the argument as I was at work at the moment and didnt have time. I tried to be as nice as possible but lost it when she started making those weird accusations and telling me what I should have done.I know I am not as good as a friend as she needs for now, but I do all I can.\n\nSo now she has broken up the friendship, honostly I dont feel that bad. But id like to know if I did the right thing, my vision is blurred cause I know I can be tense over the boundary thing, its just what I need to do. Am I a bad friend?",

      "description": "I live in a quiet neighborhood development a few houses down from a dead end/cul-de-sac. Just before my house is a stop sign where another dead end road intersects. No one ever drives down these streets unless they live here or are visiting and since almost everyone in the neighborhood works, it’s very quiet during the day (no cars).\n\nThis morning, I was driving back to my house after dropping off my kid at school. I passed a pedestrian taking a walk on the side of the street and slowed as I passed him even though I was already going slowly. About 100 yards past him, I came to the stop sign. I slowed to an almost-stop, looked in all directions, and of course no other cars were coming, so I did a very slow “rolling stop” and then turned into my driveway. I glanced into my rear view mirror and suddenly saw the pedestrian waving his arms and screaming at me, basically chastising me for not coming to a complete stop.\n\nAm I really the asshole for not coming to a complete stop? The guy was so furious I thought he was going to knock on my door afterwards.",

      "description": "Pretty sure this is gonna land me a nice, smug spot on r/niceguys but whatever\n\nSo back in high school, I had a friend, let's call her Rose. We were generally close, and often went to each other for emotional support. Being an awkward autistic single high schooler, I was generally insecure about my relationship status and virginity, sentiments I shared with her (this is important later). I also had a pretty big crush on her, but she had a boyfriend, and I respected their relationship, because that's the right thing to do.\n\nEventually Rose's relationship with her boyfriend, started to get bumpy, and I was a shoulder to cry on many a time. I still had that crush on her, but I had the sense to know that it was wrong and disrespectful to try and get with her at that point.\n\nWe remained friends, then one day she came to me complaining about getting ghosted, and then said \"I'd rather date you tbh\" and proceeded to go on about how cute and funny I am and how I'm all she can think of.\n\nWe proceeded to flirt for a bit, occasionally getting a bit nsfw, but it never went past that. So one day, I asked her when we were gonna go steady. She said she wasn't ready for another relationship after our last one, but promised we would get together eventually. I understood that and told her I would wait as long as she needed\n\nA few days later her facebook feed was full of gushy shit about her new boyfriend (not me). I was confused as all hell, and tried to ask her what's up (I feel I gotta insist I was rational and calm, I didn't come at her angry at this point, I just wanted to know what happened to her promise).\n\nShe read my message, and didn't respond. I waited a bit, still no response. I asked a mutual friend if she knew what the deal was, and Rose almost immediately messages me, angrily asking why I asked the mutual friend.\n\nI told her why, and reiterated that I wanted to know what was up. She responded that it was stressful to date people from the same school, and swiftly blocked me before I could ask any further questions\n\nNow at this point I was a mixture of depressed, and disappointed I felt used, like I was some sort of pseudo rebound that waa tossed away with no remorse for how I felt. I felt particularly insulted because not only did she know about my insecurities, but that we were very close friends, and there was nothing but trust between us up untill now.\n\nMy depression slowly devolved into anger, but I never got the chance to talk it out with her. I avoided her from then on. Eventually a few months latwr I told another mutual friend about what happened and how I felt, and how I was still upset about it. \n\nWithout either of our permission, she made a group chat and put both of us in it, and left, leaving us alone. She proceeded to ask me why I still cared.\n\nThat was the last straw for me. She knew how much she hurt me, and had the audacity to imply I was in the wrong for being hurt and upset.\n\nI lost it, calling her a cunt and a whore before leaving the group chat, hoping I'd never speak to her again. She proceeded to post our conversation in an attempt to expose me. Normally I avoid using language like that, but I was so hurt and upset I lost all control\n\nIt was pretty fucking embarrising to be put on blast like that, but luckily very few people saw or cared. One person was neutral, and the mutual friend who set up the group chat sided with her.\n\nWe eventually apologized to each other, but we still aren't on speaking terms. I have her blocked on all social media with no intention of seeing her again in my life.\n\nNow I know it's the whole \"you're not entitled to date her, you're not entitled to a response/explanation\" but I will vehemitley defend my position that if you make a promise, any promise to someone, and you break that promise. They should know about it. To break a promise, not tell them, and ignore them after they ask is super insulting and disrespectful\n\nAm I the asshole? This whole situation is similar to ones I've heard on r/niceguys and  r/creepypms and I'm kinda upset I'm a piece of shit like them. I later learned that she cheated on her bf, but honestly that sounds like me trying to justify what I did in my head.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

It’s surreal how much she looks like her.\n\nSo I told her that she looks like her mom, and my niece was... horrified?  She said, “But I don’t want to look like her!”\n\nOver the course of the visit, a couple of times I repeated my observation, and she denies any resemblance every time.\n\nThe reason I put horror in quotes is because my niece could be possibly pretending to be upset at the resemblance because she thinks it’s funny.  I have a hard time gauging whether she’s being serious or not.\n\nIn any case, the more she protests, the more I want to remark on the resemblance.  So even though she’s acted whatever way she acted, I still do it.\n\nI wish this went without saying, (but unfortunately you have to specify nowadays), but my sister’s not abusuve or anything.  She’s actually a great mom.  So it isn’t because my niece hates her mom or anything that she’s saying she doesn’t want to look like her.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I think I fucked up but I'm still confused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so my girlfriend (F22) and I (M22) were talking, and it came up that she was late. This is no issue, it happens. We've been together for 4-ish years now, but we've been long distance for a few months. I know she's (almost certainly) not pregnant, and I know she wouldn't cheat on me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last time we had sex was right around Valentine's day. She's not on birth control, but I wore a condom and didn't finish anyway. (I know pregnancy is still possible under these circumstances, but again, I feel it's unlikely.) Here's where things get kinda convoluted so you'll have to stick with me. She was also late last month, after we had had sex. She's been going through a lot with school lately and these things happen when she's stressed. I thought she said that she had taken a pregnancy test and it came up negative. I learned later, after this argument had started, that she had actually said her period came and that's how she knew she wasn't pregnant. I was wrong about this detail at first, which informed the following decision. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said, just as a side comment, that if she turned out to be pregnant, I would want a paternity test. She got super upset and said I was accusing her of cheating and that I didn't trust her. I said trust never entered my mind, I just figured that was the thing to do. This was also when I realized I had misunderstood her earlier about any prior tests. This was multiple phone calls and lots of her crying and me trying to explain why I didn't mean anything by it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was operating under the belief that we had sex, she then had a late period and wasn't pregnant, but then a month later she took another test and was pregnant. From my point of view, if she found sores on my wang that weren't there before, she would be right to question that. And I would understand, even if I didn't cheat, because the possibility exists and there's no reason to be less than 100% certain. I realize this doesn't exactly translate, because you can't test to see where STIs com from, but I think it's similar circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I have a 3rd party friend politely telling me it was a dickish thing to say, but I guess I'm just not really getting it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike if she was pregnant, I would still believe it was my kid, pregnancy tests can be wrong. I just think it's reasonable to verify it. For me it's not a matter of trust, it's just the thing you're supposed to do. Is she reading too much into it or am I being a dick?",

It’s not that he can’t be in the same room as me while I do it but I don’t like it when people just stand there and watch. I’ve told him many times the specific reason I don’t like this is because my abusive father used to use dishes not being done to his standard as an excuse to exact abuse. He would find any spec real or imaginary. So when someone stands over my shoulder and watches me today as an adult it causes an involuntary stress response. I asked him to just walk away for a few minutes and he refused. When I finally couldn’t take it anymore and left the room he followed me and told me if I knew this problem was coming from me then it was on me to deal with it and I had no right to get mad at him over it. I feel like asking someone to not stand there and watch me do something is not some huge request and should have been simple to comply with. I feel like he was just being stubborn for the sake of it.

      "title": "AITA for threatening to sue my parents for taking out student loans in my name?",
      "description": "I graduated college 4 years ago and I rarely speak to my mother or father. Maybe 2-3 times a year and even then it’s only for a few minutes, they refused to let me play sports in high school or have a social life and they’ve basically cut me out of their lives since I and about 75 other people got a city drinking ticket 7 years ago in college. Since I live about 800 miles away, I only go back to my hometown once a year either for Thanksgiving or Christmas, most years I stay with a friend or at a hotel, last year I stayed with my parents. No way in hell am I going back for either this year.\n\nJust about 5 months before I graduated college, my parents bought a boat. I know they got a good deal on it and they have used it a lot. They took it out of the water for the season in early October. I’ve literally never seen it in person, just pictures from Facebook.\n\nLast week I had texted my father (first contact since March) and let him know I would be able to make it back for Christmas. About a minute later he called and over the course of 5 minutes explained how he and my mother decided since their last child was about through college, they would buy a boat. The only problem was they didn’t have the ~$20,000 to buy it.\n\nWhat was their solution? Take out a student loan in my name of course! My mailing address was always their house through college so I was none the wiser. Why was my dad telling me about it now 4 years after the fact? Because they can’t pay it back, they actually never paid any of it back. They kept putting it in forbearance but that ran out early this year. Fast forward 7 or 8 missed payments later and my dad tells me the only reason he’s telling me now is because he doesn’t want me to bring it up at Christmas and he knows it’s going to default in a month or two. His exact words were “If you’re going to make a big deal about this it’s best if you don’t come home this year”.\n\nHe also said it’s “about $25,000” is what I would need to pay it off. I hung up and just sat in shock for a couple of minutes. I called my brother yesterday and told him what was happening and that I think I’m going to sue them for whatever it takes to pay off the loan. I still don’t know what that amount is yet, I should probably find out by next week. I’m cool with my brother and he’s cool with my parents and I’m sure he probably talked to them because this morning I get a text from my mom just saying “Do NOT sue us”. I texted her back saying she would need to immediately pay off the entire loan and show me proof. She texts back that I need to grow up. Obviously I’m not even going to respond to that.\n\nThe boat is probably worth half of what they paid for it by now and with the hours they’ve put on it. I don’t know if they have the money or not to pay up immediately if I sue them but I figure I can at least garnish their wages. My other brother called and asked me to hold off a few months before doing anything that it was shitty of them to do that but to give them a chance to start paying if off.\n",

      "description": "So, my wife and I don't get to see each other very much due to the hours we both work, we get about 2 hours together after I get home at night, so I really value my time with her. \n\nSo, tuesday afternoon, she sends me a text saying she'd like to have a date night thursday, which is my day off and conveniently also valentines day. I would cook a nice dinner and we would have some...ahem...private time...\n\nSo, today I vacuum, do the dishes, pick up dog toys, etc. I say that because she has said before that having the house clean when she gets home will help her unwind and get in the mood. Dinner is almost ready when she got home, and the second she got in the door, I wrapped my arms around her, grabbed her butt and gave her a deep kiss.\n\nShe smiled, looked around and commented on the clean house, then went and put a sweater and pyjama pants on.\n\nThis surprised me, but I didn't say anything, since maybe she wanted to relax and eat dinner first. So we watch Lucifer while I finish cooking dinner(homemade chicken parmesan), we eat dinner and then...nothing. An episode ended right after we finished eating and she picked up the remote and hit play for the next episode, then the one after that, which she fell asleep near the end of. So I just helped her to bed.\n\nI'm hurt and disappointed that she put no effort into the date night that was her idea.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Me and my best friend have known each other for 4 years and we've gone through a few phases. For some reason, most of the things we liked overlapped at some point, but she tended to be the first to get into them. \n\nLately, I've been really into Sherlock and she was really into the series as well a few months ago, but now she only talks about Queen. I also really like their music, but she's like... Obsessed, they're the only thing she talks about, besides boys she likes. \n\nIt wouldn't be much of a problem if it wasn't for how she has acted in the past.\n\nLast summer I casually ended up watching an F1 race and I absolutely fell in love! It was the best thing I'd ever watched and it quickly became my biggest passion. I did talk about it a LOT and she did anything she could to kinda bring it down. \nNo biggie, we could talk about Harry Potter, which we both liked.\n\nOne day we all decided to go out for ice-cream or something and the first thing she said was: \"Ok guys. No talking about F1, nor Harry Potter today.\" \nI looked at her a bit confused, but I thought it was kinda fair, since I did talk about those things a lot. I figured it was annoying to her and brushed it off, nodding periodically as she ranted about the guy she liked. \n\nIt was not the last time she did a thing like that, because EVERY TIME we went out after that, she'd repeat the same thing. She was also getting out of her HP phase so it was really useful for her, but it killed conversation for me.\n\nSo, after Bohemian Rhapsody came out, her love for Queen finally bloomed. I wasn't really worried, because I liked the band as well, so I figured we could talk about something that we both liked, for once.\nAs we went on, it became pretty annoying. As in it was the ONLY thing she'd talk about and since I didn't care much about the singers themselves, it was essentially just her rambling about Roger Taylor and going on and on about how cool he is and all that.\nSince I'd acted like that too, I didn't care.\n\nWe RP sometimes, so she decided to start a RP about Queen. I don't RP much these days, but okay cool, I'd just have to do a cringey self-insert where she'd be perfect and all the characters would be OOC. Whatever, I enjoyed the memes I made through it. (The RPs would be centered about her and her current love interest, making the actual plot pretty much shit.).\n\nWe'd been RPing Queen for a few weeks about every night at one point, and I felt like RPing Sherlock for once. I thought she wouldn't mind.\nShe refused, which was what made me mad. We only talked about Queen, she'd always have her way with stuff, she never let me talk about what I liked and the one time I wanna do Sherlock, she refused.\n\nAfter that I always got pissed when she spoke about Queen and, though I haven't said anything about it to her (She'd just back stab by saying I do the same thing with F1, or would get mad and say stuff like \"You're right, whatever\" and think she's right.) I can't really stand it anymore. AITA?\n\n\n",

A little information, I work at a place that has two separate buildings. I am in the second building and this person called Joe is in the first building. I've been warned about how lazy Joe is, and I've seen some of it. \nSo tonight I get in at midnight and check in at the front desk to be logged in. I see he is asleep at the front desk. (for overnight shifts, sometimes people sleep but  not until 3 or 4 when all the work is done). I go to my spot in the second building. \nAround one in the morning I am told I had to get something for someone in the first building. The second person in the main building is older and can't go up and down steps well. the materials I had to get were downstairs. I go into the drawer next to joe, grab the keys and get the stuff. Im irritated at this point. Why was I called over when he was just as capable of doing this? He was awake at this point, I would like to add, and watching something on his laptop. \nI go back upstairs after locking up and put the keys in the drawer and look him in the face and calmly say, \"If someone else needs this item, you need to get it. I'm not walking back and forth between buildings like this all night.\" He looks at me as though I just cussed him out. \n\"Who do you think you're talking to?\" He yells. I walk out, not wanting to have started an argument. I thought he was just going to shrug it off and ignore me like he usually does to people. He keeps calling after me like that until im outside. I walk back to the second building and see my friend/coworker in her car and stop to talk to her and tell her how frustrated I was. She thought it was funny and was glad I told him that. Until he comes over.\nHe rushes me, screaming \"who do you think you are? you don't talk to me like that, don't disrespect me like that, you don't yell at me and slam them keys.\" I calmly tell him he needs to calm down and he doesn't get to talk to me like this. He continues going on and on and screaming at me about he wasn't the one who called me over. Which I knew but I don't understand why the person sitting right next to him, never told him to do it, but called me over. \nIm now shaking and on edge. I was scared. I didn't know what the hell was going to happen and I'm scared to be alone with him especially off camera. I emailed my boss and the person in charge of this section of the organization. At first I felt justified, but now I am scared that maybe I was in the wrong. I never slammed the keys, and I never rose my voice, even when he was screaming at me. My coworker told me to tell my boss what happened. He has no business talking to me like that. I didn't mean to start a fight. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Okay so, I’m 17 and attending high school, a girl in my class (we’ll call her S) has a birthday coming up and another girl in my class set up a group chat with every girl in the class and announced that we all had to bring in €10 to go towards getting airpods for S’s birthday. For a bit of background: I go to a very small school and in my base class there’s 15 people, of those 15, 10 are on this group chat, so €10 X 10 people=€100 which is enough for the airpods. Anyways, I’m not a cheapskate, I don’t have a job but when a friend or family member has a birthday coming up, I save whatever I have to get them something nice. I would have no problem getting S a present if we were friends or even if she was having a party and invited me but really, I barely have any classes with her and we seldom talk. Why should I be putting money towards a gift for her then? because we don’t talk I didn’t think to invite her to my birthday party last year and obviously she didn’t get a present for me. I really don’t think I should have to give the €10 as seen as S and I aren’t friends but I feel like I’m going to look like a cheap Asshole if I just leave the groupchat. I’m really not sure what to do. Do I scrape together whatever I have to give money towards a gift for a girl I barely talk to? Or do I leave the group and risk looking like TA to the rest of the girls?\n\nSo again, AITA for not wanting to pay for this gift? \n\nThis is my first real post on Reddit like this so please excuse me if it’s long winded or not in the right place. Also feel free to ask questions if I’m not being clear, thank you :)",

      "description": "My roommate recently started a new job, so we've had to start coordinating usage of the bathroom/shower in the morning. I used to finish getting ready around 8:00, and we agreed that now I would try to finish at 7:40 so that she could get ready after me.\n\nThe other day I woke up at 7:35, so I skipped my shower because I knew I wouldn't finish by 7:40. At 8:05 she was still in her room, so I knocked on her door and she answered in her PJ's and said \"I discovered a way to knock 30 minutes off my commute, I can uber to X train station instead of taking the subway to Y.\" I thought it was a bit strange that she came to this epiphany in bed at 7:40 in the morning, but I didn't say anything. Then basically the same thing happened the next day, so that night I told her I didn't appreciate it.\n\nAfter we argued for a bit I said \"It seems like you making it to your train is important enough for me to wake up early, but not important enough for you wake up early.\" At this she got extremely offended, and said I was implying that she doesn't work hard or that she doesn't care about her job. She kept on saying \"I'm sure that's not what you meant to say, I know you're tired right now,\" which really pissed me off because that IS what I meant to say, and it's objectively completely true - I mean if it was actually important for her to make her train then she would have woken up, right? I wasn't trying to imply that she was lazy or anything, I just put the facts out there and she chose to interpret them that way. I was trying to that she values her own time, sleep, and comfort more than she values mine, which is unfair. Anyways now she's really pissed at me. I know that I could have handled this a bit more tactfully, but am I really an asshole here?",

      "description": "Throwaway account, posting via mobile, I’m going to try to give enough information. This happened today.\n\n\nI work at a daycare. My job is incredibly diverse, and we have kids, parents and staff of all walks of life. My bosses realize we all have lives outside of work, and as long as it doesn’t not affect our work, they don’t really judge what we do outside of our scheduled hours.\n\n\nI have a 20 year old coworker who lives with her 20 year old boyfriend and their 2 1/2 year old son. Since we work at a daycare, her son is enrolled and is in my classroom, while she teaches in a different room. Both her and her boyfriend smoke weed. Her boyfriend more so than her, and is someone who smokes multiple times a day (no judgement here, my boyfriend is the same way). \n\n\nHowever, the issue is, her son, or specifically her son’s lunchbox will sometimes smell like weed. I know she has been talked to about this three times: once by me, once by the other teacher in my room and once by another coworker who she is close with. None of these times management has been involved, however I do not know if outside of these three instances she has been talked to about it as well.\n\n\nWe keep all our kids lunchboxes in a locked floor cabinet. Today when I walked passed it I got a hint of something that smelt like weed. When I opened the cabinet the smell was definitely there and my coworker’s son’s lunchbox reeked. So today I went to the boss in private and said “hey the cabinet where we keep our lunchboxes smells like weed. I’d rather be the one to tell you before another parent says something. You can tell who’s lunchbox it’s coming from.” My boss proceeded to remove the lunchbox from the cabinet and store it in the office. I’m not sure if anything else was done.\n\n\nAt the time I was genuinely thinking it would be bad if another parent reported it. Now, after the fact, I’m feeling guilty and as though I snitched. I’m truly conflicted. Also after the fact I’m (selfishly) thinking I could have gotten in trouble if a parent would have said something. At the same time, I don’t even know if a parent would say anything. Also we are expecting a visit from state soon (if you don’t know what that means, think food/health inspector coming to a restaurant). I don’t know what would be the consequences if state smelt that. \n\n\nAt the same time, I don’t know what I would do if it was a lunchbox for a kid whose parent I did not work with. I’m upset I was put in a position and I don’t want to feel like I snitched. So, am I the asshole?",

He's got an extremely low voice, like chocolate rain deep, but couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. He picks one tone and will not leave that tone, it's his home. And instead of moving his pitch up and down he simply yells louder or more softly. All his favourite tunes are sing-a-longs too, with his favourite band being queen. Sometimes he notices how he sounds, so he'll turn up the music which just makes him yell louder.\n\nNow you may be thinking \"if he's so nice why would that bother you? Don't be a dink\", but I have lived with this dude for three years. We carpool to work. Every day for three years and the walrus is still suffering lol.

      "description": "This is my first post ever on reddit, so be gentle, but I just have to know if I'm the asshole here!\n\nSo, I worked as a lifeguard at a local pool in my late teens. It was a shit job and we were always understaffed, especially in the summer season, so we are normally pretty stressed out and tired. I'm quite jokey with a lot of customers and it normally plays off well , but this time it really didn't. \n\nThere are the usual pool rules signs up, but one rule we have is you can't jump in backwards. This is one of the rules that are really heavily enforced because I've heard stories of people cutting their chins on the poolside as they jump in. So on this day, a couple of kids are jumping in, having fun, but one is about to go in backwards. Trying to stop them I dash over and say \"woah woah woah\" (If you're asking why I didn't blow a whistle, we had swimming lessons on at the same time and the instructors use whistles so everyone just ignores them). Anyway, I get there a bit late and the kid goes in but thankfully he didn't hurt himself. I kneel down, smiling cause I'm glad hes fine, and say with a bit of  laugh \"don't be an idiot mate and go in backwards, you can hurt yourself.\"\n\nThe kid looked at me very wide eyed, but that was quite a good reaction because most normally cry when being told they can't do something. So I take that as a success and return to my post. Then, this dude (who I later found out was the kid's dad) comes charging at me, yelling that he wants to speak to my manager. I go fetch the boss and this dude starts yelling how I called his son an idiot and he's going to make a formal complaint. I try to say how its very dangerous to go in backwards and I don't want anyone to get hurt and he relies \"you shouldn't be a lifeguard if you're that panicky.\"\n\nTo be fair, I am quite a jumpy guy. He logged a formal complaint but my manager at the time made sure it didn't go any higher. I just feel like he over reacted to the word \"idiot\", which I don't consider that offensive especially how I said it. I'm pretty sure he didn't here exactly what I said, I managed to get hold of a copy of his complaint and he said I yelled at his kid \"stop being an idiot\", which isn't true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has bugged me for years as everyone I have told this to never gives me a straight answer. Whatever the judgement, I will accept it.",

      "description": "This happened 4 years ago. I've always been conflicted about whether I was overreacting or not.\n\nMy mother was diagnosed with inoperable cancer 4 years ago, and passed away within 5 months of diagnoses. It was a rough 5 months as my father and I did the majority of the caretaking for her.\n\nAt the same time a woman I've known since I was 14, (we were in our early 30s at this point),  had a pet die. It happened the same night I found out my mother had brain tumors. I tried to let her know I felt bad about her pet, but I had my own thing going on and couldn't be there for her. She insisted on calling me anyway to talk about her cat. Annoying, but my mom wasn't dead yet and my friends beloved pet was. I let it go.\n\nFast forward 5 months. My mother just died. I haven't been talking to my friend much because I've either been busy or exhausted. And a bit I was dodging her calls because all she ever talked about were her cats. But she wants to come to the funeral since she knew my mom and really cared for her. I let her know when and where and that she's welcome to come back to the house for the close friends and family get together after the reception.\n\nShe showed up at the church the funeral was at and I just couldn't shake her. After the service there was a reception and she followed me around it, talking to me about cats and complaining about living with her father. There were over 200 people at the service, my mom was well liked by her community. Most of them wanted to offer their condolences and as they did my friend kept awkwardly going on about her problems in the background. At one point I managed to slip away from my friend to have a smoke outside and she tracked me down. It was at that point I told her for the second time I really needed a break from the cat talk, and suggested she go say hi to her brothers family.\n\nShe came back to my side as soon as she could and continued on about the cats for the rest of the day. It was infuriating. The next day I blocked her from my social media and sent her a text saying I didn't appreciate her behavior and needed some time and space from our friendship. She flipped out, sent a lot of insulting messages, engaged with name calling. I just blocked her numbers and haven't spoken to her since.\n\nI just wonder if I was overreacting out of grief, exhaustion, all the heaviness that comes with caring for a dying relative. AITA?",

In a half-joking, somewhat serious and provocative way, my friend brought up that the football team (which used and decorated the whole locker Room) should have to share and accommodate all the other sports. \n\nMy friends, who I still believe are being unreasonable, swear that they have rights to “their” locker room and that it’s not for anyone else. I brought up ownership of the locker room should go to the team with the best record, which would be the golf team. (For more context, the football team had just gotten to a terrible start, and finished with a terrible record). This got them pretty pissed, but I still think they should understand that they don’t have much basis to help their argument that their team is “superior”.\n\nWe all have a pretty good relationship, but I felt somewhat bad because I really do hope that they do well as a team.",

      "description": "I have two close friends, Joe and John. \n\nA week ago they wanted to catch up over dinner in a local restaurant. I don't have a lot of spare savings. But I don't see them often, and there's never much opportunity to hang out so I decided to just go. The dinner was nothing special, came down to about $10 each. Joe forgot his wallet so I paid for him. I didn't specifically say anything but I was under the assumption that he would return it when he had the chance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today. I ran into Joe and tried to ask in a polite way (I'm a little short right now, do you think you could pay me back sometime?) He laughed it off and grew annoyed when I kept on asking why he thought was funny. He explained that if you offer to pay for someone else you shouldn't expect them to pay you back. \n\nI got pretty angry, not because of the money but because he was really dismissive. I was raised to believe that you should always find a way to pay back or reciprocate when a person does something for you, even if it's just showing appreciation. I felt he just waved away my beliefs and the issue with an excuse. If he didn't have the $10 or was also short that would've been fine but dismissing me like that was really rude and not something i want in a friend.\n\nSo I just walked away and stopped keeping in touch/inviting him to hangouts. John probably heard, because today he told me that it was an asshole-ish thing to do and it ruined the whole friendship circle blah blah. He said it was only a few dollars and now I'm holding a grudge. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole? Did I overreact?  \n\n ",

      "description": "I currently work at a retail joint with a small group of coworkers who all get along well. I decided to invite them all over to my place for a dinner party and reluctantly invited L, one of my coworkers. L is extremely hard to spend time with. She shows up late to her shifts as well as any event we have. She believes in all this nutjob conspiracy crap (ex. That vaccines cause deformaties and that rich people bath in the blood of babies etc) and spends a lot of time talking about it. She also constantly tells me (I'm gay) that gay people are disgusting. All in all a shitty person, but I'm nice and invited her anyway. \n\nL then decides that she doesn't like that I'm cooking asain food and tells me I need to make something different. I tell her I won't change the menu. Still, I don't recind the invitation. \n\nThen shit hits the ceiling because L quits. Not only does she quit, but she doesn't show up to her last three shifts and then berates me for not covering her even though I had used my vacation days to go see my mother. My manager is pissed and she didn't even return her key. \n\nSo basically I want to tell her the dinner in two weeks is canceled and still have it. I know this is a dick move, but I can't imagine a more awkward event considering she screwed all of us by not showing up and screwed our manager (who is coming) by not giving back her key even though she quit a month ago. My coworkers have specifically asked me to disinvite her. \n\nSo reddit, WIBTA?",

Last week though, he was infected with the flu, was sent to the hospital and because of his weak immune system he did not make it.\nHe was my sister's godfather and she had a good relationship with him, but I have never been close with him, never had a deep or long conversation and we haven't been in touch for about a year now. I am sad that he died and I feel very sorry for my sister and everybody else who was close to him. But I just don't feel like going to his funeral next week. Somehow it feels wrong to say goodbye to a person I haven't been in contact with for the last year. Also I would have to use a day off from work to be able to go there which I could definitely get, but work is very busy right now and I'm not sure, if I want to use a vacation day for a funeral I don't want to go to and I would feel misplaced at. Honestly, I would only go there, so that my other relatives wouldn't think bad of me.\n\nI already feel like a massive asshole just by thinking about it this way, but what do you guys think?\nWIBTA?\n\nTL/DR: Didn't talk to my uncle for a year, was never close to him.

I observed that I really hate that song, and that while America has lots of problems, that I'd rather have those problems in America than anywhere else in the world.  \n\nWell you would have thought I'd just peed in their cornflakes.  People went ape-shit.  I was called an ignorant racist.  Told I have no empathy.  I mean it got so bad, that the company eventually just deleted the thread.  \n\nI've been poor as poor can be... but I'd never choose to be poor in another country over America.  This is the land of the free and the home of the brave.  I tried to follow up 1:1 with the biggest haters afterwards to find out what their problem with me was, but they just shouted at me.\n\nI really wasn't trying to cause a controversy.  I don't know why patriotism makes people lose their fucking minds these days. \n\nMy guess about how the comments are going to go:\n\n1. Lots of people will call me privileged and ignorant -- which makes no sense because I grew up pretty poor.  We were on free lunches at school, for instance...\n2. People will assume I'm a conservative, trump-loving, homophobe -- which is crazy because I'm not.  I love the whole rainbow.  Be who you wanna be is my perspective.\n\nI'm really honestly perplexed how saying that you love your country automatically translates to all of this, frankly, crazy-assed bullshit.\n\nJudging by the torches and pitchforks in slack, I'm the asshole... but WHY AITA?  \n\nI'm really asking.

      "description": "My husband and I never wanted a big wedding so we just married with a wedding officiant. My family was ok with it. His family really wanted us to have an actual wedding party and to plan one for a few months after we married. Since I can remember I have always thought marrying in front of people was awkward and something I never wanted to do, which husband and his family knew. I agreed to a wedding after being pressured for a while. \n\nI’m in the midwest and his family is in the east coast. I asked to have the ceremony in my city,  because it’s the city we met in, and so my family (none of whom could afford to travel) could attend. His family is able to and does travel often. His family said they wanted it to be in their city and pretty much shut down any other options. After a couple weeks I was guilted into switching it to their city. \n\nThe wedding was scheduled to be on our anniversary (I’m weird and love anniversaries and special dates). His family said that the day wasn’t convenient enough for everyone and wouldn’t be pretty enough weather. They wanted us to change the date completely to a few months before the original. I reluctantly agreed to make it a date that was more convenient for his family after a week or so of hearing complaints.\n\nI’m not a preachy sort of vegetarian or anything, but I wanted my wedding to be meat-free. Several family members said they wouldn’t come if there was no meat served at the wedding and I was some kind of crazy person for thinking I could have an event with no meat.\n\nHere’s where the person I never met comes in: I never wanted people to see me get married in the first place, so I asked for the cutoff to be family and those related by marriage only to keep it small. His aunt then said that if her sons girlfriend couldn’t come, her whole family wouldn’t come. I had never met or heard about the girlfriend in my life. I felt there had to be a cutoff and was really not ok with some random person I’d never met at my wedding. This was the only thing I refused to compromise on. I told my husband to inform the aunt that the girlfriend was not allowed. \n\nInstead of telling the girlfriend not to come, the wedding got canceled without my consent by my husband and his family in order to avoid upsetting the aunt and girlfriend. \n\nI could have allowed the girlfriend to come but it was about more than just the guest list at that point. At that point it had become wedding I never wanted on a meaningless date in a city that had no significance to our relationship with people who had for months continuously disrespected my needs and beliefs, so I felt I had a right to put my foot down on something that made me so uncomfortable. \n\nI was made out to be a horrible person for not compromising on this and my husband sides with the family. I’m wondering if I should have just let the girlfriend come to keep the peace. So...AITA? ",

Not thinking anything would happen soon I said yeah sure, she then called half an hour later saying she's on her way as she just broke up with him. \n\nNow my house is a tiny unit with two rooms, one is our bedroom, the other is a study room that does have a small bed in it for when guests come over. This very rarely happens, so it's main use is to study and use our computers. \n\nShe first said it would be a couple of nights a week until she found a new place, then it's every night for a week, now its two weeks...I feel like this is going to keep growing until she either gets a new place or I can't handle it any more. She gives me loads of washing to do for her at night then goes straight to bed leaving me hang it all up for her. She went back to her old place last night to dye her hair black and comes back after midnight wanting to dry it in a carpeted room which I ask her not to do as it might flick black hair dye everywhere. She gets annoyed that she has to dry it in the bath room, which makes me feel like an ahole. Then this morning I wake up to her using an OIL based hair spray to straighten her hair in the spare room on the carpet! I ask her to not do that as the oil will go into the carpet, and she gets stroppy and says I worry too much. \n\nI'm in a rental, that's about to be sold by the landlord and I'm trying to keep it nice for when people come through looking at it.\n\nToday is her day off and because she slept in, she is just going shopping instead of looking for places to live. I feel the more I mention that she needs to keep looking at places the more she gets annoyed with me. I don't know what to do as she clearly doesn't respect my house or myself, and I feel trapped that I can't say anything or I look like I'm an asshole. \n\nShe also is not upset at all about her brake up, she only feels bad for the guy, so I can't put her behavior down to that. My partner and I have already had a fight about her being here as we don't have the space to house another person indefinitely. I need help  as I don't know how to approach this with her with out her getting immediately defensive. AITA?",

One of the many reasons we are divorced. \nNow, my ex and I have split custody over our 5 year old daughter and he has bringing back food, mostly snacks or goodies she has baked back with my daughter. When I asked my daughter about it, she said (EXMIL)  just wanted to make sure she had food that she made that she knew she liked. That is a cut to my ego and is a bit undermining to me as my daughter’s mother. (Side note, this woman has always considered my daughter to be the daughter she never had and told me that she was going to take the baby in the middle of the night so that I could get sleep while she had the baby in her bed.) She had a seriously twisted sense of grandmother boundaries of anyone I knew. So next time my ex husband comes to drop of my daughter, would I be the asshole if i tell him to take the food back because I don’t need it because I know what my daughter likes to eat and I don’t need food from his house?",

      "description": "My (30) BF (33) and I have been together for 5 years but this has only become a problem for the last 2 and I'm pretty fed up with it.\n\nThe only chore my BF will do without being asked (or nagged, in his opinion) is laundry. Not household laundry, just his (not to include sheets, blankets, basically anything that isn't in his laundry basket). If I don't ask him REPEATEDLY to wash dishes, take out the trash, mow the lawn, dust, vacuum, bathe the dog, sweep it usually doesn't get done. I don't think he's cleaned any of the bathrooms in the house in 2 years. His other habit is to wait until he sees me about to do something I've been asking him to do and jumping up to try and do it.\n\n\nNow I don't like to live in filth, and we have a dog so that adds to the chores I have to do. I feel like he knows I won't live in filth and I'm really not able to just stop cleaning to spite him.\n\n\nRecently I asked him to please help me out more cleaning the dishes. He caught an attitude and started washing the dishes. I tried to talk to him about it and he snapped at me about how I create more dishes than him. This is true, because I cook way more often (like almost every day often). But we had a agreed that when one cooks the other cleans. He said he doesn't like to cook in a dirty kitchen. \n\n\nFor the past two weeks after this conversation, every single dish and utensil I've used, I've washed by hand and put away. Now there's a big pile of his dishes in one side of the sink and I refuse to touch them. He says I'm an asshole for not washing them just because I didn't use them. \n\nI'm tired of doing the majority of the housework and being made to feel like a fucking nag when I try to talk to him about it. So, I decided to cut at least one chore in half.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nBTW, the kitchen (aside from his growing pile of dishes) has been SPOTLESS, for the past 2 weeks and he STILL hasn't made a meal (other than sandwiches for himself).",

      "description": "Backstory: She and I met under similar circumstances. Both of us were lonely and we jived really well. We started dating a month after we met. Found out that she had been trying to move on from her ex who ghosted her which hit her really hard. Anytime we became intimate, she would start crying and apologize over and over. Six months later, I asked if we could be friends and she agreed. Went to uni, came back and shes still single and shes better  but still not over her bf but she allows me to hold her hand and kiss her but my feelings grew for her again. I asked her out and she rejected me and I was okay with that but realized I needed space because emotionally, I'm making myself sad being around her. She recently contacted me after almost 5 months of not talking and wound up kissing her twice and realized the romantic feelings are creeping back. I ask her to help but she can't. She doesn't want me to cut her out of my life and tells me she considers me her best friend. I don't reciprocate it. I want her out because I don't know how to deal with having romantic emotions for someone that I should not have feelings for anymore. Am I the asshole for not being able to deal with my emotions?",

      "description": "When I (18F) was 17, I worked as a cashier at a grocery store while I went to college. A bagger who was an older male (in his 60s?) liked to make comments about the young girls who worked there being \"beautiful\", called us all \"sweetheart\" and was constantly hugging us and kissing us on the cheek. On my 18th birthday (I got a new nametag to reflect that I wasn't a minor) he said to me \"What a shame. You're no longer forbidden fruit\". He also made comments about me giving him a massage sometime because I was in school for it.\n\n I've since graduated, gotten with my now boyfriend (27M) and gotten a job as a massage therapist at a rehab facility. I stopped by the grocery store today with my boyfriend today to see about getting my tax documents, and I ran into the old coworker (let's call him John). I was in my new work uniform with the company logo on it. I saw John walking towards me and whispered to my boyfriend that he was a pervert and that he had referred to me as forbidden fruit when I worked there.\n\nJohn comes up and proceeds to hug me and give me a disgusting kiss on the cheek and asks how I am. I step back and make small talk hoping he'd go away, when he mentions that I should give him my card and work on him. I say I don't have any made yet (lie) and when he asked where Iworked, I tell him I work at a different clinic than I do, and that I'll likely be moved a bit north later on (lie).\n\nJohn looks at my boyfriend and asks for clarification, and my boyfriend told tbe directions to the ACTUAL clinic I worked at.\n\nJohn gave me a look (I think he knew I lied) and then soon left. I asked my boyfriend why he'd tell him that, and my boyfriend said that I worked in a safe clinic and that I should make money when I can if I'm safe. I told him that that wasnt the point, and that I shouldn't invite people like him at my work place. We walk through the store for a moment, and then I stop and say that I can't believe he'd tell John where I worked. Boyfriend is aggravated that I won't drop it, and soon goes to wait in the car.\n\n\nWhen I get in the car, my boyfriend says that 1. I shouldn't mumble cues to him if I have something to say, and 2. If I didn't want to talk to John, I should have walked away instead of blaming it on him for telling John my work place location.\n\nI'm upset because I'm nervous John will come by my clinic now and be inclined to make advances at me, and I'm upset that my boyfriend didn't stand up for me or at the very least not call me out on a self defensive lie. However, my boyfriend feels I'm overreacting and that if I was really that worried I shouldn't have allowed John to engage me in the first place.\n\nAITA?",

We can have pets as long as their food/litter is kept inside our rooms, and they don't make a mess of the house. \nEver since I first got my cat (3 months ago) he has used his litter box every time I bring food into my room. He doesn't use it for hours, but as soon as I bring food into my room to eat, he begins digging around in his shit-sand. When he begins doing the deed, he stares me directly in the eyes, because he's a bastard and knows what he's doing. This doesn't mean he exclusively uses it when I'm eating, but he _prefers_ to. His forbidden chocolates have a horrible stench that completely fills the room. Now, I can _usually_ deal with this, but I refuse to smell the depths of hell when I'm chowing down. \nSo, recently I've started either shoving him out of my room when I get food or closing the door on him. Obviously he doesn't like this, and meows or sticks his paws under the door. When I let him in after I'm done eating, he never goes directly to his litter box, because he doesn't _actually_ have to go. Am I the asshole?",

And, since there’s no need for me to be anonymous with where I work, I’m not gonna be, I work at Walmart, unloading trucks and stocking shelves.\n\nNow, I’m not good at my job. At all. I’m slow, get tired easy, and need energy drinks to even make it through the day, and even then I’m never at the level I’m supposed to be. Think, I’m supposed to do 4-5 boxes every five minutes, and at my absolute best I’m doing 3-4. So I put in my two weeks a few days ago, setting my sights on a job more suited for me, so I can keep working there without rueing the day I accepted the position. So at Walmart, our attendance works on a point system; if you’re late by less than an hour, you get half a point, if you don’t show up to work and don’t call in, you lose 3 points, etc. There’s a bonus if your points are low enough.\n\nMy problem is, while I’ll be here still when the bonus rolls out, I won’t get it. Haven’t worked here long enough. So there’s no reason to not use my points while I have them, right? Exactly, there isn’t.\n\nExcept for one thing. I was talking to the grocery assistant manager (I work general merchandise technically but I’m in grocery every day anyways working snacks and cereal) and mentioned how I’ll be calling in two days (on either side of my two days off for a four day weekend to relax). He said “so you’re just gonna call in for no reason? That’ll really put me and my team in a bind.” Idk if he’s being legit or not, and while, yes, one person can make a pretty big difference on our teams, I will not, because I suck at my job, which is the reason I’m quitting in the first place... right?\n\nWhich is why I came here. AITA for wanting to use my points while I have them regardless of if I’m needed or not?\n\nTL;DR: I wanna use what few days off I have while I can, am I the asshole for leaving my team members dry when I don’t make much of an impact on going-ons anyways?",

      "description": "So for some clarity, the name of my roommate and most people in this will be changed for the sake of annonimity in this, since I live with multiple and it will get confusing at some point.\n\nThis event happened a few months ago, but I was invited to an all paid lunch with my roommate, Samantha, her parents, and her boyfriend, Adam. Having never really interrracted with Samantha's parents before I took the lunch as an opportunity to get to know them.  Since the only time I met them was moving in day in which they largely ignored me and my mother.\n\nThe day of the luncheon arrives and we get to a posh, slightly more expensive restraunt that I would never step foot in, but it's a free lunch so I'm not complaining. But I notice that the parents don't attempt to even interact with me as we're waiting for a booth to open up. We get seated after half an hour, in which they still haven't attempted to talk to me. In the 2+ hours we're at the restraunt the parents made no attempt to converse with me (I tried but they brought up really specific topics that I couldn't talk about) the only interaction I got was a 3 second clipped conversation to ask about the menu item I ordered and....that was it. Though I'd notice they made more efforts to include and talk to Adam for the duration of the lunch while I felt like an outsider.\n\nSo a day passes and Samantha brings up the events of the lunch to another of roommates who had been away at home.  Samantha tells this roommate that her parents adored Adam, yet felt that he fit right in with me because \"I didn't make an effort to talk to her parents during lunch.\" I was so pissed off, this roommate knew all about what happened during the lunch because I texted her about it prior to her coming back and even cried about the situation because I came to the uncomfortable realization that maybe I'd been treated differently at the luncheon because I was black and Samantha had laughingly brought up on several occasions that her parents held....bigoted views. Thinking this was the only time Samanthat would bring this event up, I just let it go.  Until yesterday, in which I was invited to go see a movie with Samantha, but declined because she brought up the luncheon situation again as the butt of a joke. It just made me pissed off to the point that I didn't think I could comfortably sit in a shove with her and needed time to myself, but felt guilty since it was supposed to be a bonding experience.\n\nAfter the movie one of my other roommate's informed me that during the event Samantha again brought up the luncheon at least 3 times during the event. Yet again I was pissed off, but quickly felt afterwards that I was being a dick for letting this get to me and allowing it to ruin any bonding experience that I could have with Samantha...yet she always finds an opportunity to bring that luncheon up. AITA for feeling the way I do?",

      "description": "AITA for not giving away my product for free...\n\nSo the backstory is I own a small business with my mom, where we sell accessories at concerts (hats, sunglasses, headbands, jewelry, etc). The only employees are my mom and I and sometimes my sister. So last night on NYE I was at the booth selling when this man came up and was looking at our products, but he didn’t seem like he really wanted anything we had to offer. That’s when his wife came up and wished me a happy new year and looked interested in our product. At this point, the husband walked away from the booth to go sit down.\n\nShe seemed super nice at first, and told me about how her husband was disabled after having a stroke. I listened and tried my best to give her my support, it seemed like she just needed someone who would listen. \nAfter she told me many details about her husband, she then went onto tell me how last time she was at this venue, they gave her husband a bunch of things for free. She then asked what she could get for free from us. I explained to her that everything we had was for sell, however we had some small items that are usually $6, but I could go $5 for her. She insisted that she would get something for free. I told her again that we couldn’t give things away, and I pointed to a booth that was giving away free gifts (NYE party hats, tiaras, and noise makers). She then laughed and said, “wow, maybe you should try being nicer in the new year.” To which I replied, “You think I’m being mean because I can’t give away things?” And she said “you just need to be nicer.” This took me by surprise because I thought I was being very patient with her and listening to her, so the fact that she thought I wasn’t being nice pushed a button in me. So I just responded to her by saying (in kind of a sassy manner), “Oh, I’m sorry you don’t think I’m nice. I will try being nicer for my resolution.” She scoffed at me and then walked away.\n\nI felt bad for not giving her something free, but the venue checks our inventory and since it’s our personal business it would come directly out of pocket. It also seemed like she wanted something for free for herself because her husband wasn’t even around and didn’t seem interested in our accessories. It’s not like my mom and I are making millions off this company, we are struggling to pay rent and our bills, so we really can’t afford giving our product away to everyone who asks. So... AITA?",

      "description": "Full disclosure, this wasn't me this was a friend of mine, but I feel it would be a good addition to this sub. But for the sake of the sub I will write it as if it was me.\n\nSo I work for a tech company in Utah, and despite Utah being a red state the tech industry is still very liberal. So during lunch there are a group of people that I would have called friends would get into these political discussions. I tend avoid those because they all seem to agree with each others and I personally don't think fighting over politics at work to be a good idea. But recently (more accurately around the time of the Stoneman Douglas shooting) on 2 different occasions these guys have asked me a direct question. And since they were directly asked to me I couldn't just stay out of it. One was about abortion which I told them that I was actually pro-life. And the other was about guns where I told them I was pro-gun rights and not in favor of their suggestions.\n\nIn both cases I tried to stay calm and relaxed to avoid an actual argument and keep it a friendly debate but in both cases they got very testy with me and in the case of the abortion debate I admittedly got testy back because it is something I am passionate about.\n\nAfter this, one of them sent an email to our boss trying to get me fired because I was creating a \"toxic work environment\".\n\nOur boss took my side and said that they don't fire people based on political opinions.\n\nSo after this ordeal I went out and bought a MAGA hat (while I am conservative and agree with some of what he does, I am not someone that you would call a \"Trump supporter\"). And for one day I went to work wearing it. I didn't confront my coworkers, I didn't flaunt it in front of them, I simply wore it and went to work as professionally as I could possibly be. I did this as a silent protest against the people who tried to get me fired simply because I don't agree with them politically.",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years, we don't live together. I am a nurse and he has a hospital phobia (romcom writers everywhere are salivating). He's had some terrible experiences having to do with hospitals that have jaded his views, and while they've mellowed out some since we've been together, he still gets panic attacks and gets very anxious about relatively small things (routine bloods, etc). I don't often talk to him about work as a result.\n\nAnyway. This week during a routine check-up, I found out that I have a potentially dangerous condition. Caught it early (I don't even have any symptoms) but it could have resulted in a stroke. I've been in hospital over the past 2 days getting bloods, scans and lumbar punctures. I've told him the basics, that my doctor was a little concerned so I need some tests done, but I haven't gone into detail. I've got to be on regular meds and will have neurology check ups for the next few years but because I caught it so early, I'll be fine. I'm sore from all the tests and feeling sorry for myself but I'm well.\n\nAnd now Reddit knows more than my boyfriend does. I kept it from him for the most part thinking that I'm doing us both a favour, but now I'm wondering if I should have told him? Am I an asshole for keeping this secret? ",

      "description": "Maybe this is more appropriate for /r/relationships or /r/sex but whatever.\n\nSo i've been with my girlfriend for just over a year now, it's been by far the best relationship of my life in terms of being in love, stress free, sharing interests, sex life etc it's been a total unicorn relationship.\n\nAnyway, I have only had two partners before her, both LTR. I'm personally against casual sex and drug use although i'm fine for other people to do it, it's just not the lifestyle i've ever wanted. She's said she agreed with me and that she had four partners before me and never used drugs. I'm sure you can see where this is going.\n\nI found out that her and her previous boyfriend were poly and into a lot of crazy stuff, threesomes with both genders, using drugs, and obviously her partner count of both men and women was a lot higher than she said. Again, I have no problem with this lifestyle it's just not something I would want for myself or for the woman I marry.\n\nI confronted her about this and eventually got the truth confirmed after a lot of evasiveness. She says all that poly/drug stuff before was what made her realize that she wanted the conventional monogamous marriage with loads of kids etc and a clean life just like me and only lied to me because she knew a man looking for that wouldn't want to marry a woman with her past. \n\nThat makes sense because i'm seriously thinking about breaking up with her over this, firstly because she lied to me for so long about stuff she knew was important to me, second because of insecurity. Like she's the best sex of my life but what if I rank only 20th or something for her? Could someone who lived that life be happy with the \"square\" life with me? And since she's apparently bisexual could she ever be happy without women? What if she's only using me as the \"safe\" man she settles down with and cheats on me? If I marry her will I end up regretting that I missed a huge red flag?\n\nThose are questions for me to decide on, my question to all you is: WIBTA to throw away the best relationship of my life over this? Or is it fair for this to be a dealbreaker and i'm about to dodge a bullet?",

He messaged me today asking if we were still willing to. I told him yes but the only stipulation is that he can't bring anything for marijuana.\n\nWe both smoke weed often (me more casual than him) but my parents are very against it (also in legal state) and don't want to increase my risk getting caught by him carelessly smoking or leaving stuff out like he does at his house.\n\nThe real problem part is that I'm on new medication and want to make sure I know the effects and any possible problems they might have, so I'm taking a 2 week break from weed so I won't be smoking at all. No big deal for me but he regularly smokes 5Gs a day so I'm guessing this is going to be a problem for him.\n\nAfter I told him about the stipulation I never got a response and I know he saw it and just didn't respond.

      "description": "Sorry, this is a long one but some back context is necessary. I've been with my girlfriend coming up on 2 years - she's my first serious relationship (I'm 29, she's 30). However, in college I met a girl who became a sort of an on again/off again FWB. She was originally from the city I was in,  but went to a different school across the country.\n\nThis girl and I met and had a main \"fling\" over one summer. We had fun, but realized pretty early on we weren't compatible for anything more serious. After that we maintained a sort of FWB situation. We remained friends, but hooked up very occasionally when she was in town (spread out by many months). Over the course of several years during/after school we hooked up a handful of times...but formed a pretty solid friendship, solidified by a similar taste in music, concerts, and music festivals. We had cycles of falling out of touch completely for months, and then catching up again. Eventually we grew distant enough that we decided we would stop hooking up completely and just stay platonic friends.\n\nBy the time I met my girlfriend, we were still in touch, but way more distant. She still lived across the country and we hadn't done anything sexual in years. Maybe once every month or so we'd have a very brief friendly catch-up convo via snapchat. Usually this started by one of us commenting on the other's post about our shared musical interests. Followed by \"hey, hows life?...hows grad school?...what shows have you seen lately?\" etc. All very platonic, never anything flirty.\n\nI voluntarily told my girlfriend about my past history with this friend very early on. I didn't HAVE to tell her, but she inquired, and I didnt' hesitate to be fully honest as I didn't feel I had anything to hide. I was also fully honest that I still had very brief convos with her every month or two - making it very clear that we were just friends now with no romantic feelings.\n\nHowever, my girlfriend made it pretty clear she wasn't comfortable with this at all. She didn't get the \"FWB\" thing, and didn't understand how we could have a sexual history if it wasn't romantic. She told me she thought talking even once every month or two was too much, and I should just cut her out of my life completely. \n\nWhile I empathized with my girlfriend, at first I dug my heels in because I didn't like the idea of my her dictating my friendships. But as time went on, I pretty much stopped initiating messages with my friend. She'd still reach out to me every several months...still very short platonic convos about music, her grad school progress, or happily inquiring about my relationship...to which I'd respond briefly.\n\nOver the course of our relationship, any time this friend's name somehow came up, up or my girlfriend brought it up, my gf would get really upset. Despite me telling her we barely spoke anymore, shed grill me with a lot of questions, trying to draw out new information about my past with her. She'd reiterate how much she hates that this girl exists. It often sparked big arguments. She couldn't really cope with hearing anything about my sexual past...and didn't get the idea that we could be just friends even though we had hooked up. \n\nI mostly stopped trying to convince her of my point. But theres been a couple big arguments sparked over this relatively recently:\n\n**Argument 1)**  Several months ago my friend messaged me out of the blue asking if I'd be going to an event she thought I might be (a multi day camping festival). I tell her I actually was going with my girlfriend. She said she was going too, and was really excited to see me and also to finally get to meet my girlfriend. Not wanting to make my girlfriend look crazy jealous by telling my friend flat out she wouldn't want to meet her... I just subtly informed her that my girlfriend knew about our history. She got the hint. My girlfriend arrived to the event a day after me. That first day, I ran into my friend at the stage, and we had a quick 10 minute chat before parting ways. When my girlfriend arrived the next day, I told her that my friend was there and we'd run into each other. My girlfriend completely freaked out about the fact I'd seen her, grilling me with questions, and saying there was no way in hell she wanted to meet this girl. She spent the rest of the time paranoid we'd run into her.\n\n**Argument 2)** Back in the summer we we're visiting my dad's house and I picked up some mail that had been sent there. Along with the mail is a Happy Birthday card from my friend. It basically said \"Sorry I forgot to say Happy Birthday this year. Glad we've managed to stay friends this long. I really hope you and your girlfriend are doing well...hope I can meet her some day.\" Signed with a heart and smiley face. I thought it was a nice gesture...as we had usually exchanged happy birthdays. I saw it as her trying to keep the fading friendship going. But since my girlfriend freaked out and we had an argument every time this girl's name was even mentioned, I decided it was best for everyone's sake not to tell her about the card.\n\nWell, a couple months later my girlfriend found the birthday card. I thought I'd thrown it out with a stack of papers in my bag, but I guess I missed it. She had a full blown meltdown. Threatening to end things...why did I have it? Why did she send it? Why was I saving it?. We had a big argument about it. Me insisting the card was totally platonic. \n\nThats just 2 recent ones. There were others along this line in the past...which is why I kept any mention of this friend to a bare minimum and more or less cut contact. During these arguments I'd assert she was never an actual ex, it was possible to have sex just for fun, and to remain friends with someone despite hooking up. I'd remind her I barely spoke to this girl anymore, and was honest about her existence from the beginning. My girlfriend didn't care...and basically said she'll never change her mind on being uncomfortable with it.\n\n**TL;DR** My girlfriend isn't cool with the fact that I stayed sort of friends with a former FWB. She asked me to cut off contact with her, and gets really upset any time her name comes up. She doesn't see it as possible for 2 people who once hooked up to just be friends. Keep in mind, me and this girl cared about each other as friends, but never professed love for each other or anything like that.\n________________________________________________________________________________\nHere's the hypocrisy I see. \n\nMy girlfriend is from a different country. Pretty early on in our relationship, she told me that maybe a year or 2 before we met, one of her best guy friends at home very dramatically surprised her by professing his love to her. She's known him since 16 years old. He pulled her aside, and basically told her that he loved her, and would be willing to leave his current girlfriend for her if she wanted him back. She didn't reciprocate feelings and apparently distanced herself from the friendship with him after that...but then they later rekindled it to some degree. He's now marrying the girlfriend he said he'd leave for my girlfriend (who never knew about his secret love).\n\nMy girlfriend assures me he must be over his feelings for her, because he's happily marrying his fiance. Last time my gf was home, she even hung out with this friend and his fiance. She says she thinks its weird that the fiance doesn't know, but otherwise doesn't see anything wrong with their friendship. They even invited us to her wedding. I questioned if it was a good idea...but agreed to go if she wanted despite it feeling a little awkward. \n\nTo be clear. I don't actually care about her friendship with this guy. I've never dug into my girlfriend's sexual or romantic past. I've never shamed or for anything, and trust her fully. I get we're both adults and had many other people in our lives.  This dude is not a threat to our relationship....and I would never force her to end a friendship. But she seems to have a dual standard here she refuses to admit to.\n\nDuring our recent arguments about my FWB, and during the discussion about the wedding...I have brought up the hypocrisy in the fact she thinks its fine for her to stay friends with and attend the wedding of guy who fairly recently professed his love to her, but shes not okay with me talking to my former FWB every few months, or receiving a birthday card from her. I've also reminded her I've never told her she couldn't be friends with him, despite the fact that many boyfriends wouldn't be cool with it.\n\nI asked her how she'd feel if I forbid her from attending the wedding, or if I told her she couldn't stay friends with him anymore. She told me I had no right to tell her that, and she'd break up with me if I forced her to choose. She asserts the situations are in no way related. Because she only talks to him once every 6 months or so, they never actually hooked up, and he's getting married...its apparently not even relevant at all. She reminds me that his feelings for her must have gone away. But since me and this girl had hooked up in the past, and talk every 3 months, she claims its not possible for us to not have lingering feelings .  I try to point out how hypocritical this is, but she digs her heels in\n\nI know for a fact that if I told her one of my girl friends once professed their love to me, she would absolutely not be cool with us remaining friends. In fact she'd probably break up with me if I tried.\n\nShe still asserts I'm the bad guy here for even entertaining the idea of keeping my friendship. \n\n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "So I (M23) have been dating this guy (M27) for about 6 months, I'm really committed to him as this is the first serious relationship I have ever been in. Around 3 days ago, I and a few of my classmates decided to go grab lunch at a shopping complex a few minutes away from school. This complex is very close to where my boyfriend goes to school, so naturally I texted him and told him that we would be having lunch near his school and he's welcome to join us. He responded in the affirmative, this was at around 1:15 pm. We get lunch and start eating and at around 1:40, I realise that it's getting late, so I text him telling him that I have to be back in class at around 2:00 pm. He responds, \"OK\". We continue eating and at around 2:00 pm I call him and tell him that are leaving, he responds with a casual \"OK\". So I go on my merry-way back to class. That evening as I'm texting him I notice that he's being very blunt and snippy. This continues up to the next morning. The next day we meet a friend, and he's (the bf) is acting normal, but I can tell something's still wrong, although I have no clue what it is. Anyway at some point in the night I force it out of him and he tells me that he had come all the way to the cafe only to get a call when he arrived that we had left. He says that he is extremely pissed off. I admit that I know this is a touchy area for him as he really doesn't like his \"time being wasted\" but still, AITA here?\nBut wait, there's more. As the night goes on he keeps taking silent but hurtful jabs at me in conversation. However I tolerate this, as I know that when he's mad his mouth grows a mind of its own and he \"can't remember\" all that he said after he's cooled down. I was willing to let this all slide until he asked me to drive him to get his new bike from the mechanic. I was a bit apprehensive to do so as I was driving my dad's car and wanted to conserve fuel, but I agreed to it because I love him. As we leave I ask for the directions. Getting to the mechanics’ is fairly simple however I am not great at directions. That said, and him being aware of this, everytime I ask him for directions I get a bunch of snide comments questioning my intelligence and it gets pretty hurtful. This day was no different unfortunately and I was seething by the time we finally arrived. He then asks me to drive behind him all the way back to his house as he's not confident on the road, I tell him that this was not part of the plan but he insists. I angrily go along with it knowing that I've more than doubled my journey home because he looks extremely unstable on the bike. When I get home he calls to tell me that I have a lot of his stuff in my car, like his phone charger and laptop which he needs for school. He asks how he's going to get them back and I tell him that he'll get them when he gets them (I'll send them tomorrow). He then asks me why I'm pissed off and I tell him it's nothing and hang up the phone. So yet again I ask you, AITA?",

      "description": "Throw away account, sorry I’m on mobile.\n\nSo this happened sometime ago, during Christmas. My husband and I are not well off. We both came together at a point in our lives So this happened sometime ago, during Christmas. My husband and I are not well off. We both came together at a point in our lives where we had nothing or very little, but we were full of love and acceptance. We have gotten help from friends and family for things like an old couch that no one wants and is quite frankly uncomfortable. We accepted a used mattress because it was literally all we could get. I’m not kidding you, people came together to help us with so much, but a lot of stuff was just old, broken unwanted things that we could make do with. Silverware,  nightstands, cups, clothes, you name it! We graciously accepted whatever we could in those first few months so that we didn’t have to sit, sleep, and eat off the floor.\n\nFast forward a few years and yeah, we’re still poor but hey! We make do, save money to buy what we can (we got a new mattress!!) and live with what we have (still have the awful couch). We know what we NEED and we know what we want, and we make it very clear that we don’t want frivolous expenditures as gifts when that money could be better spent. Obviously we are always grateful for gifts, like my husband was given a google pixel xl from his brother (who at the time was extremely well to do) some 2 years ago after his current phone died that he still uses. My MIL upgraded her phone and let me have her old one, just in time since my previous phone screen SHATTERED. What I’m trying to say is I never ask for anything that would not help our situation and don’t go asking for support unless we are in dire straits. Much of the time, people ask us if we could use an item that they no longer want which can be extremely helpful. We make miracles happen and pull through. \n\nSO! Christmas! We get little for each other since we’re often strapped for cash, and do what we can for family and friends. Sometimes it’s just a card with a lotto ticket. Sometimes we make food and gift that. Once my husband made personal drawn cards for our friends and they loved it. We always let people know that we don’t expect gifts, especially because we can’t afford to give back every time. One year his brother goes on a last minute spending spree and gets everyone something pricey. It was wonderful seeing their mother enjoy her beautiful present, and although the nieces and nephews weren’t there that year I’m sure they loved theirs as well. BIL then brings ours, which looks like a tv. Now, we already have a tv. It’s by no means huge, I think it’s maybe 38, 42 inches and it’s either plasma or lcd (whatever, it’s thin ok?). But this tv works great, just peachy keen. We got this one technically from BIL because he had given it to their father, who then passed away. So he let us have it since he had a 50 inch smart tv and had no use. \nCue me looking at this new smart tv, same size, same thickness, same everything except it’s smart I guess. This tv was expensive, needlessly so, and he grabbed it as a last thought not as a planned gift. I awkwardly laugh and say “But we already have a tv?” and of course “Thank you!”, and “It’s really cool, I’m just not sure what to do with it” which is true, what do you need two TVs for? Yes, I know that some people have one in their bedroom but that’s not gonna happen since A: no plug outlet for it in there B: I don’t watch tv in bed and I don’t wanna start C: we don’t even have cable, we just watch a few movies here and there using the computer we hook up. There are some awkward laughs and some awkward thank you’s. Leaving the house and coming home I start in about how husband’s brother is bad with money so often. How he could have used that money for anything else, not even just for us but for himself. I get beggy-choosey (I know that’s what it is, no delusions there) about how if he really wanted to spend that much on a gift for us BIL could have asked what we needed. I’d say a couch, or husbands glasses, or if he’d offered, a bed frame since we actually still don’t have a real one. These hypothetical gift ideas don’t matter to me, I’m just upset at this much money being thrown at nothing.\nHusband say something to MIL, like how we don’t know what to do but sell the old tv so we don’t have an extra for no reason. MIL decides to talk to BIL (without us knowing, this was NOT our idea) into returning the tv and just giving us the money. He is vehemently against this, which although I never wanted him to do this it rubs me the wrong way. We tell MIL don’t worry about it, we’re sorry we said anything, tell BIL the same. Months go by and before I get to selling it a friend says they need one (that’s a whole other story) so I let them have it for free in a pay it forward manner. We use the smart tv, which has admittedly a better picture but is abysmally slow to turn on, and for some reason won’t connect to anything anyway. Whatever, it’s still a tv.\n\nWhat I want to know is, was I the asshole for being practical and realistic during Christmas? Everyone knows our situation and knows I don’t want to be read as entitled just because of unnecessary spending. ",

      "description": "So I roleplay on roblox a lot -- yeah yeah, get your cringes out now -- and I was on a Steven Universe Homeworld roleplay game. It's a relatively serious game, so it's not a fun lighthearted roleplay. People play as noncanon gems in this game, which adds to its seriousness in a strange way.\n\nAnyways, I was roleplaying. I was a Sapphire who was watching a trial. Sapphires in Steven Universe are aristocratic, high ranking gems. There's a row of seats in the courtroom, and the front row is for high ranking gems, so I was sitting there. A Violane, one of the dancers from the ball episode [the creator decided to make her Not A Jade], decided to just sit on my character, completely obscuring her from view. I got a guard to escort her and she reset. Keep in mind that, in retrospect, this was all out character because she wasn't responding, and she wasn't AFK because it took a minute or so between her sitting and her resetting, but this next part isn't out of character.\n\nShe reset, as stated, and came back to be another Sapphire. She shoved me off of the seat. This wouldn't have gotten me so heated because it's RP and characters are allowed to have different personalities, but she did this with Violane. I understandably [in my head, at least] got pissed off and started telling her that she did this as Violane as well so it couldn't have been just rp, despite her insisting it was. Eventually she just sat somewhere else and I calmed down. I ended up leaving because I was s00per tired.\n\nSo, lads, am I the asshole for doing this? I can try to provide more details if needed, but I think I was pretty thorough.",

      "description": "Okay, story starts a year ago. Both friend in question - Ann and I move into our college dorms. We meet on the first day since we were on the same floor and hit it off really well. Initially, we'd share stories about highschool and talk about light-hearted stuff so everything was cool. She told me that she was lonely in her senior year since two of her friends became closer and kinda left her out of stuff and so she was determined to socialize in college. I told her I was deciding to start afresh and thus don't talk to my friends from school anymore (nothing bad happened). First few weeks everything's great.\n\nHowever, a few weeks later I noticed that she was extremely judgemental and snobby. She would constantly speak about other people's physical appearance, clothes, style, accents, religion, etc. And it would really bother me because I'm pretty open-minded and liberal when it comes to people's choices. However, I let it slide. I didn't really say anything to her because I'm don't have a confrontational nature and didn't want to start an argument. \n\nAround a month later, a girl from the same city as her (they don't know each other) gets admitted to our college, I decided to introduce myself to her. We both went to her room and talked for a while. When we left, Ann starts rambling about her; nitpicking every detail and I'm just done with her at this point so I leave. A week later, I'm helping out this new girl with some coursework she missed out on when Ann takes me over to a side and tells me, \"why do you have to help her? You're not her mother!\" So now I'm pissed because you do not tell me what to do, I like to help people out and that should not be the problem. I storm off and we don't talk for a week. She comes me to one day and apologizes and says that the reason for her outburst was that she's scared that I'd leave her for the new girl (which tbh I was never planning to do). I tell her that was not my intention and we patch things up.   \nA month later we get into another altercation - we had a presentation (group work), I was sleeping all day and she apparently knocked on my door which I didn't hear obviously - so she didn't talk to the other members about it. When I discover none of them worked on the presentation, I had to stay up all night to create it and work on everyone's parts. After this argument, we didn't talk for a while and that's when our relationship started to strain. We started to see each other less often. So at this point I thought perhaps she's done with me or maybe she's found someone else to befriend so I don't bother talking to her. Meanwhile, the new girl and I become close (completely coincidentally) - we have similar personality types and she doesn't backstab people :) - so i'm thinking everything's chill. \n\nBut it was too good to be true, a few months later I discover that Ann's been backstabbing me to her other friends and calling me a snake and all sorts of names, and went as far as to getting her parents to call my parents and tell them that your daughter isn't quite alright and she needs to visit a psychologist and that she cut off contact with her school friends because she's messed up in the head. I was **gobsmacked**, we were both 18 and it was beyond my comprehension how she could just go out there and ask her parents to talk to mine. This is none of their business. So after this, I just decide to cut her off completely - only to find out she's blocked me on Instagram. I delete her off of my Facebook and Snapchat and just don't talk to or about her anymore. \n\nSorry this is so long but I want to know if what I did was wrong, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I know I probably the asshole here but I need to hear it from others If i am (i can be biased). My grandfather died a week ago while my mom was traveling for work. My mom immediately made a trip back to a Thailand to mourn and take care of my grandmother, who has severe memory issues. Although I didn’t do anything “bad” while the cameras were covered, I feel as though I was selfish to do so. Due to her traveling, I finally felt like I had personal space. She usually searches my trash (doesn’t find anything, i dont do drugs), searches my room, reads all my texts, and tries to listen in on my phone calls. She tracks my phone, needs to know where i am 24/7, and has cameras in the house to know when i get home, what i do in the house while she is gone, and when i sleep or eat. Hell, when I held hands and cuddled with a guy i was interested in, she called me a slut, whore, etc.  I felt strangely...free While she’s gone? I felt much happier overall, other than the fact that I was worried sick for my grandmother. My actions, I feel, prove the opposite (I let myself have personal freedom for 2\\~ weeks and in turn, made my mother angry). Am I an asshole for not feeling bad about making her angry while she grieves over her father? She did not want to visit her mother again this year due to fear of her mother invading her privacy, and so. I feel no sympathy due to her lack of empathy. Maybe I’m the one lacking empathy here.

      "description": " \n\nEnglish is my third language, so apologies for any forthcoming mistakes, and feel free to correct me.\n\nSo a little back story, this summer my gramps had a knot in his digestive system and he had to be in the ICU (and still is) but his situation is going better, they're both old (over 75) and because of their health it isn't looking like they will return to Denmark. Along with that, two months ago or something, their house was overflown with water because of a waterpipe exploding in their apartment. (Edit: My grandparents are sadly both in Turkey, while i am in Denmark.)\n\nYesterday, i returned from a trip to Hamburg, and i had been sitting in a car for 6h, and at home my girlfriend was waiting me. Every time we go into my room, my mother gets pissy for not spending time with my family and she calls us *\"Rabbits\"* (Implying that we snuggle and have sex all the time) and i've voiced my disliking to that word, and she just said she thinks it's funny and found a way to justify her using the term.\n\nI get embarrassed and uncomfortable when sitting in my room with my girlfriend when she acts like this, therefore i said that we were going for a walk, and we *did,* but we also went to my grandmothers' house to sit and chill in peace.\n\nSo we stay there for some time, kissing and snuggling, just like *rabbits.* she writes to me about 10 minutes after and says \"*If you're planning on going to my mothers' house, you better forget it now, AND I MEAN NOW\"*\n\nMy phone was on silent, so i see the message an hour later, when i saw the message, i wrote \"*Sorry mum, my phone was on silent, we're coming home.*\"\n\nWhen we come home, i see anger on her face, fair nuff, i send my girlfriend home, sit in the living room and ask her;\n\n\"*Anything you wanna get off your chest?\"*\n\nAnd she goes on a rant where summed up she says;\n\n\"*You will never enter my mothers' house again, you hear me? I am* ***THIS*** *(puts two fingers close to each other) close to losing ALL of my respect to you, you hear me? This can go all the way where i* ***DISOWN*** *you.\"*\n\nShe said more hurtful, but less important things. Little note, she doesn't even know what went on at grannies. My girlfriend and i aren't the type to mess a whole place up and make it dirty and all, everything was tidy and clean as it were.\n\nSomething else that might be of importance is to state, that *I* have always been a loving and caring son, my mother has several forms of chronic diseases which render her unable to do physical work (be it Arthritis in her joints or Osteoporosis in her back, she has it all.) I have always helped her with everything without sighing once, and just a week prior she was always boasting about how lovely a son i am, she would kiss and hug me saying that i am the pride of her live and that she loves me to hell and back. I have never done something in the past that has released such a magnitude of anger in my mother.\n\nNow you be the verdict.\n\n# Am i the Asshole for spending time with my girlfriend at my grandmothers', and also for being hurt at what my mother said?\n\nThis has been eating me up since yesterday, and i'd love some advice.\n\n(I deleted the earlier post because i couldn't change the title, thought i was unfitting)",

      "description": "\nThrowaway account, fake names, kind of a long post. If you’re someone I know irl please have integrity and don’t read, thanks\n\nSo my (f18) sister (f15) has been out as a lesbian to me and most of her friends/teachers/peers etc. for a little over a year now, but she’s always been afraid to say anything to our mom (f58) because once my mother, while half asleep, turned off Grey’s Anatomy saying that she didn’t want to watch “gross lesbians.” However, we both figured that my mom was just like any other 50+ catholic raised progressive: full of internal prejudice but slowly unlearning old habits and trying to do the right thing. Other than the one Grey’s incident she had always taught us to love and respect everyone no matter what. \n\nSo a few weeks ago my sister texted me while I was at school, saying she was at home with my parents coming out, and that my mom was bawling, saying that “every aspect of hope and joy in her life is now forever tinged with sadness,” asking what she did wrong, why she was being punished, begging to know which of her friends were also gay so she could ban them from the house, that it’s gross, that she was so embarrassed, that she doesn’t support gay rights, doesn’t think they should get married and never has, telling her she has to get over this phase, and forbidding my sister to have sleepovers ever again (I, a straight girl, am allowed to sleepovers with boys as long as it’s a group and i’m not dating them). This lasted several hours. I was shocked and appalled. \n\nMy mother didn’t speak to either one of us for two days, and when she did talk to me she sat me down while my sister was out of the house. We had a long talk (a real talk, no screaming, only mildly raised voices) where both of my parents basically told me that my sister was too young too even know what attraction was, so how could she possibly know she was gay? That they would feel this way if she was dating a boy at this age (I dated a boy sophomore year and they were fine, they also asked me numerous times before this to set her up with my male friends). She said I was too young and too naive, too stuck in my “cliche of teenagers” to understand an adult’s point of view, and too young understand that parents, teachers, employers, and landlords were now looking at her negatively and she (and subsequently, my parents) would struggle for the rest of her life. She said she was so disappointed in my generation, and how we pretended to be gay to be cool without realizing lasting consequences. She said she “supported some gays, but not all of them” so asked her where she drew the line. She said “You can’t trick me, [myname]! I have a brain, ok!” \n\nI then brought up the things that my sister had told me my mom said when my sister first came out and my mom denied it all, saying that my sister probably felt that way since they were so upset. My mother has a habit of gaslighting that I will get to later. Mom then said that under no circumstances was I allowed to tell my sister that we talked, and asked me to try and be the adult in this situation and understand what it was like for her. I’ve tried but I am really struggling. \n\nIt’s been several weeks and I found out from my sisters friends that my mom additionally called the parents of my sisters friend, bawling and asking them what she did wrong, if they knew, and asking what they thought about it. All of them knew and none of them cared but were forced into very long phone conversation while my mom searched for validation.\n\nMy mom and I have always fought a lot, and she never seems to remember the incident. I’ve been called lazy, stupid, arrogant, selfish, bratty, irresponsible, unhealthy, etc. She’s dumped all my clothes on the floor and made me clean it up because I wasn’t wearing the shorts she wanted. She threw a hairbrush at a locked door I was crying behind. She told me I would die of a heart attack in my twenties because I wasn’t taking good enough care of myself.  I wasn’t allowed to cry if I didn’t make a musical since I wasn’t trying hard enough anyways. I am a compulsive liar if I bring this up to her or anyone, so I am not allowed to. She and I don’t have a good relationship, whether it’s teenage angst or not. I know this, so I am trying to be unbiased when it comes to this situation with my sister. Am I the asshole for not giving her more time to process?",

I don’t even go to this church or know these people so I think it’s kind of weird, and she told me to have my (male) fiancé come so part of me says it’s to show off her son (who doesn’t go to that church either, just the mom does).\n\nAnyway fast forward to a few days ago, the mom calls and asks us to please remove the beer mugs from our registry because that church of Christ “doesn’t drink”?

After I ended it we were still on good terms I thought with all things considered and I thought we were friends and all was good.\n\nA Couple days later she wanted to hang out and talk which is a mistake on my part for even agreeing to it so soon in hindsight. I go over we talk and chat and everything seemed fine just normal how you’ve been, whatcha up to that sort of stuff and then she springs up if we can talk about us where I said there’s nothing to talk about and proceeded to leave as she started to yell and get angry at me for not being “a real man”. \n\nAfter that I blocked her and her sorority sisters from everything and deleted my socials as they kept harassing me and to keep it short calling me colorful names for breaking her heart. Last I’ve heard was when they harassed my sister that she’s been drinking heavily and is starting to fall behind in school because of what I did to her. AITA?",

      "description": "Alright so this might be a bit confusing to read but that's because I'm confused as to what happened to me, this all took place over the course of two weeks but mostly in the last two days. It all started with a girl, let us call her Dee, Now Dee has had a pretty shitty life, without giving away too much personal information it is safe to say that she has been abused by her parents, her uncle died while taking good care of her, her mother is schizophrenic and chances are Dee will be in the future. right now her only living relative is her mother who she is forced to live with because she can't leave, because her mother forces her to pay for all the food and other things so she can't save to get an apartment. and recently she learned that she and her mother may be getting kicked out of the house. there are other aspects but again I am trying to respect her privacy. Just keep in mind she is pretty stressed. now I joined her server a few months ago and made some close friends on it all was well until at some point she started saying that I've been an asshole recently. Now on the server, we all give each other shit but we all knew it was in jest, like \"what's up cunts\" that sorta vibe. anyway whenever she said this and I ask her \"how have i been an asshole?\" she could never give me an answer, it was always \"I can't think of something off the top of my head\" and while at first, I took this in stride because I just thought she was joking, after a while it really started getting to me she I brought it up but again she just called me an asshole. so I started distancing myself from her, not consciously just I didn't go and talk to her as much as I did other people. And also we still talked and had fun together but mostly in groups so it's not like our relationship was purely her called me an asshole, we were still friends. Now as we become more and more distant she used that as evidence to justify her called me an asshole. At this point, I was pretty fed up with her and along with her other annoying behaviors such as needing constant attention and not respecting others wishing by whining, whenever someone didn't want to do something. This all leads up to me leaving the server during an argument in which she exploded on this guy who yea was rude but she was keeping the argument going, now I tried to break it up with a little humor by going \"guys guys we are ALLL assholes, ok?\" after which she and her boyfriend turned on me and again she started calling me an asshole and which point I said \"fine if I'm such an asshole ill just leave\" so I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow during my time on her server I joined another server where she was an admin, I stayed on this server because most of the friends I had made on the previous one were also here, and things were fine, I didn't talk to her she didn't talk to me. but eventually, she started getting more and more controlling in the server. For instance, she said that we couldn't post \"memes\" in the general chat and that we had to post them in meme chat, this was confusing to me and a few others because it was fine before and it wasn't in the rules. at which point she simply told us to read the roles and that it was the end of the discussion. Now in the rules, it does say that you \"should adhere to the commands of the staff\" but I wasn't alone in thinking that that rule wasn't really as \"valid\" as the others in that it is really just a catch-all rule and makes is so whichever admin or mod that was on at the time could say whatever they want and use punishments for whatever they wanted. we tried bringing this up to her but again she just links the rules and said it was the end of discussion. one thing to note is that there is a feedback and suggestions channel but not once did she say we could, ya know, talk about the rules in there, she always just told us to read the rules and if we didn't stop talking about this we would get in trouble.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis all climaxed with me and a few others arguing with her in chat about recent events in the server that abruptly ended with her muting all of us and her other \"mod-lings\" comforting here, saying that she was nice to even let this go on for as long as it had. While we couldn't type in chat we did figure out we could change our nick-names, so we starting having fun with that with things like \"My cellmate \"likes\" me alot\" at this point she made another channel where we could \"talk\" \n\nwhich really meant me spending around an hour and a half trying to reason with her while also trying to get her \"mod-lings\" to stop injecting themselves into the conversation just to either stroke her ego or insult us and tell us to shut up. At the end of all of this we me being physically and emotionally drained she says that she been humoring me long enough and that nothing worthwhile has been said  and that \"she didn't want to lose me\" at this point I'm just tired so I want to talk about this another day but she says that she can't leave me on mute but she also couldn't unmute me yet because I might start another \\*riot\\* in discord general chat, which she says is bad because it might scare the other users and that she needs my compliance. She ends all of this by saying that she has let this go on long enough and that she is tired so I say \"just go to sleep then\" and leave at which point she bans me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso if you made it, congrats and now I want to know? Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So some context, I'm 16M Asian, Hmong to be specific, but anyways my dad has a history of cheating on my mom, (he has done it twice) and he tends to be verbally abusive when drunk. (also kinda alcoholic) The reason why he's currently in jail is because he was caught transporting weed a while back.\n\nWhen my dad first cheated he did it while drunk, even though at the time I was around 6 years old I understood that he was in the wrong. Then the second time I was about 11 years old I went on a fishing/camping trip with my dad, and a few of his friends, and on a late night I woke up to my dad drinking with his buddies bragging how he had a Thai girl, (IDK why but OG Hmong peeps like young Thai chicks) and he ended calling her, that's where my hate for him began to build up. (BTW I didn't tell my mom yet because at the time I felt that this would break my home.)\n\nFast forward to the next summer threw a party with his friends, and decided to invite the chick over when my mom wasn't home (college class), and he was showing her around the house, and this made me livid, but I didn't do anything because I was too scared of my dad when he's drunk. (btw he never hit me, but he was loud and threatening) \n\nThen that Fall he was arrested for possession of more weed. (he was the supply) But a few days pass he got out, and my parents went out for their anniversary. \nThen shit hit the fan, the Thai chick approached my mom and dad on their date they got into a drunken argument that night. Then a 3 month period where they would be drunk when I got home from school, and just argue nearly every day ensued. This time period fucked me up pretty bad.\n\nFast forward to the past year my dad would get super wasted almost every weekend and even the weekdays when he knew he had a job to go to. He's also thinks he's the shit that all the other people respect him for being able to drink the most.\n\nThen fairly recently, about 2 months ago. I got into a big argument with my dad because he would constantly guilt trip me about how much he loved me, and that I need to do more chores of which I already do. Then recently he was arrested because there was a warrant.\n\nTl;DR don't feel bad for my dad in to jail because he's a cheat, and verbally abusive\n\n Sorry if the this post is shite, it's the first thing I have ever posted on Reddit besides a shitty meme",

      "description": "I went out to drink with 3 people tonight. My friend Steph, Steph's best friend Vic, and her other friend, Jane. Steph and Vic were visiting for a concert happening in my city and Jane is a local friend she met a few years ago. \n\nSteph asked me to come out with her since it'd been a few months since she was in town. I say sure since Steph and I always have a good time when we hang out. \n\nThis time was different. Apparently Vic and Jane got into a huge argument about dancing while at the club and were no longer speaking for the rest of the night. Steph and I decide to drink and chat and mostly ignore the Vic and Jane dilemma. It doesn't work. They pretty much kill the mood of the night by constantly bringing Steph and I into their argument. We try to convince them to get over it but it just doesn't happen.\n\nWe decide to call it quits and instead of just going home Jane decides we need to eat. Steph agrees but Vic decides he's done and goes home. \n\nI felt bad and decide to stay with Steph and Jane. The whole wait for the table no one talks. I try to talk to them but neither seems to be really receptive to conversation. Steph is apparently mad about Vic being mad and Jane and her are pretty much only talking about the ridiculous argument that went down. I'm pretty drunk and just really fed up with how lame the night has been at this point. I decide to tell Jane and Steph that I'm tired and going to call it a night and then I call myself an uber home. I left them in a safe area and I didn't ride or bring either of them with me so they were going to be calling their own ride home anyways.\n\nAITA for leaving them at the restaurant?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 11 months now. In the beginning, he’d constantly bring up his ex. He’s accidentally call me her name. It made me upset but I figured since it was his last real relationship, it was bound it slip out every once in a while. I talked to him about it and he apologized. (I’m not going to completely say what happened between them because it’s personal, just know that she did him dirty. However, the last major thing that happened was when she cheated on him with his college roommate). He told me that he had forgiven her for everything that happened because he doesn’t like to hold grudges and if I can’t accept that, then it’s my problem. He said he loved me and not her (anymore) so I shouldn’t get jealous or upset over him bringing her up. When this still continued to happen, I talked to him about it again and this time he promised to try and stop. Everything has been fine, he doesn’t really talk about her as much as he used to. I try to not let it bother me when he does.\n\nRight now, I’m on vacation with my friends. Last night, he called me up to say goodnight and told me how he texted his ex to try and get all his things back (since he still hasn’t gotten then/she refused to give it back). He said that she had brought them up to college with her so they weren’t home and she couldn’t give them to him. This made me angry. I don’t want him to talk to her as it is, but he is his own person. I can’t stop him. But now he’s trying to see her in person while I’m not home? I just don’t get why he tells me things about her, brings her up, and texts her when he literally KNOWS I don’t like it and I don’t like her. I really don’t know what to do or say about it anymore. I got mad about it and gave him an attitude. He told me to “not get mad and be dramatic”.  This is a constant problem and I don’t know how to deal with it. Is it bad that I get mad at him for it? I absolutely love him but I can’t find a good way to deal with this. ",

You can partner up or be alone for this. \n\nEver since last year my friend and I have been really excited to take this class and to be “rat parents” together. We both agreed that I would take Grim (our rat) during the first weekend and they could take it the next (which was a three day weekend). So that’s what we did. During the week at school Grim would stay in our classroom at school and whenever we had an open periods we could come by and take care of him. So basically I’ve been going but my partner hasn’t and because of this our rat is now attached to me whenever we in class. She tries to push him to like her but I always tell her to let him come to her not to force him and she gets PISSED because of that. So on Tuesday I asked her if I could keep him for the night because she would have him for the 3 day weekend and she said it was fine with it. Later that day she has an emotional breakdown and start crying. That night I sent her a message asking her if she was okay and if she was mad at me. She went OFF and sent me a HUGEASS message saying that I have been mean to her, that I spend to much time with him and because of that I shouldn’t have had an extra night, and that I make her miserable. I felt horrible about this cause she’s one of my closes friends. So am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Trying to gather my thoughts.. We’ve always had a strained relationship for many reason and one of them is him not listening to me. Because we’ve never seen eye to eye, I can’t tell when I’m over reacting because my baggage with him or he’s just being a dick. So...\n\n1. Originally for my upcoming birthday we were going to visit my brother across the country (we were going to go last year but I got myself a new job I couldn’t take time off).. I was hesitant for reasons but at Christmas I said let’s do it! He decided the buying the paint would be my gift (I asked him in November just to help me do the project) and we’d hopefully go on the trip next year when I’m in a better place. (What? Myself, not him) \n\n2. Multiple times I tried to get him to help me find a particular shelf for all my books, he’s always interested and even said at one point “we’ll take care of it don’t worry!” He hasn’t helped me at all and has no intentions of helping me with my shelving situation. \n\n3.  This project has been dragged on so after two weeks, the weekend to paint was here!!! Turns out there was a 15% sale on paint Monday to Wednesday so no painting that weekend (my dad has more than enough money but it is good to be frugal I do see that, we just had planned for that weekend to paint then plans changed) \n\n4. We have two doors that me and my roommate would love to replace and I mentioned it if he could pick them up during the sale(and we’d pay or course), he said they wouldn’t fit in his car, I’m not sure why, I don’t press when he makes excuses. \n\n5. My landlord requested a certain brand of paint, he said it wasn’t a problem. Didn’t get the right paint cause “he won’t notice” \n\n6. Obviously I knew he wouldn’t come by on Sunday for the VERY last visit (yay!) because Super Bowl but he did his stupid game of saying “oh maybe I will, it would make more sense” but of course he didn’t. So now pushing project 3 weeks and one day, oh well, one more day won’t kill me plus it is super bowl. \n\n7. For some reason when he came today, he didn’t paint my door, or put the doorknob back on that I took off. He thought we would just paint it on Wednesday. So he left my door knob-less and expects me to wait until Wednesday now.  \n\nAm I the asshole? Expecting too much? Am I crazy? Am I spoiled?  Keep in mind, my relationship is strained as it is, so being around him and having my house chaotic for 3 weeks could easily be skewing my judgement.\n\nIf you read all this I appreciate you very much, I’m having difficulty expressing myself right now.

However, my current roommate's inability to compromise and empathize has driven me out of my dorm that I am paying for, and instead, live with my very-understanding bf whose apartment is an hour away from school. However, the commute is nothing compared to having to live in the dorm and I've even come to enjoy it, so having to move out 6 months prematurely is not even my primary concern.\nThe first red flag was on move-in day when I asked about her shower schedule and she shrugged and said, \"Oh, you know, whenever I remember to.\" I didn't think much of it but as this year has progressed, I have never once seen her go into the bathroom and hear water running, come out with wet hair, or wash her bed sheets. The BO is more noticeable when she's in the room so I try to go there when she's not.\nShe also has a habit of bringing food into the room and letting it sit for months (there's a bowl of squash that has been sitting there since winter). I bought our mini-fridge at her request and I hardly ever use it. She lets food go bad in there and when I ask her to eat it faster, she tells me she'll \"eat it at whatever pace I want.\" The pinnacle of this was me throwing out her spoiled food in December as she had already left for winter break and her yelling at me over text about it.\nAnother side-note: she keeps an empty bottle of parmesan cheese in her bed. She tucks the thing in like it's her child and one time, I saw it on the ground and said, \"You dropped something\" and she scrambled out of bed to grab it and tucked it back in.\nFor anyone who thinks I should go to my RA, I don't because my RA is the most antisocial guy I've ever met. He's nice but his entire vibe tells me he wants to interact with other people as little as possible and I'd also like to interact with my roommate as little as possible which would not happen if he had us talk things out.\nThis morning, after a bad night's sleep, I went back to my room to see if I could nap but she was there. The godawful smell hit me like a freight train. I couldn't be in the room without feeling like I was going to vomit. I asked a friend to come over and he agreed with me, saying \"It's not even something words can describe.\" Later, I texted her asking her to shower and she told me, verbatim, to \"fuck right off\".\nEven though I can't stand her, I've tried keeping things civil and she basically has had a single room this whole year. But I feel like it's gone too far. My bf suggested we take the mini-fridge back to his place as we could actually use it, but she seems mentally unstable frankly, and I'm worried she would go off at me and that it's too extreme.\n",

      "description": "So about six months ago I went on a few dates with a guy. At face value he seemed pretty normal and was easy to talk to. I met him on a dating app, and I started chatting with him. By our second conversation, he started asking how much sex I wanted, and told me details about his previous sex habits with prior girlfriends. I politely told him I thought that was too much info and he needed to slow down. He obliged, but the fact he escalated the boundaries of a new contact set off red flags for me. \n\nNevertheless, I told myself I was being prudish, and agreed to an in-person meeting. We were both PhD candidates at the local university, so I asked if he wanted to meet up there. He said he had to go feed his cat, so I agreed to go with him, thinking he lived close to campus. Once I got there, he led us to the parking lot where I learned he lived in the next city over. I balked at getting into a car with a relative stranger, but told myself I was being stupid. We drove to his apartment a few towns over, and he showed me his place. He made a few more comments about his previous love life, but then made a few more comments about sex. He made some comment about much bigger guys were, and if a guy wanted to do anything to a woman, he could, especially to small woman like me. This comment sort of threw me off, and I don't remember how I responded. After he fed his cat, I figured we would maybe go get something to eat, which would be pretty common for a date. I asked if he wanted to go get dinner or something.\n\nHe said he wanted to go take a walk, which I figured was pretty harmless, since I assumed we were walking around the neighborhood we were in, where there were plenty of people. Nope, we hopped in his car, drove to another town, to the end of a culdesac. There was a road barrier at the end of the circle, so cars couldn't tip down the steep hill and into the wilderness surrounding the town. There were unofficial walking trails below the hill, well away from any houses or roads.\n\nAgain, my instincts were screaming at me not to go walking into the woods with this guy I had met 20 minutes ago. But then I told myself I was being stupid and a chicken, so I went with him. We walked around for a while, probably about 30 or 45 minutes, all the while I was acutely aware I was totally alone with this guy. Finally after a few more similar sightseeing stops, he agreed to drive me back to my apartment, and we sat in his car for a while and talked. He spent quite a lot of time telling me he knew all about women like me and making assumptions, which I thought was obnoxious, but he seemed willing to agree that didn't know anything about me. I even told him about an assault that happened to me a few years ago, explaining why I'm not super open with men in general.  \n\nFinally, after talking for a while, he asked for a kiss. I was totally taken aback, but again thought I was being stupid and prudish and agreed, thinking it would be a quick peck. Nope, he went for a really long kiss, which kind of freaked me out. The more I told myself I was being stupid about it, the more I asked myself why he thought taking a girl he just met out alone to the middle of the woods was a normal date idea. Maybe to a lot of people this sounds innocuous, but he just seemed to be taking a lot of liberties with a girl he just met. \n\nHe messaged me later asking if I wanted to meet again in a day or two, I said I would get back to him, and then stopped responding after a few messages. After a month or so, guilt got the better of me. I returned his messages, explained that the kiss was a little too forward for a first date, and he apologized and asked if I wanted to meet again. Again, guilt got the better of me, and I met up with him. He had driven to my apartment, and as I went down to meet him, he said he wanted to go on a walk. I balked this time, saying I had a meeting in an hour. He said it would only take about 10 minutes to drive to where he wanted to walk; I said we should just go to the city park down the street. He agreed, after a little persuasion, and he drove us there. We walked around for a bit, and he seemed to realize I was a bit tense, so he did some goofy stuff like sliding down a slide on the playset. Finally, I said I had to go to my meeting, and he dropped me off on campus.\n\nA lot of this may sound innocuous, like a slightly clueless guy, but what stood out to me was that he seemed perfectly cogent about men taking liberties with women's vulnerabilities, like he recognized it when it happened. So it stuck out to me when he took a lot of control and put us in possibly risky situations, like a woman getting into a car with a stranger, a woman going to the woods with a stranger, and initiating intimate contact on the first meeting. \n\nAll of this was enough to invoke an inadvertent fight or flight response whenever I met up with the guy. My pulse would skyrocket, and I kept asking myself if he was trying to take me to these places alone to hurt me. Finally, I figured that if I was always going to feel this way about this guy, it wasn't worth pursuing a relationship. It was around this time I read Gavin Becker's The Gift of Fear, and I saw a lot of the behavior from this guy that were red flags. Things like escalating familiarity, forced teaming, taking control and not giving me choices in things. \n\nSo I messaged him and told him I wasn't romantically interested in him. His response was to laugh at me, no other messages. I don't plan on trying to patch things up, but I do wonder.\n\nAm I The Asshole for dropping contact with this guy? Did I read too much into his actions? ",

      "description": "Ok so kinda a boring post but this interaction really bothered me. Around 4am, I couldn’t sleep so I decided to get a coffee from Tim Hortons (Canadians amirite??) I’m a little out of it due to the little to no sleep I got in the past 2 days (a lot on my mind) and when I got out of the elevator I saw a guy just standing outside the lobby entrance (phone directory or fob to get into the building) and I kept walking because I didn’t feel comfortable opening the building entrance for what could be a dangerous person- also being a 21F I felt concerned for my own safety. As I walk away to the side exit he pounds at the door and I turn back and realize it’s someone who lives in this building (I’ve lived in this building for majority of my life so Im familiar with most of the residents) when I let him in he snapped at me and said “it’s common sense to open the door because I live here and why else would I be standing there. I said “No, it’s common sense not to open the door for the safety of the residents especially at this hour”. \n\nSo my question is AITA for not letting him in when I first saw him at the door? \n\nI felt kinda bad after the interaction because there’s been times where my brother has forgotten his fob and was stuck in the lobby for ages.

      "description": "Still a bit conflicted on this. Broke up with my ex GF about a week ago. Dated for about 6 months.   \n\nBasically, we met, went on a few dates and things became serious quickly and we sat down and had the “ground rules” chat before we became official (no talking to exes, hitting on girls, etc). Which is totally fine with me, relationships need boundaries and communication. We only had a few requests each, and one of mine was: Don’t disrespect me with other guys...as in - I understood she is a good looking girl, and outside advances can happen - just don’t go looking for it.\n\nFast forward a little and she posts these stories on her IG asking her (she has like 6000 followers) followers to confide their secrets to her. Obviously guys start saying that things like “you’re so sexy” and “I’ve always had a crush on you”. So I get like annoyed and mention if she could not do that (especially since it’s something I clearly mentioned in our sit down). She says she understands where I’m coming from. Great.\n\nLess than an hour later she posts another few responses from her ‘IG story’ and one of them is: “I’ve always liked you hehe 😍”. So I just snapped a little and told her we need a break. I just don’t feel like she’s holding up her half of this whole thing. AITA?",

I’m currently in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend of 2 years who still lives in the Chicago area. \n\nMy company is around 30-40 people total and we only have 5 female employees. All the people that I directly with are males. I work on a team of 9, we are fairly young, with the majority being either my age to 3 years older. I really like the guys that I work with and recently have been hanging out with some of them more often. It started out as happy hour after work, but now we hang out more and I consider these guys my friends. It’s been hard moving so far from home and finding friends, so I’m really happy to have found some and as a plus I get to work with them too. My boyfriend however doesn’t like that I’m spending so much time with only males, especially since he lives so far away. It’s not like I set out with the intention of finding only male friends, but I do realize my chosen career path is very male dominated. I am not harboring any feeling for any of the guys and I don’t think any of them like me, honestly I think they see me like a little sister most of the time. They all know that I have a boyfriend and have even met him once when he was visiting last month. 2 of the guys have girlfriends that are sometimes around but not always. \n\nMy boyfriend seemed to be fine with everything at first but he started been making comments about how he wishes I had more female friends and how I spend so much time with the guys. This weekend I went out with them on Saturday night and my boyfriend got upset that I went out instead of calling him but I talked to him earlier in the day (as we do everyday) and it's not like we had any special facetime date planned. Yesterday he straight up said he didn't want me hanging out with them outside of work to which I said no way and we haven't talked since then.\n\n It’s been so hard finding friends in the city and I don’t really want to give up the ones that I have, but I also don’t want to put strain on my relationship with my boyfriend. At the end of the day, wether I stay friends with these guys or not, they are my coworkers and I have to work with them. Other than this, my boyfriend’s and my relationship has been great and we’ve even talked about getting married. I’m trying to see where he’s coming from but I just can't. \n\nSo reddit, AITA for wanting to stay friends with my coworkers?",

I had period cramps so I just simply said “I have cramps.” I just thought it would’ve been awkward and be like oh I understand, bye and then he would leave me alone. Instead, he had a weird smile (idk if it was creepy or mocking) on his face and said “you’re on your period this week?” I didn’t say anything because I was uncomfortable and walked back into my bedroom and sat on my bed. He followed me and demanded I answer him. I said I didn’t have to because i explained to him that it made me uncomfortable and that was personal. He stood in front of the bed while I sat on it. This kind of made me cornered because he was blocking my way to get off of my bed. I got off my bed and went around him because I didn’t want him near me and walked out my room where we originally started talking. I still didn’t say anything and he told me that I was antagonizing him. I didn’t know what he meant so I said, what? He then said it was just a question. I went to see my mom and told her that I couldn’t go and went back to my bedroom, passing my dad. \n\nNow that I think about it I remember my dad saying to me that I looked “really good.” In retrospect I remember wearing fairly tight leggings that day. He also does this thing where he forces me to hug him if I happen to go into my parents room around bedtime. I’m visibly uncomfortable mainly because he’s usually in his underwear but also I’m a bit of a germaphobe and hate hugs or touching people in general. \n\nAlso I lost a substantial amount of weight and ever since if I eat something even remotely unhealthy in front of him he’ll make me feel bad. He would be like “you’re eating all of that?” He says it and laughs in a condescending way and just over all making me feel like shit and me scared of gaining weight.   \n\nI feel so fucking stupid writing this but I get creeped out when he does these things and I genuinely don’t know if I’m over reacting and cherry picking. I feel bad when I act like I want and trying to avoid him because he’s getting older, has I lot of health related problems and there’s this pit in my gut feels like when he passes I’m going feel really freaking guilty that we didn’t have a better relationship. At the same time, some of the things he does weirds me out. I feel like the more I get older I’m getting less and less close to my father. Every time he comes into a room I feel immense dread. I tense up and really don’t like him around me. Every time I try (because really I do try) he mocks me about something or/and does something super uncalled for.

      "description": "So this one is pretty stupid I apologize. I work in food and bev distribution which means I visit several grocery stores daily. I began to get annoyed when I noticed they all seem to have reserved parking for just about everybody. Shop from home customers only, veterans only, expectant mothers only, mothers with small children, etc. Now with the exception of handicap parking, I decided these were all bullshit and cheap pr stunts, and thus started parking where ever I found a spot. These spots are nearly always open and noone seems to miss them.\n\nA woman finally called me out for parking in the pregnant woman spot to which I said \"ok\" and basically ignored her. Now I know I'm the asshole here I guess, but am I correct in it not being a big deal and a bullshit pr thing, or am I really just A total dick?",

      "description": "So here’s a bit of a background. Basically, about a year ago I (21) had just got pub g and I only had my brother and my cousin to play with. We really wanted a 4th player that wasn’t a random and we wanted with my older brother(25) because he lives with my mom in Texas and I moved to Maryland so we don’t see eachother often. I thought well I can kill two birds with one stone I can keep in touch with and we can have our 4th on pub g perfect! So naturally it starts off great. \n\nWe played pub g a lot but I wanted to play other games too and he wouldn’t want to unless he liked it. Even though we play pub g when we don’t want to. So that was check number one then after that he would say we should get siege, wild lands and even Bo4. But since its game share if one of us buys it the other gets it. He has a job and I’m a broke college student and he refuses to pay for games. For example instead of paying 20 for siege he made buy it with the little money I had because he, “had no money”. Next thing I know he has the new Xbox X which is like $400 and a $200 pair of headphones. So it irked me a bit that I’ve been paying for all the games and he obviously had some for the game. \n\nSo we are all caught up and by now he plays with his friends and cousins almost everyday because I’m in school so I can’t play often. This winter break we went to Texas and I saw him just a little bit because he was in jail again for 100 days and by the time his sentence was up we had 5 days left in Texas and instead of spending it with us he’d go out and get drunk and come back and play pub g even when we asked to play with him and asked us to watch his son so he could play pub g. So basically I pay for all the games. He couldn’t spend time with us, for the holidays when we visited and he never plays any games with us and I’ve even told him that we want to play with him and it’s not cool how he forces us to ditch our friends to play with him but he can’t do that same and that I pay for the games so the least he could do is play with us. Then he proceeds to say I know nothing because I’m 21 and somehow transitions to me being a “bad driver” and how by 16 he was so much better than me. So that kind of made me think you know what I should I just stop game sharing with him if he can’t even be grateful for it or even want to spend time with us. He rather just party and play pub g with his friends. \n\nI apologize if I was all over the place. I just was flustered and wanted to know if I’d be an the asshole if I stopped game sharing",

      "title": "AITA for being angry about an old friend coming to Xmas",
      "description": "Bit of a long story.\n\nMy mother has a positive humanist tendency to try to make Xmas good for as many people as possible, which has meant that she has often invited people we barely know over for Xmas lunch if they have been in need. The rest of the family totally gets it, it's a good thing to do, but it can lead to some awkwardness - it's not just a relaxed family affair at the end of a hard year. Sometimes it can be an endurance test, as it is when our autistic family friend comes, but we've acclimatised to her presence, and her presence is preferable to her being alone obviously!! Sorry if that sounds jerky, but at these times of year sometimes family is hard enough, not including non-family who sometimes exhibit difficult behaviours.\n\nWhich gets us to this year. We are having lunch at a restaurant so my 94 yr old Grandma can be there, and we have a spare seat that can't be cancelled. Without telling me my mother has invited an old friend who suffers from schitzophrenia. This friend ran away from home at 17 (I was 15) and came to live with my family, and it was while living with us that he was diagnosed and went from okay to much, much worse. Part of the reason for this is that another friend, our old band mate, also returned to town, and at the end of the year he killed himself. This sent my sick friend over the edge - he was the last person to see him alive on the night of his death - and after this he was homeless for a period, in jail, and eventually on a heavy mix of anti-psych meds in a halfway house. My grandma is fucking terrified of him - while he lived on the street he came over one night when it was just me and grandma in the house (i would have been 17 or 18) and did a bunch of crazy shit before leaving. I kept him low key, but Grandma has never dealt with that stuff before. Now my feelings towards him are complex - I feel sorry for him, and deeply sad - I've known him since I was 5 - but I can't deal with him. It's way too much. For me this is the tip of the iceberg - this year alone I have lost several friends to suicide, but this type of stuff isn't uncommon at all in my social circle. The idea of spending Xmas with him makes me want to crawl into a hole and die.\n\nI blew up at my Mum on text. I know she was trying to do a nice thing, but it seems crazy not to at least ask if other people are comfortable with him being there. AITA for not wanting this friend at Xmas lunch??",

      "description": "So about a week ago my parents, my sister (21) and I (17M) were having breakfast. I went to pour myself a cup of tea. I didn’t realise at the time that the tea had been left sitting for at least an hour. So when I went in for a sip I was soon hit with the brutal fact that the tea had gone completely cold. In hindsight I could have manned up and swallowed the cold tea but when you’ve just been hit in the face with disappointment, confusion and shock you don’t really think about your actions. In my mind my best option was to get this tea out of my mouth as soon as possible. I scanned for a nearby container which was the tea pot. I opened the lid and spit the tea into the tea pot. I agree that this wasn’t the best solution but I didn’t really think about it.\nNow for the point of the story, my family reacted with laughter and confusion but my sister was in her own words: disgusted. She said since we all use that tea pot it’s bad table manners and nasty to spit in it. But the tea in the tea pot was cold, no one was going to drink that. On top of the fact that a simple rinse will take care of all the germs from my mouth. Plus, we’re family right? It isn’t weird to drink out of the same glass so why is it a big deal if I spit in the tea pot and it was rinsed? A week later and she’s still angry that I spit in the tea pot. I fail to see how she’s right.\nI let my sister read this and she wants to add that after I had just spit in the tea pot I didn’t remark enough on the situation, which is true, it is pretty weird to spit in the tea pot and I just kind of went along as if nothing happened. She says the fact that I didn’t give it enough attention could cause my parents or her to forget it happened or, more likely, miss it entirely and later on in the breakfast maybe one of them would have poured themselves a cup of tea and drink some with my spit out tea in it, which would be disgusting. I’d say the chances of that happening are very low. Everybody saw it happen and you wouldn’t forget that easily. Also again the family argument, it wouldn’t be the end of the world to drink tea with my spit out tea along with it. Also the tea pot was full so it would only be a small percentage but I do agree that it would be unpleasant to drink my spit out tea.\nI’m not looking for approval I’m genuinely curious what reddit’s thoughts on this are. Am I the asshole here?",

Right now we live about 2.5 hours apart and the wedding location is closer to me than her. The drive for me would be about an hour.\n\nSome backstory: I have never met the bride, groom, or anyone involved in the wedding. The only person I will know is my gf. The happy couple are doing a sort of unusual thing where all members of the wedding party will have their significant others at the head table with them. If this was not the case, I would probably not be going since it would be awkward for me to sit with people I don't know. \n\nAnyways, she is going to pay for a hotel room for 2 nights, and it's close to $300 a night. That's a LOT for where this wedding is going to be. She told me about it, and it didn't really cross my mind to offer to pitch in. She asks if I can help. I offer the suggestion of just staying at my place since it's only an hour away. She insists she has to be there at the hotel since she's part of the bridal party, which makes sense. \n\nNow, a little background of me and her specifically. She makes more money than me and lives with her parents until I move to her city. She has no bills other than a car payment and helping with groceries. She is smart with her money.\n\nI live alone, have student loans up the a$$, car payment, rent, utilities, internet, etc. So my disposable income is razor thin. \n\nBecause of these big differences in our income, I do not want to have to help pay for a hotel room that I would otherwise not be staying in.\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to help pay for a hotel room for a wedding my gf is in?",

Sometimes even very basic questions like \"Are you hungry?\" will be answered with \"I don't know\". \n\nAdditionally she is incapable of maintaining basic hygienic standards (e.g. cleaning hands after handling greasy food) and the concepts of personal space or privacy are unknown to her or she does not care for those concepts. \n\nThese among other things have lead to me losing any interest interacting with her and also disliking her to a certain degree. As a consequence I never initiate conversation with her, only react to her when directly asked and when asked answer in a deliberately cold but hopefully helpful way; never offensive though.\n\nSummarizing her mental state you could maybe compare it to a 6 years old child, the main difference being a complete lack of any self-sufficient activity. Also there is absolutely nothing malicious about her behavior. Every shortcoming results from a lack of ability.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not pretending to be somehow interested in her and very openly displaying indifference? ",

      "description": "So I got some pretty bad social anxiety. I can't hold a conversation to save my life. So this usually leads to be leaving people on read a lot.\n\nSo at my job we claim accounts from a queue, and if we cannot finish an account (Need help or waiting for a supervisor, etc.) We have to put the account on hold in order to claim another account.\n\nA new lead was recently hired, who I have never interacted with before, however she is not directly above me, but over another group of coworkers. This past week she's been Google chat messaging me to leave notes on the accounts on hold. And sometimes when she would do so, put those accounts back in progress so I am unable to claim any more despite me still awaiting for whatever they're on hold for. Sometimes when this happens, the notes will be deleted.\n\nNow when she messaged me, I didn't ever respond. I just tried to remember to put notes on, but I ended up procrastinating and forgetting. Or the notes would get deleted due to being put on hold, in progress, back on hold. This resulted in 4/5 Google chats that went unresponsive to. Nothing out of malice, just didn't know she expected a response, and I really didn't know her.\n\nBecause I didn't respond, she escalated it to our boss' boss. And they decided to give me my final warning, claiming it was out of retaliation.\n\nAITA?",

I agreed and we said we go get smoothies before 3 pm today so we could catch our other friend on their shift. So today around 11 I told him are we still on for today, he said yes, and I said “ok just let me know when.” Now it is really cold out right now, and our original plan was to bike their, but I figured if it came to it I’d just drive us. \n\nSo now it’s half past three, I check snapchat stories and he’s out with his girlfriend. I take this as, “alright he probably wants to go later and we will just miss our friends shift. At this point, I’m getting kinda pissed, so I ask him he we are going or not. He says it’s too cold out, which it is, but I’m still pissed he didn’t think to tell me beforehand. So I call him out on this habit, and he says I did the same thing yesterday. (Yesterday he invited me out to watch a game with some other people but I said I’ll pass because of the game was outside and it’s cold out.) I tell him the difference is that I cancel beforehand and that was it. AITA?",

      "description": "About a year ago, my best friend (31f) and I (27f) were casually hanging out at a bar with a guy (43m) we had just met who happened to be a friend of a friend. We all ended up drinking too much and ended up back at his hotel room (his occupation involves a lot of traveling, and he comes through my area a few times a year). I was thrilled because I had been eyeing him for a while (we had very briefly encountered each other a few times before through mutual friends), and I expressed my excitement to my friend. Things started getting hot and heavy between the three of us, but my friend fell asleep on the couch whilst he and I continued to hook up.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went home later, but my friend was too drunk and stayed the night. I know they messed around briefly the next morning, but I later further expressed to my friend how interested I was in this guy, and she agreed to let me have this one since I was going through a dry spell.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest of the week, he and I hung out every night. We had a great time, but I knew his M.O. from the beginning, clearly, because of the circumstances under which we met. I also know other women within my outer friend circle he had slept with, and mutual friends have told me he has women he sees frequently in destinations he visits for work. This didn't bother me as I had recently got out of a long relationship that was sexually unfulfilling, so I wasn't looking for anything serious - I just wanted to have fun, and we always used protection.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that week together, we texted non stop for about a month, then I slowly stopped hearing from him. He let me know a couple months later that he was in town, and we hooked up a couple times. Over the next year he would come by every few months and we'd have a lovely time. My best friend is aware of all this and there isn't any ill will between us. We go to shows, take trips together, and we are each other's confidantes. I know that my friend and and my FWB follow each other on social media, but they don't really have contact.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the current situation: He and I have been texting regularly over the past two months; at least 3-4 times a week. A few days ago he told me he was going to be in town this week, and we've both expressed how much we are looking forward to seeing each other. Except today, he DM'ed my friend sort of suggestively in response to her Instagram story, trying to initiate conversation. She told me right away, and she made brief small talk with him to see if he would try anything, but she eventually just stopped responding. Am I the asshole for being super pissed and wanting to blow him off this week? I don't expect a lot from him, but I feel disrespected.     \n",

      "description": "I know at first glance I am very obviously not the asshole, but the situation is a bit nuanced.\n\nMy friend started texting me at about 1:45 in the morning, very obvious drunk texts. He said that he drove to the bar, and I told him to walk back instead of driving. I offered him a ride, but he wanted me to walk to the bar and drive his car. This was Halloween night right when the bars were about to close, and I am a small female. I told him that I wasn’t going to walk over, but that I could drive my car and he could pick up his car in the morning. He declined. So I told him to either walk back, get a ride from a friend (who is a bartender at the bar), or call a cab. \n\nThe next morning, he texted me freaking out that he drove back drunk. I told him I have very little sympathy and that he was well aware at the time that he should not be driving. A few days later, he told me that he thinks his drink was spiked with something, since when he blacked out he apparently was acting relatively normal. Talked to his roommate, put away dishes, got a glass of water, etc., and his bartender friend said that he wasn’t acting drunk at the bar. But his texts were very obviously drunk texts, and he was aware enough at the time that he shouldn’t be driving home.\n\nWhen I told him that I no longer want to speak to him because of his actions, he said a lot of things like how I’m only angry because I would feel guilty about not picking him up if something bad had happened, and that it wasn’t his fault because he thinks he was drugged.\n\nSo am I the asshole for 1. Kinda not believing that he was drugged 2. Not walking over to drive him home 3. Telling him that it was his responsibility to find another way home, even if his drink was spiked? ",

      "description": "My boyfriend isn’t the best at respecting my boundaries when it comes to sex. The only birth control we use is condoms. I refuse to go on the pill for a number of reasons. He used to pressure me to let him have sex with me without protection because condoms don’t feel good despite me always telling him no. This was even after I had a pregnancy scare. Finally I put my foot down about it and told him to never ask me about it again. He told me he didn’t take my pregnancy concern that seriously because I would just get an abortion should it happen.\n\nI don’t ever ever want kids and I’ll get an abortion no matter what. But I don’t want to go through the whole emotional toll of having an abortion. I’ve had friends who had abortions and it’s not fucking fun. I also have tokophobia, a fear of pregnancy. Literally every month I get near anxiety attacks because I’m afraid I’m pregnant or will get pregnant. I’m looking into getting my tubes tied and my boyfriend already booked consultations from two different doctors for a vasectomy. \n\nHe finally stopped pressuring me and even told me he now understands and empathizes with women who have to go through the gruelling process of pregnancy and abortion. He told me he doesn’t want to do anything that’ll cause me anxiety. But lately he’s been careless again. He was rubbing his dick against my genitals and I was okay with it, then he suddenly just slides it in without my permission. No condom. Raw. I just let it happen for about 20 seconds before I told him to pull out. Shortly after he stuck it inside me again and I told him to pull out. \n\nI’m getting anxiety about being pregnant now even though he claims he wasn’t even close to cumming. He even said he won’t do it ever again, and if I do get pregnant, he’ll support me the whole way. I told him, “No, if I do get pregnant, we’re over.” \n\nHe got pretty upset about that statement because I’m threatening him with a breakup over something that’s both our fault. But honestly, I’ll feel extremely disappointed in myself if I do get pregnant and I don’t think I’d be able to look at him again. \n\nAITA for that remark? ",

      "description": "I have been dating her for 1.5 years. She’s a great person and all, but she is one of those girls who don’t seem to understand that libraries are for studying. She’ll regularly go to the library with several of her friends, take up a table, and treat it like the coffee shop. She’s been told off by people trying to study and then she acts like the victim.\n\nThis is why I rarely go to my school’s library with her. Im one of those people who need absolute silence to study. Yesterday, she said she wanted me to study for a hard exam with her so I agreed. However, she gets a call from her cousin or something and decides to have a full on normal voiced convo right in the middle of the dead silent library. Nearly everyone within 10 feet turned to look at her. Yet she didn’t even seem to care, just kept talking. I was SO annoyed and told her to stop, but she just glared at me.\n\nHer convo went on for like 10 mins and I got so fed up I just packed my things and left. I wasnt going to waste my time trying to study while also listening to her talk about her cousins new dog. I went to another floor of the library and left her there. She texted me “where r u” and I ignored her.\n\nThen after several hours, I texted her saying that Im sorry, but I really need to study for this exam, and I can’t be distracted. That night when I got home I texted her again and said that I really thought what she did in the library was rude and I don’t want to be with such an inconsiderate person. She freaked out at me and said I was overreacting. I told her she needs to learn to be mindful of other people around her.\n\nTL;DR: Gf had a phone convo in middle of silent library, I had enough and broke up with her over it. AITA?",

All of them have largely been kind and we all got along for the most part. \n\nHowever, there have been a few incidents in which they either said or did something seriously hurtful. Most of these have revolved around them not finishing an activity before going to do something without me, or hurriedly finishing something while ignoring me so they can run off. \n\nL also shares interests with everyone but me. They have been raised more rough and tumble, while my family is more introverted, everyone does their own thing, not much outside time.\n\nT also seems biased about activities, sometimes simply refusing to do anything with me, while being perfectly willing to do things with L.\n\nIt is entirely possible that I have done something which made them upset with me, as I have issues with my temper. However, no one has said anything to me about this, just seemingly deciding to exclude me. It is also possible that they have been doing things that they like, not knowing that I don't like those things.\n\nI may also be overreacting due to the fact that I have a considerably smaller friend group than everyone else and I am just coming off as clingy. \n\nAll the others like L a lot, and seem to go along with anything he suggests.\nI rarely decide the activity, and when I try to ask to do something it seems to almost always get shot down by T or L. I have don't often shut down their ideas unless I think the idea is unsafe. However, it is very possible that I am unfairly biased and am being a dictator.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole for talking to T privately about these issues? Or is there something I'm not seeing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Ive always had a rocky relationship with my mom but i kind of faked liking her at all just because she buys affection. I havent told her i loved her or even hugged her in over a decade. Im 23 years old and engaged living  independently. The last time i spoke to her was when she came to my house and brought her dog uninvited who almost broke my glass entertainment center and tv. I got mad and she stormed out while i was fixing it. She's a drama queen. \n\nAbout 2 weeks later i find out my fiance and i arent invited to Christmas with the family because my mom spread lies about us. This is the main reason i blocked her. She invited herself to my house the day after Christmas to give us our presents, but we told her no. She drove up our driveway, threw the box of stuff out her window in my yard and left. \n\nShe has sent me quite a few messages since and i havent responded to any. She claims to not know why im ignoring her and said she didnt do anything wrong. Then she asked if my fiance is pregnant and didn't want to tell her. Then she actually harsssed my fiance and said she ruined my relationship with my mom. \n\nTheres also the fact that she lied about my father my entire life and hid him from me. I began talking to him and realized this. My sister ran away at 16 and went to another state because of my mom as well, so its not just me with a problem. \n\nOne of the biggest reasons i dont talk things through with her, is because there is no scenario where i dont yell at her to the point where she will probably commit suicide. Shes threatened it before and i feel like she will if i speak up. \n\nTLDR: My mom ruined my relationship with my family, lied about my father, ran off my sister, and harassed my fiance so i blocked her and cut her from my life. Am i the asshole?",

      "description": "So, I‘m from a small town in the heartland, the kind where everyone knows everyone else. I moved away after school, got married, then divorced, yadda yadda. This was well before the advent of social media, and I didn’t really keep up with everyone; howeve,  many of us are connected now. (Thanks Zuckerberg!)\n\nA couple of years after my 10 year marriage ended, one of my old classmates (”L”) and I began an online flirtation. He was recently divorced, and lived about 1.5 hours from me. L had been small, short and awkward growing up, but had a growth spurt after graduation, became a successful career professional, was active at church, Boy Scouts, had two great kids, etc. We started dating, but OMG things got weird with him fast. Growing up awkward seemed to make him determined to prove his manliness, and he spent so much time at strip clubs, flirting (and more) with women in his Scout Den, at work, etc. Add a fake pregnancy with a recent ex, nude pictures of me while I was sleeping, and some cruelty to me (I am a bit overweight), and that was that. It ended, in 2010. He got married the next year, and was old news. \n\nFast forward a eight years, and now I am engaged and living with another former classmate (“R”). Again, Facebook put us back in touch. We’ve been together three years, and live together. R knows about L, and the fustercluck that ensued. I should also mention R has always been very tall and strong.  \n\nA few weeks ago, I got an IM from L on Facebook Messenger, asking how I was. I asked him “how can I help you?”, and his first question was if I was in a relationship. I said yes, but didn’t elaborate. Basically L said he was getting a divorce, had been “manipulated” into marriage, was sorry for how he treated me and has thought of me every day. LMAO. I tersely thanked him for his apology; he sent his phone number “in case I ever needed anything”, and I blocked him. \n\nR is really ticked that I didn’t tell L that we are together and engaged. R asked me for L’s phone number, but I didn’t give it to him. I told him that L was in my past, and I really didn’t want him knowing anything about my life now. R doesn’t really get it, but seemed to be ok after a while. He did mention it again this week, but only in passing. \n\nAITA for not giving L’s phone number to R, and just wanting that awfulness to be in my past? \n\n",

      "title": "WIBTA for ghosting on a 15-year friendship?",
      "description": "WIBTA for deciding, after 15 years, that a friendship has run its course? I’ll try to keep this short. \n\nThroughout the life of my friendship with J, she’s had a charming habit of absolutely blowing up at me out of the blue every couple of years. The first time was two days before Christmas, about six years ago, when she hit me with a text barrage of abuse about how I never had time for her anymore. Her criticism may have been valid, though I was doing my best despite some extenuating personal circumstances - but the way she blew up out of nowhere was alarming. Within a few days, she was back to normal, as though she’d never said those horrible things, but I spent some time feeling like I was walking on eggshells around her. \n\nI’d finally started to feel like things were back to normal when, about a year and a half ago, she had another explosion at me. This time it was right after my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer, because J’s timing is always impeccable. We’d been out at a drinks event, she got drunk and silly and was annoying other patrons at a pizza place (to the point where we almost got kicked out), and when I tried to rein her in, she snapped again. Every grievance she’d ever had against me came pouring out (including some situations I remembered quite differently - for instance, an incident she remembered as me being “mean to her” was actually one that I another friend recalled for her being vicious toward me). \n\nA month or two went by before she’d talk to me again, and only on the grounds that I copped to everything and apologized. Why? I don’t know. I haven’t held onto that many friends from high school (I was a shy, insecure kid who didn’t have many to start with, and you know, life changes.) I suppose I didn’t want to lose J. \n\nBy last summer, I finally felt like we were in a good place - I was asked to be maid of honor in her wedding, and helping her plan was a fun experience. In September, I threw her bachelorette party, with everything she wanted. And no, she didn’t blow up at me - but she absolutely lost it on one of her bridesmaids. Again, a small slight spun into a recitation of every time this girl had ever looked at her cross-eyed. Y’all, I am not exaggerating when I say that it spun out into a literal five-hour screaming, sobbing tantrum. It was honestly scary at times, and I never imagined anyone could feel so hard-done-by at the end of a twelve-hour party in their sole honor, but apparently it’s possible. I realized that night that I’ll never NOT feel like I’m walking on eggshells around her - I’ll always be afraid of the next blowup. This is more than a legitimate fear - despite copious apologies made and accepted, she really likes to remind me of when I “used to be mean to her.” \n\nAnd to be honest, while she likes to pride herself on being a good friend (the subject of  part of her tantrum) she has...not really been for me. A few years ago, I took her on a weekend away to a theme park in Florida, paying for her airfare and hotel, which Inwas happy to do, hoping to give her a good memory since her mom had passed the year before. While we were there, a close family member of mine went on hospice. When she walked out of the bathroom and heard the news, all she said was, “I hope this won’t spoil my trip.” Any question I had about whether I could leave her the room and fly home died on my lips. My family member was unresponsive when I got home two days later and I never got to say goodbye - while spending the weekend swallowing down my grief to keep her happy. This is only one incident that stuck with me and still hurts - I don’t keep a catalog of wrongs, as she apparently does. But in the history of our friendship, she has never shown support when I might have needed it - despite times when I’ve dropped everything to be with her.\n\nThis is why it’s coming to a head - I got engaged over Christmas to a wonderful, kind, patient man (who deserves the world and CERTAINLY not to be subjected to this level of drama). J knew it would be coming and has mentioned multiple times that she expects to be in my wedding as I was in hers just a few months ago. Quite apart from fearing that she’ll use it as an excuse to throw another fit - which seems more likely than not, and is something I don’t want to put my fiancée, family, and other friends through - I simply don’t want her support. We aren’t planning a big wedding, but I would like to have the women I care about at my side on that day to mark the importance they’ve had and will continue to have in my life. I don’t want J there - I don’t want to be friends anymore with someone who treats people like she does. I don’t even want to tell her that I don’t want to be in her life anymore - it’ll be a huge, crying, angry mess with more attacks flung at me than I care to deal with. Even telling her that I’d like her at the wedding but not in it will be, I think, more than she can handle maturely. \n\nHere’s my question, then: would I be the asshole for simply dropping out of this drama? Cutting off contact, not responding to messages, ignoring the verbal haranguing that is sure to come my way? \n\nTl;dr Longtime friend is subject to throwing fits. WIBTA for ghosting her right after her wedding and as I’m preparing for my own?",

He doesn't make a lot and also has a dog, which made finding an affordable place difficult. I felt bad and let him stay with us which was a move that I now think I made too quickly. It was agreed that this would be temporary. He said he needed till the end of 2019. He said his goal was to move to BC and find a place of his own. I was hesitant to agree to this. My fiancee and I are getting married in August and well, I thought this would be kind of weird?? But I said okay, hoping this time would give him a chance to form a plan for himself. I've known him for a long time and I know he isn't the most responsible financially. He has a ton of credit card debt, adopted a dog when he probably shouldn't have and tends to spend frivolously when he probably should be saving etc etc etc...\n\nA little background info: We share a common group of friends. For the last 10 years since his parents kicked him out, he's been living in one of our basement's. His rent is $360/month utilities included. His rent has NEVER INCREASED. He got kicked out of one friends basement and then moved to another. Was kicked out again and now he is here with me. I never knew why but I think I might now...\n\nFast forward to today: Over the last few months, he's argued with me on a few things and it's really rubbed me the wrong way. When he moved in, he misunderstood me saying, \"we don't really use our basement\" to mean he gets to take over our entire basement. After he moved in, he had quite literally taken over the whole basement. His stuff was EVERYWHERE. He'd moved my stuff so his stuff without asking so that his stuff would fit. He installed stuff all over my walls in the basement without asking. He basically turned the basement into his own living room. When I told him he had to move as much of his stuff into the room he was renting, he threw a tantrum. He was so fixated on my comment and felt I was taking back something we had agreed upon (which we did not). To this day, he still has stuff all over my basement...\n\nHe says he enjoys hosting guests. Which would be fine if it were once in a while and maybe a few guests at a time. But this is not the case. Ex. One weekend, he showed up unannounced with 8 friends in tow, had 4 guests over the next day, then 6-7 guests the day after. He argued with me that he should be able to host guests 1-2x a week. And he often hosts 6+ guests at a time. This has been very hard for me as I'm a very busy person and coming home to a quiet place is my time to relax. \n\nHe likes to host D&amp;D. But they come over Sunday nights...and then they stay over late. Like 11pm. I work early in the mornings and often have to be AT work for 7:30 am. Getting him to agree to a 10:00 curfew was like pulling teeth. I had to compromise with 10:30...\n\nHis dog sheds a LOT. It's been so frustrating because I end up having to do the bulk of the cleaning. When I asked him to pitch in to sweep once a week. He told me I just have a really high standard of cleanliness...\n\nLast but not least, he smokes marijuana. A LOT of it. I don't have a problem with it, but I do have a problem with the smell. IT STINKS. I claims he doesn't smoke indoors but holy crap does it ever smell strong. \n\nThere are other issues but these are the things that stand out to me. We've come to some agreements and compromises, but it's his attitude about discussing things that has me really stressed out. It's been a few months and I honestly don't know if I can handle him being here for another whole year. **Long story short? I feel taken advantage of**. $360/month rent is unheard of. In my area for something similar would easily go for at least double that amount. I did it because we are friends and I hoped it would help him save up and make a plan for himself. But so far, he hasn't made ANY plans for himself and instead continues to spend frivolously, eating out, buying things he doesn't need...and of course all of the issues above. \n\nSo I told him this morning that I think he needs to re-consider his deadline and move out in August when my fiancee and I are getting married. We just want to move forward with married life and have kids after the wedding and I don't really want to deal with the stress of him being here. He threw another tantrum and flipped out on me. He came home today and basically holed himself in his room downstairs. AITA here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Throwaway account cause I don't want this getting linked back to me irl. I'm 18, and as the title suggests, am in the process of moving out of my house.\n\nTo make a long story short, I'm doing this because my parents have, since I started school, put an immense amount of pressure on me, which has resulted in some fucked up mental health over the years. It's kind of their way of showing that they love me, but it's always been really detrimental to me. I've told them that they put a lot of pressure on me multiple times now, and their response has always just been 'we're not putting pressure on you'. Needless to say, it didn't really help.\n\nIt's probably important to know that we've argued a lot, especially my mother and I, and while I'd like to say it's their unrealistic expectations I'm probably just as much at fault for our kinda crappy relationship.\n\nIn September 2017, I told them about my mental health, which included suicidal thoughts. My mother had a complete breakdown (didn't really help the situation but fair enough, it's pretty hardcore stuff) but my father decided to insult me because of it, calling me out for being weak and saying I 'didn't know anything about true suffering'. Note that I didn't tell them they had anything to do with my mental health; I blamed it all on school (which was more or less true as well). My parent's reactions resulted in me coming very close to attempting suicide in the coming days. I didn't tell them about this either, and have not to this day.\n\nMy parents are also a little homophobic, and I'm bi, which doesn't help. I think this is more of a lack of understanding and the way they were raised rather than outright bigotry, so it's probably not that important.\n\nWhen I told them I was moving out, they were pretty distraught. Tears were shed, alcohol was consumed and so far they're asking me to stay, at least for 6 more months. My mother has flat out refused to accept the idea that I'm leaving, and then she cried like she thought I was going to die. Keeping in the theme of things, I didn't tell them that they were the main reason I'm moving out. As of the present moment, I'm still going ahead moving out.\n\nThis probably seems pretty clean cut, but the problem is my parents have changed since then. They're not the same people from late 2017, they actually care about me and my mental health now. I've graduated from school, so the pressure has been lifted for the most part. It's not the same shitty environment that I'm trying to escape. The caveat is I don't care about them. I haven't forgiven them for what they've done, even if they didn't ever *really* mean to hurt me. They still love me, but I don't think I love them anymore.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "So, my girlfriend and her life long friends agreed to watch the Avengers: Endgame  a year ago together. Now flash forward to November last year. We got together already and I met her friends also. Her friends were nice, they're cool to get along with. Now flash forward to today, it turned out that the Premiere night of Endgame coincidentally fell on a work night for me. And they already agreed to watch it on that specific day. I don't ever wanna whine up about who I watch wanna watch it with or something, but the MCU has been a huge for me. And I wanna watch it with her because aside from she knows exactly how huge it is for me and what not, I wanna watch it with someone who I really want to spend the rest of my life with. Enough of the romantic bs. So I kinda told her that, if you could still wait for another day after it premieres then we can already watch it together. If she chooses to watch it together with her friends, I'm gonna be ultimately sad about it. No BS. I mean, I could just kept it to myself and tell her that it's okay, you can do what you want all, you can watch it together with your friends, but I would be sad about it. \n\nSo i guess the question here is, Am I the Asshole for partly making my girlfriend decide if she's gonna come with her friends or watch the endgame with me?",

      "description": "  Sorry about any errors im on mobile and this is my first post here\n\n   So a little backstory. I was in my science classs when some kid whipped out a crushed iphone. A few people (including myself) would check it out when the teacher wasnt looking. The battery was already messed up, like bent and whatnot so inevitably it exploded. Nobody was seriously hurt (as far as i know as of now, since it was a small fire and it was on a tile floor) but there was a tooonnn of gas from the lithium ion battery. A fire drill was called and the school was evacuated- temporarily. \n   Most of the school hallways are outside, and the place is really spread out. The only place that was affected was the 8th grade section but the whole placed REEKED of fumes. After the fire drill (the fire department was never called or notified) we were all let back into our regular areas and classrooms. The only classroom that was evacuated fully was the one where the battery exploded. I didnt want to be around that, so i went to the office. Janitors took out the battery and put fans in the room, probably with nothing more than doctors masks. Poor guys. \n   Anyway, while i was in the office they said they had people from the district testing to see if it was safe.\n   First off, why do you have people there if you dont even know if its okay?\n    I reserched lithium ion batteries and know that they give off toxic fumes and dont want myself or others getting hurt, so i beleive the school handled the situation incorrectly and didnt care about the well being of the students or teachers. \n   I was texting my father to see if i could get some sort of sense for this situation, and he said that hed come pick me up, personally check it out, and if he didnt smell anything that i was gonna be in some huge trouble (this was hours after it happened and his nose is messed up, since its been broken like 8 times.) I was upset with him, and he got upset at me. \n   AITA for being pissed with the schools decision and my father for being an ass about it?\n  TLDR a lithium ion battery exploded, gave off a ton of fumes and the school barely did anything about it. Father got pissed at student (me)",

      "description": "So this happened just an hour ago. My (m) female friend is super toxic. We met a year ago and used to talk a lot during the beginning but over the months we talk maybe once a month or something. I don't consider her a close friend, she's between an acquantince and a friend. I just see her on the regular cause we have classes together. We don't talk.\n\nSo it's finals week and I'm studying for my exam at the library. She runs into me and starts casually talking about her guy problems. In the past she's talked about it and I've tried to indirectly communicate (such as changing the topic, ignoring the issue subtly and shifting it to something else) that I do not want to listen to her problems. \n\nI usually don't have problems with talking about things, but she always talks about the same problems with me and it's extremely toxic. Secondly, she's done a few things that indirectly hurt me. For example, she insists to go with me to a concert but when we get there, she tells me to not stick with her cause she's trying to hang out with a guy who ghosted on her. \n\nShe starts talking about the same things while I'm trying to prepare for my final. I snap and I tell her \"I'm not trying to be rude but I'm not your personal therapist. I don't wanna talk about these things and I'd appreciate it if you let me study\". \n\nWhat followed was a 2 minute awkward silence and then she just left. I feel a little bad but I've had enough.

There's a small character cast:\n\nMe: A trans-demi male artist.\nRose: My best friend of 12 or so years.\nSteve Mc'Tits: You'll understand why.\n\nI'm a member of (Insert writing site here) and I love to talk to people when I'm pulling all-nighters to get shit done, since it works better than coffee to keep me up. So I'm situated with my water bottle and some snacks Rose left for me, since I'm currently staying at their place, it's about 4:12 in the morning. I accept a request from some guy, still shaken after we had a false intruder scare so I say something like \"Oh my shit, what a night. Anyways, how are you?\" Or some stupid greeting. \n\nHe says \"hi,\" we start talking about what happened earlier, the topic veers a hard right to art so he asks to have my Discord because he wants to see my pieces.\n\nBad idea #1. I add the guy, (Steve Mc'Tits or 'Steve' for short), send over a piece or two I'm proud of. It's fine until something like this happens.\n\nSteve: You're single right? Let me see your boobs.\n\nMe: ... What?\n\nSteve: You're a girl so I should see your tits. Pleaaase let me see them. (there's a hint of r/justneckbeardthings to this asshole right about now.) I promise I won't judge. What cup size?\n\nIt's late and I am DONE already at this point.\n\nMe: Fuck you! I'm not a girl.\nI proceeded to explain that I am a trans demi male, saving up for surgery soon and it's not okay to ask ANYONE to see pictures, especially when people aren't comfortable with those parts. It's painful to try and explain why it hurts so much. (Dysphoria is a bitch.)  \n\nBut Steve immediately jumps to this:\n\nSteve: Trans people should go fuck off and die. They don't deserve to be treated like people. \n\nI did not block him. I went off and off until I was done and then I did, but I told ALL of his friends what happened, sent out screen caps and everything. To this day I still feel shitty about it, though I've had people tell that it wasn't okay to go off, I should have just blocked him, not told his friends, etc. AITA for not just blocking the guy?

She comes from an insanely toxic family, she was emancipated at 16 and to this day refuses to speak to any of her family. They are all addicted to meth and her sister to meth + anything she can get her hands on. Her sister has 3 kids, ages 9 months (F), 6 years (M), and 13 years (F). My wife began taking care of these children when the first was born when she was only 7 years old because no one else would. For whatever reason CPS never took the kids away despite near constant monitoring and the last my wife knew of these kids was 3 years ago when she permanently cut her family off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer parents always assumed she would adopt any children her sister produced (this actually was the beginning of the rift that led to her cutting her parents off) and were never shy about it. When we started dating (She was 15, I was 17) I told her that if she adopted those kids then the relationship wouldn't work out because if I am having kids they are going to need to be my own. She agreed and said she had no desire to ever adopt those kids. \n\n  \nI just deleted like 5 paragraphs worth of useless details because I'm just ranting. I will just get to the point, so out of the blue last week she tells me that she feels guilty about leaving the children behind and she is planning on reaching out to her sister to formally adopt them.  I told her hell no, I made it clear very early on that I do not want to raise those kids. She told me that she assumed I would \"grow out of it\" and accept them. We argued and have been arguing over and over for days now about her decision. She has since reached out to her sister and has started the process of adopting the children. The oldest girl is pregnant, the middle child is a decent kid, and the youngest one only got out of prenatal ICU 5 months ago due to the mother's incessant abuse of drugs during pregnancy.   I am 22, she is 20. I think even if I wanted to adopt these kids I would still want to say no due to our age and financial situation (She works at a make up store, I work at a grocery store for fucks sake)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't straight up told her that I am planning on leaving yet but I've already told my parents that if she doesn't stop then that is my plan.

She really doesn't like me gaming or having a lan party, but I guess that is because she doesn't like gaming overall. So everything was fine and all that, the lan party was fun as always, but today when I came back home to my gf, she was upset because she had  been alone the whole day (I came home at 5pm), and she was going to leave to visit her parents. She was clearly upset at me for not coming home earlier but am I in the wrong here? Am I not allowed to hangout with my friends just because she had nothing to do at home? I mean, she also has friends and I've never been upset at her for hanging out with her friends. This has also happened before. ",

      "title": "AITA for not caring about a local issue my government class voted on?",
      "description": "So to give some background, I'm a senior in high school. I have a government class and my teacher got some new curriculum called Generation Citizen. The whole point of it is to have students vote to work on a local issue and then work towards talking to local politicians and people in power to make some sort of change happen. So. he divided us into groups a while and had us come up with an issue, then we would present each issue the groups came up with, and then collectively voted on that as a whole. In the end, we were about to do something regarding veterans, I don't really remember for sure what is was. But, as the very last group is going, this one student from their group goes up to the front of the class, and gives a whole testimony about how he is homeless. After his speech, most of the votes go to helping \"youth homelessness\". Let me drop some statistics here. In my school district in California, which has been known to have homeless problems, there is an estimated 3-5% of homeless students in my school district. I was thinking the whole time, \"There's no way a tiny high school class is going to solve youth homelessness.\" I did more research and found that a lot of millions of dollars have gone into helping with this issue along with multiple organizations in our area that are working on the issue 24/7. So, there's no way we can really solve the whole issue. Fast forward to the past 2-3 weeks. This student doesn't even show up to class anymore, and I mention this to other people and they felt that it's dumb that he came, changed a bunch of votes, and dipped. It's like he didn't even show up to his own pity party. So I'm assuming now that a lot of the people don't want to work on this issue anymore and probably want to change it. I recommended to my teacher that we do something that affects all students in the entire school district which was open campus. This means that any student can leave campus to go get food and as long as they come back before lunch ends, you wouldn't be in any trouble. But people already sneak out to get food anyways. My teacher's response was, \"If we let students go during lunch to buy their own food, then people who can't afford to get food will feel bad or feel left out.\" I responded with the fact that we have vending machines at our school, so wouldn't someone who couldn't afford something from the vending machine feel the same way? So it wouldn't even be different from that. The whole point of this is that we don't even want to work on this issue, and the only real change that my teacher made to this was to have a plan to create a \"Youth Task Force for Homeless Youth\" because who can relate to youth better than the youth. But nobody even wants to be a part of the task force. We feel a little forced to work on this issue now even though people voted how they wanted to after being swayed by the homeless student's speech. I didn't vote for it, but the majority of people did, and I'm sure they regret it. At this point, we collectively do not care about working on our issue as much anymore, and would rather do something else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion...AITA for not caring about this issue and trying to protest it?",

      "description": "Okay so short story I'm 20 now I've been friends with this group of friends since I was 13, they've been there through ups and downs, we've had our own ups and downs, I've been a lending hand for them as they had for me when we're down. Overall this is a group of brothers and I wouldn't call it anything else. Even people from outside the group have said they've never seen any other group of friends so close. We are still all really close but have grown up. Between work and school for all of us we still get to hang out a lot. But lately I've been noticing how close minded some of these people are and how their main focus is smoking weed. A couple of these friends have even gone as far to befriend my exes (they know how much I loved her) now boyfriend. I've told them that this bothers me and they dont care, they're getting a good hookup on weed. They do things sometimes that hurt my feelings and I try to communicate but they don't listen just keep doing the same things. Basically we're a different points where we stand at mentally. I personally want to finish school and become a psychologist and just be a successful man, I communicate my dreams and goals all of the time but they don't they're just stuck in this small town selling and smoking weed. I could go on and on but really I just want to know am I the asshole for wanting to move on from these guys? \nIt's not like they've ever really done anything wrong but they're cancer to me mentally and career wise. It just sucks because I can not make friends to save my life so if I dump these guys I'll be the loneliest person alive. This was more of a rant than anything but I just want to know AITA for wanting to get rid of them? Even though they've done nothing wrong and have always kind of been there ",

      "description": "Alt, for reasons that will shortly be obviously. Given the context of what I was doing beforehand I expect to be judged, but I'm more interested in about what happened after.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I was playing an online sex based rpg (worthy of an r/confessions post in its own right). Game is simple in concept, make a character, find other people, invite them to your place, etc. After looking at a few people, I found a girl (female profile) who's profile said she was a guy in a bad marriage and wanted to be treated like a submissive girl.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I invite him to my place, and instead of doing the hankey-pankey, I just ask him if he wants to talk about his marriage situation. To make a long conversation short, he's stuck in a loveless marriage, he and his wife aren't sexually compatible, and she goes out for \"coffee\" at least once per day. He's a closet transsexual, he can't come out because he lives in a conservative eastern european village (no idea where exactly), and can't crossdress because his wife is unemployed and at home all the time (at least when she's not out for \"coffee\"). His town has no marriage councelling services or even normal therapy services available.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter listening to him for a while, I came to the (obvious) conclusion that his wife is the biggest burden in his life and one of the only things stopping him from being happy. I really hammered down the point of seing a therapist, but I think me mentionning divorce might have been a deal breaker. He thanked me after the conversation and left. I got no way to track him or know what happened.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid I just break some guy/girl's marriage over a sex-themed video game?",

Well, that one thing turned into lots of things.  My inbox blew up with information about her purchases.  Sometimes she accidentally used my credit card instead of hers, but she would always pay me back.  I figured everything was okay until she started returning things.  This shirt is the wrong color.  That rug doesn't match the living room.  Things like that.  I asked her repeatedly to please stop returning things, but every time she would threaten to cut off Netflix if I changed the password.  Finally, I got a warning about the amount of returns from my account.  So I changed the password.  I made sure she could still watch Prime Video, but she can't shop on my account.

      "description": "I had a lot of mental health issues that I was dealing with in middle and high school that I didn’t know were mental health issues. Mostly because people were too busy laughing at my crazy Facebook posts that were, in hindsight, obvious calls for help. Including some people who were supposed to be really good friends and could have definitely pulled me to the side and asked me if something was wrong or why I seemed so weird and manic on social media but I was never that way when we would hang out or chill. They even took steps to make life a little harder for me sometimes by telling me obvious lies about why no one in the entire friend group was trying to hang out some days(surprise, everyone thought I was an idiot and didn’t want me to come over so they could talk about how “crazy” my last Facebook post was)\n\nLong story short Ive been in the process of getting that help for a few years now and have since pretty much stayed away from social media in terms of interacting or commenting on people’s profiles and use it mostly to keep up with news (and memes). I also made new friends out of high school in college and feel like Im an overall more “stable” and “happy” person\n\nI also now find it kind of cruel and cringe a little whenever I see people shit on each other’s social media accounts because at the end of the day the very idea of having a social media account is a silly and vain concept to begin with. But that’s just my opinion.\n\nBut now whenever I see my “old friends” from Highschool, or pretty much anyone from Highschool, in public I act as if they don’t exist. If i’m being honest a good amount of this behavior is out of anger but a lot of it is just from a feeling of betrayal. I really thought these people cared about me and everything unfortunately points to the contrary. I feel like I was just a court jester to these people. A crying clown.\n\nTL;DR: I had “friends” and people in highschool who wouldn’t lift a finger to help me even though I was obviously showing signs of mental illness on social media for most of my early and late teens; now I pretend they don’t exist when I see them in public. I don’t know if i’m being an asshole for doing this",

They are just fake balloons and don’t feel anything like a real boob. Plus the scars. \nWe were having a discussion a month ago about it and she asked if I would find her just as attractive. I didn’t want to lie to her. I told her I would still love her but I wouldn’t find it a little unsettling. I didn’t want to lie to her and have her get a boob job only to come back not getting the smile she expected from me. \nMost of my friends acted surprised and told me fake “tits” are awesome.

AITA for thinking it's weird for her to miss work and wallow in all of this while I have to cover for her? It feels like she's making this death about herself instead of him.

      "description": "I recently went in for jaw surgery to correct an overbite and problems with my jaw. I had to stay overnight in the hospital then stay elevated in bed for awhile. It takes 3 weeks before you feel normal and 3 months before you can eat solid foods. \n\nI have to be fed everything through a syringe. Since I can't feel my mouth and both my lips are swollen, I can't feel where the syringe goes most of the time. I've gotten better at it self administrating but I still need my partner to help, especially with my pills.\n\nHe knew ahead of time the amount of work it would be and how long it would be. I told him I didn't want to feel like a burden (he has a habit of complaining any time I need help and going on about \"how much I owe him\" and I just didn't want to deal with that while I was healing). I made it really clear to him several times. He said he was offended I'd think that way about him.\n\nIt's been 6 days since I came out of surgery (5 since the hospital) and he's begun to complain about having to prepare my food for me. It's all canned soups and ensures - he just has to blend, heat and put in the syringe. I could do it by myself but it's hard to tell if it's too hot (I don't have much feeling) and I'm physically weak from losing weak and not getting enough nutrients. I do everything else by myself except my pills and food. I lose track of time on the medication in between sleeping so I asked him to track it.\n\nHe doesn't feel he should have to do anything that I could do myself. It would make it a lot harder for me, especially getting up from bed. It's not a lot of work for him. I usually eat 3 or 4 times a day and I try to get my water intake at the same time so he's not constantly having to do it.\n\nFor context, he's not working right now and I pay the bills in full. He hasn't worked for nearly a year. He doesn't do a lot of chores in the house and I make most of the food/meal prep. I've been working overtime for 3 months to afford everything (I bought a condo and he moved in).\n\nI feel like because he's not working and I'm not strong, he should be taking care of me. He doesn't feel like he should do anything now that I'm \"a little better\" and that I'm taking advantage of him. Am I??? ",

      "description": "I (45M) married my wife (45F) 18 years ago. We have to kids, one boy (15M) and one daughter (13F). We're both from UK.\n\nI met her when I was 18 years old. Now this backstory is really important. I come from a working class family and didn't have much, but due to outstanding grades I was able to go to University of Oxford, which for my family was amazing. It was a struggle though, because we didn't have much in terms of money. I considered myself grateful to god to be let in though (even though I believe I earned it). \n\nThat's when I met with my wife. I met her while at Oxford. We met in class and pretty much hit off right away. But I have to say, she was more in to me than I was to her. We began dating shortly after. I wasn't sure whether I 100% was in to her but I did like her a lot. \n\nShe was also...much richer than I. Her family was wealthy and they had connections. They accepted me very quickly so I kept dating her. After finishing at Oxford it didn't take long to find a job, we kept on dating and eventually after some years I popped the question. \n\nWe have kids, and we both have high paying jobs. I'm sure I would have had a high paying job even IF I didn't stay with her, due to the prestige of Oxford, however I have to be honest, the stability her family provided was a major reason why I stayed with her.\n\nI have NEVER told anyone that I've never truly ''loved'' her the way she does me until recently, I told my friend (also 45M) and he said it was pretty fucked up. I reasoned that circumstances were quite different because her stability was a reason for my deciding to be with her, I think you can't entirely remove that aspect. Needless to say, he was shocked.\n\nI have NEVER cheated on my wife ever. I've never been tempted to, but I guess I'm not ''in love'' with her the same way she was me. ",

      "description": "Here's some backstory, I'll make it concise, thank you so much for reading if you do!\n\nI am 18 and study abroad since the age of 12. Right now I finished high school (yay) and came to visit my family for the three months holidays, which I do every time I have holidays.\n\nMy family here is big - 13-yr-old sister, 10-yr-old brother and 1-yr-old brother, mum and stepdad, all living in a medium-sized apartment. My family there is basically my step-mum, friend, 17-yr-old sister and sometimes my dad (it's complicated, I know). We live in a fairly huge house, I have my own room and everything. Get a lot of alone time, which I love as an introvert. But it's also pretty emotionally sterile, which is kind of bad.\n\nI used to love coming here because I love this country and my family, but this time things are different. The 10-year-old brother is literally an uncontrollable disaster. He swears, steals a lot from my parents, doesn't listen, lies all the time, screams and refuses to do homework. I know this sounds like pretty un-serious stuff, but it really is to me. For example, he recently got caught trying to steal a roller-scooter, even a cop came down and everything. He drives everyone crazy.\n\nBecause of that the home environment consists of often loud fights, sometimes things get physical (even I find it hard to restrain myself), constant arguing and all of that. It's literally unbearable when he's home. Mum and stepdad lose their shit all the time. My sister somehow managed to ostracise herself, I honestly applaud her mental strength which I don't have it seems.\n\nI feel horrible all the time, this environment for me is unbearable. I want to leave so badly even though I really miss my family and this country and they miss me. But I just think being here is bad for me mentally (I've had issues involving self-harm and suicide, but it is mostly in the past). Despite all that I feel like a huuuuge asshole for leaving over this, because my family can't leave and has to deal with all that and I'm pretty much just getting out only caring about myself. \n\nYes, I want to help but I tried and nothing helps. Emotionally involving myself hurts even more, I feel responsibility for solving this even though it's not my responsibility and my parents' fault. \n\nSo yeah, I don't know what to do...\n\nThank you in advance for literally any feedback or advice! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

My thoughts are jumbled and there's a lot of backstory, so sorry. \n\nMy boyfriend of 5 years, we'll call him Kay, dumped me about two years ago after cheating on me for a month or so, I was crushed but he got over me very quickly. January 2018, he friends me on Discord and asks if I want to be friends and says that he misses me. I missed him a lot and still loved him so I enthusiastically agreed, kind of sort of hoping he'd been dumped or something and we could rekindle something. He hadn't been dumped but seemed to really enjoy having me around again, I'm generally very kind and supportive and he needed that at that point in his life I think. \n\nFastforward to November, my mother is in hospice after probably 4 or so years of stage 4 breast cancer. She was in home hospice for a while, but about midway through November she was moved to a hospice facility. My mother has been pretty much my best friend for my whole life, so obviously I'm not having a good time.\n\nOne night, Kay, unaware of my situation(I think, I don't remember clearly), messages me saying that he doesn't think his current girlfriend cares about him. I legitimately love and care for him, so I spend a few hours talking to him and going over the situation. I don't associate with his girlfriend, but I tell him it seems like he really loves her and he should try to talk it over with her instead of breaking up then and there, in spite of my wanting him back. \n\nHere's the inciting incident. He starts to tell me that he's sorry for the way he treated me when we were together. I wasn't perfect in our relationship by any means but I do believe he was worse in the end. Anyway, he says that if there's anything he can do to make it up to me he would promise to do his best to do it. At some point, I really forget this detail, but I told him my mother's situation. He swore up and down that he would be here for me whenever I needed him. He knew she wasn't doing well for a long time but it wasn't til this point that he knew she was basically gone mentally(Not sure if it's the drugs she's on or the brain tumors but she's gone). \n\nFor a couple of days, he would talk to me whenever I wanted and spend lots of time with me doing things we used to. I don't know if I did something or overstepped/got too close or what, but one day it seemed like he wanted nothing to do with me. I confronted him, because I'm quite closed off with most of my friends and I was quite desperate to be around someone who really knows me, which he does. \n\nMy interpretation of \"being there for me\" was to spend time with me, keep me company, talk to me, things like that. Not all the time but I didn't think every couple days or so was too much to ask. I'm not sure what his intention was in making this promise to me, I've asked him several times if he wanted to retract it, but he stands by his point of view that he has been here for me as much as he should be. \n\nI know that I'm very emotional in general, and especially now. I've had way too many talks about this with him because I can't just let it go. He'll still spend time with me occasionally but he seems completely emotionally closed off from me. \n\nAnyway, please don't feel sorry for me in judging whether or not I'm the ass hole here. I know I'm clingy and can be kind of controlling, but I legitimately don't know if my judgement of him being neglectful and callus toward me is clouded or if he just got bored of being around me again and won't just tell me and get it over with.\n\nTL;DR My ex-boyfriend promised to comfort me and keep me company while my mother is in hospice. He seemed to get bored of \"being there for me\" after a couple of days and will now barely talk to me. I confront him about it pretty frequently and I've been very vocal that I believe he's being neglectful and cruel toward me. ",

      "title": "AITA For not inviting every single family member or person people in my family wants me to invite to my wedding?",
      "description": "Here’s the deal. I’m getting married this year. I proposed this last September. We’ve got the ball rolling on stuff. Her dad is paying for it basically. We’re at the point of sending out invitations. There are some people in my family I’m not inviting for various reasons, and for the simple fact they have nothing to do with my life really. It’s already stirred up some drama with my grandmaw accusing my fiancé that she’s controlling who’s being invited and she’s inviting her family and not much of mine, which isn’t true. There’s several shitty people on her side we aren’t inviting and aren’t even allowed to come.\n\nMy grandmaw is pissy bc I’m not inviting all of her sisters and brothers and all of their people. Here’s the thing, half of her sisters and brothers are trashy with wild children they don’t discipline at all. And the majority of these people she’s wanting me to invite, I could count on my hand how many times I’ve had anything to do with them or even saw them in my life. It’s most people who - yeah they’re my family, but, if we saw one another in Walmart, we probably wouldn’t speak to one another. My grandmaw is really outspoken and gets offended about stuff like this, but I just don’t feel the need to invite people who will most likely come, eat and drink for free, then roll out and we never see or talk to each other again. \n\nMy dad made a list of people he’d like me to invite, and again, a lot of the people I haven’t seen in so damn long, people I don’t even know really, and people yet again have nothing to do with me. At all. He included people to invite from my maw maw’s side of the family, his dad’s, my aunt’s, and him personally. There’s SOME people on each I’ll invite, but a lot I literally scratched off. People that have nothing to do with me or I can go years and years and not see. Like one of the people he has on the list is my aunt’s husband’s dad. Who I never see. Ever. Maybe the occasional Christmas. Why does he need to come? He just has some people listed that have nothing to do with me at all and I don’t feel obliged to invite. \n\nAm I the asshole for not inviting all these people certain family members wish me to invite? The way I see it, when you get married, you’re inviting the people closest to you that you wanna share that special day with and no one else. Just bc you’re technically “family”, does it really mean you’re family, or you’re just related to me and I see you on the rare occasion? Just bc I’m getting married, it doesn’t mean every little family member has to be invited to my wedding. I’m inviting my immediate family obviously. Parents, their parents, my aunts and uncles, friends, close family friends. But once we start going way down the line here and there, to people I don’t even see or talk to, to people who couldn’t even tell you where my house is, I don’t see the point? My fiancé says she looks at it like your wedding is the one day you get to be a little selfish and do things the way you want, and invite who you want to invite, and if someone has a problem with it then that’s on them, and I agree.\n\nI just feel like some feelings are gonna get hurt, and I’m gonna be made out to be the asshole just bc I’m not inviting every single person in my family I’m related to. Then just last year or so, my sister got married to her husband and they basically eloped, went got married out of state in the snowy mountains, so if you wanted to attend her marriage you had to buy a plane ticket to and back, and pay for a place to sleep. No one even attended her wedding for that simple fact. But people seem to have a problem with me not inviting every single person to mine here. \n\nAny thoughts? ",

      "title": "AITA for hosting my daughter’s sweet 16 MY way?",
      "description": " My only child was born around the time of May that Memorial day falls. So, it’s become a tradition for me to host a large family gathering around that time, since the guests are off work. It’s nominally a birthday party. Some guests bring presents sometimes, sometimes not, and we have cake (*we* do, anyway, if my daughter does not eat it, that is her choice). But you could also call this party my yearly family reunion.\n\nThe problem is, ever since she was 11 years old, my daughter has been influenced into thinking she’s a vegan. As much as I persuade or sneak things past her, she hasn’t willingly used hide nor hair (ha!) of an animal for almost five years. Not even wool, which is really inconvenient for my shopping considering the fact that she grows like a weed.\n\nEvery year, she asks me to change the menu of her/my party to be meat free, milk free, and even egg free. In dramatic teenager fashion, “*I don’t want animals to be killed for my birthday*.” I tell her that she can’t control how other people eat. I’m obviously not going to look cheap to my family by serving them rice and beans. Nor will I be making alternative slop just so “she has something to eat.” There is plenty to eat, and it is gorgeous, she just chooses not to. Last year, she even did make a second cake out of pumpkin or some such. It looked ridiculous and went in the trash as soon as she’d cut a slice to eat with he rest of us. I am an excellent cook, and I like the table to look a certain way, especially when my *darling* sisters-in-law are here to nitpick.\n\nThis year, after the usual request to change the menu, my daughter “told” me that she won’t be attending her own birthday party. Instead, she’s going to meet friends at another girl’s house, where they will eat leaves and talk about her “mean mother” I’m sure. Ha! I told her she’s being ridiculous, that she’s not a real vegan anyway since I’ve been cooking the family’s rice in chicken broth for the past five years. (Rice is often the only thing on the dinner table she will eat, since she can’t see the meat.) In typical fashion, she cried and stopped responding.\n\nSo now I have a dilemma. I can’t exactly force her to stay and act convincingly happy, although she does know there will be consequences if she doesn’t.\n\nI can let her win this little power struggle and change the menu of the party. This will teach her that If she kicks her heels long enough, she can force other people to bend around her weird demands.\n\nOr I can host the party my way, and have my family awkwardly asking “Where’s the birthday girl?”\n\nI could re-brand the party as a family reunion, but there will be questions, and family has already asked me this year about “her birthday party.”\n\nI can't decide which option makes me look like more of a chump.

      "description": "I am the only tech savvy individual in a family full of people who are awful with tech yet depend on it for their livelihoods and leisure time.  I was always good with computers and such from a young age and after fixing things for a few family members word got out and I have spent the last 10 years as the IT guy for the family.\n\nMy problem isn't with being IT for the family.  My problem is with a lot of the family members that spend so much time on their devices yet refuse to learn or do even basic troubleshooting.  My mom and dad actually google issues when they come up and only after they have exhausted that route and checked cables and rebooted do they call me.  My aunts, uncles, and grandparents just seem to throw their hands up and admit defeat at the first sign of something not working just the way they are used to and start blowing up my phone for help.\n\nThis probably wouldn't be a big deal for me except they all have the same 6 or 7 problems over and over and they are super easy fixes.  I have shown them all how to fix these problems.  Hell I even gave them printouts of step by step directions on how to fix them, but they just ignore all that and call me to try and get me to come over and do it for them.\n\nAt this point it has gotten so bad that I just started ghosting them and making excuses not to go over just to avoid conflict as these older family members have a tendency to get dramatic when they are faced with any sort of conflict whatsoever.  I want to avoid it for my parents' sake, but I am losing patience.\n\nI was thinking about just texting all of them and explaining that I have done everything I can to help them fix these issues themselves and going forward it will be up to them to fix their own tech issues as I just don't have the time to be going over to their houses every week to fix things.  Though what I really want to text them is \"It is time for you stubborn old fucks to learn basic tech troubleshooting or start wasting your money at Best Buy because I am sick and tired of your proudly tech illiterate asses calling me up at all times of the night because you can't spam share your weird Trump memes for a few hours or something.\"  I think that one might be a bit too mean though.\n\nSo would I be the asshole here?  I feel like a dick because outside of this behavior and some past drama they really have been great supportive family to me, but them being so proudly tech illiterate and refusing to do basic steps for themselves is really just making me not even want to spend time with them because each visit will inevitably end with someone bringing me a phone or a laptop to fix while I'm there.

I also love my 12 year old pup just as much who without going into too much detail has been plagued with ill health recently causing me to play over $1500 just last year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiance really wants us to be married in the same church her parents got married, however the place over the years has grown very popular causing the price of the ceremony there to be well over budget. When I suggested we got married somewhere cheaper but still nice saying \"the place may not be where you wanted but it will still be special to us\" she began to cry before very aggressively suggesting I should \"let my damn dog die in peace\" to afford her dream wedding. Although I try to be discreet about the amount I spend on my dog she must have found out somehow and it will not get any cheaper soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly find her words very hurtful and what I thought was just a snarky remark said in the heat of the moment has since become the topic of many hostile debates. She can't see that I'm not choosing my dog over her but i'm creating a compromise so that my beloved pet can continue his happy life for as long as possible. He is not in any visible pain, just has seen better days and although I hate to make my fiance sad I will stand by my choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: AITA For not funding my fiancees \"dream wedding\" so I can afford the well being of my much loved dog?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Some backstory for this. A few months ago I had just started high school. My birthday always falls around a week after school starts so I invite my friends to my pool party. I also invite this girl. Let’s call her Junebug. I invite her because in my words to my friends, “Why the hell not?” \n\nShe, along with my friends, show up and the party goes well. It ends and we go out separate ways. \n\nFast forward about a week and a friend that I usually walk home with tells me, “Ayy yo, I heard that Junebug has the hots for you.” \n\nI’m between girlfriends at that time so I think ‘cool might as well shoot my shot if I know it’ll hit.’ \n\nI text her and say ‘hey [friend] told me that you liked me.’ She goes off on me spewing about how she’s taken and that I like her and that she’s been seeing it for a while now. \n\nTo me there are some girls who are legitimate love interests and there are girls who help pass the time. She was not the former, and being the asshole that I am, I let her know this. She got really hurt and was in the middle of a tirade when I just put my phone down for 5 minutes, picked it up and left her on read.\n\nI don’t do well with confrontation, which is why I was happy when she seemed to speak to me regularly when she would stay at a friend’s place which was in our neighborhood. I would never be the one to initiate, seeing as most afternoons I’m more focused on getting home so I can sleep/do my homework.\n\nAbout a week or two has passed since the last time we spoke, in the neighborhood or otherwise, and today I pass by her on the way to the buses and she says, “I guess BlackJesusKun don’t talk anymore.” To which I replied, “Guess I don’t.” \n\nShe looked really hurt and said in a really angry way , “Okay.” Now that I think back on it she was probably just trying to get me to talk to her, but that just isn’t the way you approach me. Not to mention that me and my current gf are going through some stuff and I’m low on patience for girls at this point. \n\nI spoke to the boys about it, but I need an unbiased opinion on this. AITA?\n\n\nTLDR: Girl I was formerly friends with made snarky comment towards me. I snapped back and apparently hurt her feelings. Not the first time this has happened.",

      "description": " \n\nMy best friend/roommate is getting married during the summer and asked me if I could play my instrument at her wedding. I was a little confused because I thought I was going to be a bridesmaid in her wedding party, so I would not be able to play. I asked her if it was the case that I was gonna be a bridesmaid and she essentially said no. Instead she has her sister, the groom’s sister, and the maid of honor.\n\nI believed that her sister would be maid of honor, since they’re pretty close. I thought would at least get to be a bridesmaid since she has always told me I would be part of her wedding party ever since we got close. She then said “I would love for you to be part of my wedding and play while I walk down the aisle”.\n\nSo, I said I would get back to her about it because I was definitely on the fence about doing it, since it would be for no pay. I usually get paid for playing at weddings since I have been doing it since high school. I brought up the fact that I usually get paid for my time to her since I would have to find the music, and put in time for practicing. She thought that I would do it for free for her since we are “best friends”. \n\nSo I decided to decline, saying I would like to just be a guest. She got upset and said she really wanted live music while she was walking down the aisle and that I was lashing out because I’m not a bridesmaid. She also said that I was being greedy with asking her for money. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here?",

      "title": "AITA for using the bathroom together with my boyfriend despite our roommate asking us not to because it makes her uncomfortable?",
      "description": "Ok, this one is actually hard for me. Usually I can step back and gauge by wondering what I would say if someone else told me this story... but it’s not black and white, which has me torn. \nThere are a few factors that make me feel she should deal with it, but I also feel maybe I’m an asshole because those factors don’t mean I automatically get my way. I’ll detail them and let you decide.\n\n\nI’ll try and speed the story up but it’s a bit long.\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I were moving. We found a roommate on Craigslist and he and I secured a place a month before she moved in. We didn’t mind paying the first months rent alone since we didn’t want to lose the place and she dropped the bomb that she actually wouldn’t be able to move out until the NEXT month. \nAnd because there are two of us AND we located the space, did the walk through, and met with the landlords all alone because she couldn’t/didn’t want to attend, we assumed the bigger bedroom would go to us. \nWe figured fair price for $1,750 in rent. We even texted her about it to avoid surprises or unilateral decisions. She agreed.\n\nSo the first month we move in, and try to leave tons of space for her to make her own around the house, like in the living room, bathroom, and kitchen. She still makes a few comments about where to put her things. I enthusiastically tell her I’ll move or put ANYTHING away to make room if there’s a specific spot she wants to put something - this is all our home and we should all have a touch of ourselves. I do a few things she’d like but I still feel like she’s not excited to see I have things places, even though she didn’t really bring much to switch out anyway.\n\nNext month she appears to fully live with us and it seems pretty good. Except I feel a bit of resentment on her end. She expresses that we should not have taken the big room now that she’s spent more time in the place and compared them. It’s not fair we have a closet (only thing that makes it bigger, by the way) and she does not. She even goes as far as to hint that to make it fair WE should help pay for her a closet or pick up another expense in the house to even it out. Keep in mind I furnished the whole place by myself since she had nothing to contribute. Not happening. \n\n\nWe mend fences and continue living peacefully until one day boyfriend and I go to shower together. Now, I cannot stress enough that this is NOT sexual. (Seriously, some people enjoy shower sex but it just doesn’t work for us or appeal) We don’t fool around, we rarely even wash each other. For some reason we just really enjoy showering together and have done it often since we’ve been dating. It’s our time to unwind and talk about work and wash away the stress of the day. Then we brush our teeth together, get into pjs and head to bed. \nWe never assumed it would make her uncomfortable, which maybe we should have. We had done it loads in the house before she arrived and I even naively thought it was considerate because the bathroom is taken over for 1/2 the time. We don’t go slow, we do our business and get out.\n\nExcept when we walk out of the bathroom together, towel drying our hair in fresh PJs, she’s standing by her door with a shocked expression. I’m kinda confused but smile and say hey, “bathroom is free. Sorry if we took too long, should be lots of hot water, though! Didn’t use much!”\nFigured she wanted it or something? \n\nA day goes by and she’s super weird and moody. Finally I get a scathing text from her. Gist of it being;\n\n“Heyy just wanted to talk about last night. That was kinda super inappropriate and honestly really disrespectful. I was in the house while you did that.” \n\nNow I’m even more confused. Did what? And if “that” means sex (which we did have later that night. Quietly with a fan on juuuust in case, I may add) then I am allowed when she’s home, as she’ll always be home. She lives here. As do I. I can bang my boyfriend of 5 years. \n\nSo I cautiously text back, “sorry? Did you hear something last night or something? Oh man, I’m embarrassed. Really sorry about that.” \n\n“It’s not that I heard something, it’s just that it’s super rude to be using a shared space for that.” \n\nEVEN MORE CONFUSED. Eventually it comes out that she thinks we banged in the shower. I’m all apologetic, explain to her we absolutely would never do that, I’m sorry if we made her uncomfortable. Now at this point we’ve had girl talk about our boyfriends over glasses of wine a few times. We both know a few dirty details so I’m also a bit stumped because she’s told me a few lewd stories I would say are taken to the extreme with her bf in shared spaces, so even if we DID it appears hypocritical. \n\nShe then states she doesn’t *care* if we’re not having sex. It makes her uncomfortable for both of us to shower together. She shouldn’t have to think about it or wonder if we *are* while she’s in the house. Ok, fricken weird but guess we have to make compromises? \n\n\nSo we stop showering together. We go one by one. And when the first one is out, I or boyfriend will come in the bathroom to brush our teeth together and then the next one jumps in and the first leaves. She noticed that too and complained. Apparently we just shouldn’t be in the bathroom together at *all*, it’s weird. She tries to compare it to how weirded out would I be if she told me her and her boyfriend pee together. I laugh and say, “I wouldn’t? Boyfriend and I have tons of times?” \nWe’re basically an old married couple. Maybe not all couples feel that’s comfortable or needed, but one of us has peed while the other brushes their teeth or showers tooooons of times in our relationship. \nShe looks at me disgusted and says that’s not ok in a shared house. Now she’s pissing me off. \n\nSo to skip forward we just start showering when she’s away or at work. We don’t want to give up our bonding time. We try and make sure we’re out at least an hour before she’s expected to avoid any overlap or making her uncomfortable.\n\nI should also note that it’s been about 8-9 months of living together at this point, and boyfriend and I have done 98% of the cleaning. She leaves mouldy crap everywhere, has done three HALF loads of dishes total, never touched a broom or mop, never contributes to shared expenses like toilet paper or soap, never taken garbage out or dealt with recycling, and is just downright entitled in every sense. Even hinted that because there are two of us then we should take care of it. She’s just one person. \n\nNot how life works. Especially when rent is shared 3 ways. If we’re lumping us together as one unit, maybe we should split it in half, hm? At this point we’re kinda done with her because of a bunch of other things that would make this already long story much, much longer. But we cannot afford the rent alone. It’s a really high cost of living area and it would eat way too much of our income.\nAnd, since we’re all on the lease, it’s not like we can just kick her out if we found someone better.\n\nSo I’m getting resentful, and I feel like if I’m doing all the cleaning, all the shared shopping, and being treated as though my existence is an inconvenience (don’t get me started on all the rules she’s tried to implement which basically amount to us never being seen when she’s out of her room), then I’m going to shower with my boyfriend. \n\nSo we continue on this way and all is well, until one day she comes home early just as we’re leaving the bathroom together, drying our hair once again. I didn’t see her, but I heard the front door slam and she was gone. An hour later we get a huge text about how we are incredibly inconsiderate and hostile, that we make her uncomfortable in her own home, that she shouldn’t be weirded out to use her own bathroom. Basically alludes that we’re making the space an unliveable environment for her and if we cannot respect her feelings then perhaps we should pay to break the lease and leave. I’m over it. I won’t be doing that. \n\nThis is the girl who has screaming matches with her boyfriend on the regular, but *she* feels uncomfortable in her own home because we used the shower together? Grow up. \n\n\nBut maybe I’m wrong. Maybe it is my duty to alleviate any uncomfortable feelings in the home. Maybe I should respect her wishes since we share the space. \nMaybe I am a hypocrite because I absolutely would cease shared bathroom use if it meant sex, but I don’t feel I should have to because we aren’t boning. What’s the difference, right? \n\nSo how I see it is; \n\nWe pay the most money in the house for shared expenses.\n \nWe do all the cleaning.\n\nWe cook the most meals to share. \n\nIt’s all my furniture and electronics she uses. \n\nI deal with the recycling and pay to have garbage taken away out of my own pocket. \n\nI set up defences to prevent her from hearing us even talk basically ever. \n\nI try and abide by many outlandish rules just to keep the peace and make her feel like it’s her house, too.\n\nI deal with her toxic relationship with her boyfriend that she continually leaves then takes back at the inconvenience of *our* peace despite numerous talks and promises that they’ll stop. \n\n\nAnd I can’t shower with my boyfriend? A small luxury I look forward to when I’ve had a hard day? Even when she isn’t home???\n\n\nBut maybe *I’M* entitled because I chose to adhere to those extreme standards on my shoulders, that doesn’t me I *deserve* to make her uncomfortable as it’s her home, too.  But I’m also willing to die on this hill. I’ll refrain from ever helping her again. I’ll let those mouldy dishes in the fridge come to life before I dare put myself out to keep the peace ever again.\n\n\nGive it to me straight. I’m the asshole, aren’t I?\n \n\n\n",

And that little brat was pouring my cereal in the sink. And said that he needed a bowl because all the nice bowls were in the dish washer. And i got Pissed and said \"you cant just take my cereal!\" And i tried grabbing the bowl back and he Was all like yes i can and starting trying to attack me so I'm like whatever because you know what happens when i fight my little brother when I'm supposed to be watching him. And so still Pissed because that was all the last of the captain crunch but he doesn't even like captain crunch. And so he fills the bowl with kix and goes back to his room and stick his dang tongue out at me. And like 20 minutes later I was walking to go in my room and I hear that he is talking and playing online on his Xbox with his crush. So i walked in a yelled WHY ARE YOU PLAYING ON YOUR XBOX WITH JUST YOUR UNDERWEAR ON?WHERE ARE YOU CLOTHES? And he looked at me like he was going to kill me. And well i was thinking well maybe next time he won't take my cereal. But now I'm thinking AITA? ",

      "description": "I have this friend from high school. We were pretty close back then, but his adult life has always been kind of a train wreck. He joined the army out of high school, got kicked out for drugs, has since been arrested numerous times for shoplifting, assault/battery, DUI, and I'm pretty sure he has warrants out for his arrest. He's pretty much destroyed his relationship with his family due to his addiction and mental illness.\n\nAbout five years ago, we started hanging out again for the first time in years. Pretty soon, he began calling me all the time, randomly showing up to my house and workplace unannounced, just generally bugging and harassing me. Admittedly, I did ignore a lot of his calls... mainly because they were at random hours when I was busy, and it was always him just demanding that we hang out. So after a week or two of this, I kinda flipped out and told him to fuck off. We spoke one more time, I apologized for being so harsh, but explained that I just didn't have the time or desire to hang out with him that often.\n\nFast forward to last week. I get a call from a random number. I answer and it's him, we chat for a while just catching up. From the sound of it, he's a full blown alcoholic now. He wanted to hang out, but I told him honestly that all of my time is taken up by the business I started last year. I told him it was nice to catch up, maybe some time when I'm free we can hang out, but it will probably be a while.\n\nSince then he's called me 3 times and I haven't answered. I get the feeling he's gonna start randomly showing up again. I don't know what to tell him. It's not that I hate him or anything, it's just that I have a very busy life and I don't really \"hang out\" with anyone these days. I guess if I'm being completely honest, he kind of makes me uncomfortable. He's very immature, impulsive, and it just takes a lot of energy to be around him. He clearly needs to get some help, but I don't know how to do that. His family have tried their best to help him over the years, but it never works.\n\nAt this point, it feels more like a burden than a friendship. We have nothing in common anymore... I'm a college graduate running my own business, and he's a total mess. I don't mean to sound condescending, it's just that our general mental states and lifestyles are so completely different. I feel bad for him, but I also feel that it's not my responsibility to be his best friend. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So some context here. Before we got married I expressed my concerns about this topic, he told me that “our family came first”. Then my husband didn’t had a job for a year and two months, we adjusted all our expenses to my salary. We found out we were expecting and he started a business this week, we used our savings to buy what he needed , apparently it is going well but there will be times when he will receive nothing (it’s a food business in a public school, so it is empty during  vacation and national holidays). It’s just been one week (less 4 days!) of him earning and he asked if he could give his mom some money, I asked how much he was talking about, and after he told me about his minimum sales goal a month, what he plans to give his mom is annually about 15+% of his projected* anual earnings. I was livid. His mom is in her 50s. She doesn’t work and is given some money from FIL (they are divorced), her financial situation is not the best, but she has no rent/mortgage payments and owns her apartment. My BIL lives with her and he’s studying a masters in chemistry, apparently he doesn’t contribute much, I don’t really know. They don’t struggle with basics and there’s always money for her cigarettes. She doesn’t have anything health wise that stops her from working.\nI thought that in the future we will have to support his mom, but I was thinking when she is 70 and couldn’t work, not now. Or that we should wait to be in a better economic position to help or reduce that amount to 5%. I feel that this expense will slow us down a lot and it could add 3-4 years to the whole “buying a house” situation (we have no house or apartment of our own, we rent) and we’re going to become parents soon and that 15% could go to savings for a house, health insurance, or the car payments we need (he has no car and I’ve been driving him around, and trying to fit all his business related shopping into my tiny Nissan march and going to my job). AITA for not wanting to give a monthly sum to my MIL and would rather use that money for us to grow faster?",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo my full-time roommate is working abroad for the next 4 months, and he was nice enough to provide me with a new roommate in the interim via Craigslist. \n\nWe're about two months in now, and while she was pretty easy to live with at first (ti's just the two of us), she's recently met a strapping young man we'll call Steve that's slept over every night for the past three weeks. EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, last week my roommate informed me that she would be leaving town for the weekend to go visit her parents. Hooray, I think to myself, no roommate + Steve for an entire 48 hours! \n\nFast forward to late Friday night -- I've just come home from the bar and am relaxing on the couch, eating cereal and watching Top Chef, when I hear the unmistakable sound of shuffling feet coming from my roommate's bedroom. Now, seeing as its 2am and I was under the impression that I was home alone, I immediately go into irrational panic mode and grab a hockey stick before yelling \"Is anybody in here?\"  No answer. \n\nI ask again, almost yelling now, \"Is anybody in here?\" No answer. Not quite satisfied, I open the door to my roommate's room to find Steve! He was tucked into her bed, pretending to be asleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLivid, I \"wake\" him up and demand that he leave. He argues that my roommate said he could stay there, and it's none of my business if she lets him sleep in HER room. I counter that no one asked me if this was okay in advance (I would have said fuck no), I don't feel comfortable with him here, and he needs to gtfo. He then starts begging me to stay, giving me a sob story of how he has nowhere else to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's when I threaten to call the police, and he leaves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe aftermath has been pretty ridiculous. My roommate is very upset, and says that me kicking her bf out onto the street at 2am is an act of \"pure evil.\" I think that her sneaking her bf into the apartment while she's out of town is grounds for terminating her sublease. My real roommate, who's currently in Europe, is being weird about taking sides, and I think it's because he doesn't want to lose a subletter and be on the hook to find another while he's abroad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, humans of Reddit, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR -- roommate lets her bf stay in her room while she's out of town without telling me. I find him at 2am and kick him out, even though he says he has nowhere else to go.",

But the thing is, they actually try to be nice/love me. \nThere's only 4 of us on the one Continent and they don't have many close friends so my parents have always gone on about looking after each other. But the only feelings I really have towards them are anxiety and guilt.\n\nThey are both abusive towards each other but at the moment it's a lot better than it was.\nSince I was 5 I was told things like \"I gave birth to you, I'll be the one to kill you\" for really small things like when they found out my teacher had told me off for talking in class. They made highschool a living hell because they never believed I was trying hard enough (almost all my grades were a b+ or above) and on some occasions would do things like throw my books into my face or continually call my friends sluts and idiots (my friends were literally the smartest people and for the most part well behaved) and call me during the day to tell me off and they'd also send me texts saying how disappointed they were. I didn't have a social life.\n\nBeing around them just makes me feel really anxious and I can't criticise what they do because they end up blowing up and yelling for hours.\n\nI got diagnosed with clinical depression a while back and am also in the process of being diagnosed with ADHD and ASD.\n\nMy sibling is also dealing with some intense mental health stuff and my parents want me to spend as much time with them as I can because she seems to get better but she is also emotionally abusive at times.\n\nBut at the same time:\n- both of them work constantly so that they can support me and my sibling\n- they are always willing to spend money on us and buy us gifts\n- they go out of their way to make/buy food we like\n- are paying for therapy \n- want to spend time with me.\n- my sibling did their best to look after me and be there for me for most of my life\n\nAnd they seem to genuinely think they love me.  \n\nI don't hate them, but if I could, I would never see/speak to them again.

      "description": "Posted from an alternate account, small details changed.\n\nBackground: my aunt is the last living sibling of my grandfather. My aunt never married or had children of her own. She went to church, worked full time, and retired after 50+ years. She is elderly now, but healthy. After her own mother died (the original owner of home), it was willed to my aunt and her three sisters. As her sisters passed away over the years, they would leave their share of the house to the other sisters. She is now the sole owner of the home. \n\nWhen I was a child, I was passed around a lot. Parents were divorced, and my dad had weekends, but he was a taxi driver and had to work weekends. My aunt was my primary caretaker when my father was at work and whenever my mother would fall off the deep end (often). My aunt, with the financial contributions of my wonderful and hard-working father, bought me all my school clothes, made sure I had money for school pictures and lunch, took me to whatever sports and games I had and paid for all of that, got me haircuts, etc. (Essentially, he paid her child support, because my mother could not be trusted with money.) I could go on, but my point is that she’s always been more of my mom than my own mom. Instead of letting me go into foster care as a teenager after my father died and my mothers mental health took a real dark turn, she took me in for months until my mother could get her shit together enough to be a passable parent again. My point is, I love this woman, and she loves me, and after all she has given me, I am wary of asking her for anything else. The most I ask her for now is to watch my kids while I go get milk. \n\nHere’s the thing: I’m looking at inheriting what will (probably) be a significant amount of money, which isn’t that important to me. She has invested wisely over the course of her life, and done very well. What happens to the house is anyone’s guess: I’m going to assume I will have to sell it and divide the money appropriately. What I want, more than anything, is to have one tangible piece of my childhood. I want to grow old in that house, with some plants and a cat and my husband. I want roots. I want my children’s children to be able to climb the oak tree in her backyard. \n\nWIBTA if I asked to buy the house from the estate? I don’t want to ask for it outright, I don’t want to be manipulative, and I definitely don’t want to have to fight with strangers over the home that I spent the majority of my childhood in. Do I even have to ask her? I do NOT want to offend the woman who has given me so much, especially in the twilight of her life. Her happiness means more to me than a house. ",

      "description": "Bit of back story. I have quite a lot of spots on my back. I have been to the doctors for it before, but have not been given anything for it. Also, my Dad works away most of the time, so when he gets back from work, its after a while of not seeing the family.\n\nHere's what happened. I was going downstairs to the kitchen to get a drink at about 8/8:30 pm without a top on,as I was getting ready for a night of browsing Reddit. My Dad had just got back from work and made a comment along the lines of: 'You really need to go to the Doctors for that', referring to my back. Both of my parents are always making comments on it so I just reply: 'Naah its fine'. \n\nThis proceeded to cause a shouting match where my parents were yelling that it will put me in the hospital if I don't get it checked out. I always responded saying 'No, it won't'.\n\nEvery time me and my parents get into arguments, they try and shut me down by saying that 'You don't know anything' and 'You think you know everything remarks'. This time I responded to the shouting by shouting back saying: 'Well yous don't know either'. Bad move.\n\nMy Dad proceeded to get in my face and say: 'You know what, just fuck off to your Nanas house'. I called his bluff and packed my bag since he has things in the same vein before. As I walked through the living room to put on my shoes and leave, he shouted that: 'I have to stay the fuck in the house'. At this point I really could not be arsed with it, as I would have probably just went back to my room if they wanted to talk it out.\n\nAfter I left, I realised I made a mistake by leaving, but couldn't go back because I am too stubborn. So I called a friend and asked if he wanted to go get food or just drive around. I then called my Mam to tell here I would be back.\n\nAbout an hour later, I check my phone to see it flooded with messages and missed calls. I texted her and told her ill come home later.\n\nI let time slip and just got in now (at 1 am ish) and was welcomed with more shouting and threats of no phone.\n\nI am 19 and I will be moving out of their house in July, but she said she wont sign the paperwork.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I The Asshole for actually leaving and not coming in for hours, even though I was basically kicked out?",

      "description": "AITA because In high school I had a group of 3-4 close friends, we would hang out about once a week. I always felt like we were all relatively close. I’m 18f and there was C (19m) F (18f) and J(18f) we were good friends and never really fell out. Though I always felt like the odd one out as I was always the one taking photos of them, being the awkward one that walked behind when the pavement was too small ect. \nI began to realise a change in my mental health. I felt like everyone hated me and so I’d hide myself away at parties, occasionally hurting myself but not in a place that they could not see. I became less fun to be around. \nOne pivotal moment was going to a festival with them. I wanted to go but couldn’t afford it which was fair enough. Later, C said he wanted to go with F&amp;J but couldn’t afford it. J then began to say she would buy his ticket, that he can pay her back over time and that she just really wanted him to be there. I wasn’t fussed about being paid for, it was mostly that they obviously wanted C there more than me. I had asked before to F when I had the money, she was hesitant to confirm that I could come.\nI began therapy and realised I have anxiety which was why I wasn’t really fun anymore. I explained to them all that it wasn’t their fault I was reserved sometimes, it was just my mental health.\nI got to go to the festival because J’s boyfriend broke up with her so there was a ticket spare that I bought from her after having money. At one point when we were there and drunk, j says to me “you are only here because [her bf] couldn’t make it”.\n\nNow we all moved out to a big city, about 10 minutes away from each other. Other than F who moved to England. J&amp;C and some other close friends would go out every night to clubs and never invited me. I asked J once and she said maybe then never got back to me. The one time I did see J she said “you must be lonely” because she knows I struggle to make friends. And I don’t go to their uni or live in their halls.\n\nIt’s been 6 months since I’ve heard from them. And we all go back to our hometown in the summer and idk what I would do if I saw them again. \n\nAITA or the reason I haven’t seen them?",

      "description": "A small background, I live with 4 other guys - we all go to the same uni and we're all friends.\n\n4 of us are quite tidy. Sure, we make a mess, but we always clean it up within the day. We prefer to live in a clean environment and while none of us are clean freaks by any extent, we try to be considerate of the others.\n\nHowever, \"Ben\" as I'll call him, doesn't follow this ethos. If he cooks food, he leaves dishes in the sink for days (I used to clean up when the dishes started to smell, but I've recently started to refuse to clean up after him as I'm not his carer), he leaves empty glasses all over the house (or hoards them in his room) and otherwise causes quite a lot of mess.\n\nI (and the other housemates) called him out, we in particular have problems with the leaving of dirty dishes all over the kitchen as it is literally a health risk to have rotting food in the sink and we told him in no uncertain terms that it wasn't acceptable to keep doing this. \n\nHe and his girlfriend (pretty much lives here rent free) were slightly better for a few weeks, but they've fallen back into creating mess and refusing to properly clean up again.\n\nWhen he was told that we wanted him to be cleaner, his counter arguments were as follows:\n\n1. We live in a student house, they're naturally messy - we're being unreasonable by wanting it to be clean \n\nThis makes no sense to me, as while I'm aware that some students are absolute animals, that doesn't mean we should live in filth.\n\n2. He won't handwash his dishes (he \"hates scrubbing\"), if we want him to clean them properly we need to get \"stronger dishwashing tablets\" which will clean off dried food when he puts them in the dishwasher.\n\n3. We should be thankful that his girlfriend helps with the dishes at all (she occasionally puts THEIR dishes in the dishwasher after the food has already dried, so most dishes don't get cleaned).\n\n\n\nWould I be the asshole for bringing this old argument up again? It deeply bothers me because I'm naturally very clean in the kitchen, and I despise the smell of the food which gets left in there. \n\n",

I live with my dad and my 3 other siblings who are 14, 10 and 6, mum and other sibling are out of the picture at the moment. This problem's been going on for the past two years, since we started living in a new place. My family are filthy, they leave shit around the house, they don't wash their own dishes and leave the place looking disgusting. I keep my room tidy and clean up after myself, I know how this sounds and that's where the problem lies. Dad doesn't work and is home most days, but the place still stays filthy. I'm aware the situation is hard for him and i try to be supportive, but i get pissed off about constantly living in mess, which pisses him off since he doesn't like being nagged about it. Sometimes he'll even leave with the siblings (sometimes to do some work) to another state, leaving me alone in the house which i end up needing to clean. Am i the asshole for being bothered about this?",

      "description": " \n\nLTL, FTP, Etc.\n\nSo, a little bit of backstory. I've been home-schooled for my entire life, and am currently working on passing the SATs. Several years ago my mother enrolled me in a private class with a professor of chemistry who also had worked as a science teacher in a high-school before. So, as expected, the students enrolled in my class are not going to be your typical high-schoolers (I don't mean that in a bad way, I just noticed that they act a little different than my friends who went to high-school, as well as the fact that there are slightly older people in the class as well).\n\nSorry for all the useless information, I just want everyone to have all the info here. Anyways, on to the actual story:\n\nThere's been a classmate of mine for my past two years of school who i'm pretty concerned about. We'll call him T. T is known in my class for a number of things, few of which are normal, none of which are good memories. The first thing I can remember of him is when he first found out one of my friends was Jewish, and went on a tirade of Hitler jokes and Holocaust references. Some of his other highlights include:\n\n* Throwing a film canister filled with vinegar and baking soda at my table. (And no, it wasn't for *that* experiment.)\n* Saying \"Honestly, he's just a Rartyfag. Just like (My name) here.\" as I was passing him and his friend walking to my car.\n* Showing up to class several times in a full trench coat and fedora in the middle of the Texas summer.\n* Keeping homemade knives in said trench coat and showing them off in class. He also showed up with a balisong one time, which are illegal unless they are under a certain length, and this one was pushing it.\n* Showing up to class several times in a red white and blue leather biker's jacket.\n* Showing up to class several time in a MAGA hat to annoy any liberal people at the class. (He admitted to this, calling them libtards.)\n* Un-ironically asking \"Is that supposed to be a joke?\" After a 45 minute lecture about identifying different orbitals. He got really upset when told to take the class a little more seriously.\n* Refusing to take any notes, or do any homework for that matter.\n\nAfter nearly two consecutive years of class with him, I've begun to assemble a mental picture of his habits, and I feel bad about my result. I have the sneaking suspicion that T is either High-functionally autistic, or has a similar affliction (I never researched anything just because I don't want to give the thought any room to grow.). Am I wrong for letting myself think that? Is he just a normal Teenager? If he suffers from a mental illness, should I approach the situation differently? My current course of action has just been to ignore his existence entirely. And to be clear, I've never brought this up with him, but I've told friends about my thoughts, and they think i'm wrong.",

      "description": "I have nothing against dogs, I have had a dog before and other assorted pets. I have been dating a girl now for about two years, we recently moved in with one another and I have known her for a long time. About a year before I met her she adopted two dogs. Both are pitbull mixes and male, one looks more like a lab and the other is more like a bulldog; we'll call them dog A and dog B. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDog a is about 4-5 years old and is fixed. He is more cat than he is dog. He doesn't growl or bark unless there's some unknown being approaching our front door. He will sleep 24 hours a day if you let him. It took several months for this dog to warm up to me. At first he just ignored my presence until I think he realized I also live in this house and are not going anywhere. Now he jumps and wags and patty pats when I'm around and I love it. He's a low maintenance dog and requires the bare minimum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDog b is a lot different. This one my girlfriend says she found when he was just a puppy though I'm not sure how young a puppy. He is not fixed and will growl and bark at anything. Admittedly, he is well-behaved and knows a handful of commands, doesn't fuck shit up in the house, etc. However, this dog is fucking scared of everything. Any sudden or loud movement sends him scattering. If I put down a cup too loudly on the table he runs for his life. If you look at him directly in the eyes for too long he starts shaking. Walk too quickly towards him (such as when I am trying to put his collar on him) and he'll roll over onto his back submissively and you need to physically move him out of that position. I have never met a dog who is so much of a pussy it is unbelievable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDog A has recently become my favorite but dog B is my girlfriend's and my in-laws pride and joy for reasons unbeknownst to me. It's gotten to the point where I have to force myself to interact positively with dog B instead of just ignoring him. It just seems like so much of a CHORE to do anything with dog B that there seems to be no joy in it. The girlfriend has noticed the difference in my behavior towards these dogs and it clearly upsets her but I am not doing anything on purpose. Am I being the asshole here?",

There was water damage to his house requiring him to replace some furniture and drywall. While staying with us he offered to help with the utilities as he couldn’t do much more.\nLiving in close quarters put a strain on our friendship and as they treated our house poorly by marking up the walls, breaking blinds, tearing out closet shelves, leaving the bathroom dirty, ruining the toilet seat cover and other things. \n\nThey treated our food and other household supplies as theirs, often without telling us that they had. \n\nTowards the end of the four months we talked about paying some form of rent and he agreed we would work out a reasonable amount. We discussed  approximately $400 a month minus what he paid in utilities already.\n\nAfter a year of delaying, falling through on \npayment plan, and asking for more time to repay he has completed his home renovations and major upgrades and listed his house on the market. That was 3 months ago. \nHe and his wife make more than double the income than we do. Now his wife is telling him that if roles were switched they wouldn’t even ask us for money for rent. Despite the fact that few years back we stayed with them for a few months while looking for a home and paid a fair rent. \n\nAITA for expecting any rent?

She had a retirement fund that after splitting, before taxes, each of us will get around $53k. Two years ago her house appraised for $65k and my brothers thought there was at least $22k left on the mortgage it and had no interest in moving in or buying the property so it was verbally agreed I would buy and live in the house from the estate. We recently found out that there was only $12k left on the house so now my brothers want me to give each of them $5k from my portion to make up the difference. I know I am getting a really good deal on a house but we live in one of the poorest counties in Illinois where one out of every five houses is for sale and is on the market for an average of three years. So it's not like I'm flipping this property and pulling a fast one on my brothers, in fact, I'm going to need to do foundation work, put on a new roof, install new windows, and do several other pricey renovations to the property.  \nSo am I the asshole for being reluctant to pay my brothers extra money because a previously thought property price was incorrect?",

I'm a guy, and girls I knew had at least 10x more freedom than I did. It was humiliating. My mom never spoke up despite my constant pleas. The same thing happened once to my mom, and she created a ruckus. I was always obese, and whenever I tried to lose weight my mother never accepted it. Later she blamed me for being fat and not exercising.\n\nAll this upbringing has led me to be socially awkward, extremely ill-tempered, and even gotten me depression and anxiety.\n\nNow when I bring this stuff up to my mom and get mad at her, she simply says \"It wasn't under my control, what could I do? I'm the DIL and I have to listen to them\". She always defends herself no matter what. It makes me so mad and I fire at her constantly. I just can't help it.

Then how to roast a gammon to keep it fresh and moist, which she just nodded along to.\n\n\n\nLater in the day my partner came to me asking what I said to his mum. She told him she was massively offended, that I was slagging off her food and she was crying saying she thought she ruined Christmas for everyone. \n\n\n\nI tried to ask her if she’s ok, and she kept saying “next time I’ll make the meat extra WET!! I didn’t know people wanted it WET!!” And was crying saying we wouldn’t be coming over again for years.\n\n\n\nNow my partner, his brother, his mum and stepdad are all acting weird with me, but when we were eating I said the food was delicious.

      "description": "This is kind of out there so sorry in advance. Also I’m on mobile so apologies on that\n\nTo start things off, I’m a female who does cosplay as a hobby. So I make my own costumes and go to comic cons, my friends do as well though they’re newer at the dressing up aspect and I’ve tried my best to show them the ropes, they seem to really enjoy it and I’m very glad to share something I’m passionate about with them. \n\nThe three of us as a group decided we wanted to do a “sexy” group cosplay. I don’t want to give away too much but it was leotards and tights pretty much. We all took pictures together in poses ranging from funny to promiscuous so we could post them on our own accounts. Before every photo I posted I asked for permission to post and sent them the picture asking if I needed to change anything. They gave me their consent and the picture I posted was of us all having our backs to the camera and smiling (butt pic, it was a gratuitous group butt pic lol) \n\nOne of the comments I got was something along the lines of “happy hump day to me lol” I saw it as funny and liked it. My friends saw it as “disgusting and disrespectful” and asked me to delete it. I said that the comment really wasn’t that bad and made me laugh. And that I wouldn’t want to start unnecessary drama, considering how much grossness can be in the cosplay community, I don’t want to make something out of nothing. \n\nThey both blew up at me, with one commenting under my picture how inappropriate and awful that comment was I ended up replying that I thought it was very “cheeky” of them to try and defuse the situation and because I was sitting on that pun for a good hour. It didn’t work and I ended up deleting both the “hump day” comment and hers and mine because I didn’t want to escalate the situation anymore then it already was. \n\nThen I tried to explain that they both should expect comments like that when we purposely pose and give consent for it to be posted on a public forum like my profile. With one of my friends texted me that she “doesn’t take pictures to be disrespected.” And that I’m not taking her feelings into account and don’t care about her. I responded that I do care and I don’t take pictures to be disrespected either, I’m proud of my costumes I make and the effort I put into it and my body. \n\nAs of now, I’ve talked to one friend and she seems to be okay and can see my point of view at least a little. My profile is more cosplay orientated so I have a bit more of a following and have gotten many of the token shitty sexist comments that I block and delete. I don’t know if I’m in the wrong for saying no to deleting a comment they didn’t like on my profile and then making a dumb pun. I know the picture has all of us in it, but I asked for permission to post and it was a butt pic, so I thought they’d expect that people would comment on the butts. \n\nTl;dr: posted a sexy cosplay picture of me and my friends I had consent to post. Friends felt disrespected when someone commented on the sexiness and felt like I handled their feelings on it the wrong way. ",

I told Adam a lot of stuff about my relationship, like we went on many dates and even drove back to my my hometown to go to a haunted house. It was obvious that I saw Adam as a friend. \n\nThen, one day he sends me a long paragraph about how much he likes me and that he couldn’t stop thinking about me. Then, he asks me if I wanted to be more than friends. ??? I was overwhelmed because there was too much to read and I didn’t know how to respond. I was pretty clear that I liked Mark as well. I never showed any interest in Adam. I was gonna respond to him, but he started turning toxic. He dm’ed me on Twitter repeatedly. I didn’t know there were read receipts on Twitter so he called me out on it, but he was being very rude about it. I know I felt bad, but I just didn’t know how to respond by not hurting his feelings. It was gonna take me a day to respond because I was already stressed with studying for an exam.  \nThen, he messaged me on snapchat and started adding me and unadding me on snapchat. Finally, he messages me on Twitter saying he was gonna DM Mark and ruin things between me and him. He actually messaged Mark and told him that I slept around with many guys and that he was looking out for another bro. This is not true at all. Mark messages me on snapchat and shows me the DM from Adam. I clarified that it wasn’t true and that Adam was my friend that caught feelings for me. Adam then messages Mark asking if he was interested in me. Mark was gonna reply to him, but instead told me that  he did like me as more than a friend. Mark stopped replying to Adam and Adam messages me on Twitter saying, “Well he just told me he ain’t interested in you, soooooo.... I’d say I won.” I blocked his number after this situation and he texted me from ANOTHER number, saying that’s he’s taking good care of Mark or whatever. I then blocked him on everything else.\n\nI think a few weeks after this incident, someone by the name of Jim adds me on snapchat. I thought it was someone from r/snapchat that messaged me, so I just added them back. We start messaging and turns out it’s ADAM. He apologizes for all the things he did and I apologized for not replying back to him after he confessed to me. I think he said it was alright of whatever, so he asks if I could add him back on his main snapchat, so I did. I told him I wasn’t going to be as open as I was before and he accepts that. I feel like I held a grudge on him because of what he did to me. So, I kinda felt uneasy messaging him. Recently, I messaged him and I made an accidental typo and didn’t correct it, so he said it was an embarrassing typo that I couldn’t even correct. But, it was clear what I meant. It’s like he was attacking me. After he said that, I became bland with him. He notices and makes a remark about how he’s had better conversations with Siri. Then, why not talk to Siri?? So, WIBTA if I told him I didn’t want to be friends with him anymore?\n\ntl:dr: met guy friend on reddit. was talking to a guy at the time. guy friend catches feelings and i didn’t respond to him in time and he become toxic. block him on everything. messages me from another name and wants to be friends again. i accept at first, but feel uneasy and don’t feel like being friends with him again.",

      "description": "So I'm 21F in my third year of med school and the friend in question (Nat) is in his fifth year. Nat is a foreign student from Benin and is very intelligent, he is almost 19 and in his fifth year out of six so he skipped quite a few levels. We became very good friends last year because I had some trouble getting into the groove of studying and he helped me out a lot. Over time I befriended some of his classmates.\n\nSo last semester Nat failed his first exam here. I've failed before and its devastating, but you get two chances to rewrite and that helps you in the long run in my opinion, because the learning material is a but fresher in your mind. I didn't find out til the weekend before he was supposed to write, but when I did I played him a visit. He seemed really down and was seriously doubting his ability to pass and stay in the school. I spent several hours consoling him before I had to leave. \n\nThat same weekend my class left for a four week community posting in a rural area with awful connection, I had to walk several kilometers to make my calls. I tried to call him everytime I went which was at least twice a week. He wouldn't know the results til we came back and was seriously stressing over it. Sometimes we would talk about it and sometimes we would joke, but he wasn't his normal self. \n\nAfter two weeks he stopped answering my calls and wouldn't respond to my texts. Because of the mood he was in I was concerned, so when we got back to school another two weeks later I stopped by his room but he wasn't there. One of his good friends told me he went to stay with his host family a bit, so I let him know to tell Nat to contact me when he had the chance.\n\nNat eventually got back to me about a week later and I let him know I asked his friend to tell him to contact me because I hadn't heard from him in a while. He got really angry with me and said I betrayed him by going to his friend. He said that I could always talk to him directly and that he's disappointed I didn't try harder. \n\nI see no betrayal in this. If he won't answer my class or texts and I'm worried about his mental health what am I supposed to do? I told him that but he kept focusing on how I didn't care enough to come to him directly. I realised it was no use arguing with him and apologised. This happened three weeks ago and we haven't spoken since, I'm still worried about him but idk if I really did something wrong. \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "So my boyfriend and I have been dating for a while. Before him I didn't even have a snapchat, so he pushed me to get one and to message him more. Admitted I suck at messaging, I'm more of a face to face person, but I'm getting better at it.\n\nSo fast forward to last night. I was hanging out with my friends house and I was waiting on her to finish getting changed for work. Him and I were messaging, but we really didn't have anything meaningful to talk about, so I figured I'd just text him when I got home. In the mean time I did take a goofy photo on snapchat and posted it on my story saying \"bored\" because I was. \n\nHe flips out on me for leaving him on read... for an hour. Stating that I thought he was boring and I had better people to talk to rather than him. I guess he thought I was posting for attention, which I was not. Keep in mind I have not done ANYTHING to make him think that I would be looking to talk to other guys.\n\nSo proceeds to ignore me and not talk to me at all. I guess it's a \"taste of my own medicine\". I just don't get why he would be so upset over not messaging him for an hour. AITA not having the correct \"text etiquette\"? ",

      "title": "AITA for not forgiving my alcoholic uncle?",
      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo this was an ongoing situation that has more or less settled down for now.\n\nRecently, it came out that my uncle, who was the sweetest man and beloved by my whole family, was actually a raging alcoholic for at least the past five years, possibly longer, and that my aunt (my mother's sister) has been covering for him this entire time. Literally no one knew, not even my recovering-alcoholic grandfather (my mother and aunt's stepfather).\n\nNow, the way this came out, was because he got drunk, bought a gun, and shot out the windows in the lobby of his apartment building, getting himself arrested and my aunt quietly evicted. This was actually the second gun he'd bought, my aunt panicked and hid the first one from him, for fear he'd hurt himself.\n\nI don't know for certain if my uncle ever directly hurt my aunt, but he was definitely causing them extreme financial distress. He couldn't hold down a job (many of us were confused as to why he \"wasn't looking,\" now we know), was spending all their money on booze, spent all his time that he wasn't actively at a family function drunk. It's been like this for the past five years, possibly more, as I'm not sure if my aunt was telling the truth, considering how long and how well she's been covering for him so far.\n\nNormally, I'd be more sympathetic; I loved my uncle, we all did, we all thought he was a wonderful guy. Add to that, I struggle with severe anxiety/depression myself, I know how hard mental illness can be, and mental illness is a big part of addiction. But there are a few reasons why I'm not very sympathetic to my uncle.\n\nFirst of all, my mother and aunt both have a history of alcoholic men in their lives. Their biological father was an alcoholic veteran, which resulted in his split from my grandmother (he died not long after, unrelated). Finally, my grandfather (their stepfather) was an alcoholic for a very long time, and my mother and aunt both had to watch as my grandmother covered for him and suffered for it. My uncle was privy to all of this information.\n\nSecond of all, he had at least five years to get help. Five years of my aunt trying to get him help, five years of making my aunt suffer for his addiction, five years of crippling unemployment, five years of financial struggles, five years of letting my aunt cover for him. During this time, he watched my grandparents suffer for my grandfather's addiction, and also watched my grandfather struggle to overcome his addiction. (He's doing much better now).\n\nTo be clear, I'm not angry at my uncle for being an alcoholic; hell, I don't hate my grandfather for the same thing. But I am angry because there are two differences between my uncle and my grandfather's situation; first, my grandfather didn't let his alcoholism put them in trouble financially, whereas my uncle very much did. Second, my grandfather got help and made an effort to recover. My uncle did not, and my aunt has confirmed this.\n\nI'm angry at my uncle not because he should have known better than to become an alcoholic, but because he should have known better than to not seek help when he was making himself and his wife suffer, especially knowing my aunt's family history with alcohol. Not to mention my grandfather's struggles with the very same issue! Though they agree with my aunt's decision to cut things off with him now that he's incarcerated, my family seems to want to be more sympathetic to my uncle. It caused a brief argument over Christmas actually (which my aunt was too stressed to attend), though we were all a little tipsy at the time. So, am I the asshole for not forgiving him? It just seems like he had so much time, and so much reason to seek help, and had he come to us with this initially, we all would've supported him in his recovery. But he didn't, and ended up throwing my aunt under the bus.\n\nTL;DR, after refusing treatment for at least five years of severe alcoholism, knowing full well my aunt's family history with alcoholism, my uncle was arrested and got my aunt evicted after he shot out the windows of their apartment building's lobby, and I seem to be much less sympathetic than the rest of my family. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Repost because exceeding word limit.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nBackground: 22yo, medical student, dx Asperger's (expired), Asian, middle-class family, no financial issue, part-time job as a tutor, live in dorm, was in a therapy(provided by a psychiatrist) for around 1 year with med applied due to depression/other thoughts before went to college.\n\nMost people I asked irl said Im the asshole. I'd like to see how this issue could be analyzed by people not around me.\n\n   \n \n\nI had post an issue I was extremely concerned on Asperger's sub in which I mentioned that I had problem with interests/routines being unwillingly forced/indicated by others to drop off. The post was life-changing to me. \n\nI started from telling other people that it wasn't nice to say/keep an expressively negative attitude toward what I was doing/preferred. It was inefficient.\n\nAt one point I was annoyed enough that I had fewer options I could do and 2 months ago I told my parents to shut up. My mom was instantly in tears. That was when my mom tried convincing me focusing on academy rather than preparing materials for my (tutor) students during my free time.\n\nMy father did a talk with me later. He said they would support me&amp;I didn't need to do a part-time job and it was ungrateful, disrespectful and improper to tell parents to shut up. And I told him to shut up after remaining silence for the whole \"talk.\" He threatened me not to support me anymore. I told him that he was a tutor himself when he was a student and he could sustain himself, why did he think that threatening me financially would work?\n\n   \n \n\nSince then(Feb) my relationship with them worsens a lot but I feel like I can't care it anymore. I have nothing left. Meanwhile my mental health is significantly benefited from this incident.  \n   \n \n\nAITA here? If so, what should I change? Is there any solution? Friends told me I should apologize to my parents. I told them I didn't need their financial support and I'm already 22 years old(adult). My point is: I could return money for raising me up after I get my license. I can definitely count interest if needed. \n\nMy best friend said that my statement was cold-blooded and I shouldn't blame my parents for having good intention and I should have resisted what decision they made(controlled) for me or it must be me not making enough effort expressing my feeling/firm response against them.\n\nI have a strong feeling that \"something is changing.\" I tell parents/friends to shut up and other words frequently/occasionally when what they say/do don't make sense to me.\n\nAgain, thank you for your reading! I really need help regarding this incident and the consequence owing to blind spots and possible logical mistakes.\n\nWish you a good day/evening/night! And if possible, please straight forward tell me what, why and how I did was wrong, thank you!",

      "description": "So, to give some back story, my husband and his ex-wife raised our oldest dog together before they broke up. She even helped him pick out our youngest shortly after she moved out. As part of their dissolution, they agreed the dogs were \"shared property\" and created a custody and visitation schedule. She picks up the dogs for her week and he picks up the dogs for his week. They actually do better with their parenting schedule than my ex does with ours for my son (that's a story for another time....but he's made it pretty difficult to coparent). \nWhen she gets here, I make it a point to acknowledge her existence. I try to be cordial and speak to her, even if it's something as simple as a \"hi\". We moved a little more than a year ago to be closer to work, which is closer to her. I don't think she's said a single word to me since we moved here, so today I went off about it to my husband. I feel it's very rude to go to someone's home and not say anything to the home owner who's standing or sitting right there. My ex engages with my husband when he comes to pick up our son, and is very polite about it. I'm not asking for a long conversation or even small talk. I respect her enough to say hello and feel that her completely ignoring my existence is rude. AITA for expecting her to say hello?\n\nTLDR my husband's ex-wife comes to our house to pick up their dogs per their legal agreement. She completely ignores my existence.

      "description": "My fiance and I have been together 2+ years in Las Vegas (relevant) and are getting married in 2020. I deeply love this man and he’s almost storybook perfect. That being said, the only thing that would have caused me to hesitate on his proposal is how irresponsible he is with money. Every month, it's like pulling teeth to get just his half of our shared bills, which I always end up covering to some extent. So, I told him days later that if he can't get his act together, I would need to take sole control of our budget or I can’t marry him.\n\nHe makes less than I do, but he still says he makes $35k+/year (plus benefits) so there shouldn’t be a reason, including student loan payments, for him to not be able to pay his half.\n\nI made an Excel sheet in *September* to help him budget better. *Last month*, I got frustrated that I couldn't manage my own savings because I was constantly overestimating how much he could give me. So, I told him that I would cover our shared expenses and just stretch my dollar, if he can make it his job to stash the majority of each check for the wedding. *Two weeks ago*, I found out that *he hadn't opened the budget spreadsheet since I made it.* I was asking him to fill it in since the numbers he was giving me seemed oddly low. When I asked about it, he got incredibly defensive, giving me excuses like ‘he didn’t make enough to even warrant filling put something like this’ and made me feel like I was being cruel for not believing he doesn’t have the money. After 4 weeks of not paying rent/bills, he had $150 available for savings.\n\nI don’t know how, but every time I talk to him, he manages to make me feel like I'm a bully or like I'm just refusing to see how the numbers are falling, except he won't show me! And I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy! BUT everyone I’ve gone to for advice thinks he has a gambling addiction. They can't find any other explanation that makes sense, and while I HAVE had a couple run-ins with him and gambling, it just didn't add up for me. He never struck me as the compulsive type-\n\nUntil March Madness. We both have brackets that I thought were just for fun, between his friends. I even made a lot of bad picks to try and make him and his friends laugh, but he was weirdly stressing over it until I reminded him, \"It's not for money, just for fun, right?\" at which point he calmed down, but when my key team lost a week later, he said, \"Well, there goes your shot at the money.\"\nWhen I asked, \"what money,\" he started backpedaling HARD, saying \"oh. I just assumed there might be a grand prize, it just made sense\" but dodged my questions about the cost. The only way you get a prize in sports betting is if you put money down, right? Please correct me if I'm making a false assumption!\n\nSo, WIBTA for asking to see his bank statements to rule out irresponsible spending/addiction? Or are the people in my life right, and I've been too much of a pushover this whole time?",

      "description": "As long as my Fiancé (who we will call Jon) and I have been planning our wedding, he has expressed that all he wants is a simple elopement on a beach. Just the two of us exchanging vows and committing to spend our lives together. \n\n\nDue to our family that is not an option. Everyone wants to be there. As such, we have planned a big wedding that neither of us really wants. \n\n\nJon’s sister (who we will call Emma) is getting married 9 months before us in Mexico. She is getting married on the second day of our trip. \n\n\nThe rest of the family will be arriving/leaving earlier than us, and we are all doing our own thing outside of the wedding. Jon and I will be staying at a different resort than the rest of the family to save money.\n\n\nI came up with the idea yesterday that maybe Jon and I should have our own private symbolic ceremony during our trip to Mexico for Emma’s wedding. \n\n\nIn my mind, I don’t see why the two of us can’t head down to the beach one morning, and exchange vows in the way that both of us have always wanted. I figure as long as it is a private ceremony between the two of us, it won’t be a big deal. \n\n\nWe wouldn’t tell anyone, and we would go still go through with our wedding in the winter. There would be no witnesses, so it wouldn’t even be a legal ceremony.\n\n\nWhen I suggested this to Jon, he laughed at me. \n\n\nHe said there was no point in doing a symbolic ceremony since we are spending so much money on our “real” wedding. He also told me that it was a really shitty thing to do to Emma, and that it would take away from her big day. \n\n\nI told him that this is what we’ve always wanted, and would be free since we are already paying to be there for Emma’s wedding. Also since we wouldn’t tell anyone, it wouldn’t matter. In my world, this is the perfect way to have the intimate ceremony we have always wanted, with the big ceremony/reception for our families sake.\n\n\nSo, AITA for wanting to get “married” during future sister-in-law’s wedding?",

      "description": "So, in my town in Sweden there is this youth center place that's always been great. Cheap prices too. Anyway the last couple months there has been a huge influx of migrants, mostly from middle east and africa. They are loud and don't speak swedish, or if they do, it's like a ghettofied version. \n\nThey are gradually becoming the majority and it's depressing. There are no new people to hang with, no cute girls, just loud people talking weird languages and playing FIFA. Honestly me and my friends are thinking of just abandoning the place, since it's basixally dying now. We're pretty much scouting other youth places with different demographics. \n\nAITA for thinking like this and in genersl thinking that this placr being mostly foreigners now is ruining the place. Maybe it's probably not acceptable socially but this is my honest view. Am I and my friends assholes?",

      "description": "I’ve been working at my job since July. In addition to seeing clients throughout the day, this job requires lots of documentation/paperwork which I was told could be completed and billed to the company after hours. No real guidelines/rules/limits provided about how much extra time we could spend on paperwork. It is an hourly position. I stay after sometimes but rarely more than 15-30 minutes. \n\nOne of the contracts I provide services for 1x per week can be completed in 1.25-2 hours. I get there at 8am, see my clients, then drive approx 15 minutes to my next site. At my next site I do paperwork for approx an hour-an hour and a half (it varies depending on how busy the morning was) then take an hour lunch break with the rest of the employees. After that I see clients until 5pm.\n\nI’ve been thankful for the extra hour I get to catch up on paperwork and use it for exactly that. However, recently my boss has been going over the numbers and figuring out profits with different contracts. He never said anything directly to me. But recently two of my coworkers on two separate occasions asked why I was at work so “early” on this day. I told them I was finished with my first site and doing paperwork, like I have been since July. \n\nNow I’m paranoid. Should I have gotten off the clock when I completed my first site then returned after lunch? Should I have asked my boss what I’m supposed to be doing during this extra hour/hour and a half and not assumed I’d get paid during it? I realized that other employees don’t get this time to complete paperwork as their morning contracts are longer. Am I stealing time? If this is a problem, is it on my boss for not explaining my schedule to me from the beginning? At this job, I have seen countless “mistakes” by employees that were really just due to my boss assuming people know the “rules” intuitively so I’m afraid I will be punished for this. \n\nTL:DR I get paid an extra hour/hour and a half each week during a gap in my schedule that my coworkers do not get (that I use to complete paperwork-they either complete their paperwork after hours or during client cancellations). We are allowed to bill for paperwork after hours with no real guidelines/limits about how much time we can spend on it. No one said anything about this until recently two coworkers asked why I’m “early” since I don’t see clients until after lunch. AITA? ",

She's a really great girl and we got along great. However last week I received an anonymous message over instagram saying that Jane and John used to be fuck buddies. It ate at me and a couple days later I asked her about it. She ended up coming clean and confirming that yes they were. This made me super uncomfortable because I don't want to ever date someone a friend of mine has slept with. To be honest if I am dating someone I want nothing to do with people they have slept with before me. I had to digest that information for a couple days before deciding that I couldn't handle that and I wasn't down to force myself to deal with that as an issue. She flipped out pretty hard and called me sexist, slut shaming, etc. John is also pissed off saying that I'm being immature and that he expected better from me. Some mutual friends have also commented with reactions ranging from somewhat neutral to hostile and angry at me. I honestly don't think I did anything wrong and that I saved us both heartache by biting the bullet instead of letting it drag out longer. I feel like I am being unfairly made out to be the villain here, so I'm coming here to get a second opinion.

I feel like this was more of 'actual' cheating than what I did since he actually had sex with her while we were together but he thinks we both cheated and that because he was able to forgive me that I owe him the same forgiveness.

      "description": "This happened a year ago. I want to decide if I can fix this or give up. Changed names; ages are from last year.\n\n**I (F19)** met **Dan (M29)** online and met him IRL after knowing we're in the same area. Met his IRL friends, had good times with them. Dan invites us to \"anime breakfast\", asking everyone to bring pitches of an original anime show - we'll develop them into fun-no-profits short film. It's a gathering of about 7 people, including **Lily (NB29)** who's a longtime friend of Dan (10 or more years?). Dan invites us to a Discord server after so we can discuss more.\n\nI pitch \"*magical girls are captured so the dads turn into magical dads and use magical guns*\" that seemed to stick and was pretty clear we all wanted to explore.\n\nThe idea of a gay couple comes up. No one's quite sure how to write a gay/queer couple raising a family, and it's clear that a few are uncomfortable w/ it. A majority of the people involved in this project were straight guys. Lily and their friend **Molly(NB29?)** argue we need to implement a gay couple in a non-offending way into the project while Dan and others try to find middle ground or don't the stress is good for a goofy project.\n\nLily declares \"This whole show so far feels homophobic\", lists all the flaws in the ideas, accuses Dan of controlling the project, announces they don't want to be involved with the project, and their ideas can't be used.\n\nI skimmed through all of this after it happens. I ask what happened, get a summary, chalked it up to: \"if we're THAT concerned about making this Tumblr Friendly i don't think we'll ever come to an agreement.\" Molly interprets: *adding a gay couple is pandering*. I call out how easily Lily said the show was homophobic when it didn't go their way, Molly disagreed, I say \"don't talk to me unless you actually experienced homophobia,\" which understandably wasn't taken well.\n\nAll of this happened within 5 days.\n\n2 months later, I met up with Dan to hang out at a con; Lily's there. I forgot about before, but learn Lily learned what happened by Molly and didn't want to see me. 5 months after THAT, Dan invites me to celebrate a birthday - I don't know the cakeday boy but go with a gift anyway and have a good time. I didn't know that Lily was there, because the moment they saw me, they left after going to Dan and calling him an asshole. Dan confesses to me after that, that I had been barred from a lot of friend gatherings because Lily would refuse to show up if they knew I was being invited.\n\nI reached out to a friend of Dan who offered to mitigate the issue in August. Haven't heard since.\n\nI like Dan's friends and would like to continue going to gatherings, but I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong and rightfully left out because of what I had said. I condensed this as much as possible but please feel free to INFO if needed.\n\ntl;dr: someone wants to add gay rep to a project. calls it homophobic when ppl disagree. i call them tumblr. get shadowbanned from friend events",

      "description": "Recently every time I'm at the gym, there is always the same dude present. This dude is always coming up to me to ask  how many sets I got left. I tell him a number, he gives me a blank stare, leaving me no choice but to ask him, if he wants to work in. I don't have a problem with people working in, I get it, it's full and not wanting to wait. But this dude doesn't follow the unspoken gym etiquettes.\n\nLike he takes really long pauses between sets, like 3 to 4 min even when warming up and me asking him, if he could speed up. Since I usually workout 1-2 hours before closing time, means that I have to speed up my training to leave on time. \n\nHe is also weak (nothing wrong with that), so I have to rearrange the weights, which he ask me to help. But when it's my set, he pisses off without helping putting them back on.\n\nSo yesterday, when he asked me again, how many sets I've left, I just told him that without asking him, if he wants to work in. So he asked me, if he could work in, to which I responded with \"no, but I'm going to speed up\". Instead how just saying okay, he started to argue with me. To sum up what he said: \" why not? If work out in your breaks, you wouldn't even notice me. You aren't doing anything between sets\". I responded with a quote from a YouTuber:\" my body does more work while resting than yours while working out\". He just said fuck you and went away.\n\nNow I'm starting to think, that I was to harsh, because the workout equipment isn't mine and it was full that day, with no available bench. \n\nAITA",

      "description": "I created this new account for more private stuff like this since my family may know my username.\n\nSome background : My boyfriend of 1 year and a half and I broke up two weeks ago. It was really ugly but after he came picking his stuff back, we had a talk on the phone and we seemed both on the same page : we were hurting each other and were better apart. I told him I had to block him and he understood. After this break up, even if I still loved him, I never wanted to get back with him and made that clear.\n\nAt first I made a longer post but then thought this sub don't need that much details. Instead here's the different perspectives :\n\nFrom mine (F22) : I found 2 condoms in my bed side table, remembered they were leftovers from the ones my boyfriend picked in a family planning center two months ago. That was when I stopped the pill for a month. It felt a bit weird but I put them back, after all we both forgot about it and he didn't have to pay for them. I couldn't call him for this, I couldn't throw them out because they were in good condition and I'm not a wasteful person. I guess in my mind they were just mine now. I did thought that I would probably use them in the future with someone else, because after all I didn't associate them with my ex that much. Unused condoms aren't tied to some sort of sentimentality for me.\n\nFrom his (23M) : What I did was extremely disgusting. The fact that I didn't even think about throwing them hurts him. The fact that I would use \"my ex's condoms\" with some other dude is so disrespectful and gross. He only knew about it because we met two weeks after the break up, and while we tried avoiding it, we decided to have sex just this one time. We used them both that night (and that morning). But he still called me the day after, asking me to throw the rest if they were left and ranted for a long time about this. What I did even made him regret being with me for so long because this made him believe that I never respected him. His voice was cracking up and he really seemed more hurt than angry.\n\nThis is not really relevant but we talked more, hung up in peace, and haven't contacted each other after this (it's been 3-4 days).\n\nI'm only posting this because he genuinely made me feel bad about something I thought wasn't that big of a deal. I just want to know if this is really a thing people SHOULD NOT do. If this was a box of condoms he had bought I would obviously get it and would have remembered to give them back anyway. If they were left I would have took the opportunity of giving them back, knowing then how important this was to him. I told him all this but he thinks I'm saying that just to make him feel better and because I never want to see myself as a bad person. And I know it's easy to say, but if the roles were reversed, I know I wouldn't care so I don't think I'm being hypocritical.\n\nI'm honestly not sure if he overreacted or if I'm too insensitive and I want to know.\n\n^(On a side note, english isn't my first language and if I wrote weird stuff I'd like to know, thank you.)",

      "description": " \n\nTL;DR at bottom\n\nMy parents have always been strict about movies. When I was younger than thirteen I wasn’t allowed to watch PG-13, only PG or G. The same went for R rated movies - almost entirely forbidden until my 17th birthday. I’ve loved movies that that are a little too gory/inappropriate for PG-13 for as long as I can remember, and from fourteen onwards I begged to see different R rated movies. I was always turned down. Now that I’m older, and have actually seen those movies, I totally understand my parent’s reasoning. What I don’t understand is how they’re treating my younger brother. \n\nMy brother is around fourteen, and doesn’t really show the same interest in these types of movies. Of course, that might be because he’s watching them already; it seems like everyone forgot the rule as soon as it didn’t apply to me.  I don’t know if it’s just the curse of being first-born, but it irritates me like nothing else.\n\nAfter a lot of complaints my parents are starting to see my perspective, but now I’m stuck with a hard choice. Apparently I, my dad, and my brother might all go see Deadpool 2 in theaters. But only if I agree. I loved Deadpool, but it was one of the movies I spent a long time begging to watch in the past. When I was fourteen I could hardly imagine seeing it, and my brother’s being handed the opportunity on a silver platter. I’m half-tempted to knock that platter right out of his hands. \n\nMy first reaction is to keep him from seeing it just because I wouldn't have been able to, WIBTA if I did?\n\nTL;DR: I couldn’t watch R rated movies until I was 17, now I get to choose if my 14 year old brother can see one, WIBTA if I said no?",

      "description": "So, I'm a man (24, as is pretty much everyone mentioned), and about 3 years ago while out partying a friend, let's call her Hannah, started dancing pretty aggressively, grinding on me, etc, culminating in her straight up groping me. I took her hand off me, and she did it again, multiple times. \n\nThat was repeated at least 5 more times in the span of a year and a half. Always among other people, and, not that it should matter, she'd stated multiple times that she's not into me (most of those times, unprompted). \n\nIn the last few months I took to talking about it with friends, and we're in the same, close group of friends. In general I deal with things by talking about them, and in particular I've brought it up in a few different situations, usually related to something else, but sometimes just because I felt I needed some support. \n\nThat said, a couple of friends have told me that it's rude to talk about it, especially without handsy Hannah being there to defend herself. I've talked about it with her too, she said nothing happened, except for some mild grinding. Surprisingly, even that, it appears, had gone unnoticed to everyone. Many of the people I've told about it were present in many of those cases, and they didn't see anything. Fair enough. Some don't believe me. Fair, I guess, it's my word against hers. \n\nI'm not asking if I'm at fault for her groping me, or not stopping it more assertively or whatever. It is what it is, and I'll get over it in my own time (some of those friends also say I should have already gotten over it.) What I'm asking is, AITA for talking about it with a group of (usually common) friends that didn't involve Hannah?",

      "description": "Obligatory first time poster warning and trigger warning for self harm and depression.\n\nMy friend has depression. We're both teenagers and have been at the same school years. \n\nA few years ago we were best friends and with a stroke of luck, we were finally in the same class! At the start of the year, she tells me a secret that she says I'm not allowed to tell anyone, ever. She's cutting, and she told me this over text. I was 12 and very confused and frightened, but viewed her as my best friend so I just told her that she had my full support and I would help her. \n\nWe never mention it, until about 3 months later, when she texts me again about this. This time she included a picture and since it was through instagram dm's, I had no idea what it was until I opened it. The photo was of her stomach with awful red lines, blood and scars on it. Again, I told her that she was my friend, and I would look after her. But inside I just felt awful. I wanted to tell someone, but back then I was so young and a secret is a secret! Snitches get stitches! I told her to stop cutting, but she wouldn't listen. \n\nOver the next few months she kept telling me about her depression, anxiety, insomnia and continual self harming. Occasionally she would send a photo. We never talked about it in person, but every night she would just text and text. She was in an awful part of her life which she needed to get out of. But the things she were saying were also freaking me out and the photos made my skin crawl. Sometimes I wouldn't sleep because I was so worried that she would kill herself so instead I texted her to make sure she was still replying. There was one time she didn't reply for 2 hours and I thought she had done it so I frantically texted her brother to check up on her. She had simply started ignoring my texts and instead texting this boy that she had met. I was relieved that she was alive but utterly pissed as I'd spent the last hour contemplating whether or not to call the cops. \n\nI don't know what she felt, but I felt used and like a garbage dump, just for her to unload her insecurities onto before moving on. \n\nThe final straw was when she sent photos of her self harm to another guy that she had met through mutual friends. This guy was 16 when we were 13, and went to a completely different school. She had sent them because he told her to fuck off when she continuously texted him at night. This wasn't her first rodeo in chatting with random guys online, but this time she had not only given him her instagram and phone number, but also mine! I guess he didn't appreciate the unsolicited bloodied photos(that were of her in her underwear too), because then in the most awful act of 'revenge' he sent the photos on a massive group chat he created with her, me, and about 10 of her other friends. He also sent screenshots of their texts which is how I learnt what she had done. Afterwards I begged him to delete the photos off of his phone on behalf of her.\n\nAfter more than half a year of this, I couldn't stand this anymore. One morning I told our teacher and I couldn't stop crying. If my face were China, then my tears from the left eye could've been the Yellow River and the right the Yangtze. Thankfully, the teacher was fantastic and understanding. She sent me to the school psychologist before calling *her* up. Now if my face tears were like rivers, hers was the entire fucking ocean. She was a human faucet. I got called back to the teacher's office, where Miss Amazon River started hugging me and asking if we were still friends. She explained that since we were best friends, I should listen to her and she would do the same. I said something the lines of \"Yeah, friends...\" and she took it to heart. But I couldn't even look at her without wanting to bawl like a complete baby again.\n\nAfter that I stopped hanging out with her and make stupid excuses every time she wants to call me. When she texts I just reply with something small. \n\nAm I the asshole for only being able to see her for the depression and self harm instead of her true self? Am I the asshole for not being her best friend anymore? Is it selfish? \n\nI know that she's on antidepressants now, but I don't know if she's stopped self harming. I hope she's doing well, but we don't really talk anymore.",

      "description": "A few days ago, my dad told mom/I that his doctor told him 98% of the cell samples they took from his thyroid came back cancerous. Aka he’s got thyroid cancer. \n\nHe got/still is upset that I didn’t take initiative to make his meal plans, look up his doctors, and tell him soft spoken warm words.\n\nThis coming from a man who I watched pull and yell at my sick mom out of bed for not wanting to go to church on some sundays for years (she gets chronic migraines), make mom/brother/I cower every time we did something he didn’t find likeable, berate me for not being holy enough like him because I never saw the point of going to India to set up another small church, be a fucking judgment asshole to all non-christians, fail to be there for my brother while brother was growing up so now my brother has drug and confidence issues, tell me that my life is wasted for deciding to go to a non-Ivy league grad school so I should get married instead, etc. etc. \n\nThe first thing dad said after telling mom/I of the diagnostic was, “well, now you have take care of me better.” Me, specifically, because “now it is your turn to take up these responsibilities.” \n\n...\nI’m sorry, what? \n\nIsn’t the first order of business, “shit **I** have cancer what should **I** do? What are the tests **I** need to go through? Who are my best options in terms of doctors? Any dietary changes **I** need to know of and take?” Like panic internally and figure out what lies ahead of you, yourself first instead of telling someone to do it for you?\n\nI have no emotional attachments to dad like many daughters seem to have to their dads. I wish I did, but I don’t. I do not depend or trust him for anything. I do not confide in him for anything and resist getting anything from him because that means later on I owe him something in return. But because he’s my dad by choices and forces out of my control, I am now having to take care of him? And I have to want to do it because all good daughters should? Oh hell can freeze over but it still a fucking no. \n\nHonestly... I can’t bring myself to make my mom bear all of this by herself and I will probably help.  But in truth I want to scream, “fuck you I won’t” to his face. But I want to. I don’t want to take care of my dad who has recently gotten a thyroid cancer diagnostic. Yes it’s the holidays and new years, nice fuzzy feels time and all... but no, I don’t want to. Why do I have to. \n\nI am probably being an asshole bitch... but fuck it. \n\nGoddamn tying this out is cathartic.",

      "description": "I was coming back home from a vacation a couple days ago with my wife, our son, and both of our parents (4 grandparents) when I noticed the backpack I was using as my personal carry on item had a huge tear near the zipper. The backpack served me really well - 4 years of heavy use in College and another 6 years of frequent use since. I've over packed it a lot so it wasn't a surprise that I eventually just wore it out.\n\nSince I'm going to be traveling again for work in a week, I went online while we were waiting at one of the airports and started looking for replacements. I found one from the same brand, similar to my current one, but that also has a padded laptop compartment that would be really useful since I almost always bring a personal laptop with me when I travel in addition to my work laptop. It seemed like a perfect fit.\n\nI told my wife I was going to go ahead and buy it, which I do for every purchase as a courtesy to her since I handle the finances and want to keep her in the loop with regards to my spending. It also gives her a chance to object if she has any concerns.\n\nShe mentions that since Christmas is coming up, I should hold off on the purchase and just add it to my Christmas list. I mention the upcoming trip and that I'd like to have it in time for the trip. She rebuts that I could always just use her backpack (which would probably function as a carry on but it smaller and doesn't have room for a laptop). So in essence a reasonable compromise, but not ideal.\n\nFor what it's worth the cost of the new backpack is completely inconsequential for us financially. \n\nThe crux of her argument was that I'm difficult to shop for so I should deal with not bringing the personal laptop on the 1-week work trip in order to \"beef up\" my Christmas list a little. I decided I'd rather just have the replacement before my trip and bought the new bag.\n\nI also went out of my way to find another item to put on my Christmas list to make up for it, but I'll admit I'm not always great at this.\n\nThis was just one example but I do this sort of thing a lot. If I feel like I need something I buy it myself. Unless my birthday is literally like a week away I just don't feel like waiting the extra time. I really enjoy shopping for my own stuff and picking out the exact style I like, trying them on beforehand, researching reviews, all that stuff. Things I get for Christmas are hit or miss and I often wish I'd been able to buy an alternative myself. Come holidays I've already bought the stuff I need so I end up giving lists with semi-frivolous stuff I don't REALLY want/need, or just ask for gift cards.\n\nCurious what everyone's thoughts are.",

      "description": "Hey people. Some background, me and my twin brother are in our early 20's. We are both very close, and we live together with three other people (I guess four including his girlfriend). As I said we, are very close and care about each other greatly.\n\n\nHim and his girlfriend have been together for a little over a year. Over the year, they've gotten very serious and as he's told me, they actively plan their future together. I'm really happy for him. This is his first healthy relationship and they both work well together (from what I can tell). His mental health has improved since they've been together.\n\n\nWe used to live in seperate apartments in  the same city, but in September we moved in together with a few others. I was really excited for this. We both make music and I was really excited to start going to shows with him more, and work on music together so we can also play more shows together. Music is something thats really important to both of us.\n\n\n\nBut ever since we've moved in, his girlfriend has been over every day and night. If she's not at work she's here. \n\n\nAs I said, I am really happy for him. But all of his time is spent with her. And I honestly feel sort of replaced. And I feel like a total asshole for feeling this way, but I can't help it. We don't do anything together anymore, only at the end of the night when his gf has gone to bed we'll play video games or watch something on TV, but we don't go to shows or make music together. I guess my expectations were too high before we moved in.\n\n\n\nI've been really depressed the past couple months. I got my depression under control in late 2017 when I got on some meds that finally worked for me. It's been something I've struggled with my entire life. It can, and has been the past couple months, pretty debilitating. I recklessly got off my meds a couple months ago which is why this has been going on, I just got back on them last week.\n\n\nI'm not saying I've been depressed because of my brother, but its one of the things that has been bothering me a lot. Among a whole load of others feeling, it's just one of them thats been on the forefront. \n\n\nI feel like a big asshole because I dont dislike his girlfriend, I like her. She's great for him. I just cant help but not want to spend any time with them. There are some shows coming up that I wanted to go to with my brother, but she's coming too. And I just dont want to go to them now. I know it's really important to him that his girlfriend becomes intergrated into his life, he does say its a serious relationship, so I feel like a jerk when these feelings come up. But I cant help it. I just feel bad.\n\n\n\nI havent brought it up with him because I know it will make him upset. I have brought up the fact he doesnt spend time with me anymore, but I havent had the heart to bring all of this up. I know it would make him feel very bad because I know it's very important to him that me and his gf get along (its not like we dont.. I dont know) and are friends. I know he wishes talked to her more.  Because we are the two most important people in his life. Thats why i've been reluctant to bring this up.\n\n\nAm i an asshole? I've been struggling with this for awhile. And I can't figure out my emotions being so depressed these days.  I know this is life. And I can't always be at the forefront of his life, but i cant even get a day in, or a night out with just him. ",

      "description": "So I was on a four hour flight with my SO and prior to boarding I was talking to a lovely man whilst waiting in the queue to get on the flight. Just the usual chit chat about the weather and their holiday etc. Him and his SO ended up sitting in the seats across from us. \n\nAnyway the flight took off and about a half hour into the flight I noted an awful smell I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from I quietly said it to my SO and he said he smelt it too. After a while it got worse and stronger to the point of feeling ill  (I work as a nurse and have a very high tolerance for bad smells). I noted at this point that the man across that I had been talking to earlier had bandages on both of his legs, there was visible discharge on them. \n\nThe smell continued to get worse to the point where you could  over hear people talking about it. The woman in front of the man held a jumper to her nose for the remainder of the flight. I felt so sorry for the poor man I wasn’t sure if he was aware or not. Anyway the flight landed and we were delayed getting off the flight awaiting steps or something like that most people  were standing at this point ready to step out into the aisle when it was allowed. I stayed sitting on my phone and a friend had text me asking had I landed. I text back explaining the issue with the smell, I stated ‘it was awful’, ‘I thought I was going to be sick’ and ‘the heat and those wounds are not a good combination’.  \n\nThen the man behind me asked me if I was ok. I responded with an ‘ah yeah just looking forward to getting home now’ I thought he was just being friendly. When he suddenly asked me if I knew that man and pointed to the man with the bandages. I said no and then he went on to tell me that this was his best friend and he had cancer and that they had the best time ever and that his legs pain him every day and continued to tell me about his friend. He became quiet aggressive in tone and almost shouting. His friend looked embarrassed and everyone around including me and my SO looked a bit unsure of what was going on. It suddenly dawned on me that perhaps he had been reading my texts as I was sending to my friend  as I had been sitting and he was standing behind me. I went red in the face and quickly left the plane as soon as possible. \n\nAm I an asshole for texting my friend?",

In the two months leading up to the dance, we talked a lot and I ended up asking her to the dance. I actually wanted a relationship and I thought I made that pretty apparent. She agreed and I was very happy about it. Now, she had always told me that my lab partner was her “best friend” and I thought that it was great that we had something in common and thought nothing else of it. So we went together and had fun. Not anything more than hand holding, but I had only had one GF before this. Then, the next day, I’m walking through the halls and see her slobbering all over my lab partner. I’m thinking “ WTF is this Rowley Jefferson shit” and I ask her about it later. She tells me that he had been her boyfriend for a while. I had never brought her up in front of my lab partner so I don’t really blame him. But I asked some of my other friends if I have a right to be pissed about this and I have gotten mixed opinions.

      "description": "**TLDR: My dad is refusing to have a conversation about an event that's important to me, declaring that I can't skip a bit of \"family time\" (preparing for thanksgiving dinner).  I will be spending the rest of the day with family at the thanksgiving dinner we are preparing for, would still have to help out, and am pissed that he's stonewalling me, so am considering going anyways.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for long text. It's an intricate situation that maybe doesn't sound very serious, but ended seriously. For reference I'm 16, my sister's 13, and we have just arrived at my dad's house from our mom's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe karate dojo that my sister and I attend have a traditional annual morning thanksgiving workout, which lasts for an hour in the morning. I went last year and had a great time, so my sister and I were looking forward to going this year. Unfortunately, I didn't tell my dad about it until today, as I was without internet connection until yesterday. Little did I know, my dad (who does most of the decision making concerning his my sister and me) was planning to have us all prepare together in the morning for a family thanksgiving dinner later that day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**He** says that the whole day should be for family, that he can't spare the time to drive me to karate or have me bike there by myself. My grandma came over, who is staying until Sunday, and he says that I should spend that time with her rather than karate, or help prepare for the dinner. That morning time, according to him, should be kept free, and I should have given him earlier warning. My grandma and stepmom support him in this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I** think that \\~2 hours of an event should be fine, since we can spend the rest of the morning, about 2-3 hours, preparing if we need to. The rest of the day would be spent primarily with relatives. My grandma is here until Sunday, and I have no school and few commitments until then, leaving plenty of time to spend with her. I believe that I should be able to control my own life to a certain extent. I am old enough, and taking two hours off for a rare opportunity that I would enjoy is not asking for too much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I wasn't able to say all this to my dad, as he grew angry when I broached the subject. What I did say he didn't seem to hear, as he was talking over me, offended that I would threaten \"valuable family time.\" He eventually said he couldn't take it, and left, as I see it effectively stonewalling me. I was completely calm throughout all of it, and listened to everything he said. He gets upset easily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf he sits down and listens to me, as I did to him, and explains his side to me calmly,  I will likely end up staying home, and will be happy with that. I would love to go to the event, but even more than that, I want to be heard. Right now, I feel trampled on, like I'm there to posture and make other individuals happy but that my own happiness doesn't matter, and neither does my sister's. I don't feel listened to like a human being should be. And I feel like he doesn't understand all sides of the situation, whereas I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm considering leaving on my own to bike by myself to get there, which would take 2.5 hours total, defying my dad's wishes. I consider this justified, and hope that he will learn to listen to me better as a result of this. I also consider it the just decision, regardless of whether he had actually listened to me, though as I said if we had a conversation about it I would be willing to change my mind. I plan to come back, prepare for and attend all of the dinner, and spend a large portion of my next few days with my grandma. We've had many situations like this in the past, and I hope to send him a message that I am becoming independent and that I expect to be heard just like anyone else. I will also show him that I can do what's important to me while still finding time for family. Unfortunately, my sister isn't comfortable biking, and probably will end up not attending the event.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts? ",

She was living in a cheap motel for almost a year because her shitty boyfriend. Anyway, her money ran out and her credit is bad, so she couldn't find a place. Since they've been here, they're way of living drives me crazy. They are messy; my brother leaves a dirty ring around the tub, pisses on the floor and leaves the toilet seat up and doesn't flush. My son stuck his hand in there and I blew the fuck up. Also, they're dog had growled and jumped at my son and their cat scratched him too. So they'll have to find somewhere else for their pets to go. Plus, they don't clean up after the pets or feed them. Lastly, to top it all off, they bought roaches! I'm so over it, I'm ready for them to go, I have a 13month old and another baby on the way to think about and I just don't want them living in a pigsty with roaches crawling over them. I am fed up!",

      "description": "About a year ago my parents put down a down payment on a house in a city that I had lived in a couple years and my brother had just moved to at the time. Ever since then my brother and I have paid for everything(mortgage/insurance/taxes) evenly. It’s pretty decent 3bd/2.5bath house. The house is still technically is owned by my parents but it’s the only thing in their will that goes to that brother and I equally, and not the other two siblings(Who live in different states)\n\n\n\nNow shortly after he moved to town he met this girl ‘Nina’  Who he got engaged to on Valentine’s Day. Now, I was totally fine with her until very shortly after their engagement, when she asked when I was moving out.  I was like “What? This is my house” well since she doesn’t own a house, she just assumed she’d move in and I’d move out, so they could “be newlyweds and have their own place” I assumed she’d moved in, and was planning on talking to my brother on him paying 2/3rd of the utilities when she does. I’d understand this if my brother decided to buy half the house from me, and I was in a position to buy another one, but neither of us are in that point of our lives where we could. Also, I feel like this is my house and I just plain don’t wanna move out. I tried to talk to my brother about it, and he said he hasn’t thought that far ahead, and thought she would move in too, and we’d all live together till I found my own spouse(which 1. I’m single now and 2. I feel is kind of antiquated) also I love my brother, but he doesn’t have a spine when it comes to her, and I’m afraid her hostile energy towards me will make me feel unwelcome in my own home. \n\n\nAnother factor, that I just want to pretend I don’t know about but I do, is that she never stays over, and they don’t have sex when I’m here. Now I travel a lot for work, so that hasn’t been a problem imho yet. Also I just thought that was mainly because we’re all church-going type people who pretend we don’t have sex to people we aren’t married to, but it could be like in general that could be a problem. \n\n\nAITA for not letting them have thouse house? And any advice on how to calm down this situation? After her getting all huffy about it, I feel uneasy her moving in at all. ",

      "title": "AITA for not sticking up for my girlfriend when people were being toxic, and AITA for not giving into her unreasonable requests?",
      "description": "Here’s a bit of backstory. My friends and my (now ex, probably for good reason) girlfriend have always butted heads. We’re still in high school, I’m a part of the stoner group at school and my gf has always hated this. We would also vape, and she’s always said she hated this. She would guilt trip me and say that I don’t care about her because I fail to realize that if I get popped I can’t see her. This got to me so much that I quit just for her, and even then she accused me of quitting to appease her feelings and not because I genuinely wanted to. Whenever other girls came into the picture remotely, she would need to be there physically with me, and she literally admitted to her being jealous and not wanting me to “see something I shouldn’t” regardless of whether I made the right choices should the situation arise that another girl is into me. My friends took notice and tried to initially get me to drop her, but they realized that they were being dicks about it and that they should respect my decision. \n\nThe thing is though, it hasn’t impacted my life. I get good grades, I have AP classes in my schedule, and I’m always happy to take a night in if stuff needs to get done. I play sports and I’m involved with clubs, so it’s not like I have no life or anything. \n\nFast forward to the situation. It’s homecoming time, and there’s two groups we could have gone with, her friends or mine, we could have gone either way. I ask her if she wants to go with her friends, she said she doesn’t mind going with mine. She takes charge on most of the planning and nips it in the bud right away. A mutual “friend,” who I’ve had a history with, starts says shit in our gc to stop being controlling and even goes so far as to call her a bitch. No one acknowledges this or seems to care, so I pass it off as him being toxic because we have beef and he’s just doing it for the hell of it. I don’t volunteer to leave the group or anything because by that point her friends have already had their plans made and I thought it would be unfair to expect them to be accommodating to me and my ex. I also didn’t want to stir the pot this close to homecoming either. \n\nI get a call from her later in the day, and she’s crying her eyes out asking why I didn’t say anything to the toxic guy. I saw where she was coming from, and I realize that maybe I was being an ass by not showing anyone there that I had a spine. The next day, she bows out of the group herself and tells me to have fun with my friends, and she gets a group going with some other of her girlfriends who weren’t in the group that we initially could have gone with. After school that day, I get an angry text from her mom, who is extremely close with my ex and are basically best friends. She accused me of letting people think that my ex was crazy, controlling, and manipulative. \n\nI ask one of my closer friends about the situation, and he says that even though he respects my decision he says he’s seen red flags. Mind you I’ve known this guy since 2nd grade and he’s never done me dirty. I ask another one of my close friends and he says that he notices parts of our relationship that aren’t all that healthy, and his opinion is that he thinks I would be better off without her. \n\nNevertheless, I still feel bad that I was being the reason all this drama was happening. I go and ask my mom for advice, and so since she doesn’t know much about my friends and what we do I think she has an inflated image of me in her mind and doesn’t know how trashy we can be. She says that my ex is being manipulative and that she doesn’t deserve me, but I hang out with a bunch of potheads so I really can’t see how I would be deserving of a girl who is definitely out of my league both physically and socially. \n\nI still feel bad that she’s hurt by this, and at this time I hear from my ex that her dad knows. I freak out. He gave me the dad talk when we first started dating, and I feel like I broke that implied trust that I would protect her no matter what. I tweak and literally write an apology letter to him, much to the dismay of everyone else in my life. I hear from her mom again a few hours after I put it in their mailbox, and she says she appreciates the gesture and whatever my ex and I decide to do with the relationship her and her dad would both support us. At this point I really can’t blame her for bringing out the mama bear claws, it’s only natural for a mom to want to protect her daughter. \n\nThings are tense and we don’t really talk until the day of homecoming. On the day we discuss what to do, I’ll still go to dinner with my friends, and she goes to dinner with her group, but I meet up with her for pictures after and we go to the dance together. We go our separate ways to different afterparties after the dance. That night, we meet up for pictures after dinner and everything seems to be going smoothly, until an hour after we pull up to the dance. We’re in a big mosh pit with a mix of my friends and hers, until she pulls me out and starts begging me to go back to her house instead of the afterparty I’m planning to go to. I said ok, but I’m gonna go to the afterparty around midnight. She starts literally yelling at me, making a scene to choose one and that it’s her or my friends. I told her I don’t have to choose because I can be both. She then accuses me of wanting to take the easy way out and that I don’t have a choice but to choose. I go back to her house, and she won’t even touch me (disclaimer: I don’t think I’m entitled to anything sexual, that’s a dick move), but it hurt me how she wouldn’t even let me get close to cuddle with her. In the car on the way to her place I ask her dad to just take me home because there’s been too much drama and I need to just call it a night. My ex gives me the dirtiest look and I tell him never mind. Once we get to her house, she starts yelling at me and I told her I can’t be with someone who’s gonna put me on the spot, disrespect me, and make shit awkward for me. I call my friend to take me to the afterparty, and she blocks the door for 7 MINUTES crying to get me to stay. I just tell her goodbye and I go with my friend to the afterparty, where I just go and get fucked to get my mind off this situation. \n\nThe next day, I wake up to a text from my ex, saying that I’m never welcome back at their house and that both her parents feel lied to and taken advantage of. In the apology letter I asked him if I could still take her to homecoming and that I would be as accommodating as possible to make it as great a night for her as possible. This didn’t make sense, because for her to demand me not to follow the plan we had originally agreed on was unreasonable and I felt I had been accommodating to her the entire night. I sat her down and said the way she was acting was unreasonable, and she said I didn’t deserve her respect anymore so I called it off. \n\nI think I’m the mostly the asshole here, I really just had this burning inside and I want the court of public opinion’s opinion.  I probably shouldn’t be in a relationship again until I grow up some more. \n\nAnd r/niceguys beat you to it ",

      "description": "Incident took place on a highway connecting two rural towns. There was a car going 30 mph in the left and a truck going slightly faster at 35 mph. I tried to pass the truck but the car was going too slow and I was forced to slow down from 70 to 30 mph. Look at my rear view to see a fresh wave of traffic coming at me fast and begin to get nervous about being rear ended so I honked at the driver.\n\nInstead of simply moving over the car decides to brake check and only drive 15-20 mph afterwards. The truck I tried to pass was besides me when I honk so he decides to stay by the car so i couldn’t pass on the right. This continues for a few miles and When we hit a bend, there was a traffic jam as far as the eyes could see.\n\nAt this point I get extremely nervous because the car attempted to brake check several more times while traffic behind me was inches from my bumper. In fact every car behind me was pretty much a feet or two from each other so any rear end collision was going to end with a multi car collision. \n\nJust before we hit the next town there was a very long left turn lane about a mile long that was for a future apartment complex or mall still under construction. I decided to pass in the left turn lane and get away from the drama as soon as possible. The car couldn’t really keep up with me but the pickup was able to follow me and pulled up besides me at a redlight. \n\nEven if I wanted to say something to him, I couldn’t because my windows are manual and anyone who has them knows it’s a pain to open passenger windows. So I just kept looking ahead and the pickup decides to run the redlight and make a last minute right turn in the middle of the interesection. \n\nI seen a lot of YouTube videos where people, mostly on motorcycles but sometimes cars, decide to gang up on someone because they thought that driver was in the wrong. Was I an Asshole to honk at the car or was it justified? Their plan we ems to have worked in the end because it was a massive pain to go back home due to the amount of traffic from the incident.",

      "description": "Sorry about formatting, I'm on mobile.\n\nTo give you an idea of how much this is, my first attempt at writing this was about 7500 words. I'll keep it brief. I got into a fight with this guy on PlayStation. Everyone (in the party) agrees he has an ego problem. I'm pretty sure I have one to, but it's not near as extreme as this other guy. I've had a friend swayed over to playing for honor (a notoriously toxic game) with a notoriously toxic person, while being of a notoriously toxic age. I've known this friend for a while, so me being torn from him by these people was a bit crushing. After I'd been kicked from one too many parties (me and the rude guy had arguments constantly and, because he has no confidence, he kicks when he's routed) I got into an argument with my friend about it and he ended up blocking me on 2 separate platforms. I plan on trying to be friends with him later, during the next marching band season at my school, I think because he's a freshman and I wasn't the most stable guy around at the time, we'll be better suited to being around each other when we both become more mature. I was told the group I'd left had bonded through their hatred of me, and that the annoying coward leader is still shouting commands to this day. Sorry if this isn't conveyed correctly, or if it needs info, my 7000+ word version covered everything in extreme detail, and if you guys want, I'll post it in a Google doc and share the link. Thank you.",

      "description": "I've wanted to play Halo for some time, and as luck would have it, I managed to find a 360 copy at the game store. Excited by our haul, my SO and I decided to make a night of it.\n\nSo we're having a grand time annihilating aliens for a while, he dies.\nIn an attempt to help him track down his body and guns, I accidentally picked up his ammo, not realizing it would pick up automatically. I apologized profusely, he said it was fine, and we moved on. \n\nThe next day we go to play again and realized the checkpoints don't count as saves, so we start over, both with our original weapons. \n\nI was trying to get the vehicle up a ramp when I accidentally ran him over, not realizing there was friendly fire/kills in this game. I backed up quickly so as not to take his gun again, and he purposefully shoots and kills me and goes, yup, there's friendly fire in this game!\n\nI would've thought it was funny, but then he walked right over my body, picking up my gun. \n\nHe tried to justify it by saying I wasn't using that gun anyways, even though it was basically all I used. \n\nSo I tried to kill him-this time on purpose- however, he had the superior firepower, and I needed to come up with another tactic. \n\nSo I acted as if all was well, let's just keep playing, until he gets into the vehicle...and I drove it off a cliff, killing us both and losing all of our weapons. If I can't have them, no one can.\n\nHe got really upset, complaining I lost him his gun, and refused to play anymore. He now claims picking up my gun was an accident, but if he would've just said that in the first place I would've just moved on...\nAITA?",

We now are bitter and she won't even look at me in the hallways but I thought that just telling a few people was harmless as well as it being a pretty normal thing for people to know about that stuff.

      "title": "AITA for keeping the car?",
      "description": "While dating my ex-girlfriend, she brought up how it bothers her and her parents that the car I drove was so old and they wished I had something newer and safer. Her father ended up sending $10,000 for me to get a car. I suspected it was really to get a car that would be hers in the future (being she didn't have a driver's license and is/was overstaying a visa so probably couldn't get one at the time) because she was the one picking out the car. For a gift for me. I didn't think much of it at the time.\n\n Anyway, I proposed, we lived together, and she proceeded to become the most shallow and immature person I have ever met despite being almost ten years older. She sent me the exact ring that she wanted and after I got it, she bitched for days how it wasn't good enough (it was stainless silver and it tarnished, she KNEW it was stainless silver and that it does that). I wanted to marry her sooner to try and get a head start on possibly fixing her legal status (with the rise of trump being a possibility at that time) but she refused because if it was in the winter it may not be fancy enough for her. She also told me unless the wedding costed AT LEAST $50,000 It wouldn't be good enough for her, because her friends had a $50,000 wedding so it would look bad if she didn't. \n\nShe ended up screaming at me daily for random things (she asked when I preferred to shower and didn't like my answer, to the point of breaking down crying). She also refused to believe me when I mentioned some of the safety concerns about the house she suddenly purchased with her father's money (like oh just the backup grounding rod being bonded to the water and gas lines, for start). Mainly because fixing that may have had to come out of all the money her father was going to send her for the wedding. She even had me pick up things and drop them off at the house when she was moving in...but declined to have them stored at a place with a parking lot when she could have. Which was kind of a big deal for me given I was still in physical therapy for a shattered kneecap and had just recently gotten the brace off. I raised my concern to her only to have her say I needed the exercise. (I didn't mind helping, but to make it involve extra walking for me when it already was an hour drive one way? Really?)\n\nI finally left and started attending counseling, and she expected the car back. It pissed me off given that, A) it wasn't a wedding or conditional gift, B) supposedly her and her family were so concerned with the old car I was driving but suddenly that evaporates because she decided to become bitch-zilla, and C) she dropped $80,000 in cash on a house like it was nothing and already had plans for another $50,000, yet she's going to ride my ass over $10,000? I was freshly graduated and struggling to find a job and not going to physical therapy as often as I should have due to money concerns.\n",

      "description": "So I befriended this group of guys in the beginning of the school year and we really hit it off. We bonded over memes, dark and self deprecating humor. I knew instantly we had political differences but I'm use to that so it was fine with me. I just thought they were your average conservative. \n\nOver time they warmed up and I noticed a couple were alt right with the rest on the boarder. Some really harsh unnecessary jokes were said that weren't creative or original. Which are my prerequisites for a dark joke. Also comments like \"the LGBTQ is just a symptom from the current social climate\" were said. \n\nI'm gay so, ouch. Nothing said politically can hurt me but that LGBTQ comment did. After a couple days of internal debate on what to do with no contact, the guy who made the comment approached me. I could see it in his eyes that he felt sorry for hurting me and asked me to come back.\n\nI don't think his opinion had changed that day but I saw a moment of empathy. I do genuinely enjoy them as friends  but normally I would of walked away. Except this time had that moment. His eyes were filled with sadness and I saw it as an olive branch. I did see an opportunity and I did take it. Knowing that I'm going back in with the goal to pull whoever I can over to least your average conservative. \n\nThis was a couple months ago and I made surprisingly good progress with a few. We're closer than ever. Unfortunately someone overheard me in the library explaining the situation to my oldest friend. It's really torn the group apart with people taking sides. I think it's fair to say it's my fault but I don't think my intentions make me an asshole.   ",

      "description": "This story has a bit of dialogue to it, so bear with me (TL;DR at bottom-not a great summary). Also on mobile; apologize for any formatting.\n\nI (20F, H) met this guy (19M, E) over a month ago on a dating app and we hit it off instantly. A little after meeting him, I started planning a spring break trip to Montreal. I booked the trip and also researched tattoo studios. I had mentioned to E that I wanted a tattoo and even discussed tattoo studios in Montreal while E was in the room. Fast forward to the trip, I get the tattoo. I post it on social media. His only comment on it was &gt;.&gt;. Didn't know what it meant so I text him a few hours later asking if he liked it and the dialogue goes like this (heavily paraphrased):\n\nE:Not really. I was raised strict on drugs, alcohol, tats etc. I don't hold favorable views\nH:I don't do the others. Tats I will enjoy. So old fashioned, get into the 21st haha\nE:I've met the scum of the earth all tatted up, sure I've met the good guy but the numbers aren't 1:1. Statistically, you're more likely a criminal if you have a tat\nH:Almost 1/3 of Americans have tats. You can't just assume that people are criminals cause they have tats\nE:You romanticize the outliers who have tats and aren't criminals\nH:I'm not romanticizing anyone. So many people that you pass on the street can have hidden tattoos. Criminal =/= tat\nE:It was disappointing that you got a tat. I'm weary if someone has a tat. Not saying I hate tat users, I question their character\nH:I'm not about to deal drugs cause I have a tat. You don't have to like me having one, but I want to at least know that I am respected as a whole. It seems like I am not\nE:Not saying you're a crook, but I just don't feel comfortable with tats. I side with statistics. I'd rather be tough and charmed than naive\nH:I'm naive cause I don't believe that people with tats are instantly criminals?\nE:Yes. But  I knew you were like this since I met you.\nH:Wow, such deep character analysis. Smiling and happy =/= naive\nE:You trusted me immediately, weird unless everyone is a good person. I think you're naive that's a trait of yours not an insult\nH:Trusting immediately: I didn't. I judged that you might be a good person from our interactions, but I still made sure I had contingencies. Near my school, location I knew, a friend nearby\nE:Don't think you planned that, it seemed convenient. You're going from naive and sweet to prepared\nH:Yes, it's an insult, cause you think I'm not aware of the world. I can be sweet all I want, and still know how to protect myself\n\nThis idea of me being naive goes back and forth for a few more texts and he says that he needs to take a break, cause we were both annoyed. I took his \"character ananlysis\" as insulting, because he's only known me a MONTH and I'm pretty pessimistic, but I try and be happy on the outside. So, AITA for getting angry?\n\nTL;DR: I got angry at a potential SO when they called me naive for not instantly thinking that people with tattoos are criminals?",

Everyone knows airports are crowded and the only place (I know of) that you can get somewhat of some alone time is in the bathroom stall. Now, most of the time I have to actually use it but I stay in the stall way longer than I need to. Going thru social media and “escaping” all the people in the airport. \n\nBut, AITA for taking more time than I need in the stall when I know there’s people that genuinely need to use it? No one would know that I’m actually doing nothing in here. \n\nI know I would be a little pissed if I couldn’t find a stall when I needed to go in a crowded place but when this happens I just go find another bathroom or wait. I imagine not everyone does this so stalls come open. I usually leave after my legs fall asleep, I get hungry, or bored. \n\nI’m thinking about leaving now and I’m 99% sure the guy in the stall next to me has been in there as long as I have been, so maybe I’m not the only one.\n\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been talking to my crush daily for about 2 months. He's kinda of popular and is attractive, a lot of girls want him. I've been told he's a 'fuck boy' before. I was talking to X about this, and I was asking him why he thinks my crush, who I'll call Y, would still be talking to me this long if he's really a 'fuck boy'. Please note this is in a group chat of mutual friends so it wasn't really anything insanely personal and I was being more general about it, kind of putting it like, \"lol, I wonder why he still talks to me if he's such a fuck boy\"\n\nbut then X kept making aggressive remarks how I'm just \"free pussy\" for him and how \"I'm only good to him for sex\", \"he's desperate\". I've never once had sex or even kissed my crush, Y. He didn't say these jokingly either. It sounded like he was being dead serious, and he knows how much I hate it when people use sexist terms like \"hoe, whore, slut\" etc. He kept being very aggressive how I'm just a vagina too him, made me out to be desperate and \"used,\" and made me out to be easy. I got pissed and called him a fucking dick, and he countered it with \"shut up, you know we joke around\". I got pissed and left the group chat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: my crush has a reputation of being a fuckboy. I haven't had sex or kissed him, and when I mention that I wonder why he's still talking to me since I haven't given anything 'up to him' (if you get my gist) for so long if he really is a fuckboy. Best friend degraded me and made me out to be a easy slut and called me \"Free pussy\" with our mutual friends in the chat. I want an apology and am not speaking to him until I get one. He said he was just joking, and note we do joke aggressively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want an apology and I'm not talking to him until I get one. Am I The Asshole for this?",

Anyway so I get my food and sit down with my friends and it's with me being the only one facing the counter. Next thing I know this 20-something year old lady flies around said counter and half falls but catches herself and doesn't completely hit the ground. She didn't look like she'd hurt herself.\n\n\nI chuckle and ask my friends if any of them had seen it, they all said no so I told them what had happened and they had a chuckle as well. We all eat our meals and just as I'm finishing mine this lady (L) comes up to me (Me).\n\n\nL: Excuse me!\n\n(Now I was in my uniform, and there was a branch of our store in the nearby shopping centre so I was expecting a question about work.)\n\nMe: Hey, what's up?\n\nL: You know that woman you laughed at earlier? She's bawling her eyes out right now\n\nMe: Okay?\n\nThen the lady (who I wrongly assumed was the mother) just huffed and walked away. \n\nSo yeah, AITA?

      "description": "Okay, so this is very long and I completely understand not wanting to read the whole thing. The only reason I'm making this post is because the situation is so complicated. I've also seen many posts on this subreddit where it seems like people are deliberately skewing the story in their favor, and while I'm obviously biased, I'm going to try and explain the entire situation. \n\nI became friends with John a few years ago, after meeting from a mutual friend. We hit it off and clicked pretty well, with a shared interest in comics, board games, and outdoorsy adventure stuff. As the friendship progressed, he became the main person I could tell my shit to. And there was a fair amount of shit - I've dealt with various amounts of anxiety and depression my whole life. I've always felt uncomfortable or anxious around others, even John, and whenever these feelings of anxiety got bad, I'd get more depressed. It was a pretty vicious cycle.\n\nThe main downside to this was I've never been able to interact with girls very well. Now, I like to think I'm not the stereotypical anxious male that can't speak to girls. I've had plenty of female friends, but they just rarely developed romantically. Him on the other hand, is a different story.\n\nHe's had this girlfriend for a few years, we'll call her Sarah. I didn't start getting to know her until earlier this year, but I'll get to that in a bit. After them dating for about a year and a half, he pressured her into an open relationship. Being in a relationship made him feel constrained, and he started hooking up with lots of girls, even having sex with a few of them. She was never really okay with this, and he knew how sad all this made her, but she always said it was okay because she had a pretty big reliance on him at this point. (She lives about an hour away from us in the middle of nowhere, and the only friends available to her aren’t the best, putting it nicely.) I started to become the person she could talk to about all this - regularly at parties me and her would end up alone together while he would be off hooking up with some girl. (I've asked her recently if she was ever okay with, or ever wanted this open relationship and she said no - he told her he'd break up with her if she wasn't okay with it. He'd always told me she wanted it as much as he did.)\n\nA few months ago, I was really into this girl me and John had just become friends with. I got on really well with her, and thought she liked me too. I was wrong on that one, because as it turns out she liked John. Me and him talked about my feelings for her, but he ended up kissing her anyway. A lot. He didn't even really like her, she was just there and wanted to kiss him, so he did. He told me the next day and even though I was obviously annoyed, I forgave him, and we moved on.\n\nJohn broke up with Sarah a few months ago. Me and him both started college this year (different colleges), and I think this combined with him finally realizing how sad he made her a lot cause him to end it. She was sad but got over it okay. Me and Sarah started talking a lot more after the break up. He stayed friends with her, and continuously asked her to be \"fuck buddies\" with him, and even got upset when she said no. He's currently seeing two girls, neither seriously, and this has been making Sarah pretty sad. Despite how sad he made her, they'd been best friends and in a relationship for three years, after all. Everything came to a head a few weeks ago at his Halloween party - me and her were both feeling like shit, and we both drank a lot. But this isn't when we kissed. We just sat on a couch away from the party, hugged a little and spent some time talking to each other. We were closer than friends, but nothing else happened that night. He saw us sitting close anyway, but he seemed okay about it. We talked, and everything seemed normal.\n\nShe talked to him a few nights later, and he asked her if we kissed. She of course said no, and when she told me this, I told her that I had been thinking about kissing her. And she told me she'd been thinking about it too. This was a pretty big deal for me. As stressful and confusing as this situation was, I was slightly happy that someone felt the same for me as I was feeling for them. We talked for a while that night, sorting out our feelings and we came to the same conclusion – being close to each other was good and made us both feel comfortable and happy. We had a connection.\n\nWe met up again a few days later, just to go for a walk and talk during one of my college lunch breaks, and we stood under a tree while it rained and hugged. Again, nothing more happened. We both just wanted to feel comfortable. However, I felt terrible after this. I felt like I was completely betraying my best friend. I told her that night that we couldn't do anything anymore, that we had to stop. She was very sad after I said this. She didn't reply to me for hours, finally saying that it’s terrible the one thing that makes us both happy we can't do. Yeah. I agreed.\n\nAnother few days later, and we've still been messaging nearly all the time. We missed each other. She tells me she's been talking to John a lot more recently, and he brought up the idea of her and I going out. We still hadn't told him anything at this point, so he brought this up on his own. She said she'd really like it, and he told her he'd be okay with it, even if though it would make him really sad. Apparently (I  only found this out after me and her kissed) he flipped back and forth on this opinion a lot.\n\nTwo nights ago, I was particularly stressed and overwhelmed, and I switched my phone completely off and slept in way too late the next day. A few minutes after I woke up the next afternoon, there's a knock on my door and she shows up. We had plans to meet up with John and a group of our friends later that day, but she decided to come to me early. I'd literally just woken up minutes ago so after we talked for a bit I had a shower. After this we hugged and cuddled some more and this led to kissing. I don't want to be misinterpreted here - I'm not claiming \"one thing led to another and it just happened\". It didn't. We both willingly made the decision to do this, both of us thinking while John wouldn't exactly be happy about it, it would be okay. It'd make things hard, for sure, but we decided to prioritize our own happiness. We spent a lot of time together that day, and while it didn't ever go further than kissing, we did lose some items of clothing along the way. We were close. It was intimate.\n\nWe saw him later that day along with the big group of friends and I felt guilty - but also happy. I was with someone who cared about me as much as I cared about them. I was in a pretty good mood. I was going to tell him that night but Sarah asked me to wait. She told me we needed to decide what to say and we shouldn't do it that night cause it'll be a shit end to an great day. Terrible logic, I know, but I went with it. I told her the next morning how important it was for me to be the one to tell him - I felt like I needed to because I owed it to him. Like he'd do the same for me. She said she understood but proceeded to tell him herself. Alright, whatever. I thought it would be a manageable situation.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nHe immediately blocked me on all social medias, so I sent him a text trying to explain, saying I was sorry and most of all saying we should talk about the whole situation. I didn't get a response. She did, however. He said all sorts of things to her, including \"I'm never speaking to either of you again\" and \"I've lost both you\" and \"You've ruined everything\". Neither of us heard from him for a few days after that, and he still hasn't talked to me. To be clear, I'm not trying to hide from what we did. We’re both taking responsibility for it. We shouldn't have done what we did, at least not without talking to him first. I understand that, and we made a mistake. But I also feel like he's handling this really badly, considering the amount of things he has done to us and we have forgiven and talked to him about. \n\nJust after I finished typing all this, she messaged me saying she spoke to him last night. He said a lot of mean things to her, made her feel really guilty, and eventually gave her an ultimatum - he'll consider being friends with us again if me and her never see each other again in any way if he's not there. I had a few comments to say about this, but generally they were as follows:\n\nHe should also talk to me about this. He's blocked me everywhere and my texts went unanswered so I feel like it's now on him to talk to me. He should communicate with me as well as her. I told her I'm not even going to consider being friends with him again until he contacts me. I'm not trying again.\n\nHe simply can't ban two people from seeing each other. Yes, he can decide not to be friends with us and that's his choice, but this seems very Emily from *Friends* to me. It feels like a cheap sitcom plot and honestly it seems childish.\n\nAnd finally, I told her that I was angry at him now too. Up until now, I was just feeling bad about what we did and was worried I'd lost my best friend because of a stupid mistake. But now, with the way he's handled this and the things I've found out about the way he treated his relationship with her, I'm angry at him. I forgot to mention earlier, but when she brought up the fact he said he was okay with a potential relationship between me and her, he told her it makes it so much worse what we did because we knew it would make us sad. I thought this was a really stupid way to think about the whole situation, but I digress. Me and her are both still talking to each other, and still have a strong connection and feelings for each other.\n\nSo that's everything. Thanks to anyone who reads the whole thing. AITA,",

      "description": "WIBTA if I quit my job? \n\nI've recently started a new job. The job is interesting, the location is great, the working hours are good, the pay is OK (not great, but OK), there has been a little issue with lack of training/ work being piled on me but my main issue is with the office music....fairly hardcore niche dance music. Like proper Ibiza beach stuff - example: take Tracey Chapmans song Fast Car, speed it up so it sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks singing it and add a \"unch unch unch unch unch unch\" beat to it. \n\nSide note: this music is played through YouTube playlists from one particular staff members computer. \n\nI'm the oldest in the office (35 and female - not that gender makes much of a difference here) and the others are early-mid 20 females. I'm the first to admit that my musical taste is very specific and niche as I prefer music such as The Smiths, The Cure, Joy Divison, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds etc. I fully understand that I'm in the minority when it comes to musical taste and so have never - and will never - demand that my kind of music is played in the office. In fact, I absolutely dread being asked what kind of music I'm into as it almost always ends in a very awkward conversation with me naming bands they haven't heard of (and coming across as pretentious) and being forced to let them know I don't like the music they like (coming across as offensive).\n\nAnyway, I've tried to suggest a mixed playlist such as 90s or 80s music so there is a mix of music genres and it's only when I've really insisted on a change of music that we get a few 90s/80s hits but as soon as I leave the office to run an errand the music is changed back to dance tracks and it remains that way for the rest of the day.\n\nTo me, the dance music is not office music. It is a very specific music taste and not something everyone enjoys and I think it is very unfair to force such a niche music genre on everyone all day long, day after day. Sometimes I will hear the same dance song 4-5 times in one day.\n\nI've expressed my opinion on the music on many occasions and explained my reasonings as much as I can without it being too awkward (and considering I'm the new woman in an already established office set up) and I don't feel I can mention it anymore than I have already. However, it is also preventing me from being able to carry out my duties and it winds me up so much that I just can't concentrate on anything I'm doing.\n\nI am very seriously considering quitting the job because of this. It is having a big impact on me actually learning the job and I just can't continue to work in that environment.\n\nN.B I have considered requesting to wear headphones but I'm the main phone-answerer so it isn't feasible.\n\nAm I over-reacting? I am genuinely torn with this and welcome advice. If anyone needs to know further information please ask and I will give my answers honestly.\n\nThanks for reading you lovely Redditors! ",

      "description": "I travel a lot for school and today I happened to come down with the flu suddenly. I had to leave class early and just wanted to get back to my hotel and crash out. \nI checked in with no issues, got to my room and after setting my stuff down I hear someone trying to slide their card in my door. I kind of pause to see if it’s actually my door or my neighbors. By the time I get to the peephole they’re gone, I figure someone was at the wrong room, no biggie. \nSo I’m running a temp and take all my clothes off 5 minutes later to soak in the bath. Imagine my surprise when I hear someone try their card again- and it works! Yep. This random man is now standing in my hotel room like a deer in headlights and I’m so conveniently in my bra and underwear. The guy apologized, said this was the room they gave him to and goes downstairs. I call the front desk to let them know too and they were super casual about it, “whoops double booked that room sorry about that!” \nAnd while I get it, mistakes happen, now I’m paranoid it’ll happen again and can’t sleep. \nSo then I go to the vending machine for water (wrapped in a blanket looking like hell) and when I get back- locked out. I was slightly afraid of that hoping they didn’t deactivate his keys and mine to be safe, and hoping if they did they would let me know. \nSo off I went to the front desk, where no one was there. I rang the bell and waited for 25 minutes (not long but when you’re sick and just want to curl up in bed, feels like forever) \nThe guy activated my card quickly (didn’t ask my name or anything just the room number which added to my paranoia) and I was headed back to my room. \n\nSo I recognize I’m probably just extra crabby because I’m sick, so I’m probably being an asshole. I’m not trying to just save some money, but I’m really upset they brushed off double booking the room. Considering he tried at first, probably went downstairs to get it activated. They couldn’t see it was occupied? WIBTA if I asked for a partial refund or something?",

I had been asking them the day before where they wanted to go after getting candy, only one of my friends responded with a suggestion and the rest kept saying we’ll figure it out at the restaurant.\n\nThe day comes and we’re at the restaurant and the idea was that we were going to go to a mall afterwards, but one complained that we’d have to pay for parking so again we had no plan. After dinner, we all get in the car and I ask again before leaving where are we going after getting candy, everyone ignores except the one who is driving. We end up driving to Target as planned but all the good candy is gone so we don’t buy much. \n\nWe’re in the car again and I keep asking where to and again they ignore me, at this point I’m a little pissed off cause no one is saying anything and I don’t want my friend to just waste gas. Somehow we end up in a parking lot outside of Walmart, I get out thinking we were going to look for candy but I end up going to Walmart alone to buy gum and gatorade. When I get out I look for the car and it’s gone, they moved it to prank me. \n\nWe’re finally leaving the parking lot and one of my friends is mad at me for taking too long at Walmart and making them go there when it wasn’t even my suggestion. She keeps talking about how her mom is strict and that she’s going to blame me if she gets yelled at for getting home late (It’s about 10:00 PM). She then suggests that we should go to a smoothie place and then continues to say mean things to me along with two other friends. \n\nFinally, we’re leaving and go to drop her off and she proceeds to make fun of me and blames me for ruining the night. \n\nIn the end I felt bad for my friend who wes driving so I gave him some money for gas. I don’t think I am fault here because I kept asking for suggestions on where to go but I want to hear what you guys think.",

Things were going well until last night when she told me that the reason she started dating me is because she likes lilly white guys who she can protect. I was very hurt by this. I am a door stop for absolutely no one. Her color never mattered to me it was her personality (or the personality I thought she had) that I liked.

      "description": "This is gonna be a long one, so bare with me.\n\nTwo years ago I became best friends with this girl called T. About a year ago, she gave me this thimble her dead grandmother had given her. About half a year ago, I realized that my friendship with T was very toxic, So I wrote her a letter explaining everything, and telling her I didn't want to be her friend anymore.\n\nA few days ago, she asked me to give her back the thimble, because it was from her grandmother. I said yes, but that weekend I forgot, so when she texted me on Saturday and seemed worried, I lied and told her I had it in my bag, because I really thought I knew where it was and didn't want her to worry. Except that a few months before that, my brother decided he wanted my desk, and my mom told him he could come get it, despite me telling him not to and that he could get it another day, because it was full of my stuff, and my room was a mess. He came to get it anyway, I had a panic attack and hid until he left. While I was up there, he had dumped everything from my desk onto my floor.\n\nSo on Monday, I came clean to T, explained that I lied and had lost the thimble, and I apologized. That night I looked again, i even moved my bed to look under it, but I couldn't find it. Today, my friend F texts me and this happens.\n\nF: Hey I'm at T's place and she's talking about her thimble again\n\nMe: Idk what she wants me to do, she gave it to me a month ago, I had it up until a few months ago, my brother dumped my desk out onto my floor, and I've been looking for several days\n\nF: have you checked everywhere you could?\n\nMe: Yeah, I moved my fuckin bed to look for it.\n\nF:Well, T wanted me to tell you that if you can't find it you'll have to pay for it apparently\n\nMe:I'm not paying for something she gave me as a gift\n\nF: Idk what to tell you man, you know that thimble was from her great grandmother who died\n\nMe: I know that, and I'm sorry, but she made the decision to give that to somebody. And it's not like I just tossed it somewhere, it was in my desk for almost a year\n\nMe: Tell her I'm sorry, but I'm not paying for a gift I was given a year ago\n\nF: she wants to hear it in person\n\nI thought that was the end of it, until F sent me a text version of the letter I gave T last year. I said that was a bit petty but ok, and that if he doesn't want to be my friend he should tell me in his own words. He said he thinks I'm a liar, I asked how I'm a liar and he brought up the thimble thing. I said yes that was a was a shitty thing to do, but one instance doesn't make me a liar. He said there's more but he forgot, I said if he thinks of anything tell me, because I'm not a liar. He said that along with the lying thing, when he broke up with his ex, T was able to give him advice and make him feel better while I just sort of listened. I said that I'm sorry, I tried my best, but I'm not very good with emotions. He said it didn't seem like I tried.\n\nAITA? F was basically my only friend, I'm kinda freaking out.",

      "description": "Alright Reddit, here to settle the score between my fiancé and me. We are currently planning our wedding for June of 2020 and while it is a long way away, I know it will go fast and we’re the kind of people who like to schedule things well in advance so we are currently discussing honeymoon locations. Also should mention that we take a super long time to make big decisions (and little decisions sometimes too) partly because I’m pretty picky about a lot of things and partly because he is the most stubborn person I have ever met in my life. \n\nSo here is how we typically make decisions like this. We both lay out what we want and how badly we want it (absolutely necessary, would like it, would just be an extra perk, etc.) Here is what we both came up with. \n\nME: I want to go somewhere with a really nice beach (think beautiful turquoise water) no children, minimal interaction with other tourists and privacy. I also hate the act of traveling (like going through airport security, boarding the plane, etc but if fine when we get there) so I would like somewhere relatively close. I really just want to spend time just the two of us since we are long distance and will be up until the wedding. Anything else would just be a perk for me. \n\nFIANCÉ: also wants to go somewhere with a nice beach but he would prefer the pool over the beach. The pool must absolutely have a swim up bar. He also wants to be able to explore a new place he’s never been to before. Does not want to go to the Caribbean because we have been to Mexico and the Bahamas and he thinks it’s all the same. \n\nSo at first we thought about like the pacific islands. Beautiful beaches for me, places to explore for him. But then I thought about the entire day we would be spending traveling and wanted to throw up. Not to mention it’s a bit out of our budget. \n\nThen we started talking about one of the more secluded islands in the Caribbean. Antigua, Dominica, etc. but out of nowhere he says “we should go to Vietnam” and now, being his stubborn self, wants to go nowhere but there. I keep telling him that we can travel and see cool places after we’re married but that our honeymoon should just be about relaxing and spending time with each other. \n\nSo who’s the asshole here? Should I just go to Vietnam? It does have pretty scenery, it’s just not my idea of a honeymoon. \n",

      "description": "For background, I usually sleep with one air pod in my ear at night and it naturally falls out. I then find it in my sheets the next day. Despite how careless my actions sound considering how small air pods are, I have been doing this routine every night for over a year and I have never lost them. Usually one ruffle of the sheets and it is there. I also keep my room very clean so I would know easily if they had fallen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n A week ago, I invited one of my best friends (18M) to my house that I haven't seen in awhile. He has had a past history of doing immoral things (ex. stealing, scamming online market places).  But because he hasn't told me about doing those things in awhile and he's my best friend, I have no problem with him coming to my place. He also has little money to his name. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day my friend came over is the day I didn't grab the single air pod from my sheets. He came over and came into my room, laid in my bed, and we played video games. A few hours after he left, I went through my sheets and couldn't find my air pod. The other one was in its case, but the one that would have been in my bed was missing. I searched very extensively for it by going through all my sheets, looked under my bed, looked in the PJs I wore the night, and looked thoroughly in the vacuum cleaner bag (since I vacuumed the day before). I am positive they would have been in my sheets since I used it the night before. I messaged my friend asking if he saw it, and he just made a joke that if he saw it he would have taken it. It's been a week and they're still missing after more searching. I feel like he may have took it just to have one, since its trendy to own air pods. He may not even know they can connect to devices without the case, since he has never owned air pods. Would I be the asshole if I confront him one last time saying that I think he lied to me and took it?",

      "description": "21 F here getting married in June. My mom’s working on her 3rd divorce now but this is in reference to her first marriage and my first ex step dad.\n\nWhen I was 8 my mom and I lived in CA in a 3 bedroom apartment, we shared a room/bunk bed, and she rented the other 2 rooms out to tenants found on Craigslist. \n\nAlan moved into one of the rooms when I was 7. She started sleeping in his room and eventually they got engaged. \n\nHe had already abandoned 2 daughters from 2 previous marriages, he never put in any effort to get to know me, in fact he wouldn’t even acknowledge me when I was in the same room with him.\n\nAfter they got married I got the same treatment as before, sometimes worse. The only times he acknowledged me were to criticize the way I did my chores or to say whatever I had said in that moment was stupid. \n\nHe convinced my mom to move to UT so we left CA (separated from the only people who ever made me feel like a child, gave me the freedom to be a kid, my aunts and cousins).\n\nThey divorced when I was 13/14 (by this point my mom had 2 more kids) and he fled to live in Hawaii. During this time money was very tight so my mom and us 3 kids rented a 1 bedroom basement apartment.\n\nMy mom was working 2 jobs (day and night) so my schedule was as follows: \n\nM-F I would (try) to go to school, I would get home at 3, then my mom would leave and wouldn’t be home until the next morning when I had to leave for school again. \n\nYes, you read that right, I would watch (essentially raised) 2 babies from after school until the next morning for when I had to go to school. This included maintaining the house (laundry, dishes, dinner, vacuuming, cleaning up all the baby toys, etc), waking up several times a night to change diapers, and bottle feed the babies. \n\nSometimes I wouldn’t make it to school the next morning because I was so tired from the day/night prior. Eventually I got so behind I had to drop out. \n\nNow that I’m getting married my mom has realized she doesn’t want to be married to her current husband. She’s planning to break up with him 2 weeks before my wedding. She has arranged for the kids to go to Alan’s house for 2 weeks while shit hits the fan with her divorce.\n\nI have already told her that I don’t want him there since if he wanted to be at my wedding, maybe he should have shown some interest in me as a child. He very obviously didn’t give a shit about me or my future. \n\nI know full well my mom only wants him there for the social aspect and photo ops.\n\nShe called me this morning and said that during that time, she doesn’t feel comfortable asking Alan to just drop the kids off at my wedding (since they’ll still be with him during this time) and that he HAS to come or else my siblings won’t be in attendance.\n\nI tried to explain where I was coming from but she flipped it on me and now I feel like I’m making a big deal out of nothing so AITA?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I told my girlfriend that I don’t think she should work her main job?",
      "description": "I’ll start by saying that I’m not asking her to quit. I’d never do that, it’s just how I am. My girlfriend works at a popular supermarket chain, she started around 2 months ago. The job is easy, for the most part, but she’s never around because of this. Before she started working, we’d be able to see each other a lot. As most relationships work. But now that she’s scheduled for a majority of the week every week, she’s never around. But that’s the least of my worries.\n\nShe has a second job, the job she worked before the job she has now. She only covers people’s shifts sometimes, and because of this she takes shifts on days she has off. She works too much. Not because I won’t be able to see her, but because she has no time to eat. She wasn’t like this before working her new job. She keeps picking at her fingers, to the point where it hurts her. She’s constantly stressed out, and has little to no time to do her homework at home so she does it in school. Her parents have told her that they’re not forcing her to work, and she can quit if she wants to. I feel bad because I encouraged her to apply to her new job, and now I realize that it might not be the best for her to work there anymore. \n\nWe were texting last night, and she was super anxious because she felt like she ate too many gummy bears. Because recently, she’s been eating almost nothing all day. The past month or so, she just hasn’t been herself. She was scheduled for every day this week minus Thursday, but she took off Friday and Saturday to be with her best friend on their birthday. Thursday, she took a shift at her other job. I do honestly think she works way too much, and it’s not healthy for her.\n\nHere’s where the AITA part kicks in. I don’t want her to quit, even if it may be better for her. If I told her how I feel about this, I know she’ll overthink it and think too much into it. She’ll probably think that I do want her to quit, and she’ll think she’s a bad girlfriend because she’s always at work and never has time for me (which isn’t true on the weekends, but I have work Sunday so we can only go out Saturday and whenever she doesn’t have work.) She’s not a bad girlfriend at all, and I don’t want her to think that. She has before, for similar reasons, and I don’t think it’s fair that she has to think into things like this so much. I don’t know if I can tell her. The earliest I can see her is probably Tuesday, since I have work Sunday and Monday and she’s going to be at her friends’ for her birthday. Help me out please, because I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want her to feel down like this. I don’t want her stressing out so much because she doesn’t eat because of work. But I don’t want her to overthink everything, and maybe feel worse if I did tell her.",

      "description": "Keeping pretty vague for privacy reasons, but I hope this is enough info to consider voting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (age: 20's) found out last year that my Father had been cheating on my Mother for over 1 year. My Father only admitted to cheating after he was confronted by another family member. His apologies, which I and everyone else in the family have NOT CHOSEN TO ACCEPT, have consisted of yelling \"I said I was sorry!\". The little amounts of info that my Mother and other family members understand are through 1) threatening emails sent by the other women that were received by my Mother and 2) emails sent and received by my Father which were revealed without his knowledge. Needless to say, my understanding does not paint my Father in a good light. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be graduating from school in May, but I have already been accepted to another school, so this graduation will not be my last. I have still not been able to forget or forgive how my Father has hurt my Mother. My Mother is also battling a recurrent medical condition that was determined to be primarily stress-induced. I also know that my Mother only plans to stay with my Father until she can retire. Although I worry about my Mother's health, she states that at this time, she will not budge on her marital status. My other family members and best friends are also not very fond of my Father especially after finding out that my Father cheated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am conflicted on whether it is okay to remove my Father from a school graduation milestone in my life. But, at this time, I do not feel as though I would regret not having him in pictures during this time in my life. Another issue is other family members that I would want present may not be willing to come to my graduation if they knew my Father would be there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be the asshole for not wanting to invite my Father to my graduation?",

Last December I made some not very choice decisions and ended up getting my new GF at the time pregnant...\n\nSo my pregnant GF just informed me that she's being treated for chlymidia... I've only been with two wemen in the past 8 years and my last SO had 2 children and got STD testings each time... I know 100% I didn't cheat and since I've been with my new GF, we've lived together for just about every day of our relationship and I kinda would have noticed she was cheating and why would she have told me..? Also my new GF had an STD test in October and it came back clean...\n\nSo I'm really confused as to how this happened but when I asked my SO to go get tested, she had a shit fit and it was not a fun time (obviously)...",

      "description": "Hi all - I recently had what I thought was an interesting ethics debate with my friend (I'll call him Hans) about something that happened to him last summer. He was recounting a night in a London bar with another pal of his (Frank), specifically how he and Frank felt they had been wronged by a bartender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHans and Frank approach the bar to purchase drinks. Frank orders one G&amp;T. \n\n\"What about two? You're not nearly drunk enough yet!\" the bartender says. Frank looks at the discount for buying two (G&amp;Ts are 10 each but two for 17) and declines. The bartender pauses.\n\n\"You can just pay for one and I'll give you two. Don't tell anyone.\" Frank agrees and pays the 10 pounds. At this point, the bartender serves him a single G&amp;T.\n\n\"Hey, you were gonna give me two,\" Frank says. The bartender raises his arms and says he actually can't. Frank gets angry about this and they have a brief verbal confrontation. Hans diffuses the situation and they leave.\n\nI was surprised that my friend had even remembered this incident. I would've found it a little annoying, but not left feeling as if I had been cheated. Hans and Frank had the opinion that they had formed an agreement to exchange 10 pounds for two G&amp;Ts, and that the bartender was obligated to honor that agreement or notify Frank that the terms had changed before serving him the first drink. I felt that I wouldn't have necessarily thought to do this if I was the bartender. Frank had initially wanted to purchase a single drink for 10 pounds, I thought, and even reaffirmed this after being offered a second drink, so the bartender was fine to assume that he was still interested in purchasing the first for 10. It would've been polite for him to confirm, but not an ethical obligation of his. My friend characterized it as a bait and switch given the bartender wouldn't refund Frank's money.",

      "description": "Hey, so I just wanted to know if I am at fault here because I feel kinda guilty and have been getting mixed messages.\n\nMy dad has been very depressed for much of my life and started to reach farther in to alcoholism when I was around nine or ten. There were many times when he would drink a crap ton, take sleeping pills, and pass out instead of pulling through on responsibilities. Usually after this he would have a big family apology in which he would do a bit of guilt-tripping, and would promise to never touch another drop. He always touched another drop maybe a few months later.\nI know that he’s been through a lot in his life, and I know that depression can destroy a person beyond any recognition, but at some level I think that only explains the issues rather than excusing them. These issues are certainly difficult to fix, and I don’t expect them to be fixed instantly, but at the same time I kinda started losing respect for him because of them.\nI’m worried that I’m only thinking about how I feel with this in a selfish way instead of thinking about what he goes through, but at the same time I know that he caused me a lot of worry and anger and guilt when I was very young, to the point where my biggest fears were finding him dead and/or becoming an alcoholic.\n\nI don’t know if I should feel guilty over this or not, and really need some other points of view.\nIf you have any questions I’ll be happy to respond.\n\n\n",

      "description": " \n\nI wanna start by saying that I've been in her position, and not like \"oh I've been depressed\" I mean like I have literally been in and out of that ward and know what it's like anyway.\n\nMy friend is early 20's, female and married with two kids. She's been having a tough time and has been diagnosed with depression, eventually she was admitted to the psych ward after asking to be for further assessment. During this time she's made some comments and done some things that have really pissed me off and I'll give you the top two.\n\nFirst she made a post on FB saying something along the lines of \"i wanna go home I'm not crazy just depressed\", she went on to laugh and joke about some of the others who were psychotic and hallucinating and saying that some are just weird. This annoyed me to no end because I hate labeling people with mental illness as crazy, more so I was one of those \"crazies\" hallucinating and what not while I was in there but regardless I find her comments tasteless and down right shitty\n\nThen when I saw her she told me that a nurse said something that upset her (essentially saying you have kids to think about and can't be overdosing and stuff), I don't agree with what he said, or at least not the way he said it. She went on to tell me, while laughing, that she flipped a table and threw a plate/food at his face, saying it was so funny and she laughed after she did it. Now this pissed me the hell off, I now work at a hospital (different one) and I've had all sorts thrown at me, but I never blamed the patient because they weren't aware (see: post op delirium sucks, UTI's turn grandma into the hulk and fuck dementia), she on the other hand knew what she was doing and not only found thought it was hilarious but said she'd do it again (she didn't like this nurse). I also want to say she has no history of rage or anger issues\n\nI get that she's in a bad place, but I feel like her actions were shitty and childish. It's really made me reevaluate her as a person and as a friend if I'm honest but the more I think about it the worse I feel about judging her because I know it's hard when you're feeling so low and I know I haven't always been the nicest when I'm sick but I would never do that. When it comes to metal illness and throwing judgement around I just feel like a total asshole and it all hits a little to , so reddit, am I?",

      "description": "In my english class, there are these two very irritating girls who constantly bring up social issues especially relating to gay rights and transgender rights, this is partly because in English class, social and political issues are brought up occasionally and they are very outspoken on their support for those two groups. Anyways, I was sitting in class just before the bell rung, when my two friends are walking in and in their conversation, they say that a certain mutual friend of theirs is a \"faggot\", just as part of regular banter, when one of the girls, we'll call R, hears this and goes ballistics and starts loudly saying that it's 2019, why are you still saying words like that when gay people are oppressed and that they're adding to the problem and what not, I at first decided not to intervene, but when she kept going on for a few minutes, and was just talking over my friends, not allowing them to defend themselves, I had enough. I went over to her and told her to shut the hell up and also said that \"you know there's people right now who are starving to death, who are suffering from cancer, have had their limbs amputuated, or born with congenital defects, and all you're concerned about is people not being able to have sex with others, really, that's the biggest issue in society for you?, fuck right off!\" This made her cry and I didn't see for the rest of the day, I'm pretty sure she went home after that. Maybe I shouldn't have humiliated her that bad, but I don't know AITA? ",

      "description": "Today my mom got back from work and we were gonna have hamburgers. My two sisters and I are in highschool and I was had just washed dishes and was going to take out the cat litter. When I was taking out the cat litter I accidentally got some on my hands and I made a \\*Tsk\\* sound, my mom asked \"What's wrong?\" and I replied in a calm voice, \"Don't worry about it.\" I finished taking out the litter and washed my hands. I took a nap, and when I woke up, burgers were done and I was putting on a movie I wanted to share with my mom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here comes the part that had the incident. When I was making my burger, I was finishing putting the buns on top of each other, when I slipped and dropped them both but was able to catch them, but dropped a bunch of pickles and tomatoes. When I dropped the pickles I was in the process of dropping a bomb, but instead turned it around to \"Fuindle.\" I was then getting ready to clean up the mess when my mom started yelling at me \"Why are you so angry?\" before I could reply that I'm not angry she says, \"You only speak to me in an angry voice and you're trying to scare me!\" I was kinda shocked. So I told her IN A CALM VOICE, \"I'm not angry, I just dropped my pickles. Don't worry, I'm cleaning them up.\" She then said, \"Yeah right! You're just blowing me off! Why can't you just f\\*cking answer me like earlier?\" My older sister (who is pregnant) started crying and my mom started crying, then my mom got on her coat and got in her car then drove away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe proceeded to have a 'conversation' over the phone. I'm a little confused as to what we're 'fighting' about but if you guys understand, please let me know if I'm the asshole and what I did wrong. Here's the texts we shared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom: You know I love you and let you get away with a lot of crap. I take up for you even when you don't know it. It hurts me though to have you talk to me in the time you do.\n\nMom: Maybe I'm sensitive but I feel that you should know how your words make me feel. It seems I mean nothing to but an irritation.\n\nMe: If it'll fix what's wrong with my speech we can have a civil discussion where we talk about what's 'wrong' with my speech and how to fix it. Or I can just text everything. I typed most of this before reading your second text.\n\nMom: I would like that but to be honest I don't think I could dream of talking right now.\n\nMe: If we don't talk about it, we can't fix it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is exactly what was stated in every text we sent.",

      "description": "This happened a while ago while I was still in college, around Christmas.\n\nI was working in retail at the time and this random new hire started flirting hard with me. We seemed to hit it off rather quickly and all of our coworkers were saying stuff like \"you'd be great together!\" and \"oh man, she's always talking about you, you're lucky\"\n\nWe went out several times, and decided it'd be cool to go to a hookah lounge since she'd never been to one. I pick her up, I pay for our seats and drinks/food (at this point we'd never paid for each other before but she claimed to be low on money after having some family issues) and we hang out for about an hour. The place was a state over, probably a 45 minute drive.\n\nAs I'm enjoying what feels to be a nice night, out of nowhere she casually says \"oh, by the way, I'm not looking for anything serious.\"\n\nI was kinda sad but understood, more upset that she wasted my time and money at this point. Then I find out through the grape vine, and I'm shown texts from one of our coworkers, that she'd been hooking up with my friend (strictly work friend, thankfully) pretty much the entire time we were going out. He didn't know she was seeing me either, and flipped out on her for doing that to both of us.\n\nI was so pissed off that when I got back to work after a couple days off, I spot my North Face jacket I let her borrow on the coat rack and put it into my locker. It just happened to be during a snow storm. She just kinda...claimed my jacket after that night. When she leaves for the night, she texts me something along the lines of \"THANKS A LOT ASSHOLE!\"\n\nEveryone, even our manager and the other guy she was seeing had a good laugh about it. AITA?",

      "description": "Apologies if it doesn’t fit, this is the only judgment sub I know. \n\nI started my RPG dice collecting hobby/obsession when I got into D&amp;D in college and throughout the years I’ve been slowly increasing my collection. I had loans and a part time job then so most of that money went to loans but I would buy 2-3 sets of dice on special occasions like my birthday or if I did well on finals. My family don’t approve of this since in their mind, I could be spending it on more important things.\n\nAnyway I graduated college a few months ago (changed my major several times) and working at a permanent, full time job that’s related to my major. It pays well, I still live with my parents, and I should be loan free in 2-3 months. But I went to PAX last week where I dumped $300 on dice. These were the novelty, expensive ones, I’m talking gemstone and metal dice. I’ve never spent this much on dice at once, the ones I bought in the past were plastic $10-15 ones. But I figured it was fine as I wasn’t planning on making it a daily habit, more like a once a year thing.\n\nMy family was not happy when they found out, said I could’ve spent it on other things like shoes and clothes. I will admit my collection is big, I have like 25-30 sets plus an additional 7 Kickstarter sets that should be delivered soon.\n\nI regularly play D&amp;D so I do use them but maybe I was irresponsible with my money. I mean you can’t really use dice in everyday situations compare to clothes. So AITA?",

      "description": "Movie night with friends and GF. Snowstorm's raging outside. I shoveled most of my driveway but the snow in the neighborhood roads is still pretty deep. My best friend (male) and my GF are the first ones to show up so the three of us chill and are watching some TV when I get a call that my other friends, carpooling together in a van, got stuck in the neighborhood streets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  bundle up and head out to help dig them out. My friend volunteers to come with but I say hell naw because he's not dressed for it (jeans and a hoodie when it's -40'C with windchill? PLEASE.) Everyone makes it alive to my doorstep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get in and warm up only to find my GF visibly upset. Everybody just kinda ignores it while they shrug off their jackets and stomp their boots of snow before coming inside. So I sit down next to my GF, wrap my arms around her and whisper to her to ask what's up? She immediately, and loudly, says, \"Go ask your friend,\" and starts shooting daggers out of her eyes at him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhole room is silent. I look a question at my friend again, and his face is pure 'WTF just happened'. My GF accuses him of being saying things that made her feel uncomfortable (no touching, just words), and my friend denies them. The whole conversation goes back and forth for a few minutes, and finally she stares at me and says, \"Why aren't you saying anything!?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell my friend to wait outside, then realize it's a dick move, but it's done. I take my GF to the kitchen and get her side of the story. Then I go outside and get my friend's side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a classic he-said-she-said sort of situation. I know relationships aren't a court of law so 'innocent until proven guilty' doesn't work when feelings are involved. I feel my GF wouldn't make a big deal over nothing, but I also feel my friend isn't the type of arse who would hit on my GF and play dumb. So now I'm stuck between my personal beliefs and 100% pissing off my GF. Knowing 100% that I am dooming our relationship, I let my friend back inside because there's just no proof (cue the executioner's bell).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe both come back inside and my GF looks appalled that he's even allowed back inside. The accusations and denials fly again and she storm upstairs into my master bedroom and slams the door shut. I give her some time before one of my girl friends (platonic) and I soldier on upstairs. I knock and she tells me to f\\*\\*\\* off so my girl friend knocks and she's allowed inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been a few hours now, everyone else is just chilling and I am typing this all up in all its AITA glory to debase myself before you all for judgment.",

      "description": "V day coming up, hope this won’t happen to y’all. This happened a while ago actually. \n\nLong story short: my (ex) boyfriend and I had been long distance (&gt;500mi) for over a year.\nHe had always been quite irresponsible and unreliable at times when it came to making me happy. Personally, I always put in the effort to make him happy, such as always putting work aside to talk about his anxieties, giving money for him to eat when he runs out (he goes to school while I work a job), and he recognized that I took this relationship very seriously and appreciated me for my efforts, which I had been thankful for. \n\nSo we coped with our distance by seeing each other every month and planning fun activities, and this time (In October) I flew over to visit him for a week that I had taken off. Building up to this dinner, I had been mad at him for something for a while, and he was always promising me to make it up to me by taking me out to this restaurant he said he’s always been wanting to take me. \n\nSo the big day comes and we head out on a Saturday night. The restaurant was nice and I was in a great mood—until he told me he left his wallet at home. \n\nI got complete upset at him. I felt like he didn’t care, about me or about this dinner enough—if he did he wouldn’t have made such a basic error. For the whole dinner I was just pretty upset and didn’t really talk to him much, and he said that I was ruining what would have been a great night by focusing on such a small error. From my perspective, this small error revealed his lack of care and attentiveness—would you forget your pencils for the SAT, or forget your passport when you’re flying? He disagreed and said I was overreacting. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hi! \nSo basically, i’ve had issues that have caused me to lie specifically for attention (important) for my whole life. I recently started going to therapy for these problems and yesterday i finally admitted to my boyfriend everything i’ve lied to him about in our relationship. We didn’t break up and he basically just said he really needed time to think about everything and consider how we can best go forward and rebuild the trust between us. I started getting really anxious waiting for him to get out of work to talk so i decided to go to the neighboring city to distract myself. It’s about 45 minuets away. I locked my keys out of my car and so I tried to call a lock smith but it was too expensive.  So then i tried to call the police but there was an event going on so they didn’t have squad cars to send to me, so the most they could do for me was call a tow truck to come unlock it and i would be responsible for the payments. I texted my friends who weren’t working and they were at school. Around this time my boyfriend was going on break so I told him the situation and he texted his best friend but he was at an event and wasn’t in town for the day. At this point he started telling me it sounded like i was lying.  So i sent him pictures of my car and the stores around me and my location being in that city. He told me if i was telling the truth i could wait until after he got out of work and i would have no issue with that if i was telling the truth. This all happened at about 3pm and he doesn’t get out of work until 10pm. I didn’t know what else to do so i just sat on the curb and waited. Finally he gets out of work and asks me where i am and i tell him in the exact same spot. He drives to me and finds me. I was extremely upset at him because the temperature dropped to around 40 and he left me stranded in a parking lot for hours. But i also understand it was a real boy who cried wolf situation. So. AMITA for being super upset at my boyfriend for this? Or did he have a right to not believe me?",

      "description": "Sorry it's long! Bit of a backstory here. We bought our first house about a year and a half ago. We get along with all our neighbors (even the ones across the street whose kids have hit my truck with their basketball from time to time. Even though I don't witness it, they're very respectful, knock on my door, and apologize). I know all my neighbors. We're on a corner lot so we have the neighbors that live \"behind\" us. When we first moved in they came to greet us, my kids played with theirs, we even got the \"if you need anything let us know. I work for x company so if you need help with something, we can work something out.\"\n\nOne of the first big projects I had was removing 13 trees off my lot. The roots had already destroyed the sprinkler lines, were headed toward my foundation, and the pool had started showing bulging. I needed the root system gone. So, naturally, I went to my neighbor since his company has large machinery for what I wanted to do. He offered to get me a quote and bring the equipment over to my place if I didn't have the truck to do it -- just to give him a day to get back to me. I didn't hear from him again so I hired someone else. A couple months later, we get a winter storm that knocked down our fence shared with this neighbor. I went to talk to him, offered to do all the labor myself and put in half for materials. He then used the excuse that the previous owner had made it clear to him that the fence would be her responsibility. I reminded him I'm not the previous neighbor. He said he'd look into materials cost and see what he could do. At this point I knew it was a lost cause. It was 2 weeks until Christmas and my backyard was completely exposed. I filed a homeowner's insurance claim and hoped for the best. I received enough to cover most of the costs, but still paid out of pocket for some of the material. I did all the labor. The entire time, this guy never looked at me, asked if he could help, greeted me, thanked me, or acknowledge my presence while I worked on the (now mine) fence. A few days later on Christmas, I hear a new dirt bike and see his daughter riding a new bicycle down the street. \n\nNow, it's winter again and the leaves have fallen. I got rid of 13 trees for a reason, but because he hasn't maintained the tree he said he would, all his leaves have fallen into my pool, continually stress my pump, and fill up the bag on my pressure vacuum. Some nuts from his tree fell into my pool during the summer and broke my previous sweeper, causing me to purchase a new one that cost nearly $800. \n\nThis morning, I left him a note asking he please do something about the tree like he said he was going to do nearly 2 years ago. I reminded him I already paid for a fence and I don't feel like paying for things that could be easily avoided. AITA for doing that or should I just suck it up and continue doing my thing, not riling anyone up?",

      "description": "TL;DR - my SO of 12 years fails to meet me with his side of the bargain when we decided to be better about giving gifts. I’m getting frustrated. \n\nTo start out, I’m 26F and my fiancé is 27M, and we have been together for 12 years. We’ve lived together for the past 7 years, and have two small children, 5 &amp; 2. We have a mostly happy life, but the past few years, we’ve gone through a bit of a rough patch financially, so we stopped giving each other gifts for holidays and birthdays, except for the kids. We share finances. \n\nTwo years ago, we decided we would get back to giving each other gifts, even if it was a card, trinket, etc. Nothing crazy, small gifts. He agreed and seemed excited.\n\nSince then, I have given him gifts for his birthday, Father’s Day, Christmas, and sometimes for no other reason than I love him. Most recently for Valentines Day, I gave him a beard care kit ($10), a mug ($3), a card from the kids and I, and some candy. I set it up as a surprise for him to go into his office and find and I was really excited for him to see it because I enjoy doing special things like that for him.\n\nHe showed no emotion, gave a half hearted thanks, and hasn’t made any motion towards reciprocating the gift giving. I’m getting increasingly frustrated because it is now past V-Day with no signs of any kind of plan in motion. \n\nHe does work night shift. I’m trying to be accommodating and understanding, but I’m really sad. I’ve talked to him several times over the past year about it, and his response is that he has no idea what I like. \n\nI understand that gift giving might not be his love language, but I have communicated how much it means to me that he meet me in the middle of our deal and he tells me he will get better, but it doesn’t change.\n\nI’m not trying to be selfish, and I feel conflicted because should I really be this upset over material things? Probably not, but I can’t help it. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Ok some backstory, my dad's family lives in China but my we live in Australia. I've never been close to my dad's side of the family. My dad's great, but his family, not so much. \n\nThey believe men are superior to women and hate me, my sister and my mum. Whenever we come and visit any of them, they constantly try to convince my mum to have a son and shit talking us, saying that women are useless and are only good for housework and having children. \n\nThey also constantly demand money and goods as if we owe them something, but every time we visit, they never do any favors for us.\n\nNow one of my uncle's has a son and we've only met once, and can tell he was raised by my dad's family. He's treted like a god in there family bwcause he's the only boy in the second generation. So basically he doesn't have the best grades in school and he's doing his final exams this year. \n\nMy dad's side of the family wants us to let him into our house to study in Australia if he fails. They also expect us to cover the whole cost of his learning and other necessities. They won't even pay a single cent to pay us back, since were 'family'. \n\nSo obviously I'm pissed, my mum's pissed and we dont want this kid in our house at all. But its hard to convince my dad to say no to his family so my mum's plans to convince him by telling him that if we pay for that asshole's tution, me and my sister won't be able to go to uni.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting someone that my dad and his family care for in our house\n",

      "description": "I've been married for 3 years. Together for almost 10. I met my wife in high school at a party. We exchanged numbers and ended up texting a bit and meeting up again at a second party a couple of weeks after. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I first met my now wife, I was at the time involved with another girl, who we'll call Lily (not in an exclusive relationship though). The night of the aforementioned second party, my wife and I ended up talking for a bit and then spending most of the night making out in an empty bedroom (like I said, we were in high school). Her friends wanted to leave early so she left, and we both said we were interested in seeing each other again. All was well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter she left the party, I was ecstatic. Lily was not. I told Lily earlier in the night that I was no longer interested in pursuing anything with her anymore because I was smitten with my now-wife, which I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, we kept on drinking and eventually I ended up hooking up with Lily. She told me to meet her in a bedroom and I ended up going down on her, but stopped things very shortly into the encounter and left because I knew I really wanted to try and pursue something with what would become my future wife.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I cut off contact with Lily the next day. I ended up going on my first real date with my now wife a few weeks after that incident and within another month we were officially dating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here? I've never talked with my wife about that night, but she does know that Lily and I had a thing  when we first met and that I cut things off with Lily to pursue a relationship with her. She knows that Lily tried to contact me in the early stages of our relationship. I am very happy in my marriage and my wife is my best friend. All of this seems silly but I was thinking about the incident today and thought an AITA is in order.",

      "description": "So basically, I'm a psychology student in my graduating year, and around last year I borrowed a psychology book from a friend of my sister (I honestly don't remember if I did give my thanks, it was quite a while ago). \n\nAnyway, a few days ago, the person I borrowed it from asks me if I still use the book, to which I replied \"no, I don't use it anymore\", she replies with an \"Ok\" and we leave it at that. The book was returned yesterday by my sister, and when she got home she asked me why I didn't say thank you for borrowing the book. I say that it slipped my mind, and now she's telling me to message her a thank you for the book. At this point, I feel giving a thank you out of obligation just feels off, so I just decide against it and leave our conservation as is. \n\nJust as a side note, I realize this shit sounds really trivial, but it actually really bugs me since I'm not good at dealing with this sort of stuff, and I don't wanna look like a dick. I acknolwedge that I tend to be kind of apathetic sometimes, I know that much at least. My sister didn't really call me an asshole, but I sure as hell feel that way because of how things turned out.

      "description": "So a little bit of background. I'm 24 now. I have always been a socially awkward person through childhood and early college. I never got attention from any women, and most of my love life in high school consisted of having crushes reject the hell out of me. \n\nWell as a result of that, I developed a yearning for attention. It's not some huge need, but when someone praises me I am basically happy for the rest of the day. \n\nI've had a few girlfriends but this current one is the longest. I am happy with her. Over the years I've become way more mature and socially capable. I'm still not great, still a bit shy at times, but I can make a presence now and people actually *like* me. \n\nWell at work, I've worked with a few women who seem flirtatious with me. Not in a blatant way, but subtle. I might be completely wrong too, they might just be friendly, but whatever. \n\nI won't lie... I like it. I don't flirt back ever, and I keep conversations short if it's outside of work. I have never touched them physically outside of a handshake, I don't compliment them, I don't talk to them more than other people, I don't sit near them. \n\nBut I like the attention. Makes me feel attractive. Part of me wants them to flirt. It's not them either. It's not that *this specific person* is flirtatious and I enjoy it. It's the fact that *anyone* (outside of my girlfriend) is giving me that kind of attention and genuinely interested. \n\nAgain, even if it's not true, and they're just being friendly, I am receiving it as subtle flirting. And I'm enjoying that. Does that make me the asshole? ",

In the last 2 years, I’ve come to find out that, of course, that’s not the case. \n\nMy mom manipulated my dad into a relationship, manipulated him into taking care of my brother (who is not biologically my dads, but my dad has been raising him since he was a year old), manipulated him into not wrapping his willy resulting in me, and has manipulated my brothers and I our entire lives. Currently, I am 18 years old and living with my dad on a farm and I couldn’t be happier to be living here. My dad has always done what’s best for me and my brothers and I could never repay him for all that he’s done for us despite what we have put him through. I love him to death and couldn’t imagine my life without him. I love my mom too. She was my best friend when I didn’t have any friends. But now I’ve come to realize that she is also the reason I didn’t have friends. \n\nI love my mom and always will. But she has a lot of issues to work out that I can’t help with. But she thinks I’m the asshole because I abandoned her by moving out. She thinks I don’t ever take her feelings into consideration despite stressing myself out on a daily basis to make sure that she doesn’t stress. At this point I’m just done and I can’t sacrifice my wellbeing because my mom doesn’t want to be happy. My dads gf is telling me that if I love her I need to let her go and let her fix herself. So, AITA for not wanting a relationship with her?\n\nI’d be happy to answer any questions you might have:) thanks for reading ",

      "description": "I matched with a guy on a dating app, and we hit it off right away. We had a lot of interesting video chats and about 3 weeks after our first talk we decided to meet up.\n\nSince he was happy to drive during rush hour just to meet me (which could easily double his travel time) I said I would be paying for the entirety of our date. This included tickets for 2 separate events (researched and agreed upon by both of us), and dinner in the evening (restaurant we both liked), which he insisted he would pay for. We also agreed to keeping it very casual.\n\nHe travels the 1h40m to make it here, and we meet at a local mall. Immediately I can tell something is off, he's looking half disappointed, half annoyed. After we exchange a \"hello\" hug, next words out of his mouth are \"Just look at all these people walking around, is everyone is making more money than I am? I bet I'm the poorest person here\". \n\nThings kind of went downhill from there.\n\nIn between any casual and familiar conversation we had, there were several comments like: \n\n* Oh we have the fancy seats? Oh wow, people will look at me and think I'm some kind of rich spoiled guy. *(I could afford \"good\" seats (not insane VIP ones, just good ones) so I went for it)* \n\n* Oh yea, of course you would be driving a brand new BMW, I don't know what I was expecting. I bet that's the least expensive car in your parking lot *(my car is not brand new, just... clean and scratch-free)* \n\n* Of course you would need a reservation for this place, I mean, why wouldn't you? Look at this, I'm scared I'd break a glass, and it will cost me a week's rent. I am definitely out-classed here. *(it was just a nice restaurant I would expect to find in any average-sized town)* \n\n* Your hair is so soft, and you smell so good. What kind of shampoo do you use? -Never mind, I doubt I can afford it. \n\n...and many, MANY more.\n\nJust picture (if possible) someone having a half desperate, half smug expression, and quite the defeated tone while making them. I either chuckled, remained silent, or changed the subject after each one.\n\nHowever much I liked hanging out with him, every time he would make a comment like that, I felt incredibly uncomfortable. We had discussed our jobs, and his income is average nationally, somewhat low for his area, which is significantly poorer than mine, mostly because mine is STUPID CRAZY expensive. It is also the home of many well-known companies, and the salaries are highly competitive, if only to compensate for the insane cost of living. For where I live, I make average money at best.\n\nThe next day, I messaged him that while I appreciated his company and think he is a great guy, I would not be pursuing another date with him, and wished him all the best.\n\nSo, in a way, it is not inaccurate to say I don't want to continue seeing him because of our difference in income, but more specifically t was his comments/behavior when it comes to said difference. \n\nAm I the asshole he, and some of my friends, say I am?",

At first I had no real problem with it as I did not know what an mlm was, but I have since done some research and don't agree with Plexus or any other company of this type practices. On top of this my mother started making claims and pushing me to drop my antidepressants ,I was diagnosed with clinical depression a few years back,  in favor of some other supplements sold by her company. So I decided to sit her down and explain the research I had done, and why I no longer wanted to take any product made made by Plexus. She flipped out. Started yelling at me about how I'm unsupportive of her dreams, and how I'm so selfish and don't understand that all she wants to do is make some cash. ( I didn't say I wanted her to quit Plexus, just that I no longer wanted to participate) I decided to drop it, and just spit out the pills when she wasn't looking. Since I've started doing that though Ive felt really sick on days I don't take her pills (cold sweats, nausea, excessive need to go to the bathroom. Its a fun time ) So now Im unsure of what to do as I don't know the pills contents either. Am I an ass for not wanting to take her pills? Should I just suck it up and take them? ",

      "description": "I have been dating my girlfriend for two years and love spending time with her. We've been asked a couple of times to go out on double dates with other couples in the past, and I have no problem with it if I know both of the people. \n\nMy girlfriend recently said that we should take a weekend trip to Missouri (we currently live in Chicago IL) with her two friends and their boyfriends to do a weekend triple date. I know her two friends and have a good relationship with them since we all go to college together, but I'm not as close with them as she is. However, I've never met the two people that they are both dating (neither of them go to college with the four of us), so this doesn't sound like a fun trip to me. My worry is that it will turn into the three of them hanging out and me trying to force a conversation between the other two guys the whole trip. I tried to tell my girlfriend that it doesn't sound enjoyable for me since I don't know either of the two guys and we'd be practically living with them for a weekend after just meeting them. She got frustrated when I started telling her that I wasn't really up for it and said \"not to raise my voice at her\" (this conversation was over the phone). I didn't think I was raising my voice, but I may have been trying to talk over her I guess? I'm not sure. I asked her if she could see where I was coming from, and she just said to change the subject. \n\nWe've gone on a double date before where I didn't know the other guy but I did know her good friend and it wasn't horrible. I wasn't too thrilled about that one either, but it wasn't too awkward. I got to know him and we eventually found something we had in common (yay for Star Wars fans). I told her before that date that I wasn't really up for it either, but she said that her friend really wanted to do it so we should just do it.\n\nIn the past she's taken a trip with me to my home town and has met a lot of my old friends that she didn't know beyond my descriptions of them. I really appreciate her doing that, and I want to try to provide her the same courtesy. I just don't like the idea of how awkward it could be. A party/brunch is way different than a weekend in another state with people I don't know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I definitely did fuck up to some degree and I’m overall trying to fix the situation, but I feel that I’m not entirely in the wrong, at least, and want some strangers to either validate me or tell me I’m being a little bitch. Anyway\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo yesterday, my girlfriend, who is bi but not out to many people, sent me a post about a gay weekend at a ski mountain she’s gone to a few times and was jokingly offended she didn’t get an invitation. I called her “hella gay” and she agreed. In order to continue the joke, I then said that she was dating a man (me) which is pretty fuckin’ straight of her. She said “are you kidding” and then said she didn’t want to talk to me, before actually being unable to talk due to work. \n\nWhen she comes back I call her a pet name, and she tells me not to call her that. I apologize, use another, only to be told not to call her anything, to which I apologize again, not only for using pet names when she’s not in the mood but also for previously upsetting her. I do, however, say that I was just trying to make a joke, and she goes into how she thought she could trust me in talking about her sexuality with me and how I have never called her straight as a joke before, and it hurts because while she’s fine with hella gay being that gay is a blanket term, being called straight reminds her of people who say bi people in straight relationships are just straight. I repeat that I was just mocking that behavior, and say that I had previously made the exact joke, and recently. She says she doesn’t remember, so I find a screenshot from the weekend where she said she felt gay and I said “and you find me hot? That’s pretty fuckin’ straight” to no ill effects. She then said “fuck you” and “you always have to be right” before telling me not to talk to her. \n\nI oblige for a bit, then text her a paragraph of apology which she responds by saying she can’t forgive me until I apologize in person. \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Local lurker with a throw away for today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to school in a large city on the  coast of the US, I switched colleges from a cheap to more expensive school, thinking it would be better for my major. The rent is 2-3 times higher here so I can't rent like I did at my previous school without pulling out a bunch of private student loans; I'm already 50K in debt and want to avoid privates as much as possible.\n\nI moved in with my aunt and uncle who I'm on good terms with, or so I thought, and they let me sleep on the air mattress in the gaming room on the top floor and eat their food, though I do try to buy myself meals as much as possible, but I will resort to sandwiches and oatmeal from their kitchen time to time. \n\nLast semester was the roughest I had so far (depression, suicide, breakdowns, feeling over worked, bad grades, breaking down in class..etc), I didn't talk to anybody and I keep to myself as much as possible, talking to my boss  and professors only (I work as a student office assisstant). I also try to stay out of my aunt and uncles way when it comes to their routine and daily life, I usually woke up when everybody was gone in the mornings and I came home from school when everybody was usually in bed. I took a shower went to bed, rinse and repeat the next day. On weekends I drive 1 hr to stay at my nuclear family's home, and usually I just stay in my room unless somebody needs something, or needs help. Then I drive back to school on a Monday, and thats my week. I also try to help my aunt and uncle out and offer myself when I can, ie pick up kids, wash dishes, do laundry, offer to buy some groceries when going out, etc...\n\nI don't want to be involved in anybodys life really, just my friends and fiance, who I trust.\n\nRecently I decided to travel to China to see my fiance of 2 years, he's from Eastern Europe and is working there, the last time I saw him was Jan. 2017. We knew each other for longer than we've been dating and just had our application for a fiance visa to the US accepted and I wanted to be sure we wouldhave no problem living together, and surprise! We live great together. The trip was over $1500 which is A LOT of money for a college student but I had a plan for money coming in.\n\nI'm in the military with a GI bill in effect, I earn around $700 a month while enrolled from the bill, plus around $200 in pay each month just for being enlisted and working, as well as an additional \\~$400/mth from my office job. I'm also going to annual training this winter, depsite missing school I'll be making around $1000. I had all this in mind when I planned the trip, its just a matter of waiting for it now. \n\nI didn't tell anybody about the trip because most of my family is old school, like 'China is communist and evil and you'll get robbed and this will happen and this and this....', my nuclear family also isn't crazy about my fiance, I also knew that'd I'd get criticized for spending that amount of money, though I told them that I would pay for this college semester as well so they didn't have to worry about it, they usually helped me with some payment in the past. \n\nI didn't tell my aunt until she asked if I was coming to the Xmas dinner with my parents and when I told her I wasnt because of the trip she seemed enthusiatic for me, I was kinda surprised actually. I didnt tell my parents until the day I was leaving, which just resulted in heartfelt goodbyes, and again surprised.\n\nI went to China and had a great time with my fiance, I was trying to ignore and only do small talk with everybody who texted me from back home, including my aunt. I just didn't want to remember home, I just wanted to focus on me and my future husband having a good time. \n\nToday my sister sent me a screenshot from my moms phone who was recieving this text from my aunt (they're sisters):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"U know since () set this whole thing up she says nothing really to anyone other that she is going. Little to no communication during her stay. No thank u during the holiday no little holiday gift to say thank you for letting me stay here. Now she's coming back and asking for favors? \n\nI'm a little pissed. Don't tell her how I feel I will talk to her when she gets here. I'm off this weekend. \n\nNow I am understanding what (my dad) said to me. During the summer he said \"don't let her take advantage of you\" I was confused but I'm beginning to understand. \n\nShe can take a bus from (city where airport is) and Lyft like she did when she left. You can\\* just impose on people.\" \n\n\\*pretty sure she meant can't\n\n\\*I wrote it exactly how she texted witch exception to names, apologies if it sounds off\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm hurt beyond belief, and in the text it sounds like I asked her to pick me up from airport, which I didn't. I asked her if I could come down and stay in her house for 2-3 hours while someone from home came to pick me up. This was after asking everybody at my home, if I had gotten an answer that allowed an earlier pick up time I never would have asked to stay at her home. It turned out I didn't even have to go to her house as someone had woken up early at my household and decided to pick me up, so I just waited in the bus terminal. I did tell her I wasn't coming. Now that I think about it I should have said thank you then, but I was really tired from 20+ hrs of travel and it didnt even cross my mind.\n\nIt's also this kind of behavior that makes me as reclusive as I am now, as my family on both sides has a reputation of it; I've only started being more open with therapy. \n\nI also didn't get her anything, I was debating myself about it becuase I asked my dad if he wanted anything and he said no, asked my mom and she said no (until I was in China and asked for silk pillowcases from there, which I couldnt find and told her, she said no worries), my aunt never asked anything from the past and they have been doing better than my family in finances. I thought no big deal. \n\nI was clearly mistaken, my sister said 'its not hard to get  a $5 gift\", and shes right, I did get a post card from China that was 5$ but I'm planning to get them something good under $30 from the liquor store, a thank you card and a gift card today. She wants to talk about this incoming semester and I have no problem with it, my fiance will be coming to US soon and we plan to live together before July, so hopefuly everything will work out there. \n\nI have no problems with clarification, there are a few personal things I left out but since its a throw away and, as far as I know, nobody in my family uses reddit I can elaborate on somethings. \n\nAITA for what I've done?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Quick background, I am in the Food and Beverage industry and am getting close to opening my first venture which is a cocktail lounge. \n\nWhile preparing myself for this I’ve met with a lot of people, vendors, booze and food reps, potential clients and investors. I recently started to search for someone to take care of my social media accounts. \n\nMet with someone, looked at their work/CV and was quite happy. We exchanged a few emails and on our second meeting I felt like things took a turn. \n\nWe met at a local pub that’s quite popular here and had lunch. I had said lunch was on me and asked if they would like a pint as well. They said no and didn’t really drink often. No problem for me. I enjoy a few drinks rather often (rarely more than a couple and rarely get drunk). \n\nIt’s a Friday and late afternoon so, about an hour in to our meeting I ordered a second beer. They gave me a bit of an odd look but I didn’t think anything of it. Now, by the time I’ve ordered this second beer I’ve eaten a steak sandwich and plate of fries and finished the beer over the course of an hour. \n\nShortly after my beer arrived they ask me how often/much I drink. Didn’t think much of it and answered honestly. That at the end of the day I’ll have a drink or two but I rarely get drunk except for maybe special occasions ie birthdays, celebrations. This is where it got really weird for me. They then told me they don’t actually drink at all and that alcoholism ran in their family. They then proceeded to tell me I was an alcoholic wether I realize it or not. They were never “rude” per se but I was taken a back and definitely offended. I ended the meeting shortly after that and said we’d be in touch next week. \n\nNow I am not sure if I want to hire this person to manage my social media. I have no issues with the fact that they don’t drink but, I was offended by the comments that were made. I also am opening a cocktail lounge... how can someone do a good job managing my social media for my night club if they are vocal and condescending towards people who drink aka my clientele. \n\nI am looking for feedback since I am torn about this. I haven’t hired this person yet and we have only met twice and exchanged a few emails. So I don’t owe them money and feel like it might be best to move on to someone else now rather than later. ",

      "description": "For a little context: I’m in high school and this is one of my first relationships and his first. \n\nI’ve had at least two encounters I can remember where I see girls leaning on his shoulder. I’m a super jealous person and he knows this. The first time I was laying on his lap on my phone or something and when I looked up, a girl who I am friends with [girl 1] was leaning on his shoulder watching a YouTube video. I immediately got up and left so I didn’t act out. I didn’t tell him about how I felt about it until a while later, but I did tell a good girl friend of mine. [girl 2] The girl is also his best friend but I knew she wouldn’t tell him since she knew I wanted to talk to him. However, a couple days ago I walked into school to see her laying on his shoulder reading a book while I sat there with her. I was really hurt. \n\nIn general I just stared at him. I didn’t mean to I was just hurt and a bit dumbfounded that he did it... again. I later asked him about it a day later. \n\nHe told me, “I thought you would be okay with it since it wasn’t [girl 1].” \n\nI replied with, “No it still made me jealous, but I’m mostly a bit mad at [girl 2] because I have talked to her about it and she told me she understood what I meant.”\n\nHe then proceeded to defend both of these friends. \n\nHe told me he values physical contact. I don’t know about the rest of you but I see a lean on the should as one of two things. \n\n1. A flirting tactic\n2. A trusting gesture\n\nI understood why [girl 2] did it. She trusts him as a friend and she was going through some stuff. I felt a bit disrespected at the time because of what I told her in the past and I was trying to explain this to him. \n\nHe told me that they both have no ill will and it’s restricting for me to not allow him to do that. \n\nI told him I don’t trust [girl 1] and that I was worried about losing him to her (as they’ve had a fling type thing in the past). He then defended her by saying, “[girl 1] is one of the most people I have ever met and she would never do that.” \n\nOverall this made me worry because I do have some trust issues with other women so it is hard for me to bond with them. I didn’t know if I was judging her too harshly even though I did believe and see the rumors of her cheating on her boyfriends and selling sex. \n\nHis proposal was to only do that when I wasn’t around. I told him that it made it feel untrustworthy. At some point during this conversation that lasted over the course of two days, I gave up. I told him he could do what he wants in front of me or not. I can and I will get over it. \n\nInwardly I wanted him to say no, but that’s a selfish thing for me to believe he would do. \n\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for not wanting my boyfriend to have too much physical contact with other people?

      "description": "So 3 hours ago the New Year happened in my country, and i already had a dispute. \n\nThis year, due to several reasons, i had to stay home, so i played games until midnight when i decided to go outside of my apartment building to watch the fireworks.\n\nThe street outside is blind (ends in a stairway) and the end is a parking lot for the residents cars, including mine, and is full all the time.\n\nSo i watch the fireworks and i noticed this family, man, woman and child walking in the middle of the cars, and the man is throwing those pyramid-shaped fireworks, just casually lighting them and throwing them left and right.\n\nSome fall under the cars, some next to them. So i wait until they approach me and the conversation goes like this (Me: is me, Him: is the guy throwing the fireworks)\n\nMe: Hey, could you maybe throw those fireworks further away from the cars?\n\nHim: Why do you care?\n\nMe: Well, my car is parked there and i dont want it burnt to the ground.\n\nHim: Im not throwing them under the cars.\n\nMe: Dude i just watched you throw like 6 of them left and right, some under the cars at least dont lie.\n\nHim: But those are kids fireworks!\n\nMe: I dont care! They are still capable of lighting stuff on fire.\n\nHim: So you are here just to watch over your car or what?\n\nMe: No, im here to watch the fireworks, but when i see an idiot throwing fireworks under cars, of course i will watch my car.\n\nHim: Yeah well they are fine, i can throw them here. (proceeds to light a cigarette 10 cm from my face)\n\nMe: Why cant you throw them on the concrete stairs, no one is there and there is nothing that could catch on fire?\n\nHe then mumbles something to himself and his wife and they leave. And no, he did not pick up those used fireworks after him, he just left them there.\n\nI dont know i should have just keep my mouth shut, but cmon, be at least a little bit careful.",

      "description": "I met my girlfriend Daisy four months ago on a dating app. Over time I realized Daisy was extremely reticent about pretty much every facet of her life. Example: I asked her how many siblings she had and she told me she had two siblings, then immediately started peppering me with questions about my siblings. That's what she does. She deflects and redirects people like that and if you're not careful, you won't realize what just happened. I used to think, \"wow, she's really interested in me!\" But really, it's a smokescreen. When I started to realize I literally knew nothing about her, basic things like what she did for work, her family situation, essentially her whole life history up until we met. I could tell you her favorite books and  TV shows but not much else.\n\nI raised my concerns with her and she basically told me that she doesn't like to talk about that stuff, she moved here to not think about any of it, it was really painful for her to talk about. I was kind of hurt that she didn't trust me enough, or was comfortable enough with me to be open and honest. I told her this. She got pretty offended and told me I, nor anyone else, was entitled to know the personal details of her life as they aren't relevant and I'm over stepping my boundaries. I backed off. I had clearly upset her and I needed to think about what she said and get a second opinion. \n\nI talked to my buddies about it, or tried to. They joked that she's a Russian spy. They didn't seem to think it was that big of a deal. They've met Daisy and think highly of her. She's witty, smart as hell, kind^andsmokinhot, just an all around fantastic girl in every way. We have similar beliefs, interests, hobbies, the same sense of humor. \n\nI'm very much tempted to let it go, but I also think it's not weird that someone would want to know basic information about someone they're dating. Am I wrong? I don't suspect her of being up to anything nefarious, I'm taking what she said at face value as I have no reason not to. It's really weird that she knows so much about me and I know next to nothing about her.\n\nI need an impartial opinion: Am I the ahole?",

Normally I'd love to go but there's this one particular person...\n\nOne of my wife's friends, let's call her C has a boyfriend named D.\n\nC is great - we get along well, I find her funny, and I'm always more than willing to hang out with her.\n\nD is the opposite. My wife's group tends to be all-women so during other outings, D and I are usually the only men. For some reason, D takes that as a cue to be the fucking Robin to my Batman. He seriously doesn't leave me alone - I can't tell if he's uncomfortable talking to other women or I've got some amazing bro-charm that he can't resist.\n\nMore context, D likes to talk exclusively about two things: stocks and football. Now I love football and the S&amp;P500 as much as the next red-blooded American man but... that only gets me through so many convos.\n\nD is also immensely off-putting. IMHO, he's sexist, elitist, racist, and a little lacking in self-awareness. \n\nShit he's said (I only remember because they've been such jarring comments):\n\n* \"Marketing isn't a real field. The only real jobs are in finance and law.\"\n* \"C (remember this is *his* girlfriend), you've got such a flat chest. When are you hitting puberty?\"\n* \"(when we pass by a remotely attractive woman) God she's so hot . Why can't you look like that C.\"\n* \"C, you should just quit your job now. We both know you need to learn to take care of kids.\"\n* \"C, I'm just going to marry your other friend E. I've decided we're soulmates.\"\n* \"Man, I love your mom C. PingPong is the best (C is Asian and D is not. C's mom's name is Pingwen).\"\n* Not to mention I constantly see him checking out my wife's other friends.\n\nMy wife finds it hilarious that I hate D. I could honestly put up with his bullshit in large group settings if it wasn't for the fucking. constant. hovering. He seriously sticks to me like he's a bee and I'm the world's last flower. I'm also not \"too nice\" - I give one word answers in response to his comments but I don't engage.\n\nI refuse to go on a week-long trip if D is there and my wife doesn't want to go without me. My wife's friends say I'm the asshole for not wanting to go (I don't publicly explain that D is the reason).\n\nIf you ask me, C could honestly do better than D but I'm in no position to talk to her about that. \n\nAITA?

      "description": "So some backstory. My girlfriend has really beautiful curly hair. I know it's important to her and I love it. When we went out for New Year's, she had it straightened by her friend and it looked incredible. She's never straightened it herself so I was surprised when I saw it, but in a good way. She looked great. She was fielding compliments all night from our friends who have never seen her hair straight before. At one point she mentioned that it was a one-time thing given how long it took (3 hours) and that she kind of missed her curls. \n\nFast forward a week and my birthday is coming up. She sent me a few pictures of dresses and asked me which one I wanted her to wear. She does this sometimes when she wants to look sexy for me in particular so I was all for it. At one point I asked her if she would consider straightening her hair because I thought it would look great when we go out to eat. Out of nowhere she got really upset and offended. She told me people have told her to try straightening her hair her entire life and that it makes her feel like her curly hair is inferior. I didn't know this so I apologized and asked why she decided to do it on New Year's. She replied that she just \"felt like it\" and then asked me if I would be more attracted to her with straight hair. Of course I said no, but she was still upset. Most of the time she wears it in a bun on the top of her head anyway because of how much work it takes to maintain. \n\nApparently she got teased a lot growing up because of her hair and it took a long time to get confident in her natural curls. I expressed that I find her hair completely beautiful and the straight hair was only a suggestion. She took it to mean that in order for her to look extra sexy on my birthday that she would need different hair. At this point I just kept reiterating that I love her hair but she isn't over it. She told me that it would be like her telling me to wear lifts in my shoes to look taller. I can't change my height and she can't change her hair which i get. But I never asked her to change it forever. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "The day started out like a typical Wednesday afternoon for us.  We have roughly a 600 sq ft apartment which consists of an open living room/kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.  Needless to say, there aren't very many options if either of us want some privacy.  My girlfriend works from home so she doesn't really have a set schedule; whenever she feels like working she'll bust out her laptop and get to it.\n\nWe're both sitting on the couch; I'm playing a video game with a headset on (no external audio is being played) while she is working right next to me.  She makes business calls sporadically and I'm so focused on killing noobs that I can't tell exactly what she's doing at any given moment.  I had an awesome kill in the game and kind of when \"ooohhhh\" to myself, and she instantly raises her finger at me as if telling a toddler to hold their horses.  She happened to be on a phone call and I had no clue.  I get ever so slightly irritated and carry on quietly.\n\nShe finishes up her phone call, slides off my headset ear cup nearest her, and sternly says, \"if I'm on the phone, you can NOT make any noises\", to which I reply, \"not even (referencing the noise I made, which wasn't really a word, more of a sigh-ish sound) kind of noise?\"  \"No, not a sound\", she says.  I get a little more irritated by this point, thinking to myself, if I had to make calls and couldn't have any external noises, I would surely do it elsewhere.  I say, \"well, babe, can you go work in the bedroom (she has a small desk and stool in there) so you can work in peace?\"  She gives me this look of pure ignorance and I can already sense what she is going to say.  \"FUCK you\" has never rolled off of a tongue so naturally.  She scoops up all of her material and storms into the bedroom.  She has been in there, working and most likely fuming on the situation (as I am, hence this post), for roughly 2 hours now and completely avoids eye contact and conversation in the minimal moments that she exits the bedroom.\n\nReddit, I need to know.  Am I the asshole for suggesting what would be a win-win situation for both of us?",

We have texted for years. Not daily but we talk for about a month or two, then he confesses his feelings for me, I reject him and we stop talking. He usually doesn't want to talk to me after that. Then a few months pass and he texts me again. We have been going in that loop for about 5 years and I am really getting tired of it.\n\nThis time around though we have been talking for 6 months and I really don't like talking to him. He makes me unconfortable and he asks me quite personal questions. Questions like: \"do you like someone right now?\" and \"are you taking antidepressents\" (I have a history of metal healt issues like depression and panic disorder). Those are just two examples and I don't want to tell him the answers. But he gets upset with me when I say I don't want to tell him.\n\nHe keeps asking me to meet up with him, like a date but I continue to say maybe. I can't say no because I feel bad. He likes telling me about his mental health issues. He also constantly gives me compliments and gives me weird comments. He told me that I reminded him of his mom, in a good way. He compliments me all the time. One compliment from time to time is nice, when it comes from the right person but he is so noth the right person. His compliments make me uncomfortable and I don't know why. He mainly compliments me on my eyes but he sometimes compliments my hair and freckles. I hate it but I feel a little bad for him. He recently got diagnosis for a multible personality disorder. I feel bad for him, that's why I kept replying to him.\n\nRecently though, I stopped replying. I couldn't do it anymore. But he keeps sending me messages. It really annoys me and I get into a really bad mood everytime that happens. I want to block him because I just can't stand him anymore.

      "description": "I’m a 23F and my boyfriend is a 24M we have been together for 4 years, recently it has been very difficult to spend one on one time with him. He prioritizes his friends or anyone before me and I never get any couple time with him. Anytime I bring up the topic and let him knows it upsets me he just blows me off. For example today he just came home from being out of town for a week, we have barely spoken and he has spent all day with his best friend only really speaking to me when he wanted to initiate sex, I haven’t mentioned anything about being upset but I feel like this isn’t normal in a relationship. So basically am I the asshole for asking for alone time with my boyfriend? ",

      "description": "About five years ago I met this amazing woman on World of Warcraft. I want to be clear that I do not now, nor have I ever had romantic feelings for her.  She was just a really cool person I had a lot in common with. This led to us being \"internet besties\" which led to \"actual besties\". I've traveled six states away to visit her and her husband in California several times when I had vacation time.  We would play games together, watch Netflix together by syncing our streams, voice and video chat all the time. She was just the best.\n\nCut to about a year ago, and she starts suddenly bailing on me. We had a standing vague friend date that every Friday we would hang out and play games or whatever. Seven o'clock Friday night rolls around and I'm waiting for her to Skype me and then I get a text saying that she and her husband had made plans a week ago to have a date night. Okay, no big deal. This started happening more frequently, and with increasingly inane reasons for ditching me last minute. If I had to cancel on her for a good reason she would get upset and try to guilt trip me. Then she started doing petty things like refusing to play video games unless we played what she wanted or refusing to watch the Netflix shows I wanted to watch. It always had to be her choice. The list of shitty behaviors is a mile long. Every time I tried to talk to her about her behavior, she would explain it away as being on her period or she had a bad week.\n\nNow cut to about three and a half weeks ago when I told her we needed to talk. I told her I wanted to talk to her about some stuff I felt hurt about so we could move past it and it wouldn't fester inside me until I wanted nothing to do with her. I was holding out hope things could return to some semblance of normalcy. She promised me she would be available Friday night at our usual time. When the day came, we hadn't been connected on a video call more than twenty minutes when she said, \"Oh &lt;FRIEND&gt; is here. I have to go. I'll call you back later.\" She never did. I later found out that she had made plans with this person after telling me she would be available. Something snapped in me, and that was the last straw. So I stopped answering texts and calls. It's been two weeks since.\n\nYesterday her boyfriend, her husband, and a bunch of our mutual online friends that we accumulated over five years started bombarding me and saying that I wasn't giving her a fair shake. I'm being a dick for ghosting her. She's been crying over me all week. She's so sorry for taking me for granted. I should let her explain herself. You get the idea. They all know the whole story. They're still insisting that I'm a dick, and I'm starting to wonder. I know I need to cut her out, but AITA for ghosting her instead of giving her another chance to explain?",

      "description": "Ok, so not as black and white as the title sounds, a few months ago my roommate mentioned something about maybe getting a dog eventually (even though our apartment has a no pet rule) at the time I said \"yeah that could maybe be cool\" and even joked about getting a cat too, but in no way were these actual plans of ours and after that we never talked about it again.\n\nFast forward to last month where I get home one day and there is a puppy at the apartment. My roommate and 3 other friends spontaneously decided to get a year old puppy from the pound, the puppy is not just my roommates but has been staying at our place since the other friends who also got the dog don't have stable places to live at the moment/a place to keep it. The dog has defecated multiple times in the apartment and I've had to clean it up some of the time because my roommate was at work, it also has woken me up early in the morning multiple times from it barking. I've had roommates in the past and learned that sometimes you need to let some things slide with roommates so as to avoid unnecessary conflict and because of this I've been cool with the dog staying with us for the past month with the promise that the dog will soon be moved somewhere else. Today I was with my friends (the ones who also got the dog) and they were talking about how they might not be able to have somewhere for the dog to stay because of some home issues, I then made the comment that if the dog wasn't gone soon, I was going to tell apartment management about it because I don't want to live with a dog and I could potentially get in trouble with my roommate for letting the dog staying with us.\n\nI haven't threatened to report the dog at all before this and my friends said that it was a dick move of me to drop that on them and that they just needed some more time to figure something out without me threatening them. Am I being an asshole for threatening to report them to management for this?",
