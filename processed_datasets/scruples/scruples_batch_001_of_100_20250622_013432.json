      "description": "My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.\n\nM wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. \n\nM proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying \"of course you dont know, because you never look.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?",

      "description": " \n\nMy really good friend is getting married. Yay!happy for her. I'm a bridesmaid in her wedding. Also yay. I am currently underemployed which my friend knows. I make about 35k (Canadian a year). I'm sensitive about this. I'm in a social work type field. \n\nOkay so friend lives a plane ride away. Approximately 600 bucks. Flights are pricey.  Anyway she hasn't decided yet but is thinking about a destination bacherlorette party...so it would be flight from Canada to that city, apparently a small gap of time then flight back to her wedding city but not enough so I can fly back home in between so it's looking like lots of unpaid leave. And it's just after Xmas next year so pricey time to fly.\n\nSince she got engaged she's been saying things along the lines of \"start saving for my bach party\" and \"we gotta save for the party\". I let her know these kinds of comments are super stressful for me as I have other savings goals and I'm doing my best to save for her thing too, but I am feeling unhappy financially.  She responded by basically saying she too has savings goals (her parent is paying for the whole wedding) and at least I'm not a homeless person like what happened to thousands of people in California. I just told her again i wanted to bring it up that telling me to save makes me feel stressed and anxious. She wrote it on the official bridesmaid invitation that I needed to save for her party and I mentioned how I didn't like that and she was like Oh so that's all your remember about my gift?! \n\nIt just runs me the wrong way and I think it's crazy tacky to tell people especially people struggling financially to save for your destination bacherlorette party. She thinks I'm overreacting and that I want to ban her from talking about her wedding. Its embarrassing enough to admit to financial struggles and she doesn't seem to get it. I just want her to tell me my presence and support are enough at her wedding.  Am I the asshole for saying what I said and for not prioritizing saving to be in her wedding party? ",

Then she tells me that a friend of hers had also planned a trip to my town by coincidence, and that they're now coming together with the intent to hang out as a group. I'm really not a group person, but I guess I could handle it with someone I know; it's just that I was really looking forward to seeing her by herself, and hanging out with someone I don't know makes me very uncomfortable - it always has, and she knows this.

Today I was supposed to substitute teach so my mentor teacher could do some work with the other school's teachers.\n\nI set my alarm on my computer and on my phone last night to wake me up early, due to me having trouble waking up sometimes.\n\nHowever, last night, a breaker in my fuse box flipped off and shut off my computer and stopped charging my phone, which then died during the night.  I woke up at 8:00 A.M (when class started) and rushed to put on clothes and bike to the school.  I got there around 8:05-8:10 and found another substitute teacher talking to my mentor teacher.  Also in the room is my college teacher who is like an overseer of our progress.\n\nI walked in and my mentor teacher and college teacher sat down with me.  They were worried because they couldn't reach me on my phone (still was dead), and I was late, which is never like me.  \n\nI told them what happened, that I was so sorry, and I can still be there and teach.  \n\nMy two teachers understood but thought it best for me to go home.  I argued against that, saying I'm here and I can teach, but got told to think about how to not let them happen in the future.   I walked out of the building dejected and know that the whole staff knows that I am unreliable and I messed up.\n\nMy mentor teacher and college teacher each texted me and told me not to be too hard on myself and it is okay.  \n\nI have chronic anxiety so my morning has been sitting at home in humiliation that this happened.\n\nNow I am trying to figure out what my next steps are, and how much do I look like an asshole and how to fix it.",

So now we are both in college together and enjoying it a ton. But now it's getting close to the end of her(supposed to be) senior year at the high school. Which means prom is also coming up. \n\nNow, I don't know about all of you but I think prom is one of the most elaborate scams ever devised by the education system and entertainment (case in point: every high school sweetheart film ever made). Which is why I never went to my senior prom.\n\nIts overpriced, you REQUIRE a nice outfit, and to top it off neither of us go to the school anymore. I've given her all these points and yet she still wants to go. We did, however, go to the homecoming last year. Let me tell you, I've never been more disappointed with my school and you have gym teachers getting arrested for sexual conduct with students here. \n\nShe was upset about the homecoming being bad too and I just know that prom going to be exactly the same way because there is no way our school makes enough money for a proper dance. So what do all think? Am I wrong for not wanting to go to a dance with my her? I'd rather spend the night at somewhere that would actually be fun. Perhaps a nightly beach walk or something.",

      "description": "She was constantly lying to me, whether it be out of kindness or to protect the relationship from heading towards an argument (meaning bad things she's done but has lied to keep me from questioning her). We've constantly had arguments with each other and she even started feeling like we weren't meant to be. So the 3rd time I broke it off, I felt sure I wasn't going to be with her, as I had no emotions. This was due to the fact that she is extremely selfish and wouldn't even console me when I was in a bad state. She then started to say things like I'll kill myself if you leave me, or she couldn't get attracted to other men. Being the asshole that I am, I decide to stick with her to make sure she stays safe, but I've really had enough at that point. Fast forward a few weeks later and the lies ensue. I face my fear of having a death on my soul and just tell her I've had enough with the lies, I break it off for the last time and she's quiet for a few days. She hasn't killed herself at that point as I've seen her online and she's tried to message me, (I've blocked her everywhere). Then I get messages from her on Instagram somehow, saying she'll actually kill herself, and I replied with \"well atleast you won't be able to hurt anyone\".......\nI'm not familiar with Instagram but I think if their profile picture disappears they've blocked you? Correct me if I'm wrong. But I'm feeling guilty as fuck and anxiety is eating me alive. I'm religious, so having a death on me is.. Idk how to feel. AITA? ",

We have allocated money for everything already and once mint says we reached it, we’re done with that category. We agreed we would wait to see what our new financial situation was. The paycheck won’t come till the end of the month. SO buys stuff for the kids knowing we have more money in the future even though on the current budget we have maxed the kids spending out. SO reasoning is that we need it. My reasoning is that we agreed to wait for new budget before spending. Aita here?",

      "description": "Hey guys, I'm sorry if it's obvious one way or the other whether I'm an asshole or not, I just really dont know. Also, sorry if my writing is poor, but I'm kinda just writing off the cuff.\n\nMy dad recently got with a new girlfriend, and she's nice and all, but she's been talking a LOT about moving out of the country, even by next year. And my dad seems to be really into it, so I'm pretty sure it's a certainty.\n\nThey're talking about moving to France, and France is nice and all, but I don't know. I kinda like America, and I feel like I haven't stayed in one place for more than a year for a while. Either I move schools, or I move grades, or I move states. I'm always moving, I haven't made friends that last more than a year besides a couple internet friends (that I've drifted from quite a bit) since third grade, and through that the only stable thing in my life has been the country I live in. No matter how much shit had changed all the time, at least I've been in my home country, where almost everyone speaks the same language as me, and have around the same mannerisms and expressions.\n\nI feel like one of the only things familiar to me will be ripped away, and that's scary. Especially with article 13 coming soon, I wouldnt be able to access most of the YouTube channels I love to watch, and that's my main source of entertainment and coping mechanism for sad times.\n\nSo in moving to France, I would be giving up the only familiar thing in my life, my country, language, and culture, as well as giving up my main source of entertainment and coping mechanism. I don't know how I would continue living.\n\n But is it right for me to hold my parents back like this? If their dream is to constantly move around, who am I to hold them back? I would feel terrible if I held them back and made them unhappy. But then again, I've always been going with the flow whenever we have to move and just being okay with it, even when it's destroyed me. When is it time to be selfish and think about my own happiness?\n\nHonestly, I see only a couple possible futures for me and none of them look happy.\n\n1: I move to France, and then inevitably move again in another year or so, and spend the rest of my life with no real friends or connections.\n2: I don't move with my dad, and move in with my mom (which is a non option, really. Long story)\n3: I put my foot down and refuse to move, which will either result in option 1 or me holding my parents back from happiness and feeling guilty forever.\n\nI don't know anymore, and I'm so confused.

      "description": "Some years ago my husband and I built a DIY patio behind our house. We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. ",

      "title": "AITA for making MIL leave our home while my fiance is away?",
      "description": "I don't even know where to begin here. Unlike a lot of people I've never had any issues with my (soon-to-be) in-laws before - in fact my fiance's parents quite liked me the handful of times we've met, and we've always gotten along. The shit realllllllly hit the fan this past weekend though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my fiance travels a lot for work and was out of town for about a week-ish. During the weekend his mother was planning to come for her annual visit (we live near Phoenix AZ, she lives in San Diego CA) and was going to stay in our guestroom for a few days until he returned from his trip so we could all spend time together. The first day was fairly good, we went out to lunch and watched her favorite gameshow for a while, chatted about random stuff. We'd never gotten to know each other very well or spent time alone together so it was somewhat awkward, but it was fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then the second day when we go out to lunch is when things start going downhill... see, MIL is nice and all but is very naive and gullible, to put it nicely. She could hear something on the radio and immediately take it as truth without any sort of fact-checking or research on her own, which is something that's even gotten my fiance rather irritated with her on occasion. She is also very stubborn and likes to talk a LOT, so she will always give you her blunt opinion. And on top of this, she is a staunch Trump supporter and wants the wall built ASAP, because she believes \"all the illegal immigrants in San Diego are the cause of all the traffic\". Needless to say, I don't exactly share her views. Which that in itself isn't a problem, I've known she's rather conservative and made it a point to avoid politics as a topic of conversation so as not to cause any conflict. However, she wants to talk about anything and everything with me, and with the current political climate and government shutdown in place, she's very enthusiastic to discuss it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe begins asking me questions about my views regarding the shutdown, the wall, Trump, etc. I say I'd rather not talk about something like that but she insists, adding how ridiculous she thinks it is that \"Democrats won't fund the wall to keep our country safe\". I'm desperately trying to avoid giving my honest opinion and instead try to talk about something else, but she keeps poking at me \"oh come on, tell me what you think! Don't you think we should stop illegal aliens from entering our country?\" like she's expecting me to agree with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClearly she wasn't budging, so I just say I don't think the wall is a good idea and that Trump is causing even more damage than good to the country with this shutdown (Sidenote: my father works a government job and has been without pay during this period, so it's a bit of an extra touchy subject for me). Immediately her expression goes from an eager grin to completely stone-faced. I go on saying that most illegal immigrants come in through airplanes anyway and just overstay their visas so a wall wouldn't stop that, and she goes off saying that's not true because she heard this from Breitbart or that on Fox News and the president tweeted this and that and it's all the Democrats fault and blah blah. Which again, if that's your opinion then fine - I tend to respect others' opinions as long as they do the same for me. But she goes on this tirade trying to \"educate\" me and how I shouldn't by into the lies of liberal media or whatever. When she finally stops to take a breath I quickly say \"clearly we aren't going to agree about this so let's just not talk about it\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that quieted her down... for about 30 seconds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen she starts mumbling about how I must've gotten my views from my mother (who is in fact quite liberal) and that it's so unfortunate that I've bought into all this false information and that we disrespect our president and country so much. Obviously this struck a nerve with me now that she's brought my mother into this, whom she's only met twice and my mother knows they have opposing views but has never said a bad word about her. So flat-out tell her that I'd like her to stop, I don't agree with her views and especially knowing how much my father is struggling to pay bills right now she's the one being rude while staying under my roof.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis only offended her further, and eventually it just got to the point where I asked her to leave and stay with her friend in town or a hotel for the remainder of her trip. She was completely shocked and initially refused to leave, saying she had a right to be here because this was her son's house too and he invited her here (although she's never actually invited, she just randomly calls up and says \"hey I'm coming to stay from X day to Y day!\" but that hasn't been a problem since we only see her once a year and we shift our schedules around if needed). I tell her it's my house as well and she's no longer welcome to stay here if she's going to insult my family and argue with me over something as simple as a different viewpoint. So she huffs and gathers her stuff, gets in her car and drives off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI barely have a few minutes to take a breath and process everything that just happened when I get a call from my fiance, angry that I kicked his mother out of our home. I figured she probably just gave him one side of the story and spun it in her favor, so I explain what happened but he insists she would've calmed down if I just let her vent, and that I shouldn't have told her to leave. This irritated me and I said she's not welcome while I'm here alone and that she'll be staying elsewhere, which of course he wasn't happy about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiance and I barely spoke the rest of the time he was out of town, and he was still fairly annoyed when I picked him up at the airport. He was especially upset because apparently his mother had left for San Diego early because of the incident, so he missed out on seeing her. Now that we've had some time to talk about it he understands my point of view, but since he sees his mom so rarely he can't help but feeling down about it and I'm left questioning my decision and feeling very guilty. I've considered contacting her to apologize even though I really feel like I shouldn't - in fact I've thought about barring her from the wedding altogether if this continues to be a persistent issue between us, because god forbid she starts drama with myself or my family at my own wedding. I'm not sure how to feel about this, so I'll leave it up to the fellow Redditers to determine if I'm the asshole.",

      "description": "Okay so here is the situation. So my girlfriend and I recently moved in together, because of this we sometimes get in little arguments over stupid stuff. Well yesterday we had one of those arguments and it put both of us in a bad mood. We end up making up, we have dinner together, watch TV everything seems fine. So we go to bed. Usually I initiate sex but tonight she does. Our usual routine with sex is foreplay and such, until she cums, then we start having sex. Well no matter what I did she couldn’t cum and this probably went on for 20 to 30 min. So she gets annoyed and says “I’m not going to cum, I’m going to bed goodnight” and rolls over. She says it with kind of an attitude. Now she’s extremely wet, and up until this point everything was pointing in the direction of sex. So I’m like what the fuck and I say “are you serious, are you really going to tease me and then just go to bed”. So I roll over and a minute or two passes by and then she rolls back over initiates again. And we start having sex. And I ask “is this pitty sex?” She says “yes”. So I said “fuck this” stop having sex and go take a shower. When I get back we have a little argument she calls me an “asshole” I say “I’m not having fucking pitty sex”, we end up going to bed. This morning we apologize to each other. I still wanna talk about it when we both get home from work but I’m still confused about the whole situation\n\nI feel like she could’ve easily still been into it, or could have cum later during sex and that her abruptly turning over and giving me attitude because I couldn’t make her cum is kind of a dick move. I also think she got in her own head, because I can almost always make her cum and that it wasn’t my fault to begin with. But then again me getting mad at her for not wanting to have sex and getting even more annoyed because of pitty sex is also kind of a dick move. I don’t know what to think. \n\nSo who is the asshole? \n",

      "description": "Background for reference: I'm a 44 year old married male with 3 kids. I have many male and female friendships developed in the usual ways - work colleagues, sport, social groups, kids parents etc. \n\nAt one past employer, I got close to a female peer / colleague. We had a relatively close relationship insofar as we would often lunch together, grab a drink after work in our group, and generally hang out. \n\nI left the job to go elsewhere, as did she. We did however stay in touch - regular text/email, the odd lunch catch up - basically friends...we were very comfortable with each other and I really felt she was a good friend. We both shared a lot of personal information. \n\nShe moved away (only a state / 1 hour flight away) with her partner, and had a child. Two years pass.\n\nAfter a number of false starts (I was going to visit / work schedules not aligning) she finally plans a trip to her home city (her family is also here)\n\nWe schedule a lunch for a Friday. ( I'm actually pretty happy with that and schedule a half day off work) She bails and asks to move our catch up to Monday. Sure thing - family stuff will likely be required - I can juggle my schedule and move to Monday.\n\nOn the Sunday, I get a message from my friend asking \"how long our lunch will take\" on Monday as she is keen on setting up a date with an ex partner. Basically a booty call.  Her relationship has not been in a good place for some time.\n\nThe inference being that our catch up was holding her back from hooking up with an ex.\nI get pretty offended. I make my excuses for the lunch, and avoid any chance to reschedule while she is in the city.\n\nHer trip ends, and she returns interstate.\nI receive one further friendly email as if nothing has happened. I don't respond and have made no attempt to contact again. \n\nI have blocked her number and email. AITA.\n\n",

      "description": "AITA? So in another thread, a woman made an off hand comment about how going to grad school was stressful and she is literally crying everyday. I said I realized school can be stressful but if she is literally crying everyday maybe she should reevaluate why she is there or at least see a therapist as to why she feels the need to break into tears at least once a day. Of course I was told I was being insensitive and that I would never know the stress and pressures of going to grad school. Full discourse I did go to undergrad so I’m not completely out of the loop when it comes to academics but in no way did I cry everyday. She then brought up my military service and claimed I would never tell a war veteran with PTSD the same. Well I know plenty of vets with PTSD and not a single one cry everyday either. I just feel like these people are trying to make their graduate experience seem like a trial by fire when there is literally millions of people who have done it without all the dramatics. I asked a friend with two masters (both from Virginia Tech and yes he was there when the massacre happened) and not even he cried more that once. I’m not trying to prove to anyone I’m a tough guy and yes, I have cried plenty of times before. But I believe if you are truly crying everyday or even a few times a week you need to seek help.

      "description": " I (18M) am still a student and currently in my vacation so I'm home all day. My girlfriend (19F) works as a cashier in a mart. She basically leaves at 7 and returns at 4, and I'm so much attached to her that I basically spend all my day waiting for her to return. It's been a couple of days she's returning home late, at 6 mostly. Like always she texts me that she's back home, but these few days she says she's tired and that's it. She doesn't text me at all for a few hours and just texts me back at night as if nothing's happened. I don't know if I'm overreacting, but I don't get why she doesn't even text me saying that she'll get some sleep and then text me after waking up. She wakes up, does her shopping for dinner, goes to her friend comes back and then texts me saying what I have been up to. So today I've had enough so I said i was sad and mad that she didn't text me saying she'd sleep and didn't text me after waking up. I said that I'd text her tomorrow because I was not in a good mood today. I'd be happy to hear her out tomorrow and accept it if I was overreacting and maybe she was really tired and i would be the asshole then for not seeing it through her perspective. But she kept on spamming me hearts and kiss emojis, which to me was very annoying. I proceeded to tell her that her way of approaching and handling this situation was making it worse and we should just call it a day and go to sleep. She kept texting me saying why I had to be mad about small things like these, she also said that atleast she texted back despite the fact it being late. I didn't want to ignore her, but I was pretty much very annoyed so I still calmly said you're just forcing me to talk and its making it worse to which she replied that she didn't know how trying to handle the situation is making it worse and asked why I was thinking like that. \"I don't have anybody else except for you to talk to\", that's what she said. So I said \"bro\" and was typing out my message that this isn't okay at all but she quickly replied with \"yes sis\" which might would've been her attempt at trying to be funny but I honestly had enough. All i asked for was time and space which isn't even much as I said I'd text her back in the morning and it was 9 here already. She said \"Go on then, text me back when you're mood is good. What can I do? Me speaking seems to only make the situation worse and annoy you.\" She said this in our language with much respect so this was very sarcastic and this is only a rough translation. I was pretty annoyed. I said you don't have to say that as a reply to her \"take rest\". So she started to rant again \"Who am I to you anyways.. and blah blah blah\", so I just blocked her for now.\n\nI will text her back in the morning but I don't know if what i did was a good approach to this situation. I don't even know if the title is right for this but I'd really appreciate you guys' take on this. Thanks.",

      "description": "Throwaway because I'm really not sure how this will go and don't want it attached to my main.\n\n\nOkay so, to start with I handed in my notice of contract termination at my job the other day. We are required to give 2 weeks notice, so that's exactly what I did. I explained to my boss that I'd found a better paying job elsewhere and would be leaving. He asked me why and I explained that it was simply due to my workplaces refusal to give me holiday time I was due.\n\nAs employees we're entitled to 4 weeks off a year, spanning from April to April. If you don't use them within that time period then you just lose them, but if you leave employment in that time you're entitled to be payed all the days you didn't take. I have three weeks. My job has a policy of only four people off at any one time, 3 employees and one manager. The problem is we're a building of 50+ employees so unless you get them all booked right away you'll always have people off on the days you want. \n\nNow you might be thinking 'well you should just book them earlier'. While you're correct in thinking that, I have to work around my parents schedules too, so when they go on vacations I come home and look after my younger brother and sister. I don't mind this, they're great kids so I'm happy to do it. \n\nAnyway, as I still have three weeks left and I ended up losing two weeks last year for the same reasons, I figured I could take two weeks off, be happy with that and just lose a week. Nope ,can't be done. My boss has told two others to take two weeks off so he has to say no to me, so he's doing me to lose paid time off the second year in a row.\n\nOkay so onto the meat of this tale. I got a new job, have handed in my two weeks notice and I start on the 18th of \nFebruary. My boss pulls my aside yesterday and asks if I'd be willing to go down to working one day a week until April, as it means he gets a £3,000 bonus for staff retention year to year. If I leave it means we've lost too many people and he doesn't get the bonus. I told my boss that I'd be happy to work one Saturday a week(my new job is Mon-Fri) until mid March on the condition that he gives me my three weeks paid vacation from March-April and that he not change my contract as it means id get paid less for the time taken off, as id be classed as part time from then on and wouldn't be paid as I would've before.\n\nI thought this was a fair request, given that I get paid for the time if I leave anyway, and this way we'd both still get what we want. Nope, my boss loses his sh*t, telling me I'm blackmailing him and what I was requesting was fraud and is illegal. Now I'm not a lawyer, I have no idea if thats true, it just seemed like an idea that I could leave and he'd still receive his bonus. I told him that if he didn't agree to that then I'd be leaving at the end of my notice period at that would be it. He stormed off and the only thing he's said to me since was a snide comment when my colleagues were talking about work he told me 'its not your problem anymore is it?' when I chimed in with a comment.\n\nSo Reddit, Am I The Asshole for how I 'blackmailed' my boss. I don't think I am to make it clear, but all his comments has really made me wonder.\n",

      "description": "So some background here:\n\nI have an older, 21 year old sister who just returned from university abroad back home. She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to back out of my best friend’s bachelorette weekend?",
      "description": "My best friend is getting married in May and it’s been the plan all along that her bachelorette would be a weekend away in April. I have helped her plan parts of the trip and was completely on board until this past weekend when she sent me the detailed itinerary of the plans. I’ve been busy these past few weeks and I know she’s been working with ironing out the details with another one of her bridesmaids. \n\nSo the new details I learned this weekend that are making me want to back out were:\n\n1. We’re going away for two nights, not one. I have a full time job and a three year old. My husband is extremely hands on with our son and is totally capable of and will be happy to take care of him for two nights by himself. But I’ve never spent a night away from our son and I am not sure I want to do it now. I think it’s a lot to ask of my husband. Especially because my friend, as much as I love her, is not the most sacrificing by nature and would never do things that don’t fit into her normal life/routine for me. So I don’t want to go out of my way for her. \n\n2. There are going to be 15 people there, none of who I am super fond of or have anything in common with. I’ve met them a few times over the last 3-4 years and while they were okay to have a brief chat with over dinner, spending 2 days with them seems like A LOT to handle. I initially thought it’ll be just the bridesmaids so like 4-5 of us. \n\n3. They have plans to go clubbing one of the nights and I just don’t do that. Probably the only person in the group who doesn’t. I don’t drink and going clubbing with 15 people with who I have nothing in common just sounds quite unpleasant. \n\n4. I’m pregnant and will be 4-months along in April. This adds to the whole not wanting to go clubbing and on long hikes (I haven’t gone hiking in 3+ years) with a large group of women that I’m not friends with. Hiking features a lot in the planned itinerary. \n\n5. It’s going to be pricey and I’m not comfortable spending a huge amount of money on a weekend that I know I wouldn’t enjoy. I would actually be happier giving that money to my friend as an add-on to her wedding gift. \n\nSo how selfish am I being? My plan is to offer that instead of driving there on Friday night, I can drive up there on Saturday and be there for a photoshoot, lunch, hangout and dinner that she has planned and then drive back home. They have a few things planned for Sunday that I’ll miss but I’m okay with that. ",

      "description": "\nOnce a month I (21m) take my grandma to play bingo for about 6 hours, as she’s 92 can’t walk properly, partly deaf, has dementia (early stages) and doesn’t really get to do much for fun and apart from caring for her none of my other family really take her anywhere. I adore my grandma so I’ll do anything to make her happy. When my grandmas at the bingo she’s a completely different woman, I’ve never seen her so happy, she walks (with her walking trolly for support) faster than I’ve ever seen, she smiles, gets all excited and it just makes my entire day.\n\nToday I took her as I always take her the first day after my payday so that I can play along side her (even though I have absolutely no clue what the hell I’m doing), everything was going as normal, I was losing money in confusion, my grandma was somehow winning constantly as always and we were having fun, about half way through the day another lady sat behind us, I see this lady quite a lot and she’s there every time I’m there, her friend came with her and they sat right behind us and spent the whole time chatting super loudly. \n\nNow I’m not sure if any of you have ever gone to bingo but being able to hear the speaker is vital in order to play, and the usual expectation is that everyone should keep quiet or should speak quietly. But because of them chatting about how the bus driver wasn’t white, and what groceries they bought that morning my grandma was struggling to hear the speaker and I could see she was starting to not enjoy our day. \n\nI decided to not say anything as I know this lady was just catching up with a friend, but after 2 hours of constant talking (they weren’t playing at all) I decided to turn around and I politely said “would you be able to keep your voice down my grandma can’t hear the speaker and she’s trying to play” the lady looked at me, didn’t respond and went back to her conversation, I decided to let it slide as I didn’t fancy arguing with someone 3 times my age, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she didn’t understand me, about an hour later my grandma got irritated and went “ Yap Yap Yap that’s what they sound like”, my grandma says things like that sometimes without realising, it’s just how she is now because of her dementia and she can’t help it, evidently the lady heard us because she turned and started having a go at my grandma who didn’t understand what was going on so I said “ if you kept quiet then my grandma wouldn’t mock you, so I suggest you shut up, keep quiet, play what you came here for and leave her alone” to be fair to her the lady did as I said and they kept their voices down. \n\nAfter we left I felt awful, I just feel guilty for being rude but I did what I had to to make sure my grandma was okay, AITA? I feel like I am. ",

      "description": "I'll be short and sweet here. My SIL lives next door and is kind of a shitty cat owner. She feeds and shelters them, but emotionally neglects them to the point where one cat ran away and lives with a neighbor across the street now, and her other cat basically moved in with us, but goes home for the odd feeding. Husband and I are big cat people, so we always showed affection to their cat when it came over and thus, the unofficial adoption. To be honest, her cat is kinda annoying and our cat isn't a fan, and I wish he didn't like us so much, but what can you do. \n\nAnyway, about 6 months ago I noticed her cat loosing weight, despite eating a ton of food at our house and at her house. Deduced it was diabetes. Mentioned to her he was skinny, kept hinting he should see a vet, even weighed him and proved he was loosing weight and still she dragged her feet about taking him to the vet. \n\nNow they don't make a lot of money, but enough for a vet, and plus don't own pets if you can't take care of them. Anyway she is aggressively cheap and I just knew it was about money so I offered to pay half if she took him to the vet. She immediately agrees, makes an appt, takes him to the vet, they run a bunch of tests and treat him for a few things, to the tune of $400. I pay my half as promised, with no expectations that she would pay me back. It was a straight up gift on my part.\n\nFast forward a few months and her cat is doing much better. Weight is back on and then some. Still spends 90% of it's time chilling at our house. I mean, he sleeps in our bed. \n\nHere is where I am thinking of potentially entering asshole territory: her grandma died over the summer, shortly after the vet trip, and she just now received an unexpected inheritance of around $30k. I would never expect her to pay me back normally, but now that she has this big windfall, would I be a jerk if I asked her to kick me back the money I paid for her cat? \n\nSorry I lied at the beginning and said this would be short and sweet. Anyway, debating asking for the money, but curious on what you all think. \n\n",

      "description": "This happened back during the Super Bowl \"Sweet Victory\" controversy, so I waited a while before posting so people's heads could cool down and I could get an unbiased answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, Maroon 5 teased that they would play play \"Sweet Victory\" during the half time show in honor of Stephen Hillenburg. That turned out to be a lie. r/BikiniBottomTwitter was pretty pissed off about it, with everyone posting memes about their disappointment, but it was all rather humorous and generally fun. That's why I'm on that sub in the first place, I don't care much for Spongebob, but it's funny. Well, I saw a comment saying something to the effect of \"I bet the Marroon 5 subreddit is going to get a lot of shit for this.\" I thought, \"You know, they probably are. I wonder what's happening there?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I check out r/Maroon5, and it's just this tiny 750ish subscriber dead fansub. However, there were two posts already on it from Spongebob fans. One of them was an angry troll saying \"fuck maroon 5,\" but the other one was a humorous picture of the Pitchfork Salesman from... whichever episode of Spongebob featured a pitchfork salesman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, what I expected was mostly posts of the latter sort: teasing, but ultimately good natured meme posts. I decided to post one like it in the name of fake internet points. It said \"Don't mind me, I'm just here to watch Spongebob fans burn this place to the ground.\" My post was third out of what turned out to be hundreds, and I got like 2000 upvotes. However, the ensuing shitstorm was NOT the jokes I was expecting, but mostly variants on \"fuck maroon 5.\" It was uuuuuuugly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my moral quandary is this: was I part of the problem, and if so, how much? I got there before the brigade really became a \"brigade,\" but my post certainly could be viewed as actual encouragement to \"burn this place to the ground,\" and really I knew that it was always possible that people would get mean.",

      "description": "Hey guys,\n\nA week ago I attended a party with a bunch of classmates, whereof a girl that I share a lot of common friends with from \"back in the days\" also was there, let's call her C. We don't really talk much apart from when we're drunk, but she has been slightly flirty with me, despite both of us having a partner. She knows that I could never cheat on my girlfriend (C's friend who is also a classmate tried really hard to make me go home with her a few months back), however C stated: \"I know that if we didn't both had partners, then we definitely would've hooked up by now\". I think C is smart, funny and good looking, so I replied that we should make a pact; whenever one of us is single, then we'll message each other for a hook up to which she agreed with.\n\nNow I told this to my best friend, and he told me that he found it slightly \"bad mannered\", a break of trust and a gatekeeping for being unfaithful, and stated that it's kind of \"assuming you won't be with your girlfriend for a long time\". I was honestly lost for words, because I can see what he means, but I honestly didn't think that much of it. Both C and I meant what we said when we agreed, but I yeah, idk. This is my first relationship ever, and the pact just seemed like a fun thing to do.\n\nPlease let me know if I'm being a complete asshole without realising it.",

We invited his mum, dad, brother, sister, surviving gparents &amp; 1 of his aunties. We however, didnt invite his other aunty (let's call her paula). Paula, since we met, has taken disdain for me, most likely because I have bright red hair, piercings &amp; tattoos, kinda alternative looking. Shes always made fun of how I look and speak (I'm 5 ft 2, thin and pretty shy), not to mention at every gathering, shes gotten crazy drunk and embarrassed herself.\n\nI said that if he wanted her there we could, but it was my husbands idea not to invite her, at the encouragement of his mum (Paula's sister). He also said he just didnt want the added stress of worrying shed say or do something dumb (she started a fight at his sisters wedding 2 years ago). She also likes to be vocal about her hatred of kids, and the majority of my cousins are under 10, and they are like my siblings- I love them to death.\n\nBasically the wedding happened, without her and it was an incredibly beautiful day. she found out through Facebook about it. She was LIVID, she sent abusive message after message to my poor husband saying how ungrateful he is for not inviting her, and then got his grandparents involved &amp; said that if they didnt cut contact with my husband and I, she would. So now his grandad refuses to speak to him and it's completely ruined him as he looks up to him.\n\nHis mum and dad are on our side though, but it begs the questions AITA for not inviting her and causing all this?",

For the new year I decided to start waking up earlier and walking to work and I've started cooking breakfast to make sure the day gets started in the right way. This week I've been making scrambled eggs (american style), toast and avocado with -&gt; FRESH PARSLEY &lt;- sprinkled on top of the eggs.\n\nEvery morning this week I've woken up my roommate with a really really pleasant surprise of home cooked food. He always acts really grateful, and I'm happy to do it because I enjoy making food... However. After cleaning the plates today I noticed that he had hid ALL of the parsley I had sprinkled on his eggs under his cup.\n\nParsley goes with eggs. He's making his morning experience WORSE by eating around it... and then trying to hide the evidence- WEIRD MUCH??\n\nSo tomorrow I am going to put more parsley on the eggs I make. I'm actually going to put more on than I put yesterday. So yeah. Sorry if this is the wrong format but can you just honestly tell me if I am the asshole in this situation?? I will update this post as developments happen.",

She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.",

      "description": "Obvious Throwaway account. Yadda Yadda..\n\nI'm in a weird spot in life right now, and I'm not sure where to begin with this.. Basically, I've been doing porn on the side to make money. I'm currently in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend. I'm a stay at home mom that can't get a job because of childcare expenses. We live in a pretty high standard of living area and are planning on moving soon. Until then, money's been tight. The child's father gives me child support but it's just enough to cover bills, nothing more. I've turned to making porn videos on pornhub. My boyfriend's upset with me because of it. I've told him time and time again that he can trust me. I've promised to stop after we get moved and I can get a stable income. However he's really upset by it. I'm his first real girlfriend and it bothers him that guys/girls will look at me like that. I don't think it's that big of a deal, I've tried talking to him about it but he refuses. He said he feels like shit for asking me to stop. I told him lastnight that I was going to stop when we move but I wasnt going to disable my account. That way, I can still make money off it, I just won't make new content. He got really upset. I'm torn here because I don't want to upset him but at the same time, I see no harm in doing what I'm doing. Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "I work in an office with 4 cubicles, the woman next to me is Mexican. She openly talks about being Mexican fairly often, with me and other people in the office. We talk about food fairly often, Mexican and otherwise. \n\nI've been wanting to make my own empanadas but all the grocery stores in my town do not carry any Hispanic foods besides the Tex-Mex basics. I thought, if anyone knows where to get Hispanic foods, it would be someone who was Hispanic who makes Hispanic food. Made sense in my head.\n\nToday when I was on my way out to go home, I stopped and said exactly, \"Hey, do you know where to get empanada dough? I can't find it in the stores around here.\"\n\nShe is usually a very warm person, this time she seemed almost exhausted by my question and told me about a store for Hispanic food in the town over. My boss quickly called me over and showed me on his computer some stores that should have it. Another coworker made the comment, \"Jeez, asking the Mexican where to get Mexican food?\" I was a bit stunned so I just mumbled, \"I just thought she might know.\" I tried to change the topic a little and talked about the different kinds of empanadas my partner and I have made, but I wound up saying my byes and rushing out because of the awkwardness. I might actually be in a bit of trouble over this considering the way my boss was acting.\n\nJust how much of a racist asshole was I today? \n\n ",

      "description": "I'm in my early 20's and into hot chicks dominating me, I'm into ballbusting (you can guess what that is) but I'm more of a light to medium max player of it. I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.",

I've given up trying to please them and I've just been telling them to fuck off. On my one day off all week, I ask if we can go out to eat since we haven't in a long time.

Sometimes I’m busy, and sometimes I just really don’t feel like it. I’m currently on break from school, so it’s not like I have an excuse to not want to let him borrow my car, I just don’t want to. I want to be able to know that it’s in my possession ready for me to use if I need it for whatever reason, even if it’s just to go to a friends house. \n\nThe thing is, aside from this issue, my brother and I get along well. I don’t want to hurt his feelings and have it hurt our relationship. \n\nAm I really the asshole for wanting to put myself first when my brother is struggling?

      "title": "AITA for moving out and snapping on my roommate?",
      "description": "Hey everyone. I’m in a bit of a conflict and could use outside opinions. \n\nTo begin, at the beginning of August, I moved in with 2 random college roommate in an off campus townhouse. I signed the lease with two other girls, we will call them H and S. \n\nS turned out to not be a very good roommate but this story is not about her. She moved in and hasn’t stayed a night over sense. She also abandoned a lizard that was on the brink of death when I found it in her room.  Anyway, S is out of the picture now and I thought everything would be fine in a spacious apartment with just one other roommate. \n\nH and I got along for months, even would call her a friend. She is a nice girl but she is a hypochondriac and allows her boyfriend to treat her like crap. She has caught him multiple times on tinder with other girls, going on double dates with his brother and other girls, calling her a bitch on her birthday, and that is just the beginning. I have been supportive of her every time she comes home crying because of him. \n\nOn top of the drama, H has 2 cats that completely ruin the place. She does not tend to the litter box as often as she should, but insists on keeping it in a closet in the kitchen. It stinks up the whole apartment. Not to mention both of the cats are males and have a dominance issue that leads to spraying. She has put off getting them fixed multiple times, and now it’s to the point that the apartment literally reeks of cat. H is also horrible at cleaning up after herself. She leaves rotting food in her room for weeks at a time and doesn’t understand you have to use hot water when cleaning dishes. They are left all caked in food and slippery with grease.\n\nSince S moved out a while ago, H and I have been looking for another roommate. My good friend and old roommate D just got back from a 6 month trip in France and wanted to move into the extra room. H and I happily obliged. \n\nToday, D texted me saying that she was uncomfortable living in the apartment because it reeks and gave her a headache after staying for just a day. I keep to myself in my closed off room when I am home, so I don’t really smell it too much. I brought up this situation with H, suggesting we move the litter box to her room since she has the largest bedroom (by far) and it would help solve some of the issues. \n\nH completely freaked out and said that she refuses to move the box to her room because she doesn’t want her room to smell like poop (even though if she cleaned it regularly, this wouldn’t be an issue) and that she doesn’t have room since her boyfriend is going to be moving into it with her. This was complete news to me. He expected to live here rent free, use my refrigerator, tv, everything but chip in a little for utilities.\n\nI finally snapped and told her D and I are moving out immediately and that her boyfriend can take over my lease. I told her that I am tired of living in a litter box with someone so unwilling to compromise, let alone respect. \n\nNow, I’m not going to pretend I’m the best roommate. I leave clutter around every once in a while, usually mail or school work for a day or 2. But I’m not dirty.\n\nI on one hand feel guilty for snapping and causing conflict right before classes start, but I don’t know if I can handle another semester with her. I also want to live with my friend I have missed for half a year, but I want it to be pleasant for everyone. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for snapping on my roommate and moving out suddenly?\n\nTL,DR; one of my roommates has cats that pee everywhere, who doesn’t clean and is gross. My new roommate got sick from the cats and wants to move out and I want to go with her. I snapped on my old roommate for being gross, selfish and unwilling to compromise.",

      "description": "I work in an office downtown and the other day I forgot lunch. I had class that evening till 10, so I knew I had to eat something. I was extremely busy so ordered a sandwich delivered. It ended up costing like $12, which was around $7 for the food and $5 delivery fee. Under that it said the delivery fee all goes to the delivery guy. It recommended a tip but I decided not to leave one. \n\nWell, when I picked up my food from the front desk, the delivery guy started asking if I wanted to leave a tip. I said \"no\" and he asked if I was 100% sure I absolutely did not want to do that. I got a little uncomfortable but said \"no\" again and left. He scowled at me and left. The receptionist looked at me sideways and said bye to the delivery dude. \n\nI feel terrible for not leaving a tip. Am I the asshole in this scenario. \n\nTL;DR: did not leave a tip for a delivery guy and he was a little salty. ",

      "description": "The last few hours have been spent justifying my actions, and I just need to get an objective opinion.\n\nLast night, I (23M) met friends who are visiting SF just for the weekend. Let's call them Anna and Conor. We knew each other from a company we all worked for and I'm very close with Conor especially. We had dinner, chit chat, lovely. We said our goodbyes and agreed to meet up in the morning and explore the city. \n\nThis morning, I didn't hear from them. There were 3 of them (one girl I'm not close with) and I assumed they were jet lagged and wanted to catch up on sleep. At 10:30 I message Anna to see how she is. No response.\n\nAt 11, I message Conor to see what the plan is. No response. \n\nFlash forward to 1pm and I see on Instagram that they are exploring and have had brunch. I meanwhile haven't eaten yet as I was waiting for them to contact me, as we had agreed. I am visiting SF too for work and so have no other friends here etc.\n\nBy 2pm I'm pissed, and receive messages from them both basically saying they had no WiFi or internet. Bear in mind the Instagram posts. I am at this point upset and angry. I have been friends with them both for a long time, and nothing like this has happened before. What transpired was me asking where they were to speak in person (to make things civil), which was met with them not responding. Again due to lack of WiFi. \n\nEventually, I was told that this was a communication issue and I was overreacting. A few messages later they seem to see my point slightly, but still push back. I feel abandoned, and completely left out. I spent the whole day alone while they had fun. I told them both they are bad friends, and have made me feel terrible.\n\nAITA for being so upset? It's made me reconsider the friendship given their reaction. They have always been great and I've  never even had a disagreement with either of them, but this has really destroyed my opinion. Has ayone else experienced anything like this? ",

      "description": "I had been friends with X for about 12 years.  I met her through a family member (Y).  She’s always been a demanding, manipulative sort. Back then I tolerated it because although she was hard work she was still a good friend. About 2-3 years after I met her she got chronically ill.  She used the illness as leverage for getting her own way even more often.  Still, I didn’t mind so much. \nOver the years we made mutual friends, and Y met a lady (Z) and married her.  As things progressed, X would frequently hang out with mutual friends/Y&amp;Z without inviting me.  Fine – sometimes you want to see people alone, but this was happening more and more often. She even started seeing my nephew who was only 15 at the time.  I started to do the same, because X and the others were always busy doing things at weekends, and so I had to meet other people or sit at home alone.  X told me that it upset her and made her cry that I was seeing friends without her, even though she had been doing the same thing to me for much longer. \nI should point out that I am also chronically ill, mentally.  I’ve had depression/OCD from the age of 8, and used to have bad anxiety (which now only comes in waves when my serotonin levels are low).  At first a lot of the mutual friends either didn’t know or thought it was much less serious than it is, but I am very open about it nowadays and most people know.\nMe and X grew further and further apart.  Not too long ago we attempted reconciliation. I told her how I felt I was being shut out, and how it reminded me of when I was bullied throughout school.  She told me that she was upset that I didn’t seem to care enough about her illness.  I made it clear that it was painful for me to see her getting close to Y and Z without me.  I had found out later that on previous occasions when they had met up that and suggested inviting me along,  X had said ‘she’s busy on that day’ or ‘she wouldn’t like that’.  Never was I even asked.  I also found out that X had lied about cancelling a night out with me under the pretence of having to work, but she went out with Z instead.  It was only when Z posted on Facebook that I found out.  X said work had been cancelled.  Later, Z told me (inadvertently) there had never been work – X just wanted to go out with Z instead.  I know that X has lied to others about such things because I’ve witnessed it.\nThings are going on as before.  X is still meeting up with my friends and family and never asked me, even though she has promised she would least sometimes.  It happened this weekend and it was just too much.  I now don’t want anything to do with her.  I’ll be polite when we cross paths but I have no interest in being a friend any longer. X has managed to convince everyone that she is the ‘victim’ here because she is ill and needs special treatment, and I’m the bad guy for not giving it to her.  Some people even tell me that I’m over-reacting because of my mental issues.  It’s painful and isolating.\n\n",

      "description": "So, I’m a mid-twenties woman in a small town in the UK. Theres a regular customer who has been asking me out and trying to flirt. I don’t really mind this/brush it off since I won’t waste negative energy on someone who likely believes they’re just being nice.\n\nFast forward a few months; I’m a smoker and was outside the store and along the street for a cigarette break. This regular customer notices me and comes over to chat. I’m a little annoyed since I more or less want some peace while I smoke but I chat any way. As he was about to leave, he asks for a kiss and proceeds to lean in for one; I immediately pull away and shout ‘no’ before even thinking. He laughs and leaves.\n\nNow, for context I’m bisexual with a preference for women, so during his advances have told him I’m a lesbian in panic in an attempt for him to leave me alone, which I now see as wrong and has only made him pursue harder.\n\nSo my question is, I’ve grown sick and tired of being made to feel uncomfortable by his advances, after repeatedly trying to politely reject him to no avail. Would I be an asshole if I confronted him in a colder manner? Is he just so oblivious to my rejections? I feel like squashing this behaviour in a softer nicer way isn’t working for me but I also don’t want to step out of bounds in my work place and face major consequences if he decides to be the asshole and complain. \n\nMy boss and I get on really well, and I fully believe they’ll have my back on this, but I’m unsure what upper management would do in this scenario.",

      "description": "I have always been the person everyone runs to whenever they need something. I won't (can't) say no when I know someone needs help. This makes \"friendships\" very interesting because people tend to remember me only when they need something.\n\nIn the last 3 years, I cut about a dozen people from my life. Out of them, 3 were actually very important to me; one of them was even my BFF. \n\nIt's the same story for all of them. Friend needs something so they call me for help. In most cases, it's something like babysitting their kids while they go out, or driving them somewhere when they need a ride. Many times though, I have also helped them moved, have cleaned their houses for them when they couldn't, and even allowed them to live with me when they couldn't live at home. \n\nAnd I'd run, every single time someone needed me, I'd be right there for them.\n\nMy \"awakening\" happened a few years ago when one day, my daughter simply asked me if my BFF and I weren't talking anymore. I wondered why she'd think that and she told me it was because my BFF never liked or commented on anything I posted on social media. I had never realized that up to that point, so I started paying closer attention. Sure enough, any of our friends posted something, she'd love it, comment it or whatever. Nothing whenever I posted something. She even ignored my comments on her own posts, while liking/commenting everything else others wrote. I asked her and she said I was being stupid, she was just busy. She would never call me to talk or get together, and whenever I'd call her, she'd say she was too busy (and then I'd see her out with other friends). \n\nThis went on for 2 years. The day I basically said \"FUCK YOU\" was after another friend made a group chat to invite us (about 5 friends in total, ex-bff included) to her b-day brunch. My husband had had an accident and was in the hospital (nothing serious, more for observation) and I posted that I couldn't make it cuz SO was in the hospital and I didn't know what time he'd be released.\n\nShe never asked what happened. She never asked if he was ok. She never called or messaged. When I got home, I deleted her (and all her friends) off all social media and never contacted her again. \n\nAITA for expecting more from her?",

      "description": "Not exactly sure what subreddit this goes in. But My girlfriend (20F) and I (19M) have been together for a year and a half now. She lives with her parents still and I share an apartment with 2 other guys. Her parents are extremely conservative and I think are just making her feel guilty anytime she is at the house with them. I don’t believe it’s directed at her but her mom has said before to her “don’t get pregnant it will change your life” and so she will feel guilty just because she and I aren’t conservative and are definitely liberal at our core. Basically because of her upbringing and her background she thinks that sex is super scary and that she will get pregnant immediately if I never wear a condom. So that’s fine I wrap it up. I spend the night occasionally at hers and she’ll sometimes come hangout at mine. Never spending the night of course because that’d be the end of the world for her parents.  She claims to enjoy sex and so once a month I’ll get to have sex with my girlfriend. Mind you I have to pull out while I wear a condom that is coated in spermicide. She’s an athlete like me though and extremely skinny so it’s not uncommon for their period cycles to be out of wack. Some months we have more sex others we have less. She’ll blow me here and there and give a handjob despite me telling her I don’t like them. But every month the week before she gets her period she’ll say that she’s late (23 day cycle is normal for her) and that she’s worried about being pregnant. How could she possibly be worried if we are only having sex once in a given month? and when we do have sex, I pull out with a condom on right before I finish or I won’t even finish via having vaginal sex at all because we don’t have it enough for me to be able to have sex with her at a pace that I can finish at... (basically got mad at me last time because she climaxed and I hadn’t yet and it was painful for her. Gee I wonder why) I try and tell her there’s no possible way she could be, she goes onto say that I’ll never understand because it’s not my body and that I’m not the one that could have a human growing inside of them....\n\nMore background, she and both of her siblings all went to catholic school and her sister(23) recently got married to her high school sweetheart. Another relationship that would shame her about sex and sex before marriage. They supposedly abstained up until marriage. That’s something she had used to say but said I had changed her mind about that. And also had told me that beginning of our relationship last year she’d be able to spend the night with me more as our relationship progressed. She even brought up that her sister is moving out next year and she may move in with them. \n\nWe definitely had a lot more sex last year but I’ve gotten a promotion and she didn’t so she’s trying to focus more. And she also had girlfriends’ houses last year she said she was spending the night at but has since distanced herself. So her parents are a lot more protective this year than last and it’s impacting our sex life. \nShe claims to enjoy sex and sometimes she’ll be the one to initiate it. Only when I’m not talking to her about it and basically when I forget about it completely. \n\nSo I guess what Im just going to start doing is trying not to even think about sex with my girlfriend at all and never be the one to initiate it. Because it winds up just blowing up in my face when I do. It’s not fair to me but I’m hoping to marry this girl eventually and hope that she’ll sexually blossom in the years to come. But right now she’s driving me insane with constantly worrying and it’s making me just want to distance myself from that aspect of our relationship. \n\nTL:DR girlfriend has vaginal sex with me once a month where I have to pull out with a condom on. Complains that she may be pregnant every month. ",

      "description": "Throwaway account. Here’s some background: My ex and I dated for about a month before we realized we weren’t right for each other (so it wasn’t a very serious relationship). Despite this we realized we are completely right as friends. We still hang out regularly because we have similar hobbies and humor and have mutual friend groups. I have been dating my current boyfriend for four months now and it’s great. We’re nothing similar like me and my ex, but we connect on greater level where we aren’t fighting all the time like I was with my ex. It’s a much better relationship. Because my ex and I are so close, he and my bf have hung out a couple times with me and others. Both times it seemed fine and they actually got along well.\n\nHere’s the problem: In March a few of my friends are going to Maine to go hiking and see a friend couple who recently moved. My ex is among these friends going. I mentioned it to my bf and he wants to come and...I don’t want him to lol. First he doesn’t even know those friends and two, these are my friends. I want to be alone with them. He just came from some game convention thing with his friends that I didn’t even ask to go to (for one thing, idc about games) I know people need time with their friends. I told my bf I didn’t think that was a good idea and he said he didn’t see the problem since two people who are coming are in a relationship. However, they were already in the friend group and not a couple when I first met them and they’re the only couple besides the one in Maine. He got upset and said he only wanted to share an activity with me and feels bad that I’m more okay with spending time with my ex than I am with him and that I act very cliquey. However, I only spend time with my ex because we’re friends. If I hated everything about him, obviously I would not want to hang out with him. Am I being an asshole here?\n\nTl;dr: ex and I are still friends and we’re going on a trip. Bf wants to tag along and I said no. AITA?",

I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n——————————————————————\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**",

      "description": "Okay so some background. My sister (16) and I (19) have recently started going swimming every weekend to try and improve our health. We both have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, so we can’t go super fast and we have to take a lot of breaks, but we can swim at a perfectly decent speed which usually isn’t a problem.\n\nThe pool we swim at has three lanes: one lane has a parent and toddler class on a Saturday morning so it’s out of bounds. The second is an adults and children lane, and the third is adults only. My sister and I were swimming in the adults lane when a man came in who was swimming much faster than us. And he wouldn’t stop at all between laps. It quickly became impossible for my sister and I to swim in the lane, because every single time we started, he’d catch up to us and we’d hold him back. He made it very clear we were getting in the way, saying excuse me and knocking into me a few times (I think on purpose but I’m not sure). He also seemed to get annoyed by us taking breaks and standing at the end of the pool, even though we tried to keep out of the way. He also wouldn’t keep in line, he was kind of zigzagging across the lane trying to overtake everybody. It was a nightmare.\n\nEventually he got our attention and said to us: “Excuse me girls, this is the ADULT lane, and it can be quite fast. Maybe you’d be better suited to that lane” (points to the children’s lane). This pissed me off for two reasons. Firstly the other lane was completely full and nobody was following the rules about swimming clockwise, so it would be completely impossible for us to swim there. Secondly, I look a little young for my age but I’m clearly not a child, and the way he talked to me was very condescending. I didn’t want to make a scene so I just gave him a kind of grimace smile and continued swimming in the adult lane. We ended up getting out a few minutes later though, because it was so annoying. \n\nAITA for not moving? I’m genuinely not sure because as much as my sister and I are entitled to swim there, he is too and we were slowing him down quite a bit. But I don’t want to feel like I can’t swim in a shared pool just because of one person. I’ve been wanting to bring my blind friend swimming with me but now I’m worried that people will get annoyed with her too, and she can be quite easily upset if she thinks she’s inconveniencing people.",

      "description": "Does it matter if somebody asks me not to?\n\nDoes it matter if my office or house can only be accessed through the area that has been cut off? \n\nOtherwise, I  have two frequently occurring examples when it wasn't blocking my apartment or office:\n\nExample 1: Most frequently this occurs when I'm heading or leaving my Best friend's house. For whatever reason fashion shows, award show red carpets and film/tv shoots keep happening in the area in front of her apartment building, and so I've accidentally cut through weird red carpets before trying to leave in a hurry (no one told me not too, and I was confused what was happening. But I didn't have time to figure out if there was a way to go around because I had somewhere to be.) ; so I charged through the chaos) and one film shoot, which the production assistant asked me to go a different way when trying to get to my friend's apartment, but there was no way around it to get in.\n\nExample 2: I  used to go to school in NYU, and they would always have film sets all over the Washington Square area, and production assistants blocking off spaces in the park or space by the West 4th station when they weren't even filming at the moment. So if I was running late for class (which I would be very late for if I took their proposed detour), I would just walk past the PA's with my headphones even though I knew they were trying to ask me to walk around the park.\n\nSeveral times, I've been yelled at by security guys. Ironically  always in situations where they are blocking the only exit or entrance, and when no one told me to go around the set or fashion show paparazzi area to begin with. But I usually respond with \"sorry, I'm late,\" and keep walking. I feel like I might be an asshole, and I also feel like the entertainment and fashion industry are assholes for expecting people to change their lives for their commercial gain.",

      "title": "AITA for being pissed at my girlfriend for adopting a cat?",
      "description": "I wrote this out once, but it ended up being super long so I tried to cut it down a bit. It didn't work too well. I (23m) am pissed at my girlfriend (24f) for going out and adopting a cat today, without even talking to me about it. We've been together for a little over a year, and have known each other for about a year and a half. She has a two year old daughter from a previous relationship, and they split custody almost 50/50. I had no intentions of having kids at this point in my life, but here I am trying to do my best. \n\nAnyway, my girlfriend recently moved out of her sister's house after her sister's dog bit her daughter. She moved into a small apartment on her own. I haven't moved in because my commute to work would be about an hour, and she's not even sure she's going to stay there when her lease is up near the end of this year. Also I'm just not sure I'm ready for that. She took two pay cuts last year, one because her job was making her miserable so she found something else. The other because the new place fired her and a bunch of other people after they got a remote staff. I gave her support and encouragement both times. Now she makes less than ever, and is trying to make it on her own. Her new job was super understanding of the move and everybody donated stuff to help her get on her feet, and they pooled together about $2000 to help her so she wouldn't have to get a second job. My problem is that she has no concept of financial responsibility. She's constantly spending money on useless things, without concern for how it will affect her bank account in the morning. For example, a $30 oil diffuser that she used for a week and then gave away because it wasn't helping her sleep like the internet said it would. She got one $30 lamp (that didn't even come with a shade), instead of the 3 $10 lamps that I suggested, but now complains that it's too dark. She has two gym memberships that she never uses, she just bought the new iPhone, even though her old one worked just fine, etc. We always go back and forth over what she should, and shouldn't buy, and she's already gone in the negatives, and needed someone to bail her out. I constantly try to help her with advice, and she always nods and then does the exact opposite, and it comes around to bite her in the butt. Or she'll call up her dad right in front of me, and ask him, and he'll say the same thing I did. I come from a family that is terrible with their money, and I've been helping to pay bills, (groceries, rent, medical bills, new appliances, renovations, taxes one year, brother's attorney most recently) since I was 10, while my stepdad was out buying a motorcycle, new guns, etc. So I know what it's like to be in a family with spending problems, eventually someone has to pay. But this means I also know how to handle my finances, and am usually never strapped for cash. Whereas, she's always had her dad (who generally agrees with me about her spending habits) to bail her out when things get hairy.\n\nSo this brings us to this cat. She said she gets bored and lonely on the rare weekend where she doesn't have her daughter, and I have things to get done at my house so I don't come to her. So she adopted an 8 year old cat. She got the cat for the two days every other month that she's alone, but it's going to be another responsibility every day for her. She complains that when she has her daughter she never has time to get things done, so instead of getting back into the gym those day, or getting a hobby, she got a living creature that she will now be responsible for. It has all of its shots, and its check ups are all up to date, I get it, she doesn't have to put much money into the cat right now, but eventually she will. Between cat food, litter, vet bills, damage to the furniture or apartment, eventually it will be a burden. She has a 2 year old who is already so much responsibility, I don't know why she thought a pet would make things better. The other problem is she knows that I'm allergic to cats. She knows they make my eyes, neck, and back of my throat itchy, they make my eyes water, and nose run. It's unpleasant for me to be around cats like that. They're cute to look at on the internet, but that's just where I prefer them to stay. She knows this. Yes, I can take allergy medicine but it's not 100% effective, plus that's more money that I have to spend, just to be mostly comfortable when I'm with her. I can honestly get past the allergy part, I'm bothered that I didn't factor in at all into her decision, sure, but the money thing is really what's concerning to me. Sure the cat could end up being perfect with no extra vet bills, but that would only encourage her to get more unnecessary things. Also this isn't the first animal she's adopted. She got a dog not long before she got pregnant while she was living with her ex in an apartment. Then she had to give it to her dad when she couldn't handle it while being pregnant. \n\nSo basically I'm hurt that she didn't even ask me about it. She said no matter what I said it wouldn't have stopped her. She's surprised I'm making such a big deal out of this, and that I'll just get over it. I didn't ask her to, but she said she won't apologize for doing it or even for not getting my opinion, and is acting like I'm a terrible person. Any major thing I do, I try to hear out her opinion on, because this is supposed to be a team effort, but she purposely didn't say anything to me because she knows I would have told her I didn't think it would be a good idea. Since I don't live there I don't get a say, even though she wants me to move in, but with her getting a cat I'm even less likely to do it. I get that we don't split bills and that she can spend her money however she wants, but I'm concerned that she won't change in the future when the bills are split, and I'll be in a family that struggles just like I've been in for the past 23 years. Or that she won't have the money when her daughter actually needs something, and I don't mean another giant toy that there's no room for. She has so many medical bills from herself and her daughter, and I know there will be more, no two year old in daycare stays healthy for long. I told her I wasn't okay with it, and that I'm very frustrated with this decision. I didn't give her an ultimatum or anything, and honestly I don't know what I even want to happen moving forward. I'm just at my wits end, and I wish she saved for unexpected expenses, and would listen to me for once. I've never taken more than about five minutes to move on after her poor decisions, but this time it's been all day, and I still haven't moved on. Am I the asshole for being so frustrated by this, or is she right and I should just get over it?",

He found out I'm leaving school and he came up to me and was upset about how things ended, he wasn't ready to not see me in school everyday, not have me be at least somewhere around and he said he wishes he could get a re-do because I was always the one and what not. I did try to talk to him through December because I heard his father passed away and I guess I just haven't gotten over him. He has a girlfriend now and he knows I still have feelings for him, but he keeps doing little things like send stuff over to my house or say good things about me when I'm not around and even asks people stuff about me. It really does make me happy, but I know it's not healthy and I want to completely change my life, hence the school change. But he is putting his relationship in the pits and I understand why he could feel like I've been leading him on since everyone knows I never stopped loving him. In fact, it is so hard for me to not fall into his arms right now, but I want to grow and start afresh. His current girlfriend has stopped talking to him and I think they're on the verge of a break up and I can't help but think it's because he thought he could be with me. I've never stopped hurting from how we left things two years ago but I don't believe any good can come of this. I'm scared I'm hurting him, again.",

      "description": "Strap in folks\n\nSo I've come to the realization that I often find myself more attracted to people (mostly girls but I swing both ways) who have mental issues than those without.\n\nThis is for two reasons:\n\nFirst of all, I have mental issues myself (depression, anxiety, autism, etc) and I often find that it is easier to relate to those who also share these and other mental illnesses in many aspects of life. Sharing experiences and thought process helps me feel less of a weirdo and that there are people like me.\n\nSecondly, I enjoy helping other people through their problems. I get quite a bit of satisfaction out of seeing somebody's life take a turn for the better and knowing I helped with that improvement. So I like hearing peoples problems and giving advice and sometimes going out of my way and sacrificing my mental health and well being to help them improve their mental states, education, relationships, etc.\n\nI told a friend about this attraction once. And to say she was offended is an understatement.\n\nI got a very long, scathing speech about how I'm taking advantage of those with mental issues, how I'm a terrible person and a villain with a hero complex. \n\nI made the mistake of trying to explain myself, and got blocked.\n\nI was hurt, because she was a really good friend, but I also felt ashamed of myself for having this attraction.\n\nAITA?

She said it was so that I wouldn't get stressed during my exams, which I can understand, but I explained to her that it was my nan and I had a right to know, and for future reference could she please tell me as I didn't want her to bare the burden alone. We're all family. She agreed. Fast forward a year and my nans cancer has taken a turn for the worst I get that this is her mother and she had her own coping system, but the only reason I found out was because my step brother told me. I chose to not say anything about her breaking her promise and consoled her as much as I could.\n\nThere have been other little things here and there after this, like my stepdad having a stroke and my brother's telling me, but I'm going to fast forward past this to last year. I was walking in the street of my old hometown and bumped into an old friend of the family and got chatting. After all the formalities, I was asked how my mom was doing now and if she was feeling better. Absolutely dumbfounded I asked what he meant, it turned out  that she'd had troubles with her womb and needed to have a hysterectomy, but they couldn't operate on her because she'd also had some issues with circulation in her legs and had a bad blood clot and some other issues (my memory of the whole ordeal is hazy and everytime I asked mom about this she'd always tell me it was nothing and not to worry). So after I confronted mom about not telling me this, I got the usual didn't want to worry me, and it wasn't that big a deal etc etc. I did lose my shit a little bit with this one, because as her only child I should be made aware of these things and how would she like it if I withheld information like that from her. \n\nShe then apologised and again told me that she would let me know for future reference. In her defence, she did keep me up to date with what was going on with her for a while, and gave me dates when she had her hysterectomy surgery so I was there for her and gave all the support I could. However, after the surgery she failed to tell me the one thing I worried would happen, that during the surgery her bladder got perverated and caused her to be incontinent. She tried to keep this from me for weeks until my stepdad told me. I again tried to have a stern but fair conversation with her. She's not been able to work nearly a year now while she's been on the waiting list to have repairation surgery, but did keep me up to date with appointments again.\n\nFast forward to today and I've just received a call from my step brother telling me that she's had her surgery today but hasn't came out yet. He's at the hospital waiting for her. To give you insight. My step brother (her husband's son) lives in Amsterdam, we live in the UK. He knew and came all the way over here a few days earlier from Christmas so he could see her, and I find out because he tells me. \n\nI'm getting fed up with it now, I'm always the last to hear about anything and I want to be there for my family, and it hurts that I'm always kept in the dark about this stuff. I'm going to the hospital after work to see her but it's going to take all my willpower to not lose it. Reddit, AITA for being selfish about this?",

      "description": "So I know this guy who has actual diagnosed autism. We have been friends for about a year now. He doesn't have many friends but I thought he was fun to be around. We sent eachother memes and just did normal things that online friends do. So anyway I made a discord server and naturally he was invited. I gave him admin privilages because I trusted him. This particular server had an NSFW channel. Sometimes people posted NSFW art of a video game called Splatoon. Every time someone did he and I got really angry and claimed the characters were too pure for this. I was joking, but I soon found out that he was not. It escalated to the point where he started deleting those NSFW messages. I took action and removed his admin privilages and blocked him from viewing the channel. He soon responded with \"But I thought you said no Splatoon NSFW?\" Then before I could explain myself he left. I feel like I should have maybe given him a second chance or just not have given him admin privilages in the first place? He does have autism and I now realize he doesn't understand sarcasm very well. I just feel like a really shitty friend right now and I want some outside opinions.",

      "description": "A couple months ago I decided to play a 1v1 bet against my friend in a fighting game called Brawlhalla. He was the one who offered the bet to me, which was surprising because he is known to be pretty bad at the game. I quickly accepted his offer and we began fighting. After a couple lost games I realized I was getting destroyed and a little tilted, so i did a big bet in an attempt to get my money back. I lost that one too, and at this point I owed about $160.  I decided that I wasn’t going to be able to beat him so I stopped betting against him and agreed to pay him the money that I owed him as soon as I had the money. A couple weeks later I wanted to get Black Ops 4 because my friends were all playing it and the same friend I bet against agreed to buy the game for me. The game cost about $35, putting me at about $195 in debt.  Fast forward to today, about a month later. My other friend who is known to be very good at brawlhalla told me that during the entirety of my bets, he was playing for the worse friend. He told me this because he didn’t realistically expect me to pay $195 so instead he should just settle for the $35 I ACTUALLY owed instead of the money that they tried to scam me from.  So I was a little bit pissed upon hearing that my friend tried scamming me out of $160 and I decided to test him. I pretended like I had the full $195 and was ready to pay him, and he said “okay yea ill take it”. At this point I realized he was fully willing to completely scam me out of $195 and I now feel like the $35 that I owe him aside from the scam bets should not be paid. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Honestly I'm torn on this one so, internet do your thing.\n\nSo when ever we play monopoly, my younger brother often goes around the board once (if that) and quits. Usually he doesn't have any property and if he does we just auction it off or he gives it to someone. I'm honestly fine with that. \n\nTonight, my sister, her friend, my brother and I were playing and right on que he quits while running off to play fortnite. We decide since he has a couple properties to just let him play as a \"ghost\", rolling for him, he buys any properties he lands on that he can, and making only legit fair trades we all approve of.\n\nSo all was going ok and the game was nearing an end when my sister's friend starts running out of money. Since she lands on brother's spot, we jokingly have her go ask if she really has to pay. She pays. After landing on the same space a few times later, she asks again. She pays again. Now hes back and interested. He lands on an unowned spot and I say I'm going to buy it away next turn (we agreed paying double what he paid on our next turn was legit).\n\nSo this is where everything goes down. At this point the other two have him sit with us so I cant just buy it since hes \"playing\". Ok whatever I dont mind too much. But his next turn he wills all his property and money to my sister, calls me a loser and walks away again. I'm having none of this. I argue it should go to auction, she argues he can do what he wants with it. At this point we're all annoyed. I throw the dice annoyedly on the board and we all decide it's a good place to stop. We joke around and come out fine but still lowkey annoyed at one another. \n\nSo, Tl:Dr, am I the asshole for getting annoyed at sibling monopoly time?",

      "description": "This happened over the weekend and im still feeling fallout.\n\nI own a business. I hired a man who became my best friend. Both me, him, and another employee of mine try to go out to a fancy restaurant every month, get slightly drunk, and talk about whatever. Music, politics, sports, ect. Stuff we imagine really snobby rich people do since we all came from modest backgrounds.\n\nWe call it white tie night, though we dont actually wear white ties. We also bring dates, i bring my wife. My wife set up my best friend with her sister, they are now married. Yadayada background over.\n\nSo this weekend was white tie night. My best friend, now brother in law, brings his wife my sister in law. We start drinking, having fun. The subject turns to the media and journalists.\n\nI hate them. IMO they profit off of discontent and tragedy, theyre not out to report the truth theyre just out to report what gets the most clicks or views or whatever. I also hate the fact that you cant criticize their grossness without being called anti first amendment.\n\nNews flash, theyre billion dollar corporations, just like banks. They need to be critisized. I also think people who go into journalism are usually sociopaths who need to control what people see and how they view things. They want people to die and get hurt and they want people to fight. I view them like war profiteers. The movie Nightcrawler comes to mind.\n\nNow i was also drunk like everyone else so i mightve been more passionate but it was white tie night and im around family and friends. Other people have ranted about politicians, celebrities, corporations, ect and even if we disagreed it was all in good fun.\n\nWell lo and behold, my sister in law changed her major to journalism last year. I didnt know, i thought she wanted to be a vet. My sister in law says im being offensive, I retort that she made fun of guys with southern accents in the past and i didnt whine despite me having one, and thats not even a choice on my part.\n\nThe whole evening is awkward. My wife and brother in law try to save it but it was a bust. Apparently my sister in law has been shit talking me to my wife whose defending me.\n\nAm i the asshole?",

      "description": "Weird title, I know.\nHere’s a little bit of backstory: I dated this girl for almost 6 months, but we “quickly” found out we were more like great friends than a couple, so we broke it up and continued to talk regularly. During the time we were together, me and my family would give her gifts. I would often get her clothes from the store I used to work at.\nAnyway, about a two ago, I ordered a hoodie from a Chinese girl on instagram, at 400$. The hoodie came about a month later. Once it got here, I realized that the size was actually in the asian size chart, instead of american, so it didn’t fit me right at all. I call the girl and she tells me she could change it for me, so I wait another month for the hoodie to arrive, and when it does, the girl has the audacity to tell me that she can’t change it, but rather lower the price of the original by 10$, because the one she first gave me didn’t have a tag anymore, even though it never had a tag in the first place! So I just say fuck it and buy the hoodie for a second time at 30$, it just so happened that the day I went to get it, my ex was waiting for me at my house, so we started talking and I let her know about the hoodie and she says she’ll take it off my hands. Since I didn’t feel like making her pay full price, I told her I would do 30$ to at least make up for having to buy it again. She posts a picture of it on instagram and my dad happened to see, he then casually tells me “hey, isn’t that the same hoodie you bought like two months ago?” and I then explained the situation. He then scolded me and told me I should have given it to her for free (even though I used to make 260$ a month, so 70$ for a hoodie is a lot of money for me) so I call her up and let her know she could keep it.\n\nNow it’s eating me up, I’m not sure if I should have just given it to her to begin with or if giving it to her for 30$ wasn’t such a big deal. AITA here?",

      "title": "AITA: For Not Wanting To Be Around Most Of My Siblings",
      "description": "This argument has been going on for years between me and my parents, but has quieted down a little bit in the recent years since I've started college. The argument is that I don't want to actively pursue a relationship with the majority of my siblings, and though I've stopped actively avoiding them, I don't want them in my life (with the exception of two of my older brothers). This had always upset my parents, who firmly believe that you don't have to like your family but you still have to love them. In the end I cave and argue to do whatever my parents ask of me, but I want that to change now that I have started college. Thankfully now I don't interact with my siblings much at all, except for one brother whom I'm really close with and goes to college with me.\n\nBefore however, my parents would have me share rooms with my siblings who had moved back in for a reason or another, and in any argument that would start between me and another siblings, I would be excepted to be mature about it and let the situation go, because I was the most responsible. More often than not I was told to bite my tongue around my other siblings and whenever I would avoid them my parents would guilt trip me into hanging out with them.\n\nSo, some background on why I hate my siblings so much, most at least. At least 4 of my siblings are current or recovering drug addicts, and I think a few still are in trouble with the law. One reason I personally don't want them near me is because I don't want to be associated with anything illegal. \n\nAnother reason is the way they treat me and my parents. Since I'm the youngest I don't have perfect memory of their childhoods or mine for that matter. But I remember a lot of stories that I've been told by my parents about my siblings. A lot of them used to steal from us, probably to buy drugs. Two of my siblings I especially want to avoid are my sister and one of my oldest brothers.\n\n(Some background: anger issues and disabilities practically run in my family, which makes arguments that much more worse. I am legally disabled and have been since 7 years old, and I have medications I take every day for my disabilities.) My only sister, several years ago when I was in elementary school, we believe had stolen my medication and sold it. My parents had because so upset and worried, that they installed a lock on the cabinet where the meds were, which I believe conveniently was dismantled about two weeks later. She, in my opinion, has always put drugs and her self before anyone else. Often did drugs or drank in front of my, behind my parents back. Would be in and out of prison constantly. Would call random people in the middle of the night while I was trying to sleep (we shared a room until she moved out at 18). And never respected anyone. She constantly starts drama with anyone, isn't below using violence to get her way and will readily complain about being poor and then buy like $50 manicures every week. Me and her were never really close, as she preferred her friends over me and would get mad at my parents when they would make her play with me. The only times she would \"play with me\" voluntarily (for the most part that I can remember) was when should would take me or my brother somewhere under the impression of going somewhere to play, when she really would be taking us to where should could meet friends, or boyfriends, and on one occasion drink and smoke in front of me, I was 7. At 11 it was common knowledge for me not to touch our laundry basket because I was afraid of breaking a liquor bottle that she occasionally hid in there. I remember at one point, I was maybe 9, me, my sister and my mom were in the car going somewhere and my sister was complaining about how clingy I was. My mom said smiling that my sister was the one who begged for a little sister and my sister responded in an upset tone \"well I regret it\". And I don't think I've ever felt that unloved and worthless before. Don't get me wrong I have loving parents and my siblings say they love me. But in that moment I think I finally realized I was never going to get the loving relationship with my sister that was like it was in the movies or the way my friends described their sister were like.\n\nIn another instance one of my older brothers, his wife and their baby was living with us for 2 years (I believe rent free or incredibly cheap, as my parents believed in helping family when they are down). Though we have no solid proof we believe they were addicts. Some reasons for our suspicions were random pills scattered in drawers or on tables (no bottle in sight), our codine cough syrup was weirdly empty after a few months of them living there (even though only two people used it and neither said it was anything less than half full. And it was a BIG bottle too), and they always worked jobs that would pay them in cash at the end of the night (even though they conveniently seemed to never half enough money for anything that they begged/made my parents buy for my nephew (their son)). They would occasionally make me baby sit my newphew with no thanks or pay. Sometimes they woild leave me with him, saying they would be back at 10 pm or soemthing but wouldnt be found til 2 am. Always made my dad or another one of my older brothers baby sit my nephew constantly, even when they were in the house themselves, they just wouldn't pay attention to him and my parents would have to step up to the plate. During the first year they were there Christmas had passed and everyone got gifts, I had gotten a new camera I was really exited about and a bag for it. But since I didn't need it I put it away in my closet, that a shared with my niece because we shared a room. Fast forward 4 months and I decide I know a perfect place I could take pictures of with my camera. I go looking for it and it's gone, only the travel bag is left. I was fuming and told my parents, we searched but never found it. My parents believe it was stolen and pawned my brother or his now ex wife, as they had done the same with an xbox they had rented in my mom's name. I remember vividly, no words of apologies, but my parents asking how I could be so careless leaving something expensive \"lying around\" when I know my siblings have stolen stuff before. I still feel guilty about not being more careful to this day because I know the camera costed at least $300 which we definitely could have used to keep on tract with bills.\n\nIn the end, though my siblings have grown up some and changed in the time since I've last seen them. But a lot of the stuff they've done still mess me up today. I went through depression in high school for 2 years and during that I tried to get closure with my sister for the way I felt she treated me. I'll admit I didn't go about it the right way, I ended up explaining that I had been writing about things she had done when I was little and that I was sharing them with a self help group. She got mad and stormed off. My mom come to me and told me to accept that my sister would never apologize, that it was so long ago no one knows if what I remember actually happened and to just let it go. My sister ended up coming back and I apologized and sorta argued to move forward a forget the past (though I don't think I can). And while I'd like to think that they have changed, both have kids, their own homes, but still start drama on facebook, sister still continues to do drugs, fight and \"divorce\" her husband. I don't think I'll really ever be able to trust them. And I know that they've had their own issues to overcome that could be the cause of drug abuse (one was raped when they were a toddler. And the other had lived with a drug addicted mother till puberty) I don't feel that the way the choose to cope with it was okay or a right thing to put others through.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting to be near them? I don't have the heart to tell any one it's because I'm afraid of letting them in my life and just being used for profit or gain again. Or should I stay firm if my parents ask me make accommodations for them, and tell them no? I want a relationship with my siblings but I feel that they don't really care. It's past the point of where I don't actually believe it when they say they love me, no matter how much I genuinely want them to.",

      "description": "Obligatory disclaimers here at the beginning: this is probably gonna be a throwaway account as I'm not much of a Reddit user and I don't want this getting back to me for reasons that will become obvious, so apologies if I'm shitty at replying to comments. Also I'm on the mobile app and apparently that fucks with formatting, so apologies if this post looks a little bit wonky. Sorry if this gets long but y'all are gonna need a bit of backstory for context and I have a real issue with rambling. \n\nI met my now ex-girlfriend at school when we were 14. We were best friends for a year before we began dating and then were together for about six years. I'm 22 now and we've been broken up for a little over six months. I find it easier to tell a story with names so we'll call my ex Jessica. \n\nThe year that we were friends was great. We were both kind of \"emo kids\" and, being that we lived kind of in the middle of nowhere and there weren't any other emos at our school, we kinda naturally drifted towards each other. She was a kind, sweet girl at first - very bubbly, always smiling, always friendly to everybody. She could be a little hyperactive at times, but I'm incredibly laid back and  a bit shy so we kinda  balanced each other's energy perfectly. We'd hang out at each other's houses almost every night after school and play video games, or go walk around the local park if the weather was nicer. I awkwardly asked her out on Valentine's Day of 2012, thinking I was being dead romantic. Still one of the biggest mistakes of my life. \n\nShe started to change pretty soon after we started dating. She'd always been semi-jealous when it came to me, even when we were just friends. Think, if anyone else called me their best friend she'd get on their arse like \"actually sweetie he's *MY* best friend but nice try :)\" or she'd sulk a little if I made plans with other friends and didn't invite her. I'd always found it endearing, I guess because I was never the one getting chewed out. Boy did that change when we started dating! If I so much as spoke to another girl to ask her for the homework for some class, Jessica would get angry with me and demand to know who she was and what we were talking about. I did confront her about it a couple months into the relationship and she cried and told me she was super scared of being cheated on because she'd seen her dad do it to her mum her whole life and said she was sorry. At the time I thought that was reasonable, said alright and tried to move past it. \n\nThe jealousy didn't stop. In fact, it only continued to escalate. When we were 16 she, without my knowing or my consent, went through my Facebook friends and Instagram followers and blocked any girls I wasn't related to. When we were 18 we started renting a flat together and she threatened one of our neighbours to \"keep the fuck away from me\" because she brought over cookies as a welcome gift while Jessica was out. That same year when I came out as bisexual, she told me that she didn't want me hanging out with my best friend since childhood because he was gay and she was afraid of any \"funny business\" going on. It reached a point where she wouldn't even let me go to the hairdresser's because the only one in our town had three women and a gay guy working there and she didn't want any of them touching me. She also repeatedly called my workplace saying I needed to come home because there was an emergency if she knew I was on a shift with all female co-workers (which was often) resulting in me eventually being sacked. \n\nHonestly, if it was just the intense jealousy, I might have been able to cope, or try to salvage some semblance of a relationship with her. But she would also insult me constantly. I'm pretty prone to eczema and she'd make fun of me if I had a breakout of it on my face. She mocked me when I lost my job and she became the breadwinner of the house. She'd either tease me or get incredibly angry with me if I ever cried about anything (I'm a sucker for crying at films). I gained a little weight around 19 when I had an injury and could no longer go to the gym and she called me fat relentlessly (in hindsight, I really wasn't fat at all), which I believe was one of the catalysts to me developing bulimia. All in all it was a shitty, emotionally abusive situation and I should've gotten out of it sooner than I did. \n\nI eventually broke it off because she started to become physically and sexually violent and I was genuinely afraid for my life one night. I'm now staying with my aforementioned childhood best friend and his husband, have a new job, am in recovery for my eating disorder and am well on the way to getting back on my feet. To be clear, I'm not asking if I'm the asshole because of what happened in the relationship because I've come to accept that I was a victim and none of it was my fault. \n\nHowever. A \"friend of Jessica's\" recently reached out to me to let me know that Jess has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and is recieving treatment for it. My response was basically \"ah that sucks for her and I'm glad she's getting treatment but what's that to do with me?\"  What eventually transpired was that I was not speaking to her friend, but in fact Jessica herself through her friend's account, and that I was expected to forgive everything she did because of her diagnosis. I flat out refused because, while I'm no means an expert on personality disorders and do understand that they can make people act irrationally, I don't believe they're an excuse for outright abusive behaviours. Since I refused to forgive her, I've had countless messages from her, from mutual friends, and even from her mother which all essentially boil down to \"she can't help being an abusive person, you're being awful for not forgiving her.\" I'll note here she hasn't actually *apologised*, just incessantly asked me to \"forgive and forget\", \"get over it\" and even to give her a second chance. I'm starting to doubt that I'm doing the right thing by refusing to accept her BPD as an excuse. AITA and should I forgive her? \n\nTL;DR: my ex was incredibly abusive when we were together and has since been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which she's using to try and justify her behaviours without actually apologising. I refuse to accept it as an excuse and she, her mother and our mutual friends are telling me I'm the asshole for not forgiving her. \n",

I would always just say that i have no information for them since i dont know anything about my birth parents.  \n\nA few months ago i got a message from my birth mother (which the genetic testing service confirmed) who was very polite in reaching out and wanted to make sure i was really her son and if i had any questions. I asked about any diseases i should know about that might run the family i should look out for and she let me know. Then she told me i was her only child and wanted to get in touch through facebook, and that *her* mother wants to speak to me as i'm her only grandkid.   \n\nAt that point i just said \"I'm not really comfortable with that right now\" and there's been no communication since. My parents are making me feel like i did something wrong for blowing her off in so few words and not really leaving the possibility for more of a connection.  \n\nAITA for just straight up denying my birth mothers request, even though i never asked for any sort of relationship?",

And then she said there’s an ATM few mins down to the road she can later bank transfer back to me and ask me to google her name. In my mind, I’m like I’m not going backwards for few mins and take out 40 quid cash and give it to you when I’m getting late for work.

      "description": "I’m not automatically against pit bulls, despite stats involving dog bites. My friend’s pit is the best-trained dog I’ve met, and he has never so much as growled at any person or other dog. The pit bull my ex owns, however, has had two incidents in the past year.  The first incident involved my 5lb dog. His dog &amp; my dog both ate dinner &amp; there must have been a morsel on the floor bc suddenly he growled &amp; snapped &amp;, as my ex describes it, “put Lila’s head inside his mouth” but he didn’t bite bc there would’ve been puncture wounds. In the 2nd incident, my daughter’s 11-year-old friend came over. Normally he’d introduce his dog to new people, but he was in the bathroom&amp; I was taking a nap. My daughter opened the door (he had told her to wait until he was out of the bathroom &amp; she didn’t listen) &amp; his dog lunged at the little girl &amp; bit her hand. Her hand was bruised &amp; bleeding, she had to go to urgent care &amp; skip volleyball camp for a week. I understand that my daughter should’ve listened, but her not listening shouldn’t result in a kid’s hand being scarred. His dog is “insecure” and “just gets nervous,” but he’s also 75lb and in those rare moments he snaps, no one is in control of the situation but him. I’ve tried to be understanding of the fact that he has owned his rescue dog for almost 6 years, but his dog even jumped up and almost knocked me down when I came back from the birth certificate office 4 days after I gave birth, and he jumped up on the bed w my older daughter &amp; knocked the wind out of her. Yesterday the dog head butted my small dog &amp; made her cry again. He has no rules &amp; goes on the couch &amp; bed as he pleases. Cesar Chavez did training with him &amp; it didn’t help, so further training wouldn’t be helpful in my eyes.  Things are getting hairy with this conflict, but I just feel like I can’t risk my daughters’ safety further &amp; I couldn’t live with myself if that dog hurts or kills my newborn. My older daughter I’m not super worried about bc she doesn’t get in his face &amp; he knows her, but dogs snap on babies all the time.... Am I the asshole for implementing a no-pit-bull rule for my home &amp; refusing to have my newborn around the dog? If I am, is there a compromise I’m not seeing? ",

Creepy was actually kinda normal when we first met her, so we let her hang with us at lunch and stuff. Then things shifted into M. Night Shamalama territory. \n\nOne day, Creepy said that she had DID. Now, I have no idea what someone who actually has it is like. So I said that mental illness doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. Now comes the weird part. She said that her pharmacy stopped making her DID pills because “nobody was really using them.” Which sounded illegal and kinda like bullshit. But I went with it. \n\nOne day at lunch, she asked M, S, and I if we wanted to see the her other “personality” which for here, we’ll call Creepy-X. I was hesitant but M and S said okay, so I went with it. Creepy sat in her chair, fell limp, then came back to life while pulling her hood up and—I shit you not—SPEAKING IN AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT. \n\nThings turned into a big spiral of unsettling, like when she was passing out in the middle of the cafeteria, when I found her notebook full of drawings of Youtubers like Jacksepticeye and Markiplier in bondage gear, when she said that she was an allmighty, eternal being... It was just too weird for me. So I gradually stopped hanging out with them. \n\nAm I in the wrong just because I didn’t “get” her? Or was she really just a dangerous person to be around?",

      "description": "For some backstory i recently (6 months ago) had a falling out with a group i used to be close friends with some of which i've known for years.\n\nAmong them tho is an ex of mine (lets called them Jane) that has never-ending reasons for people to throw her pity parties and has spread rumors about me before and another one (and lets call this one Marsha) who has horror stories about other ex-friends that i believed till this happened.\n\nAfter a fun night celebrating up the country we take the long trip back home and on the way drop people off, got down to the last two to drop off, one of which is Jane. We drop them off in the city and ask if they have money for the bus/need to be dropped home and they assure us that they're fine.\n\nFast forward to the next day, i'm in work and i don't finish till late, after checking my phone i find myself blocked and kicked from every group chat and a slew of messages including every version of how im a terrible person from \"a toxic relationship towards women\" to \"sucking the fun out of everything\". \nApparently Jane accused me and the driver of abandoning them without the money to get home and people with a grudge against me for whatever reason took this opportunity to see what kind of bull they could get away with sticking on my image.\n\nAll this ended up blowing over and i just stayed out of it, not the type for drama but two weeks ago, one of the friends i knew for years comes into me in work (first time i've seen him since the fallout) and confronts me about supposedly stalking Marsha, with \"texts to prove it\".\n\nThis was the last straw and after that i've started the process of a defamation of character case. \nI don't know if i'm just being petty but after this i don't want to imagine what sort of things people are believing if its been this long and people would believe that about me.\n\nTL:DR- People are spreading bull and evidence isn't convincing enough, so forcing them to court just to avoid the possible collateral damage a suspected charge might have on my life.",

      "description": "In 8th grade I asked a shy, quiet girl out and she said yes. Looking back on it now it was something I jumped into too soon as I really didn’t know her all that much. Things went smoothly for the first year and then things started to go downhill.\n\nThis girl had some pretty bad social and mental issues (social anxiety, depression of some degree, and even lived in a not so supporting household). This led to her being a girl who kept to herself mostly, even from her boyfriend. It would be a journey just to find her in the morning, as she didn’t have a phone.\n\nThen her problems got worse, to the point of her cutting herself. This is when she completely separated herself from everyone, including me. She would barely talk to me and seeing her so broken and hurt made me as a boyfriend feel useless and pathetic. \n\nI felt horrible that I couldn’t help her. She was very much in a bad place and there was nothing I could do.  I wanted her to be able to find someone who could help her with her issues.\n\nWith us being so separated, I started losing the feelings for her I used to have and started getting feelings for another girl who shared feelings back. It was a feeling I missed. \n\nAfter a month of this, I told my current girlfriend that I wanted to end our relationship and told her that I was losing feelings and that I felt that she needed to find someone who could actually help her with her problems. This went over like a car on bricks.\n\nImmediately, word went round that I left her for another girl and that I broke up with her because of her mental issues. People HATED me. They didn’t know my side of the story and didn’t bother to find out. The took the word of the innocent, shy girl.\n\nThree months later and that girl is more social than she ever was. She’s actually talking to people in our school. So i don’t know if I was holding her back or if she just randomly became social. \n\nSo the question is Am I The Asshole that everyone thinks I still am?",

      "description": "Hey, so this happened ages ago when I was delivering pizza and I keep thinking about it occasionally.\n\nI showed up to a customer's door with their pizza, they ask me to give them the pizza, I say I need the money first. Over the course of me refusing to hand over the pizza several times, he says the money's all the way over there, why should he have to make more than one trip, why am I being so insistent about it, do I seriously think he's gonna steal the pizza, why don't I trust him. I tell him I treat everyone the same way, I always take the money first, that's just the rules.\n\nImportant detail: this guy isn't white. He is clearly hurt by a perceived lack of trust and I think he thinks it's a racism thing. Also I did tell him it was store policy but I was lying. It was just my policy.\n\nHe did go and get the money by the way. I didn't think he was trying to pull anything. It was just a rule I enforced for everyone. Never in my pizza delivery career did I ever provide pizza before receiving payment. In fact it was rare that I ever had to ask for the money. Most of my customers knew the drill without me needing to say anything.\n\nI think another driver might've given this guy the benefit of the doubt. Pizza theft isn't exactly an issue and this rule wasn't store policy or anything",

      "description": "Hey All, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll try and make this brief. My boyfriend and I are together 4 years. I get along great with his parents, but his older brother literally hasn't said more than 10 words to me in our 4 years knowing each other. At first I would greet him and ask how he is, and I would get no response. He would walk past me in the kitchen, finish what he was doing and go on his way. \n\nSo last year I spend Christmas with my boyfriend and his family for the first time. I showed up with gifts for everyone, including the brother (a PlayStation gift card), but was too nervous to give it to him directly because I thought he hated me or something so I gave it to my boyfriend to give to him when I left. I never got a thank you. \n\nSo fast forward this year, I was again invited to Christmas with my boyfriend and I want to accept, but the first thing that came to my mind was \"What am I going to get the brother?\". I asked my boyfriend and he didn't really know. He said I could get him another gift card, or I could just get him nothing because he won't get me anything and he probably won't say thanks either. \n\nI immediately refused and said I couldn't show up with gifts for everyone but him, but then I thought about the facts that I talk to everyone but him, and if I can't face him long enough to give him his gift, should I be getting him one in the first place? Also, to be fair to him, he's seems very socially inept. He rarely leaves the house, and I've heard that he treats mostly everyone except his family the way he treats me, but it's never been confirmed. \n\nSo I leave it to you redditors, would I be the asshole if I showed up with no gift for the brother who ignores me?",

      "description": "I feel the title is very watered down. Hopefully I can give a clearer picture.\n\n\nBackground: My husband and I are recently new homeowners in a state that is getting dumped with snow. Much to my husbands dismay, we don't have enough saved for the snowblower he wants, so we're stuck with shoveling it ourselves (sidenote: in case it gets brought up, no I will not pay for snow-removal service when both of us are strong, able-bodied adults who have the time). I work nights, 10 hour shifts, and he works days, 8 hour shifts. Both of our jobs are physically demanding. So far we've been good about doing our fair share of winter maintenance. \n\n\nSituation: I am working 12 hour shifts most of the week due to a surge in production (yay overtime pay). Due to incoming weather, his job notified employees yesterday afternoon that today they would start an hour late. The snow started falling at 11pm and hasn't stopped. I got off after 830 am this morning ready to take a shower and do some shoveling, if needed. Turns out it was very much needed as my husband didn't shovel any of the driveway (1 car length by 3 car widths of pavement), the back sidewalk (idk, 25? feet) or the front steps and sidewalk ( about 30? feet total). It's been snowing for 9ish hours so it's not a small amount, it's several inches deep. \n\n\nI shovel the driveway and the back sidewalk. I start the front sidewalk but I stop because I'm upset and think it's unfair. So I text him, stating clearly why I'm kinda pissed and that the front sidewalk will be waiting for him to shovel when he gets home. I also say that \"I don't love him any less, that I'm just upset.\" I don't want him thinking I hate him, I'm just upset at the situation. No response yet but I dont expect one until he goes to lunch. I suspect he used the extra hour this morning to sleep in, which he has every right to do. However maybe a text about how he didn't get to the shoveling would have been appreciated, that way I wouldn't have been blindsided. \n\n\nI've been going back and forth over if I should feel this way. Half of me is saying \"Suck it up, Buttercup, that's life,\" while the other half says I need to make my feelings known so I don't push it down and allow it to fester and manifest in some other way. So, fair Reddit, AITA for assuming my husband would do some shoveling before he went to work and not leave me with it all?\n\n\nP.S. I may not comment until some hours from now, as I need to get some sleep before my shift tonight. ",

      "description": "A while ago I (male, 30) was in a bad place and turned to alcohol and dating-apps. One of the girls I met was 35 and wanted to come over to my place at night after a very minimal amount of chatting. I figured it was a classic bootycall. She came over, we had a good time, had drinks, and as expected she stayed the night. And that's where my fuck-up happend: I don't want to blame the excessive amount of alcohol (I'm pretty good at handeling my drink, but drank over 6 beers before she even came over, drank a lot more with her) but for some reason I was a fucking idiot and didn't use protection. \n\nThe next morning I realized this was a major fuck-up and went out to get us breakfast and got her a morning-after pill. She took it, we had breakfast, she told me she didn't have any STD's (which I wasn't so sure about given how easily she slept with me) and she left. (It later turned out she didn't give me any STD's btw).\n\nI ended up seeing her 4 more times in the next two weeks (I made sure to use condoms every time) - we always met at night, and I was very clear about not wanting a relationship - she said she didn't either. After those two weeks I kind of got my life together a bit more and wanted to quit casual hookups to go after this other girl that I was really in love with. So I broke up with her - and she took it HARD. Talked about wanting to commit suicide and stuff. I recommend her some people/telephone numbers/anonymous chat organisations that could help her and broke off contact. \n\nOver the next two months she occassionally (drunk) texted me to tell me she wanted to date again. I kept saying I was over it, that I had moved on and that I didn't want any contact anymore.\n\nFast forward another month: she texts me pictures of an ultrasound, telling me she had become pregnant by me and had a miscarriage. I'm not sure if the pictures are legit - but there's a date on them that fits the timeline. I realise the morning-after pill doesn't have a 100% success-rate but she did get her period about 1,5week after the unprotected sex. Always used condoms after that first time. \n\nNow she keeps blaming me for everything. I figured I'd go with believing her story, had a convo via texts about how I'm really sorry this happend, that it was never my intention and that I should've used a condom that first time. However, she keeps saying I'm a horrible person for breaking it off with her, how it's unfair that I continue with life while she's had to deal with this, that she's mad and believes I treated her like a toy, and so on.\n\nI obviously feel bad about the whole thing and would like to hear your opinions. \n\nPS: I know I really fucked up having  unprotected sex with someone I just met an hour ago, after months I'm still mad at myself about it, but is there anything I could've done better after that fact?

Personally I did not care that someone flirted with her. The thing that bothered me was that she only told me three months after he flirted with her. She then told me that she would cut off all ties with him. I said ok and it was left at that. A couple of days ago she told me she was going out with a couple of high school friends (I’ve met 4 of them before). I was more than ok with her seeing some old friends. She then told me that the guy who flirted with her was gonna be there. Out of curiosity I asked have you talked to him since the last incident. She said, “yes, we speak here and there.” I was pissed at this point. I later asked her if she initiated any conversation with him and she told me yes. I lashed out at her and was furious about what happened.\n\nOn a side note I was friends with her ex-best friend and she made me cut off all ties with her because my gf believed that she was into me. I cut all ties even though she was a good friend of mine.\n\nAITA for getting pissed at my gf and thinking smt is going on between the two of them?",

      "description": "Throwaway so I don't get psychotic prolifers harrassing me through this already horrible time. Me and my husband are pregnant with our first child. We just found out at our midpregnancy scan that our baby has Patau's syndrome. Apparently, he didn't show many of the early warning signs that most babies do, so it went unnoticed. The baby is currently okay, but we were told that his likelihood of surviving up to and after birth are dim to say in the least. Obviously, we're both heart broken. And it hurts me that I may never be able to meet my baby. But I don't want to meet him if it just means he's going to die anyway! This is hard enough, I would rather just end the pregnancy and try again once we're up to it. I feel like a failure, and I just want to get past this and have it be over so we can try again at our family. But my husband wants to meet him. He thinks it would bring us more \"closure\" when he dies. I think its just going to open me up to more pain. Pregnancy is hard enough without the life at the end of the tunnel. I understand my husband is having just as hard of a time as me right now, and it might bring him closure to say his goodbyes to the little guy. And maybe I am being insensitive or selfish? I just dont want to have to grieve a second time over him...am I being selfish? The longer we wait the harder it gets and I just want to tell him too bad, and end the pregnancy, but I dont want to hurt him or our marriage and he just wont listen...",

      "description": "College student here (20F) living on campus. The dorm I’m in is apartment style with four bedrooms and two bathrooms. I share a bathroom with the girl in the room next to mine.\n\nI haven’t really spoken much to her aside from a couple of “Hello’s” here and there and the occasional “How was your day.” Barely even acquaintances honestly. Throughout the semester I’ve kinda taken charge on keeping our bathroom clean—I’m kind of a clean freak so I took it upon myself to wipe down our tub and shower curtain every now and then.\n\nShe, however, does not seem to be on the same page. She’s prone to leaving hair in the bathtub, and has never bothered to try and straighten up the bathroom on her own accord. She has the cleaning supplies for it, but I’ve never seen them used. I’ve gone the past couple weeks without cleaning, and our bath tub and shower curtain ended up getting very dirty. Nothing was ever done about it on her end, so I finally snapped today and wiped everything down again.\n\nWhen I tried to scrub the grime in the bath tub with my Clorox wipes, I realized it was going to be a hassle. But, my roommate had a scrubbing brush and a bottle of Fabuloso sitting on the toilet. I figured since she had never used it, and it was going toward our communal bathroom, I made the call that it wouldn’t be a big deal if I used the stuff to clean our place of bathing. 20 minutes later, everything was relatively spic-and-span.\n\nNow that I’m thinking about it though, I feel like I overstepped a boundary somehow. As I mentioned before, we’re barely acquaintances, and even though I used her stuff to clean a space we both use...I still used her stuff, y’know? We move out in two weeks and being that she never bothered to scrub the bathroom before, I figured she wasn’t going to start now. But now I’m afraid she’ll get angry if she realizes her stuff was used. She already moved her little trashcan out of the bathroom and next to her sink, I assume because she no longer wanted me using it. So I’m not sure here, AITA? ",

      "description": "(Trigger warning - this is about childhood sexual abuse.  Don't read if you find it upsetting.)\n\n\nSeriously, if that sort of thing bothers you, maybe skip this post.  I was reading a post over on /r/legaladvice about someone who was abused by their piano teacher for a number of years and s/he is considering reporting the teacher to the police because the teacher is teaching again and they're afraid the teacher is going to harm another child.  In reading through the comments, I discovered that Colorado has no statute of limitations on prosecuting childhood sexual abuse (That is something that has changed since I lived there -- I didn't know this until yesterday).\n\nIn 1988 I lived in Colorado where my grandfather used molest and rape me (I was an 8 year old boy at the time) and my sister.  In 1990 my mom cut off contact with him and reported what he had been doing to my sister to the police.  I was too terrified to say what he had been doing to me because A: I was told \"This is all your fault.  I don't want to do this, you're making me\" (I have since gotten into therapy and do accept it was not, in fact, my fault) and B: because one time I tried to use a pocket knife to stop him from hurting my sister.  It didn't work and he just beat me up, telling me the horrible things he would do if I ever tried to stop him again or if I told anyone what he had been doing.  I still have a physical scar from it.  \n\nSo when I got stuck in therapy to see if he had done anything to me, I still thought it was my fault and I was still afraid of him.  By the time I could trust the therapist, she transferred me to another therapist and I felt I couldn't trust anyone.  That therapist told my mom \"The grandfather wasn't interested in boys, so your son is fine.\"\n\nJust my sister went to the police.  They interviewed her and gave my grandfather a polygraph test.  He passed the test (Something psychopaths can do very easily.  Fun, err, disturbing little trivia fact.) and the police declined to bring charges against him.  My mom tried to tell the rest of the extended family and they all turned against us saying she was spreading lies.  In 1992 we cut ties and moved three states away.  We couldn't do anything about him and we just had to move on with our lives.  I remember at one point looking at the laws and seeing that the statute of limitations had passed on what he did to me.  Not that I had any faith in our justice system to prosecute him, honestly.  \n\nI tried to heal and move on (Some days are better than others).\n\nThen I saw that post and read some commentators that said there is no statute of limitations for that type of crime in Colorado anymore.  That means I could report him.  \n\nI thought a lot about it, and I just don't want to.  I've talked about my history on reddit before, and had someone message me saying I was a \"little (derogatory word)\" for not taking the law into my own hand and going to beat the shit out of him.  I had lunch with a friend and he told me that I'm a bad person for not going back to Colorado to take care of this because he might hurt other kids.  My grandfather is now 90 years old.  Has he hurt other kids?  Maybe.  I try not to think about it.  I'd like to think he's now too old to do that anymore.  \n\nMoreover, I don't want to take revenge on him.  I don't want to send a senile, 90 year old man to die in prison.  Even if he is a heartless monster.  I don't know if I strong enough to travel back to Colorado for whatever that would involve (I still live three states away).  I don't want to deal with the inevitable nightmares of going back to confront him.  I called him on the phone once, and it didn't go very well (See my post history, if you're curious).  \n\nI just want to go on with my life, forget that bastard and just heal.  Does that make me an asshole?  \"Evil prevails when good men do nothing\" as the saying goes, but I don't know if I can do anything and I don't want to deal with the guilt of sending him to die in prison.  I know he'd be going because of his crimes, but I struggle with guilt and anxiety.  I know that it would eat me alive to know I was the catalyst that sent him to prison.  \n\n\ntl/dr; my grandfather used to rape/molest me 30 years ago in Colorado.  I just discovered that the laws were changed to remove the statute of limitations on child sex abuse crimes.  I don't live anywhere near him and I want to get on with my life and healing, not going back to Colorado to try and bring him to justice.  ",

      "description": "This is going to be kind of long: I almost killed myself last March, and I attribute it 80% to my parents. \n\nStrike 1: My parents were an absolute disaster during my high school years, and any time they suspect that I feel this way, they go on about how there's no rule book and they were doing the best they could. They did have a reason for being disasters: my baby sister died at 3 months old due to complications from surgery. My dad became extremely controlling (he had to know where my sister and I were at all times, who we hung out with, even where we picked up new words/phrases), and my mom became extremely depressed. She wouldn't acknowledge that there was an issue, though, so I went through high school with a narcissistic and controlling father and a generally absent mother. This all shaped the rest of the issues I have, some of which are detailed below. \n\nStrike 2: I was homeschooled from kindergarten through high school, so my parents affected and controlled literally every part of my life. I was told what exactly to believe, commanded not to question it, and fed a bunch of bs that anyone who believed differently than my parents was evil and going to hell. My entire freshman year of college I honestly believed that being gay was one of the worst things that anyone could ever be. I met my best friend that year, a very awesome, very gay person. I later discovered that I am bisexual. I haven't told my parents, since they always go on about how their friends with gay kids are so strong to put up with the \"choices\" their children made.\n\nStrike 3: I grew up in an extremely conservative Christian home that gave little credibility to mental illness. I'd really like to think that when I started showing signs of depression at 15 a serious conversation about mental health and an appointment with a psychiatrist would have not lead me to almost kill myself at 19. My parents did give me options: I could go see a Christian counselor who would tell me to pray more and give my worries to God, like what my parents had already told me, or I could talk to the family doctor. I was sort of fed up with religion at that point, so I talked with the family doctor. She said it sounded like I was depressed and gave me a bottle of pills. She told me to come back if they weren't working. Looking back, this was absolutely not an appropriate response to what I was dealing with, and it took me years to figure out I wasn't supposed to feel down all the time.\n\nI've talked to many trusted people about this situation, including the fact that the only way I see ever being at peace is to never have to deal with the people who screwed me up this badly again. Initially, I wanted to completely disown them, and after talking it out more and thinking on it, my counselor even agreed it would be a good thing for me if it's what I still want. I know family is supposed to be forever and all that, but I haven't felt love for them since I was a very little kid, and it stresses me out enough to be around them that it can trigger a depressive episode and make me question my safety. I even ended up changing majors so I had to take summer classes just so I didn't have to be around my family all summer. I get depressed even thinking about going back for the holidays. \n\nSo would I be the asshole if I sat them down, expressed my grievances, and told them I never wanted to see or hear from them again, for my own happiness and health? \n",

      "description": "LONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. ",

      "description": "Here's the situation..... This coming summer I'll be working at this company part-time for 2 years. Initially, there are 3 of us in our department. One ended up leaving a year later, and the other was let go. Since I work part-time with varying schedules, I never really needed to talk to the supervisor for tasks. I come in and ask my co-workers what's going on and what tasks must be completed.\n\n  \nWell since they are both gone, I wasn't properly trained and pretty much figured out how to do the job as I go day-by-day, considering I only work a handful of hours a week/day. I approached the supervisor once with a question and he said he'll teach me how to solve the issue once he's done with something. He never did. And this was like several months ago. Apparently, there's more work that needs to be done as my job description but he NEVER comes up to me or bothers training me. \n\nI figured he doesn't hate me or my job performance because if he did, I would have been fired. When I run into him in the hallway, he's polite and respectful. However, he's not really vocal about what things must be done, nor has he hired anyone else to help me within my department. It's not a difficult job, despite me picking up a few more responsibilities but considering I work less than 15 hours a week at most, I do believe someone should be there who can commit to more hours to be able to handle customer inquiries, etc. in a timely manner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI basically feel like I'm doing whatever I want at my job at my own pace without supervision. I've been alone in my department now for 9 months and he has not approached me at all. AITA for letting this go on for so long? Is it my job to come up/confront him about the situation? I don't want to make him feel nervous/awkward, even though I am nice and make myself approachable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - Boss doesn't talk to me because he's nervous/awkward around me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I knew my brother didn't care if we hooked up but his gf asked me not to. I told her I wouldn't try to in kind of a backwards way of answering her request. When we got there, we did some X and some other stuff and by the end of the night had hooked up. Neither of us are interested in anything serious, but she seems to still be interested in playing around. One of our friends told my brothers gf and now she's mad, but my brother doesn't care. When I asked her what the big deal was (not like we're related and they're not even married or engaged) she wouldn't answer me. She's not Christian and neither am I. AITA?",

I replied with \"A lot of things.\" He told me to go home, that attitude wasn't wanted here.

      "description": "I know this is really long but I would REALLY value the feedback. If it's positive I'll feel better about myself, and if it's negative I'll at least be able to use it to try and learn from my mistake in the future, so please, read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll try to explain things the best I can. I'm very emotional right now and it's definitely affecting how I'm thinking right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: \n\nI got in a relationship with a girl I met online a little under a year ago. It's been pretty complicated. We never actually met, but that didn't stop me from becoming very attached to her. I had some trust issues and early on and ended up doing some snooping on her, I talked to her about it and we got in a fight and broke up but ended up getting back together later, it was rocky for a while but eventually we learned to get along and ended up making it work for a while. She's sick and has been for a long time. She ended up having to move in with her parents several months ago and our contact was strained during that time. We only talked a couple of times a week, she progressively got sicker and sicker over time but I stuck by her. Anything she needed I was there. I helped support her emotionally and financially. I really felt like I loved this girl. Eventually she even told me that once she got better she wanted us to live together, that she loves me more than I can possibly know for sticking by her side through the time she's been sick and waiting for her. My point here is that I felt very close to her and she felt very close to me. I've never felt so strongly about someone before. (I still believe everything she told me about her condition and I also have even spoken to her mother and her sister about it, I also believe that she did have feelings for me and even loved me). Onto the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeither of us use social media very much, so I never cared before, but recently I had suggested that we be friends on Facebook so I could send her messages from my work computer, she agreed initially but then backed down saying that her family was uncomfortable with it since her last boyfriend had harassed her and her family after they broke up. So she told me that she was going to hold off on it and I said that I understood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly though, this dealt a huge blow to my trust, I felt like she was trying to hide something from me. I'm not going to go into huge amounts of details, but ended up finding her LoL account info and looked up her match history. I found games dating months back, she was queuing with her friends nearly every day. Days that she said she was too sick to talk, days she said she was even in the hospital. This led me to believe that she was on alternate profiles, or marking herself offline on discord and the like, so she could sneak around behind my back and do stuff with her friends, and not have to do stuff with me. (She did this before when we were fighting, but I didn't think she'd do it when we were getting along fine).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called her today and confronted her on this. I did my best to maintain a level head, and gave her the opportunity to be honest with me first, and I told her that if she was honest with me that I was completely willing to forget about it. She flipped out at me and said that it wasn't her that she was letting a friend use her account. She told me I was a psycho for doing this again and that she was done and never to contact her again or she would \"fuck my life up\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here's why I feel even worse about it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got into a conversation just a few days ago about us and we both reaffirmed to each other that we wanted to be together and that we loved eachother. She promised to be more proactive in contacting me and such. She followed through on this and for the past few days she was indeed talking to me more. Just this morning she called me just to wish me a good morning, and to tell me she loved me. That's when I brought up what I found.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for snooping on her? Was it wrong of me to go seeking out her history? I feel like I shouldn't have ever brought it up, I feel awful like I've thrown away a year of hard work for nothing...",

      "description": "Before I get on with the story I want to point out that I have BPD, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. This makes my emotions switch on a dime and causes me to see through something called \"black and white\" vision (basically I can go from hating someone to adoring them for no apparent reason).\n\nSo I've never really dated anyone mostly because I'm a flaming homosexual and the only people attracted to me are guys. A few months ago one of my friends openly stated she had a crush on me. This kind of shocked me because I had a but of a crush on her as well, but she had a boyfriend. \n\nWe had talked a bit and a few days later I told her that I get really anxious and a relationship wouldnt be good for either of us mentally. (She has depression aswell) Besides, I didnt want her to cheat on her boyfriend. \n\nShe said that she understood and I thought we would go back to being friends. I was wrong. Whenever I'd go get lunch and sit with a few of my friends she would get really affectionate with me; aka hold my hand, hug me, etc. This would be fine but 1: we weren't dating and 2: touching me made me really uncomfortable.\n\nI didn't say anything but I didnt really share the affections. That night she texted me, asking if I was mad at her. I had explained that I wasnt mad but just got really anxious when people touch me. I also went on a long tangent about how we shouldn't date because my BPD makes it extremly difficult for both people in the relationship. She seemed understanding so I thought that was it.\n\nA few days after I was in a very bad place mentally and it showed. She talked with me and made me feel a lot better, which in turn led me to get clingy that day. I wanted to hold her and hug her, even if that was very odd for me. I needed someone to hug that day, and she was that person. I guess she assumed that was the normal and for the next few weeks tried holding and kissing me. I was visibly anxious once again and told her that it made me uncomfortable. \n\nShe took this as anger and ended up avoiding me for the next week because she thought I was mad at her. This was not true and I had confronted her about it. After this things went back to normal, and by normal it meant she was clingy and close to me again. \n\nNow I knew she had her own problems and I really didn't want to cause things to go worse for her. This meant I let her hold me close no matter how uncomfortable it made me. I wanted to help her and by avoiding her efforts it obviously affected her negativly.\n\nThis went on for a while and I kind of let it happen. It took its toll on me, getting me into a worse state by the day. The only time I drew the line was when she invited me to her house for a dinner the very day. I got anxious at the thought and frantically made any excuse I could. She told me how important it was to her and I told that I couldn't. This led to a mini fight and she ghosted me for a week. Again she thought I was mad at her and had again explained that situations made me very anxious and could send me into a very bad panic attack.\n\nAgain things back to normal. Up until I had snapped. I got upset and told her to please stop touching me and to stop getting upset after I dont answer her constant calls or texted. I got mad because she wouldnt listen to me and we technically broke up. She was really hurt by that, and avoided me. I had come back to re-breakup, but being much more polite about it. I told her that it just wouldn't work, and continuing a relationship would only hurt us both. I apologized for earlier but said I still didnt want a relationship.\n\nAm I an asshole for breaking it off with her?\n\nTLDR: My mental illnesses make relationships very hard. Girl tries to date me anyway even though I am openly uncomfortable. After not listening to my requests I decide to break up with her. ",

      "description": "My girlfriend is very strong willed.  She’s quick to call out bullshit when she sees it.  It’s fun being with her when she’s in terminator mode.  If and it’s a big if I’m not the focus of her wraith.  \n\n\nThere are sometimes that she really pisses  me off.  Not so much that she goes off, but that she’s kind of a hypocrite about it.  She calls my friends and I “frat bros” even though none of us have ever been in a frat.  She says we’re toxic when we’re together as a group.  Disrespectful and harassing.  Harassing as in one of my friends will dare try to talk to a girl in a bar.  She also overheard us playing fuck,marry,kill once and lost her freaking mind over it.  \n\nShe’s no treat whenever she’s around her friends.  The are the catiest group of girls I’ve ever been around.  I’m not a very sensitive person, but even I’ve felt bad about some of the shit they will talk.  There’s this gay bar that they go to so they don’t have to deal with guys hitting on them.  Sometimes I’ll play DD for her.  One time I went in there and they had completely taken over the middle of the glowing dance floor thing.   There were a few guys who were able to dance on the very edge of it, they were taking up almost all the space on it.  I’ve also seen one of them grab someone’s crotch as we were leaving and they just laughed about it. \n\nShe also helps her self to anything in my fridge when we’re here.  Doesn’t ask, just takes.  I didn’t mind, I just assumed that that was the kind of relationship we had after that though.  When I was over at her’s though I went to check out what she had and there was this taco dip thing she had in a big pan.  It looked really good so I start putting some on a plate when she comes out.  She got irritated about it saying she was trying to make it last and actually made me scoop it back off the plate into the pan. \n\nThere’s been other minor things.  The only other one probably worth mentioning is that she shit talks her one friend who doesn’t work and lives with her boyfriend supporting her.   She’s said that she would never allow herself to live like that.  Relying on a partner for everything.  Literally besides our first date, she’s never even offered to go 50/50.  \n\nThis all probably sounds harsh.  She’s a lot more than these examples and I get excited every time I’m about to see her.   The hypocrisy has been rubbing me the wrong way for a while though and it’s not something I’ve been able to push out of my head or just ignore.  Like I said at the top, she calls out bullshit where ever she sees it.  I want to take a page out her book. ",

      "description": "My husband recently moved in with me, now that he has a job in my city. Before then, he would visit me on weekends. He has brought trash mountains to my attention before, but I just kept forgetting. The way I take the trash out is I try to pile up as much as I can in one can so that I can just dump the entire thing out when it's time. If stuff keeps falling I'll put them in another bag. I know this seems lazy, but I am a very busy doctoral student. I am rarely (if ever) home; I am usually always in my office. When it's time to clean and stuff, my husband usually always helps by taking out the trash, dusting, and swiffering; sometimes he will wipe the counters and vacuum if I can't. Today he took out the trash and asked me again to not make trash mountains again, as it makes the trash harder to take out. He also asked me to flatten the Coke boxes before putting them in the trash can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel those are reasonable requests, but I feel like a terrible person for having done all that... I feel like I made trash mountains and stuff because I'm terrible... AITA?",

      "description": "So to make the relationship backstory short my ex-wife had a &gt;1 year affair and divorced me because she wasn't happy and wanted to be with him. After a lot of on again off again stuff its final that she has chosen to be in a relationship with the affair partner. Per our custody arrangement we have 50/50 split custody (one week on, one week off) of our two girls aged 5 and 7. We are currently living together and co-parenting until my ex-wife can afford to move out.\n\nMy ex-wife has a friend, let's call her Mary, who has cancer and lives close to my ex-wife's work and with whom she stays most nights when it's my week to watch the girls. Not too long ago I found out that she had lied to me about staying with Mary when she was really spending the night with the affair partner. It is currently her week to watch the kids and tonight she asked me if I was okay with taking care of the girls overnight so she could stay with Mary. I told her that if she was actually staying with Mary I was fine with it. She asked me what I meant and I told her that I was not okay with doing a favor for her that directly benefited the guy she had cheated on me with and who I obviously hate. She stated that it shouldn't matter who she was staying with if I'm okay with watching them for her to stay with Mary then I should be fine with watching them for whatever reason and that I was being controlling. I think there's a big difference and told her that putting conditions on a favor is not controlling since the other option is just a straight no.  \n\nI've been pretty messed up by everything that's gone down and don't have a ton of people who I can ask for advice, so reddit, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for being fed up with a customer, and asking my manager to ban them from the store?",
      "description": "It's me again :&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work at Starbucks, and have been working here for the past year now. I really do enjoy my job and I'm always happy when I get to work. I get along well with my co-workers, and many of our regular customers. Before I continue, I've worked in customer service for a few years now outside of SB and I am well aware that people are not always going to be pleasant. I'm usually well at diffusing situations and staying calm under pressure, which is part of the reason I'm pretty decent at my job. However, there's one customer who's a regular that I've been having issues with these past few months, and today was my breaking point and the worst interaction I've had with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe always has the same order - tall, extra dry cappuccino with whole milk. I'm also convinced that he doesn't really know what a cappuccino is. No matter who is making his order, he always sends it back and says that something is wrong - the milk isn't foamy enough, it feels too heavy or too light, the espresso doesn't taste correct, there's not enough of something or it's too hot or too cold... literally any and every excuse in the book has been made, and every single time he makes someone remake his drink. Now, he's older than I am by a good amount of years - I never want to disrespect someone older than I or stick my nose up at difficult customers, so I usually just stay calm and ignore it. I'm used to it and let things like that go. Starbucks is overpriced and inexpensive, I totally get it. But he comes in at least 5 to 6 times a week, so how can it possibly be made incorrectly every time, when we make cappuccinos at least 30 times a day?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Side note: He has caused problems with my co-workers before as well. One of my co-workers in particular simply refuses to serve him. She sees him come in, and has to go in the back and wait until he leaves. This is because he blew up at her and asked her why she couldn't do something so simple, and that she needed to be re-trained, and some other pretty harsh stuff. Not to mention, he also swiped a few dollars from our tip jar. This story is actually pretty funny, but another time. Anyway, I wasn't working there yet when this took place; this is just what I have been told. This had already caused him to get a store ban for 6 months.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning we were completely slammed. The line wrapped almost all the way around the store and we had at least 15-20 orders pending, with 4-6 drinks being made. currently We can typically only make 2 or 3 drinks at a time for each of us (usually two baristas make drinks - this isn't necessarily important, just helps more with the situation). Cappuccino Man leans over and asks me how long it will take to get his drink. I eyeball the very long line of orders, and tell him 15 minutes at the most. Most drinks are made in less than 45 seconds to a minute, depending on complexity. He gets visibly annoyed once I tell him this, and asks if I can \"just make his drink now so he can leave\". I apologize and tell him I cannot do that, as we have to do our drinks in order and it just wouldn't be fair to other customers. One thing that can be annoying is when people see how incredibly busy we are and then get upset when it takes longer than 3 minutes to complete an order, but I digress. He doesn't say anything in response, and just steps back and continues watching me and my co-worker make drinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I get to his drink. Before I can even start preparing his order, he calls over to my other co-worker that's making drinks, and says to him: \"Hey, can you make my drink instead? I don't have time to wait on her.\", while pointing at me. Immediately, I got annoyed. But, I just handed over the order to my co-worker and kept it moving. I make two other drinks, and just as I'm starting to calm down, I'm called over by Cappuccino Man. Since he had already annoyed me a bit, I didn't want to be dramatic and start anything, but I knew he was going to ask me to remake it. I decided I would question him on what exactly happened instead of just bending over backwards again, to hopefully make some kind of change. Food/customer service workers are still just people, man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, he claimed it tasted \"off\". I pushed a bit and asked what was wrong, even re-reading through his order to \"make sure\" it was what he had ordered. He said the thought the problem was with the milk's density. I asked, is it too much or too less foam? He said he couldn't really put his finger on it, and asked me to remake it. I said I would make it again, but I wouldn't know what to change if I didn't know what was wrong, so it would be pointless. To be fair, we do ask what needs to be changed or what seems to taste incorrectly when we remake drinks so we're not playing a guessing game and wasting product. Then, he asked if my manager was there and that he would like to speak to him. I grab my manager and they talk for a few minutes, so I see this as an opportunity to sit in the back for a second to calm down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCappuccino Man leaves, but not before speaking to another customer, who I'm assuming he knows personally, saying \"oh, don't let the girl in the blue hat make your drink\" loud enough for me to hear over espresso machines running and milk steaming, which isn't exactly quiet. It was so completely embarrassing, especially with all of these people in the store and in front of my boss. I wanted to cry, honestly. My manager comes in the back and talks to me, asking why I didn't just remake his drink. I explain how I felt and apologised, but also stood up for myself. I told him I can handle a lot of things, but he was agitating me and I know I'm not incompetent.  I asked if it was possible to report and/or ban him, and I know I'm not the only employee who felt this way. However, Boss Man didn't really care for my side of the story. \"He's a regular, we can't lose customers, he has no reason to be banned, you need to not be so aggressive, this is grounds for a write-up\" etc. I understand that I have to have that \"the customer is always right\" attitude, and I can't put someone on blast for wanting a remade drink. He may not be purposefully trying to be difficult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've gotten mixed responses on how I should or shouldn't have handled it from friends and family, how I was being unprofessional or how my actions were justified, but I can't help feeling bad for acting that way towards someone older than myself, and to a customer at the very least. Did I fuck up? Was this really necessary?",

      "description": "I really like this girl. I've been really close with her and we've been talking almost every evening on the phone for hours. She was talking to a few people like my best friend and a few friends of hers too, but I don't really care about that... why should I?\nAt some point in time, I noticed that I was always texting first and calling her, so I stopped calling her to find out if she would call me on her own. She didn't call me for two weeks, but she was talking to my best friend a few times on the phone. Strangely, on the day he went on vacation with his family and couldn't talk to her she suddenly called. I was really happy, but also a little confused.\nA few weeks later I confronted her about me being the one who always initiates contact and stuff like that and she got really defensive and tried to switch up what I said to make me look like the bad guy. \nThis was always just a stupid back and forth and she was just getting annoyed at me, even though I was just asking myself if it was even worth it to try to talk to her. Today I kinda argued with her via texts about me not trying to lose her, because she's really really important to me. She ignores my messages almost every time I text her about how I feel and if I say I just want to know what's up and that I don't want to be ignored she says that she just doesn't see the need to justify herself and answer every little text I send her.\n I was really straight with her after that. I told her that she's really important to me and that I don't want to lose her, but I also feel like she doesn't want to talk to me and that I think it's just me running after her at this point. She's ignoring me again. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "**Cast of characters:**\n\n**Me**: 18/m senior in high school who attends an online school and also works from home\n\n**Mother**: My mother, whose house I live in (I mean, my parents are married, so I guess it's also my dad's house)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:**\n\nSo, we are your average middle class American family, except for the fact that my mom has two horses, and our whole life seems to resolve around them. Now, you may say, \"But elaboratenoodle! Horses are so expensive — you are very privileged!\" However, I can assure you that we are far from wealthy — the horses are our only \"splurge,\" and I don't enjoy or ever ride them. Because of the horses, my mother has disrupted our lives in a bunch of little ways, but the biggest issue was when she moved our whole family to a different county in order to buy a farm, which meant leaving all of my friends behind and moving to an area where the closest grocery store is almost half an hour away, and going to my office (which I only do once a week) takes almost an hour. But, the little things are just as bad — things like selling our beloved pop-up camper to buy a horse trailer. Now, as every pre-teen has inevitably been told, *owning horses is expensive*. And, yeah, it can be. However, the prices goes up significantly when the two perfectionists that are my parents decide to purchase *a farm*, a brand new truck, a tractor, and a horse trailer.\n\nMy parents are pretty smart, but all of these things are pretty financially taxing, and I know we're in a lot of debt. Now, don't get me wrong: I still have an amazing life, and my parents really do care about and love me and my siblings. They even helped me to buy my first car, and pay for my insurance. Still, I still am not happy about this horse scenario. Because we are in debt, I feel *really* guilty whenever they spend money on me at all — I've started paying for my own tuition, a lot of my own food, and I will occasionally secretly cover their grocery bills when I go shopping. But, it's taken a toll on our lives: we avoid making necessary repairs to our house and our cars, paying the taxes is always an ordeal, and we can't afford to go on any trips.\n\nNow, I understand that it's their money, and I appreciate everything that they do for me. But now, I'm preparing to go to college, and their income is high enough to prevent me from getting good financial aid, but because they spend it so foolishly, they can't afford to even help me a little, like paying for my books or helping me out with the cost of housing. And I know that I don't deserve any of their money, but I am still not thrilled about the prospect of owing \\~$100,000 for college (and no, I am not going to community college; the closest \"community\" college is farther away than several four-year universities).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Situation:**\n\nSo, as you can tell, I am not super thrilled about the horses, and they've been a lot of trouble from my perspective. But, they are really something she enjoys, and a way for her to connect with my sister. Okay, great. But, one challenge is that my sister chose to attend a brick and mortar school, meaning that only myself and my mother are home during the day. Because of this, my mom often tries to guilt me into helping her with the \"daily chores,\" which include obsessively cleaning up after her horses, as well as brushing them, feeding them, and occasionally riding them.\n\nUnfortunately, I am very busy at all times: I have an intense course load (trust me, it's not the type of online school you're thinking of), in addition to a bunch of extracurriculars, as well as my responsibilities as my company's only web developer / IT specialist / technical support representative. I have a crazy life, but I am very lonely and depressed, which isn't great when combined with a huge workload. I am awake and working from about 8:00 AM to 2:00 AM, I have no local friends outside of work (and all of those people are a lot older than me), and the only time I get out of the house is when I go to the office or go skiing with my dad (we got really cheap season passes for which I had to pay most of the price). My mom, however doesn't really have time for this either, as she also works, in addition to having to take care of the house during the day, but I really don't think it's fair for me to expect me to add even more chaos to my life for these stupid animals — chaos that leaves me covered in filth for the rest of my day. I feel guilty for leaving her so much work, but I really do not need more stress in my life right now. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My mother has thrown our lives into chaos because of her horses, and I don't want to help take care of them.",

      "description": "So on Monday, February 25, my twin sister and I turned 20 years old. \n\nWe are both in college, although she lives on campus at hers, which is about two hours away. I commute to my school because it’s only fifteen minutes from home. We always _at least_ text each other a “happy birthday” each year. \n\nThis year, I went around the house collecting some baby pictures of her and I (and two of them included our older brother). I then made a collage of them and made a post to her on Facebook to wish her a happy birthday. \n\n\n So this passed Monday, around 11 PM I was just scrolling through my texts to clear up space on my phone and saw she hadn’t texted me in awhile. Then I saw it was the same on Facebook and such. My heart just kind of... broke. I don’t know. I know this all sounds very petty, but it did. So I texted her saying, “So like you never wished me happy birthday... what’s that all about?”\n\nHer response was this: “? I could ask the same of you??”\n\nI’ll show the rest of the conversation, her replies will be marked by the letter “H”. \n\nMe: “I did. I sent you a whole collage and then sent you a Jake [one of our dogs]pic on messenger. I went around the house for baby pics cuz 20 is the end of teens and all you know?”\n\nH: “I just happen to have randomly woken up rn but I don’t know why you’re up right now and I feel like you just want to start a fight or create a problem so I’m going back to sleep as should you and you have found something to be angry about that you had a week to mention.”\n\nMe: “I’m not angry and I can see why it can be misinterpreted as angry cuz I was just sending multiple texts but the multiple texts was to clarify when I had said happy birthday. And when I asked about why you didn’t say it it’s cuz I just felt weird about it that’s all.”\n\nH: “I don’t necessarily think you’re angry I just think that you have made something an issue just to have an issue because it’s late and the issue doesn’t really exist and you’re just making up a reason to be resentful.”\n\nMe: “It’s just hurtful I guess. It just showed I wasn’t on your mind enough to text a quick “hbd” at the very least is all I’m trying to say.”\n\nHer: “If it is so hurtful I don’t understand why you are mentioning it a week later that seems unfair.”\n\nMe: “ I’m mentioning it a week later because I was hoping you would still end up sending something out eventually. But yeah sorry for being unfair I guess and it is late, I’ll go to bed.”\n\nHer: “Whatever.”\n\nSo AITA here?",

      "description": "(18M) Let me start off by saying I don't like the guy but this isn't about my personal feelings for him. This is more because my little brother (12y/o) adores him, my brother is fantastic at basketball and his dad's a great coach for him and even though I don't get sports I think he genuinely has a future in it, he just got invited to his first national tournament. Okay now that the background is out of the way here's the situation.\n\nSo about 3 months ago I got a letter from the local power company saying that I was 1,000 dollars in debt to them from 2013, but here's the thing I was 13 at the time. So I called them to figure out what happened and once they told me the street address I immediately recognized it belonged to my old step dad. Obviously I was furious, so I talked to my mom about it to make sure she didn't give him permission to do anything like this, because he's a great manipulator and that was about the time they were thinking of getting back together (they didn't) and she assured that she would never let something like that happen and she was just finding out about it as well\n\nMy mom called him and told him to either pay the debt or have it put back into his name. But the problem with that is he's currently living out of a tent in a friend's backyard so I know for a fact he won't be able to pay it but once it's out out of my name it's not my problem. He tells her that he'll do it and I thought that was that\n\nYesterday I call the power company so I can make sure that this won't affect my credit or anything because I have no idea how that works and it's better to be safe than sorry seeing as how I'm planning on moving out in the next couple of months. So after asking her to check my name in their system the lady asks me \"How would you like to pay your debt?\" and  I was LIVID (obviously I didn't take this out on her shes just doing her job) and I explained that I was minor at the time and she transfers me over to the debt collectors agency and after explaining that I was minor to a 2nd woman she helps me file a letter of dispute. But then she tells me that the power company may require me to file a police report and name anyone who I might think is a suspect if I want this to be taken out of my name.\n\nIt's hard because when I was his exact age my dad started drinking heavily and fell out of my life and that was hard one me. I don't want my little brother to go through that too, seeing as how this is punishable by up to 5 years in prison where we live. We're also super close, the kid is genuinely one of my best friends and I don't want him to resent me even if his dad doesn't end up getting jail time. Obviously he knows nothing about any of this and I'd like to keep it that way but if I have to file a police report he's eventually going to find out.\n \nSo if I file this police report WIBTA?",

      "description": "I had a bit of a crush on my roommate's sister, who was in a happy committed relationship but who I feel was pretty flirty with me. So I stopped hanging out with her.\n\nI found out that her boyfriend might have been involved in a high-profile rape case, a pretty major thing. So I looked into it a bit, it looked like a case of mistaken identity, and that the actual person involved was his cousin or brother or something. They just had similar names. This is all based on an internet witch hunt, and those are not very accurate anyway. I knew that the witch hunt did target him though.\n\nI discovered that his cousin/brother/whatever was in junior high during the events of the rape case, and it looks like everyone else involved was in highschool, so I kept looking into it. Eventually I found out through a different source that one of his friends was involved in \"revenge porn\". Even if he wasn't the one involved in the rape case  directly, the fact that he's hanging out with people like that after  going through that witch hunt, after he saw that kind of revenge porn ruin someone's life. Well that's a huge red flag, and I couldn't keep  setting on it.\n\nThe problem is that it's all conjecture. I couldn't get any details of the \"revenge porn\" without pushing someone harder than I wanted to, and while it certainly looks like he was one of the rapists, the fact is that I'm basing that judgment off of a witch hunt. A witch hunt that got 2 people convicted (to probation, it was described in the news as a miscarriage of justice), but a witch hunt none the less.\n\nSo I let his girlfriend know what was going on. The guy phones me, understandably angry, and talks to me a bunch of facebook. After talking to him, I only feel more confident that he was involved. But I also have an obvious bias against the guy.\n\nIt really wasn't my place to get involved, especially where I had a crush on her, and I created a bunch of drama for what could have been no reasons. I feel like machiavellian asshole who got the two of them broken up for my own selfish reasons, and while under normal circumstances I would have pursued her I feel like if I did that in the future it would just be proving to myself how much of an asshole I am.",

      "description": "AITA when I ask my friend to control his dogs when I bring my toddler over? Let me explain.\n\nMy close friend got married to a dog lover. They have 2 weimaraners and they are absolutely insane. They've had then for about 2 years and they both stay inside always. They do not listen, they bark incessantly, and they will jump all over you and scratch the shit out of you with their claws and gnaw at your hands with their mouths. What angers me the most is the wife always makes up some kind of excuse for their behavior.\n\n\"Oh they're just excited\"\n\"She's just showing affection\"\n\"I would never put my dogs outside, you wouldn't put your kids outside would you?\"\n\nI get it. People love dogs and cats and I'm on the other side of that spectrum. I can tolerate and enjoy dogs but their not my thing.\n\nSo here's whats got me a frustrated.\n\nI recently gave my friend, J, his christmas gift. I gave him my deceased brothers Xbox One. My brother passed a couple years ago and I kept his xbox but it stayed in my basement collecting dust and since I have a ps4 I never really used it and it didnt seem fair to let it sit there. So I decided a month ago since me and J were getting along so well that he should receive it because he only has a xbox 360. \n\nSo we were texting tonight and he suggested i come over and bring my 4 year old daughter. Last time I brought her those dogs cornered her and scratched her legs with their paws. So I texted him and asked if he could rein his dogs in since my daughter didnt like being scratched(more like I'll kill a dog if they hurt her). His response was, 'I cant do anything about that.'   ....I'm trying to be a reasonable person but wtf man? Cant keep your dogs in check?? Or put them in the other room for a small amount of time? \n\nSo I say cmon man im just protecting my kid from scratches. He asks, 'What do you want me to do?'\n\nAt this point I'm hurt and fucking angry. I can feel my blood pumping over a stupidass text convo. I tell him I just dont want her scratched and all I get is 'i cant help that.' So I just tell him I'll come over when I'm not watching my daughter one day and thats the end of the conversation. \n\nAt this point I'm ready to say fuck it. I have had the shittiest day and I'm confused as to whether I'm not being reasonable and this is why I wrote this. Maybe the internet can clarify. Sorry for the format this is all on my phone so thanks for reading.",

      "description": " \n\n( first post, fyi - happy birthday to me )\n\nBeforehand, let me apologize for the absolute word soup I'm throwing at you guys; it's hard for me to gather up my thoughts right now, so I'm just typing out memories and personal problems as they come back to me. I probably missed a few, too.\n\nFor some reason I just can't conjure up any positive feelings for her; I care about my stepmom and I know for a fact that she cares about me but almost everything she does seems to stress me out; nothing seems to be good enough for her when I clean the house with my sister, and she loses her temper incredibly easily with us. If we ever say anything that contradicts her, she raises her voice at us for arguing with her, and tells us that we never do anything she tells us to; that maybe she should just become harder on us if we're going to be like that. She just lashes out in anger and rarely tries to make up afterwards, even going as far as to say that it's our fault for pissing her off and being so uncooperative in the first place. And any perceived sign of disrespect (real or not) at all is immediately pointed out and I'm scolded for it. Recently, when I revealed that I feel safer talking with my biological mother (who has a history of drug abuse and is very financially unstable, on top of the fact that she use to stand us up during visitation. Still, I feel like I can talk to her and trust her more) , she launched into this huge, night-long lecture about how ungrateful I am for the work she puts into us, and how she loves us more than that woman ever could, and that if I wanted to be with our biological mom so badly then why don't we try and live with her. Any little thing can piss her off, and she launches into a lecture about how I need to have good grades so I don't end up in my parent's basement like my biological mom did, or worse. One time, she started to yell at my sister who was hyperventilating and obviously having an anxiety attack from already being chewed out for her grades. Occasionally, my stepmom changes up rules when they've always been a certain way, and pretends like it's always been like that. Because of her temper and different way of thinking, I never feel like I could share my inner thoughts around her; they always get targeted as some form of disrespect or they get shrugged off as childish. Both of my parents never seem to take me seriously, and treat me like I know nothing. My stepmom is also incredibly passive aggressive to everybody in the house; even my dad. I'm honestly just afraid of her; she never seems to be able to control her feelings and I can't relax while she's in the house because she'll probably find something to get stressed about.\n\nI'm not even a bad kid; I try my hardest in school and I really try to make my parents happy because I care about them. I used to love my stepmom but for some reason that feeling's just faded entirely into an urge to get the hell out of this house.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

M works in the construction industry and has a very high position.\nM offered to put in a letter of recommendation for D, which basically cements him getting a job,  on the condition that he would pass the drug test.  \nThe way my sister explained it to me was that if M recommend him and he failed the test it would really risk his credibility and potentially affect his income. \nI’m not sure if that’s an over exaggeration. \nBut nonetheless today I was helping them move and I noticed he was already smoking when I got there.

      "title": "AITA for negatively reacting to how my roommate handles food?",
      "description": "I've been living in an apartment with 3 of my friends from school since September. I really enjoy cooking, so I'd often treat the guys to a big meal once every 2 weeks or so where everyone would pitch in and I'd cook the main course. This was the norm for the fall, but now 2 of my roommates Aaron and Stan (fake names) are on a diet and prefer going out every week for an expensive cheat meal. I was happy that I didn't have to plan a week ahead, but also sad that I couldn't cook for anyone but myself anymore. This past week I go up to Aaron and Stan and ask to make them a cheat meal, and they agree on my idea for mac &amp; cheese. I ask if I can make it a dinner party and invite some of my friends and they agree with that as well, making the total amount of people about 12.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAaron lets me know that he and Stan are more concerned about their meal and doesn't want to pay for everyone else's food. Understandable, since it was my idea to invite everyone. I ask him how much he thinks he and Stan will eat and he says 2lbs each. Using how much I've eaten in the past and how much Aaron and Stan will eat, I get what I think will enough pasta and cheese to satisfy everyone, which was about $50 worth and I get reimbursed by Aaron and Stan $10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where it gets weird. Aaron demands that he grate the cheese, not because he's especially good at it but because he missed his arm workout that day. I hand him the cheese and the grater and let him do whatever. Aaron takes the cheese and starts aggressively grating this cheese. Like, he's screaming and looks like he's trying to fist the plate into submission. After one poor, poor pound of cheese he moves onto the next one. I take the cheese and take a look at it before I dump it in the pot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are few tiny, red specks in there.\n\nHe cut himself on the grater and is bleeding into the cheese.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I'm surprised and disgusted, but I didn't want to say anything because he's acting like a raving lunatic. Right before the first mac &amp; cheese batch is done, the guests arrive. I finish the meal, toss on some breadcrumbs, and have all 12 dig in. Everyone's complimenting the meal, so I at least know that no one's poisoned from Aaron's lunacy. It took them about 15 minutes for all 12 guests to give up, with both pots less than half empty (Each pot had about 3lbs of food).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I'm pretty upset. I now have $50 worth of cheese and noodles that I don't know what to do with, except make mac &amp; cheese for the next month. Aaron and Stan wildly overestimated the amount of food that they would eat, and let's not forget how Aaron BLED INTO THE FOOD. I've already seen the wrappers of the other cheese that I bought in the trash and everyone's avoiding each other. Am I the asshole for getting moody about my roommate's food habits, even though some have been the norm for months? Am I the asshole for willingly letting guests eat food with blood in it?",

      "description": "So. This happened almost 2 years ago. I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. ",

TL;DR of that post: I asked for more commitment for DnD sessions. I got  a hard no and my group is continuing to plan sessions ad hoc (last  sessions was at least 3/4 weeks ago fyi.) instead of on a (bi)weekly  basis.\n\nI am at a point where I want to  get more out of friendships and relationships in general than my current  group of friends are offering me. I am considering just telling them  that I don't want to be friends anymore and leave all group(chat)s we have.\n\nBecause we are 'officially' still friends there's still a chance we may be doing stuff together. This potential is in my opinion never met and so I am waiting to have my needs met. This potential never being met puts a strain on my patience and I really don't feel anything towards waiting for nothing. In other words: I want to cut off contact just so I don't have to put effort towards putting myself on hold and never being rewarded for it.  \n\n\nSo in short: would I be the asshole  for cutting off contact with my current group of friends because I feel  we're not doing enough together?",

      "title": "AITA for deciding to cut out a friend because I felt shunned by her?",
      "description": " It started 6 months ago, this friend I've known for 20 years started to shun me for no apparent reason. After she cancelled on a staycation a mutual friend and I were planning for her birthday (citing family commitments), she kind of stopped responding in the group chat. In the months that followed, she went silent, though there were occasional social media posts; and she was still posting active on her cats’ Instagram account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some reason, I got increasingly annoyed because I felt non-existent to her; she did not text me when I went on my solo trip overseas, despite sharing the excitement months earlier. She would react to other friends' posts on social media (some who aren't even close) but not once to my posts. It almost seemed on purpose. I realized much later that her personal Instagram account was no longer following mine (no idea when it happened), but her “cats’ account” was still following mine. I told the mutual friend about this, only to be told the 'unfollowing' could've been accidental, and that I might be overthinking things. At some point I came to a conclusion that the mutual friend probably knows something was up, but just didn't want to escalate matters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a passive introvert, I stopped initiating communication after attempts in the group chat got zero reciprocation from her. The only exception was wishing her happy birthday, to which she replied a simple “thank you!”.  I mailed to her some gifts over Christmas, and she didn't even have the decency to let me know she received it. I only knew she received it when I recently asked the mutual friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite wanting to consider that she might really be having personal difficulties and not wanting to be guilt tripped for being upset over all of this, I still eventually decided I’ve had enough.\n\nI unfollowed her on Instagram, later also removing her \"cats account\" from my followers, and I left the WhatsApp group chat. We are still on each other's Facebook, though she hasn't posted anything in 3 months. Either that, or she has been only posting to selected audiences to view (something she has done to others before). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left things at that, but last week I received a tracked parcel from her. It contained some items which I guess are gifts she got for me over the months and held onto, maybe waiting for a time to meet up... I don't know, maybe even thinking that is presumptuous. There was also a 'thank you' card in which she wrote \"Thanks for everything. Take Care.\" Not sure what kind of context that should be interpreted though.\n\nReceiving this now feels too little too late, and it no longer matters as much as it used to anymore.  Am I the asshole?",

I'm pretty broken up about it NGL, but I've been trying to be patient and not let my emotions get the better of me.\n\nThis evening my BF is trying to organise his mother's day with his siblings who live out of town and realised that we are due to be at a show on the night before mother's day (booked way before my mother died) . He turns to me and asks what I'm going to do about the meal he's going to for his mother during the day. I'm like, I dunno I'll sort something. He pushes for an answer to which I'm like, I have like 2 weeks to decide dude, chill. He pushes further and asks if I should just come to his mother's thing.\n\nWell that went super well. I ask him if he's thought about what he's just asked me to do. I burst out crying and just sob. He apologises, frequently, over the next hour. I'm still pretty upset, so I just say it's fine. I haven't really spoken to him but I'm sat here stewing about it while he (now) sleeps.\n\nI just feel like I have no perspective on this because its still pretty fresh. \n\nAm I the Asshole? ",

      "description": "Hello people, so here's the story. I won't go into too many details as I don't want to be traced back by people that know me. \nBasically, me and my girlfriend have been together for a few years now (we are both in our early 20ies) but recently (I'd say 1 year-ish) I've completely lost feelings for her, and yet, I'm still with her.\nNow, the reason why I have not broken up with her is because one of her relatives was really sick and in and out of hospitals, so I felt like making sure she was ok was my responsibility and my first priority. The problem was that, even tho I \"love\" her, I haven't been \"in love\" with her for a while now, so I wouldn never initiate sex or cuddles, and being affectionate towards her looked very forced and fake on my part.\nBecause of this dilemma, I feel like I might have done more bad than good as she is not stupid, and even though she hasn't mentioned anything, she probably knows something is up, which means I might have just made her sadder for the past year instead of helping her at all. \n\nNow, a little over a month a go, this relative passed away so I've spent nearly every day with her, and it seems like there will never be a good time to tell her I've lost feelings for her, and that I want to end the relationship. \n\n\nAITA for staying with her? And WIBTA if I broke up with her now? \n(Also some constructive criticism will be highly appreciated) ",

      "description": "I have had a crush on this girl for two years. We did a lot of stuff over the past few months: went to dinner together, got breakfast a few times, and I supported her at all of her soccer matches (we go to the same college). She's had a fucked up year and has been so courageous through all of the trials. I made sure I was a friend who was always there if she needed to vent.\n\nThen, her friends started to ask her if we were dating, apparently even one of the guys from the men's soccer team got jealous. People thought we were a couple. We looked good together. When I make her laugh, I see people looking over at us and smiling. We looked like a couple. She noticed that and for whatever reason made her uncomfortable. She proceeded to avoid me for two weeks. This is the first time she avoided me. I approached her about it, she told me everything, profusely apologized and that was that. Fast forward to February.\n\nIf people thought we were a couple and we looked good together, she'll say yes if I ask her out right? I got a soft no, she wanted to stay friends. I told her if she needs space I'm more than okay with that as I probably need space too. After a bit of thinking over the next week, I was confused as to how she could say no. I understand there might not be attraction, but this was more than a friendship, we were borderline dating. So that got me mad. AITA for being mad about her not feeling the same way? I understand some people just don't feel some type of way for others, but we were doing things that couples do.\n\nThen tonight, after over a month of no communication, I checked in to see if we were cool. She said yeah and apologized if she made me feel like she was avoiding me (we used to bump into each other a lot so I should have seen her at least once, she's definitely avoiding me). I didn't want conflict so I acted like she hasn't been ignoring me and said, \"Nah not really, I wanna give u space and it's been good for me, but I didn't wanna get completely cut off yknow?\" Ambiguous statement, but I was referring to the future. I didn't want one month of no communication to turn into a few months. She took it as though I accused her of cutting me off for the past month and got triggered: \"I'm not sure how I cut you off? Literally just haven't seen you?\" That really set me off. We used to see each other at lunch every Tuesday and Thursday but I haven't seen her in over a month. I texted her happy bday, she didn't text me on mine (few days apart). Hasn't texted me once since I asked her out. Literally has done everything in her power to avoid me. AITA for being mad these things?\n\ntl;Dr\n\nAsked a friend out after we were pretty much dating. Her friends and my friends thought we were dating. I got shot down AITA for being mad that she said no?\n\nAfter I asked, a month went by. I texted her to check up, she thought I accused her of cutting me off (which I think she did) which really pissed me off. AITA?",

They live one floor below me and I see them everyday, but more importantly, my dog, Hatter, sees them everyday. \n\nShe is the friendliest, most excitable, loving dog I've ever owned. She's a medium sized dog and if you go through my profile you'll find pictures of her.\n\nEveryday when I walk her and run into my neighbors they let out a shrill gasp, they jump away, they act like she's a monster who just said \"Boo\". Just this morning the mother gasped, threw herself out of our path and cowarded. Like with her hands over her head..One morning the father of a special needs child saw my dog coming down the stairs, leashed I may add,  grabbed his daughter and threw her against a wall out of our path. Legit, hard enough that it hurt her.  S not even afraid of dogs! Everytime we see the child with her (nanny/grandmother?) She claps with delight and pets Hat.\n\nLook, I understand not liking dogs or even being scared of dogs, but this behavior is ridiculous and it serioisly pisses me off. I've lived here for months, I say she's friendly Every fucking time you act scared. She's never once barked at you or your family, or really ever since we've moved in. She's never lunged at you or made a move. She walks down the stairs and flicks her old ear at you and if you were interested in petting her she wouldn't say no, she'd even throw in a few face licks. \n\nTheir reaction just pisses me off and it basically ruins our whole walk. If you're scared of dogs, whatever, but don't fucking inflict that fear on your child. Don't act like I've just appeared before you in a puff of smoke laughing manically. I'm a girl and her dog, trying to take a walk. \n",

      "description": "I’ve been friends with this girl, let’s call her M, for a few years. After graduating last year, we’ve only talked once when she needed somewhere to stay for a night because her and her boyfriend got in a fight. \n\nI said sure. She leaves the next morning and we, again, have no contact for about 5 months. \n\nOne day she calls my suite mate, a close friend who I share apartment with, and tells us both that her boyfriend randomly kicked her out. She has no where to go besides her parents house, they’re both raging alcoholics, and asks if she can just stay one night with us. We say yes. \n\nShe tells us all about how she never saw it coming and she has no idea what to do. My suitemate asks me if it’s okay if M moves in with us for the time being. This is risky for us; if our school finds out she’s living with us we would suffer all the repercussions. We both agree to let her stay because we would feel horrible if she had to move back in with her parents. \n\nA few weeks pass and she’s keeping contact with her ex-boyfriend. Both I and my suite-mate A repeatedly tell her we aren’t okay with this, and that we don’t want to be her parents but we let her live with us to get away from him. One night she tells us she’s going to stay with a friend, and we find out she lied to us and went and stayed at her ex-boyfriend’s house. \n\nSuitemate tells her that if she gets back with ex-boyfriend, she’s not living with us. \nWithin a week of this, M brings him over to our dorm to move all of her stuff out and says she’s going back to live with her ex-boyfriend. \n\nNot even two days later she calls and says they got in another fight. Both I and my suite mate let her move back in. \n\nAbout a week passes and I realize she’s still talking to her ex-boyfriend every day. I warn her, in the nicest way possible, that this can’t happen again and I think it’s best to cut contact completely. She shrugs this off and tells me they’re just friends. \n\nOn Valentines she tells us she’s going to stay with her mom, and then posts two pictures with her ex-boyfriend on Instagram that have obviously been taken that day.\n\nMy suite-mate and I decided together to confront her and text her a simple, “So you’ll be coming over tomorrow to get your stuff?” Keep in mind that we’ve made it very clear that she is moving out if she gets back with this guy. She texts back “what?” and we tell her we don’t appreciate repeatedly being lied to, and that we aren’t trying to parent her but that the one rule was that we weren’t going to let her live with us rent-free to get away from her boyfriend if they were STILL DATING.\n\nMy question is, are we the assholes for giving her that one guideline to live with us? It was completely rent free and we never asked her to clean or help with anything, just that she not get back with her boyfriend that had kicked her out twice. A few people have told me we should have confronted the issue differently and we were bitches the way we handled it. ",

      "description": "I'm a 21 year old male. I was raised in a catholic house and attended a catholic school. When I was younger my parents were fairly devout but not necessarily overbearing about religion. We'd say grace at meals and attend church every sunday. As I've grown up and learned about religion I've realized its not something I wish to participate in. I did go through an obnoxious atheist phase in my mid teens but now I'd say I am more agnostic than atheist. Christmas is coming up and my parents are always wanting to go to multiple masses throughout the holidays. They do not really attend mass on weekends anymore and I personally believe they are so firm about attending christmas mass because they feel guilty and know their parents would want them to be there even though they are now deceased. The past few years I've shared how I do not want to attend mass as I don't support Catholicism and it usually ends in a large fight, ruining the day and me caving and attending mass just to appease my parents. This year, I want to put my foot down and not go. I am not telling them not to attend mass but I in good conscience just can't support an institution who fosters and protects pedophiles. Also I have a very close family member who is part of the LGBT community and again do not wish to support something that says my family member will burn in hell for his sexual preference. AITA for sticking to my morals that i feel very strongly about even if it causes conflict during the holidays or should I swallow my pride and attend for the sake of the greater good? ",

      "description": "Hey so, made this account ages ago as a sort of throw-away for lurking and just subbing. I saw this thread and sort of had something I needed to get out. Kinda a long post so here we go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there's sort of a lot of background to get through, I guess, for it to make a little more sense. My mum is a single-mother. Dad walked out when I was young, the typical story.  Basically, in my hometown, the only members of my family are me, my mum (who I'll call M) and my step-grandad (I'll label G here.) M's been obsessively protective of me throughout my entire life -- she basically cut herself off from anyone who wasn't me, and frequently told me things like how she doesn't \"**need any friends**\" because she \"**has me**\" and how I'm all she needed. I'm entirely aware of how unhealthy that is, don't worry. Throughout most of my teen years I frequently encouraged her to get out more and form actual connections that weren't me or her family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I eventually (clearly not what M wanted) moved three hours out of my hometown to go to university, and well, she took it with a mixed bag. But I thought she was coping well. Then recently, on call with her, she mentions how she's found a potential new job; and it's a job she's really been wanting to get for a while now. At first I'm happy for her -- but then she mentions it's way outside of my hometown. Immediately, my thoughts go to *G*\\- he has literally no one else in the town. The rest of our family don't bother contacting him (since he's only a step-relation, ties were cut after my Grandma died) and he's at that life stage where a lot of his friends are gone. M's about the only person he has left that still visits outside of nurses and such.  He's provided for and helped us for so long, the thought of him ending up alone is just, well, awful for me. He's well into late 80s, and his health isn't exactly well. My worry is if something happens and he just has no one around him to help. Or even anyone to talk to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM seemed surprised, and I think that she'd forgotten to even consider him, but she got angry at me for not supporting her after so long of telling her she needed to get out more and be ambitious. She pointed out that, well, she's not his caretaker or anything, so she doesn't have to stay and look after him. She also rightly brought up that *I* left without much debate about leaving him, so it's hypocritical of me. I'm less sure of that since well... I left thinking that she'd be there. Getting to the point, we got in a massive argument over it, where I brought up that she wasn't really considering anyone other than herself and that she had other things to consider before making a big move like that.  \n\nThis is without mentioning that said job would also be way closer to where my Uni is, so she'd effectively be moving to me. This didn't slip my attention either.\n\nWe fought, we called each other selfish, it was a bit of a yelling match over the phone and we haven't spoken a lot since. She did, however, tell the rest of the family who've contacted me trying to explain her side. \n\nThis includes G, who says that he just wants M to be happy. Which is what I expected from him, really. But it doesn't make me any less worried about him being left behind in his last years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now I'm just worrying -- because I'm starting to see it from her point of view. For years I've gone on to her about pursuing what she wants to do, but when she turns around and says she's going to, I've essentially said \"no not like that\". I just really don't like the idea of my grandad being alone but I'm beginning to think telling my mum that I didn't approve of what she wants to do might have been the wrong move. She clearly felt really passionate about this job opportunity, and she was excited to tell me. And I just shut her down because I didn't really think about how much she'd wanted this. AITA?",

      "description": "few months back I took a vacation to Japan and mostly lived in Airbnbs. This particular hostel I stayed at was in Kyoto and I reserved a small room for 4 nights. Everything was fine until the 4th night when I found a cockroach near my bed. I have a really bad phobia of insects in general(particularly roaches), and it crawled under my bed. I contacted staff members through the app and was generally being difficult: asking them to come deal with it, to pack my luggage up for me as it was right next to the bed and threatening to leave a bad review. They were unable to do anything, giving me excuses about the shop and stores selling roach bait being closed( literally just hit 9 pm). The staff member also accused me of leaving open food around ,telling me to just go if \"I do not like here\" and promising to back the fee for tonight. After an hour or two of literally just staring at my luggage from meters away I quickly packed my stuff up, stored my luggage at the reception and left. I slept at a Manga cafe and returned in the morning to get my luggage. When I asked for a refund for my 4th night two days later ( they still haven't refunded me) they typed in broken English telling me to be a man and to not still think like a kid. The fee came through later. I know roaches are common in Japan especially in the summer, but I don't think what i did was wrong. I didn't even leave a bad review or cause a scene considering that the hostel was attached to a restaurant managed by the same company(customers were eating there when this happened). AITA?",

      "description": "I got into an argument on the libertarian subreddit, and I'm really confused why my comments got so negative reception.  \n\n\nThe post was a comic about weed use, and how smoking a joint can ruin your life, because of the unjust laws. I found the comic quite nice. It made a point I agreed with. I support legalisation of weed 100%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I think that people who smoke weed, while knowing it's illegal, should not be surprised, and angry when they get punished for it, because they consciously decided to break the law. I argued, that even if the ban on drugs is completely stupid, they can't just go against the law, and then complain, how unjust everyting is. I don't want to smoke weed, but I like occasionally drinking alcohol, so to relate to the situation, I imagined that alcohol is banned, just like weed. I argued, that while I'd be just as outraged as them, I could hold myself back, because not breaking the law comes natural to me. (Just as a side note because I didn't include this in the argument: I have a pretty rebellious nature, and I like complaining about unjust things, but after several arguments, and fights with my parents, I learned, that complaining doesn't get me anywhere, it won't change the law, and it doesn't oblige me to break the law)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to seem like an ass, but I didn't really understand the arguments of the other side. They rephrased my sentences, replacing words, and asking questions. It didn't give me anything to think about, I could only repeat what I said in my first comment.

      "description": "I'm not sure if this qualifies as a dick move. It really caught me off guard.\n\nWas getting brunch with the roomies and some of their friends. I get a $15 meal, they all get their own stuff with bloody maries.\n\nThe bill comes, we all hand over our cards, I get mine back to see it's almost $30, 2x as much as what I paid for. I speak up. Apparently the table decided to split the bill 5 ways. I reiterate my bill is twice what I paid. They say I should have said something when the bill came, even though I didn't hear this conversation. I push the issue a little more but no one is budging, so I let it drop, thinking maybe I'm overreacting.\n\nUsually these guys are cool but I feel like I was just told to fuck off for no reason. For some reason I'm pretty upset about it, but I feel like maybe I shouldn't be? I don't know, it came out of nowhere. Honestly wondering if I'm overreacting or not, because I am admittedly under a lot of stress right now. I'm having money troubles so it's not like $15 is just pennies to me, but I don't like getting petty over money.\n\nWhat do you guys say?",

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend have been together for almost a year. Our anniversary is this Sunday. A couple months ago I was home alone and as many people do, I got a little in the mood and decided to watch porn and get it over with. I was looking at pictures and they were hot to me and I figured maybe I wouldn't be able to find this again, So I saved some pictures. Once I finished my business, I realized that it was dumb of me to keep then on my phone, so I deleted them. I completely forgot that I had the Google Photos app, which backs up ALL of the pictures on my phone. I just deleted the pictures from my gallery, not Google Photos.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. \n\nI went to the bathroom and left my girlfriend alone with my phone. When I came back she was visibly upset. She said went on my Google photos to find pictures of us. And she told me she saw something she didnt like. I didnt know what she was talking about until I unlocked my phone. Right there, waiting for me were the pictures I saved months ago, and forgot that they were still backed up onto Google photos. \n\nShe said that she can't trust me anymore and I've apologized A LOT. I told her it wont happen again, but I didnt tell her that I feel like shes over reacting. I dont know who the girl in the pictures is and I will never even be able to talk to her. \n\nSo please help me out, reddit. AITA?\n\n",

About 10 minutes later, it became apparent that she was just hanging out in her car. I tried to put a pillow over my head, but the bass was up so high that even if the sound was dulled, I could feel the beat. A few more minutes pass until I sent her a text message.\n\n\n\nMe: “Do you have any control over the music outside, or is that someone else?”\n\n\nHer: “Sorry, that’s me. Turned it off.”\n\n\nMe: “Girl.. it’s 4am on a Wednesday”\n\n\nHer: “I know. I had a friend call me to take them home after getting plastered.”\n\nHer: “I’m sorry I woke you. I’ll be quiet.

Granted she hasn’t asked but I usually offer gas money for trips even if they don’t, but I don’t feel like it’s necessary in this case. \n\nI want this to be known I don’t want to drive but I am perfectly capable of doing so, and there is also company provided transportation to get to the location. But we’d have to Uber everywhere for the two days that we are down there, which would also be reimbursed.",

However IMO the kitchen is an open area and anyone shouldn't feel burdened to make food without worrying about disrupting other people (especially if they are working). I've had enough and would like to eat when I'm hungry. I would also like to point out that this includes group meetings with their classmates (that of course have to meet at our house and do it in the kitchen while we have 2 other living rooms), and practicing presentations. The most annoying thing they do is 'business' calls over skype with the webcam and everything. I actually enjoy the idea of a 'professional' call for an interview or with a 'client' while I'm in the background banging pots and making oatmeal for breakfast in my PJs, I believe it would send the message across.

      "description": "Guys, I need to know my level of assholery on this. I feel terrible and want some advice on how to handle the situation because I love my grandmother dearly. \n\nA little background information, I grew up living close to my grandma and seeing her several times a month. Shes the grandparent I would consider myself closest to. Around a year ago I moved out of state for school and am now around 2000 miles away, so I only see her a few times a year. Even still, I feel like our relationship is strong. My grandma lives in a tiny town that no one in my family lives near anymore because everyones jobs took them elsewhere. Because of this, she says shes lonely. She is single and has two cats. She got her cats about a year ago after her old one passed away and these cats are her life. She says they have separation anxiety and she cant leave them alone or with anyone else for more than three hours. She said they will stop eating and may try hurting themselves if she is gone for too long. She stopped visiting my father/mother (3 hours drive away) around six months ago and says they have to come to her because she can't leave her cats. That being said, shes mentioned leaving for day trips with her brother and sister before and says her neighbor is a trusted cat sitter who the cats are comfortable with. She has no physical disabilities and is only 70. She retired two years ago and still drives herself/goes shopping weekly/goes out with friends and siblings every time I talk with her. \n\nMy fiance and I just booked our wedding venue and are opting to have it in a location that is in between all of our guests. Everyone is spread out so everyone will have to travel a bit. When I told my grandma about this, she said she was sorry to hear I wasnt getting married within an hour or two of her and she would be unable to come. She said at first it was because she had no money. My father and I both told her we would happily pay for her transport , lodging, food, everything. It's that important to me she is there. Then, she said it was because of the cats. I asked if her brother or sister could take care of them for 1-3 days (they live ten minutes away) or if her cat sitting neighbor could help out. She said it wouldn't be possible because their lives would be put at risk. In my opinion, shes putting her cats over her granddaughter. It hurts badly and I cant understand why she is being like this.\n\nI told my father I think she may have a mental illness and if he had any ideas for help, but he and the rest of my family laugh it off and just say shes \"a crazy cat lady\". \n\nIt seems to me like she will not be attending, even though she is physically capable,financial capable with family assistance, has no other obligations, just is irrationally worried for her cats. I love my own cat dearly and can understand wanting it to be safe and comfortable while I'm away, especially if it has anxiety, but it seems like my grandmother may be projecting her own feelings of anxiety onto her pets.\n\nHolidays are coming and I cant help feeling upset about my grandmother. I feel almost angry towards her for deciding not to attend. I feel like I cannot mention the wedding at holidays if she is near because she is upset with me for having it more than an hour and a half away.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

She may be one of the grossest, most unclean person I know and cannot keep something clean to save her life no matter how often asked by others. She is just drop dead lazy. I would have been 15 at the time of the first incident, she would have her stuff all over the bathroom (shared by both of us) and would constantly spill makeup and oral care products over the counter. I'd ask her to clean it up and she would say yes and continue to never do it. This would go back and forth continuing the same pattern over a couple weeks. Until one day I got my mother involved to ask her to clean in, in which she hesitantly obliged.\n\nThe clean bathroom would last for about a week and then back to the same old disgusting mess after that. Over the next 4 years it would get worse with the slop expanding to living spaces and the kitchen, never cleaning up after herself even when asked by my mother and father. \n\nThis brings us to tonight after I have absolutely had enough of it, me and my mother got into a yelling match going back and forth. My mother finally says that's she's done all she can and that my sister won't listen to her. I then told her that she should kick her out (she does not contribute to the household or pay rent at the age of 22) which ultimately made my mother cry. \n\nNow kids making your mother cry always makes you the asshole, however in this circumstance are my views unjust?

Most of the time I just respond with something along the lines of \"No one cares\" And hes been getting mad at me over that. So im just wondering what the people of reddit think of this situation.",

      "description": "I wanna keep this short, but I promise I won't exclude any information\nSo today is Ash wednesday in the Catholic faith, and I got my ashes done on my forehead. They're quite prominent, but it doesn't bother me. I live in quite a sectarian city that I won't name. Catholics and Protestants have had a long hatred of eachother which has only started to recently cool a bit. I'm not a catholic in the religious sense, probably more agnostic, but I come from a catholic family. I should note, where I live, being a catholic generally equates to a nationalist while being a protestant generally equates to being a unionist. I am a non practicing catholic bordering on agnostic and am 100% nationalist. My girlfriend is not religious and is 100% unionist. \n\nSo after I got my ashes done we went out for the day. I didn't tell her I'd got them done so I thought it would be a bit of a shock, but not a big deal and we could laugh about it. When we met up, she immediatly told  me off for getting them, that I shouldn't have cause I'm not religious. She refused to walk next to me, and after saying I look like a retard she half-jokingly said that she didn't want to be seen with me and if she'd have known she'd have just went out with me tomorrow. she insisted I wash it off but I refused. While I might not be the most religious person, I am proud of where I come from, and I find that participating in religious events from my culture is a good way for me to express that. \n\nI told her if she was going to be like this then I'd simply get a bus home, she walked on past me. While I was waiting she texted me and essentially told me to come back, she was getting cold. When I got down to her, she was on the phone to her friend. Her friend was in the same place we were headed so she planned to meet up with her. This kinda hurt, it seemed like she wanted someone else to be around so she wasn't alone with me. Her friend is also protestant, and I didn't want to be made fun of by my SO and her friend. I made up a story about having a test to study for tomorrow so I had to go home. She gave me an annoyed \"bye\" and walked in the opposite direction. \n\nI don't see the problem, I like getting my ashes done, even it's not for explicitly religious reasons, it's just something I've always done. I don't agree with her political beliefs but I don't belittle her for it, I occasionally make light digs if it comes up in conversation and apologise if she thinks I went too far. \n\nThis happened about an hour ago and we haven't spoke since, normally, we'll both apologise in an argument, but I don't feel i should this time, I feel I've been treated wrongly for simply getting a black cross on my forehead\n\nSo Reddit, I know nobody wants to get involved in religious debates, but AITA?",

      "description": "In one of the lectures I'm in, there's a trio of girls that sit in the seats ahead of me. This is a standard pattern. I don't know any of these girls.\n\nI'm not really listening to the conversation they're having before lecture. I'm doing my own thing and one of the three girls, let's call her A, was talking about how stressed she was for one of her classes and how lost she is. The other two didn't really say anything but they were like \"aw that sucks\" and stuff like that. \n\nOne of the other girls started to complain about something else and A was offering actual tips and resources and anything else that could prove useful in whatever situation. I believe it's another class but A seemed confident and was willing to help one of her friends.\n\nA then went to get up to go to the bathroom and fill her water bottle. In the time she was gone, I overheard the girls complain about how annoying she is and how \"she's such a dipshit to not get this class\" and stuff related to that. I decided to listen in because they were really going at it and one of them even joked about spitting in her lunch that was left on her desk. I have no idea what the context of any of this was, and A seemed nice.\n\nEventually, after about 7 minutes, A returned to her seat. As she was doing so, I pulled her aside and told her, maybe a bit loudly, that her friends were calling her a bitch and a dumbass and threatened to spit in her food-- and maybe they did, because I wasn't watching them for a minute and I did hear them giggle crudely at some point. A was really upset about it and left the lecture, and one of the two girls told me to mind my own business.\n\nI personally wasn't having it because I'd fucking hate it if two of my friends talked shit about me. I have no idea what happened next or will happen to their friendship.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "A couple of weeks ago I came back home from college for the weekend. I found out, once I was home, that my younger brother had the stomach flu and was in peak sick mode during the weekend. Usually my brother and I love spending time with each other but I didn't want to risk getting sick so I didn't spend time with him that weekend.\n\nI refused to be in the same room with him. I wouldn't enter his room for any reason. I refused to have my meals at the same time with him, although I did let him eat first. Occasionally I would even sanitize things he may have touched such as doorknobs or mainly shared bathroom areas.\n\nI did try spending some time with him. We talked on the phone from separate rooms in the house and facetimed while watching the same movie from different areas in the house. I still missed him!\n\nNow my mother said that I was being a jerk and, I'll even admit that I may have gone, over the top in making sure I didn't get sick. I did have a test in the following week that I did not want to be sick for especially since you can't make them up. I was watching out for myself.\n\nSo, let me know, AITA?",

She is a worrier/planner so she's making lists and plans and setting up appointments to sort out her financials.\n\nI told her when she was diagnosed that whatever she wanted to do is fine. Anything she wants me to do, IDC. This part of our lives is about her. I would like to minimize her burden.\n\nOkay but anyway, back to the question. Mom is talking about life insurance and she told me she wanted me to be executor of the estate. Obviously I said ok and we talked about how she'd want things divided. The next day, she tells me her husband offered to be executor so there would be no tension between my sister and me. And before I could I stop myself, I told her I didn't trust him and that he's manipulated her/others before. (I dunno if their marriage is important context but she and I live separately from her husband because he cheated, she left, but they've been \"dating\" and half-living together for the last 2 years. She left him about 4 years ago I think.)\n\nShe obviously doesn't feel the same way about her husband that I do and I've been thinking about that conversation since yesterday morning. I don't want to push her into doing things (I have done this in the past) but at the same time, I do want her to consider all opinions before making decisions. But then on the other hand, I don't want to burden her with doubts about her marriage while she's dealing with her medical issues.\n\nI have a feeling this topic will come up more and more often.

      "description": "I'm about 37 weeks pregnant but I still haven't told any of my biological family. We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell.

We stayed the rest of the day together, we gave each other a little kiss from time to time. \nWhen we both left and went home, I thought about things and having an actual relationship with him... turns out I’m not really ready for one, my mental health is not good; so I text him a paragraph saying how sorry I was and that I can’t have a relationship at the moment, that I can’t take it and I explained to him why, he said he understood and was willing to wait for me to be ready but he tends to bottle up his emotions so idk if I hurt him or not.\nWas I the asshole for telling him on the very same day we kissed? \n",

      "description": "In high school I had a friend that we'll call Alice. At the start, we were somewhat of an item, but I said something stupid and we had a minor falling out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths pass and we are on great terms again. She got a boyfriend we'll call Chad, her dream lad. He was a hopeless romantic and super good to her at first. About a month later, Chad dumped her when she didn't say that she loved him. He started dating some chick the very next day that he had wanted (and probably been cheating with). This entire debacle sparked Alice's downward spiral into a deeper depression than she had been in from bulimia (which I found out about later), and she called bawling because she was contemplating suicide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver time, Alice started to drift. She stopped responding to me - she was 'fine' and just 'busy'; her Snapchat story showed her at parties. She'd make plans, only to never show, and later I'd see that she had gone to some other thing. I tried to help her out on this for two years instead of just leaving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe joined the robotics team with me and some other friends. Another person on this team, Rachel, was an absolute nutcase. Hated me for calling her out on letting my friend sing soprano but not me. Supposedly, this incident was extreme enough to make Rachel contemplate suicide that night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring a robotics meeting it came up about myself and the other captain's college choices. I had said that I was accepted to school in Florida and, without missing a beat, Rachel fires out \"Make sure you don't remake Parkland!\" days after the massacre. I stormed out and found out that Alice ended up comforting Rachel. She constantly referred to me as her best friend to everyone under the sun, but she never acted like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was in the middle of packing to move. My family had decided that they were also going to move, with me, 2 weeks before the date I was planning to leave for school, on top of me working full-time, and insulted me for 'not packing enough', when I packed half the house. One day I snapped from all the pressure and went into my room with a blade. Nobody was answering my frantic messages or pleas for help, except Alice. I called her about twenty minutes later, in tears, and begged for help. She laughed and hung up the phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day, I'm talking to one of my robotics buddies. Talk turns to the roster. Alice quit. Turns out she's drinking, smoking, and bulimic again as a type-1 diabetic - essentially a death sentence. After thinking about it, all I could say was, \"good riddance\", in the hopes that she could never hurt someone again like she hurt me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My 'best friend' from high school whose life I saved multiple times laughed at me when I called her - suicidal - and hung up to leave me to die. I found out that she is a smoking, bulimic, alcoholic diabetic, and said \"good riddance.\"\n\nReddit, Am I The Asshole?",

      "description": "So my sister, let's call her K (19), has been dating this young man, let's call him N (19), for almost 2 years now. They have been great friends since middle School, but he always wanted more from her. Even when she was in other relationships, although he never once acted on it or pressured her to leave her at-the-time boyfriends. I was always secretly rooting for him.\n\nTime jump to their senior year of highschool, she gets out of a terrible relationship, bounces around a couple guys, falls into a very deep depression and only continues to rely on \"boyfriends\" for emotional stability. N is by her side as the best supportive friend he can be. After a few rounds in hospitals and seeking mental care, they decide to become a couple. She is doing great, but obviously still has moments of emotional instability and depression.  In fall of her senior year she decides to move out of our parents' house because \"they are crazy and controlling\". She had just turned 18 and had convinced herself and her friends and friends' parents my parents were crazy and not allowing her to be an adult. They only had 2 rules, don't get drunk and don't smoke in the house. Other that those 2 things, she was free as a bird now that she was 18. After a lot of emotional trauma for the whole family, she moves in with N, now her boyfriend of 3 months.\n\nFast forward to about 6 months living with N and his mom and stepdad. We are seeing very serious signs of emotional abuse and she eventually tells us of physical abuse as well. Not only this, but her depression has been even more extreme and she has frequent panic attacks, almost all with N being the cause of  stress. After  6 months of us telling her we will do anything to get her out and basically telling her she needs to leave him and she can live with either parent or myself, she decides to finally do what she needs to be better. She moves out of his house, breaks up with him and moves in with me (I have my own house about an hour away). She does all of this over one weekend, after deciding it is what's best for her.\n\nFast forward to 1 month later, after sitting on my couch for 2 weeks without a job, my parents buying her a car, all new furniture for her room, she decided she needed to give N a second chance. K also now denied all accounts of any emotional or physical abuse from N. K texted my family in a group text and basically demanded we accept her choice and tell her we love her, or she won't talk to us or be in our lives anymore. And this is something she would follow through with as she has shut some of us out for months at a time before.\n\nNow, currently a month after K got back together with N, all of her stuff is still at my house, but she has been living with him and his mom and stepdad while she waits to find her own place. K did decide she shouldn't live with N anymore, but that they should still be in a relationship.  \n\nNow she is asking me to let N come with her to my house and hang out and help her pack to move back. So, am I the asshole for not wanting to have anything to do with N?",

      "description": "Some background: my father put a lot of pressure on my education when I was younger and would basically claim that whenever I did well in school it was because of him, he isn't married to my mum, so I stopped contacting him. Last year my mum got a boyfriend who moved in with us even tho, he has a flat of his own and his daughter sleeps over pretty often too. Mum always said that I don't have to do well in school, but she wants me to be happy.\n\nA few weeks ago I got some bad grades, not terrible ones, but enough to notice. I'm mostly a good student, but I didn't have time to prepare for the lessons and had trouble with understanding some things in Maths.\n\nAfter seeing those my mother said that I should rethink my life and she doesn't want to hear any excuses from me. That stressed me out a lot, I'm afraid of being a disappointment. Later that week during a test I remembered the situation and couldn't focus on it anymore, so I did horribly.\n\nShe later messaged me (during a lesson) to talk about my grades and say she's worried. She also said that from her point of view it's \"a cry for help\" (I want to move out later this year and live with my girlfriend of 3 years, mother was fine with that). I told her how what she had said previously made me stressed and that I failed a test because of it. She replied that I should stop blaming her for my failings.\n\nI thought about the whole situation and asked my homeroom teacher to tell her that I'm doing perfectly fine, I'm pretty much the best in class and that it's okay to do badly sometimes. She didn't want to hear that from me, so I thought she would listen to the teacher.\n\nShe just came back from a parent-teacher conference and made sure to let me know how tired she was. She asked me, as if it were my fault, if I think it's okay for her to leave the house at 7:30 a.m. and come back at 8:30 p.m., she also asked me why I \"snitched\" on her (yes, she literally used this word) and why didn't I talk to her myself.\n\nSo AITA for not talking to her myself?",

      "description": "I want to give you guys a little idea about the context, so this post is probably going to be a little long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy gf (20f) and I (21m) have a LDR. This obviously brings some difficulties, as we only see eachother every three months or so. We're both in uni, but she has been struggling alot with motivation and anxiety. She doesn't enjoy the path she's going and as a result has been very down the last months. She wants to quit uni, but has absolutely no idea what to do instead. I have been helping her as much as I can, I think. I am always trying to give her advice, help her with motivation, be supportive when she is feeling down etc. But I am getting a little frustrated about the fact that she is not following any advice i give her! I have been helping her with her with options she could explore instead of uni, i've told her that it would be good to get a therapist to help her with her anxiety (as I know I just simply fix that for her) etc. The problem is that, instead of working towards a solution, or trying to find a passion, she decides to do nothing. I know it is a scary situation to not know what the hell you want to do with your life, but the problem is that she has been getting angry with me because supposedly i am not helping her \"enough\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example is that would ask me: What should i do? Should I quit uni, should I continue? What would you do? My answer to this was simply: I would not continue with uni if you KNOW that it is not going to make you happy. \n\nShe then gets frustrated and tells me that I always give the same answer, and that she just wants me to tell her what to do! It's like she expects me to know exactly which career is going to make her happy? I really dont know either obviously. I told her that maybe you could go to the US for a couple months to study English, kinda like a gap year. But then she refuses to look into things like that. It's like she just expects to one day wake up and have found her passion. As you can understand this lethargy is making me slightly annoyed, because like I said, she refuses to actually take the advice that i give her, and then she gets mad at me for not helping her enough. Anyways, this was some background information. Now to the actual situation that I am dealing with now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night we were on the phone and the same subject came up. I could tell by her voice that something was wrong, so I asked her what was up. She then said that she was just confused because she doesnt know what the fuck she wants to do with her life. She then (again) told me that I am not helping her enough. Of course this kinda struck a nerve with me, because i have been doing everything i can to help her. Ive been doing a lot of research for her, exploring different options etc. Anyways, i responded with: \"babe, but you haven't been doing any of the things i told you! You haven't told your parents you want to go to a psychologist, you haven't been going to the gym, you haven't done the research to go to america, you havent read any books, you havent listened to any audiobooks on anxiety, you havent meditated, etc. I have given you so many options on how to feel better, but youre just not listening to me!\"  She then gets mad at me that i always give the same answer, and that she just wants me to help her.. So i try (for the millionth time) to give her my opinion on the matter, and i try to explain to her what i would do in her shoes. But as i try to talk, she just keeps interrupting me about everything i say. She doesn't let me talk at all and just keeps rambling on about how I don't care about her, how I don't help her enough etc. I keep asking her: can you stop interrupting me please? This literally goes on for 15 minutes, i just cant say 3 words withour her interrupting me, and telling me that im not supporitve enough. So now I am getting really frustrated, because i am trying to HELP her, but instead of listening to what i have to say she decides to interrupt me and ramble on about how i DONT help her. So yea, at this point im getting very very annoyed and angry, but i try to stay calm because we've had some prior issues about me \"yelling at her\" and she says that i have anger issues, even though i have never called her any bad names other than maybe \"hypocrite\", i've never threatened her etc, but yea she stills believes i have anger issues because i tend to raise my voice in arguments when i get frustrated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yea, back to the story. Gf and I are still on the phone, and i keep telling her: can i talk now? Are you done? Can i please talk without you interrupting me? So then i tell her that I am getting very frustrated that she doesn't let me finish my story, and that she really has to stop interrupting me. While i tell her this, she decides AGAIN to answer mid-sentence and i just get very angry and yell at her: Can you just SHUT UP AND STOP INTERRUPTING ME PLEASE! I admit I did yell this quite aggresively, but I was just so exasperated. After i yelled at her she tells me i broke the rule (of not yelling) and that she is done, that she cant be with someone that treats her so poorly, that i do not respect her, that no matter how many times she interrupts me i should NEVER disrespect her like that etc. I then tell her I did not treat her badly, and that she doesn't see her own flaws, and that I try everything to help her but that she just doesn't appreciate my help. I then hang up. She now demands that i apolize for my behavior, and that I promise her that I will get therapy to help me with my anger issues ( which i dont believe i have). So i refuse to apologize, and she wants to break up if i do not say sorry. So yea, thats where we are now. AITA for not apologizing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi.

      "description": "Some background:\n\nI'm (20F) currently travelling with my mom (48F) to visit some family members for Christmas. We left home a while ago. Soon after we started travelling, she took a number of does of prescription drugs (not prescribed to her) because she thought they'd be \"good to take while travelling\". The drugs have messed up her body and she hasn't slept properly in weeks. As a result, she's gotten quite sick (presumably from a weakened immune system) . We don't a lot of money so I've typically had to sleep in the same bed while we travel. We've finally met up with our family members and now I'm sick too, I've spent my Christmas lying on the couch with a stomach ache, a sore throat and I'm losing my voice etc (same symptoms). \n\nAITA for being (at least a bit) annoyed at my mom for taking the drugs and presumably making me sick on Christmas?

      "description": "So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won't give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",

When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.",

      "description": "Greetings from Belize where my week old marriage is already on the fucking rocks. Happy days yo! \n\nI will try to make this short while adding all relevant details and I also want to make this as equitable to my wife as it is to me and even though I feel she is wrong, I wouldn't be posting here unless I was self aware enough to admit some fault. \n\nI got married to my wife on March 9th. Her parents agreed that if we had a small and cheap ceremony they would pay for 100% of our honey moon and allow us to stay in their house (they plan on retiring there in a few years) for 3 weeks. I wasn't aware of this but one of the conditions of this was that my wife and I were supposed to stop in and say hello to multiple sets of their \"Belize friends.\" I think all told it's 5 different couples that we were supposed to make an appearance. As of yesterday, we were on couple 4 and while I was sort of annoyed that I wasn't made aware of this, couples 1 through 3 were nice people and the second set was these two hilarious gay dudes named Rod and Pete and Pete owns a helicopter who flew us all around to see the sites and that was awesome. \n\nCouple 4 was where shit hit the fan. They were much older, had obviously been fighting with each other and were super agitated. It was about 1000 degrees inside their house and they just sat and bitched the entire time about how their kids never call, how the husband's alcohol problem had flared up again, how the wife wanted to die because of her plantar fasciitis. We sat in these people's sweltering living room or almost 6 hours (that's not a joke) and we weren't offered so much as a drink and when I finally said I'd like some water, the kitchen was filthy as were the dishes and the husband was so shitty because I took a bottle of hot Dasani from under the sink. \n\nWhen we left,  I lost it with my wife. I told her that was one of the most miserable experiences of my life and those were two of the most miserable people I've ever met. She retaliated that those were two of her \"dearest friends\" and I was being super ungrateful to her parents who were paying for the trip. I told her that I wished her parents had made it clear that spending a full work day with American gothic on opiates was a condition of the honeymoon. She got so pissed at me that she called Rod and Pete to pick her up and I haven't seen her since yesterday evening. Her phone is either off or dead as my texts are not showing as delivered. I don't know how to get to their house even though its not that far so I'm just sort of hunkered down staring at my phone not sure what to do. \n\n\nAm I the asshole here? \n",

      "description": "I was going to post this on /r/Depression but then I saw this sub, mayne its a good idea to post here. For backstory I'm a 18YO (M) depressed, anxious guy, I finished HS 1 year ago, and took a year off (basically spent 2018 doing absolutelly nothing) I never had a job, umfortunally depression got the best of me I guess. Anyway, yesterday my uncle came here to make dinner (paarents were on vacation, only me and my grandmother home) so, he is there doing whatever, and I'm here, playing on my 3DS, on an online match. Out of nowhere, he comes ate me and tells me to go buy some Ketchup, because he needs 'em. I tell him to wait, as I'm playing, he tells me to go at once and I ask for him to wait again. He then scream \"dude, I'm cooking hurry\" and I say \"okay, lemme just--\" he slaps me on the head. Oh boy, I lose it there, I punch in in the stomach and he starts yo get all angry, full of himself. He nearly broke my 3DS too. So, I decided to go at once (sorry to whoever was playing with me) and on the way I shout at him \"piece of shit\" he instantly comes at me with his fist closed, with a grin on his face and by there I'm ready to (try to) punch him too. If it werent for my gramma, we would have fought right there. Anyway ff, he's gone, he text me asking if I'm angry, tells me he was wrong for hitting me, but I was also wrong for not \"obbeying\".  He then tells me that I don't have a job, I don't help with anything and that I SHOULD do everything someone asks me, and that we live in a society and some shit like that. I send him a long text explaining that I can barelly leave my bed, and That I'm bordeline suicidal, and that I feel like a leech for my family, and that its hard to even do most things when I feel like that. he just says that he understands, says that he'll kill me if I kill myself, but that I still should do everything someone asks me. He also told me that Im lucky I have a home, and that I'm not abused by anyone etc..\nNow, I'm not gonna lie... I'm lazy as FUCK. Like really lazy. All I do is take out the trash and help my gramma as she cannot move very well. That is not to say that I'm ungratefull for what everyone offers me (home, food, internet), I never complain, and I rarelly spend money since I dont leave my house really. Also, I AM looking for a job, I'm just not lucky with that. Later on my grandma said that \"we were both wrong because he hit me  but I also didn't obey\". I got so pissed, I said \"Look  HE was wrong, he came to THE HOUSE WHERE I LIVE house and started giving orders to me, and then hit me. I appreciate that he was making dinner, but NOBODY ASKED HIM TO, it was his choice, I could have made something else instead, so while im gratefull, Ill not suck his dick because of that\". My mom and her mother procceded to tell me that I'm wrong.. \n\nSo reddit, AITA for all that happened? \nAlso, AITA for being lazy in general?",

      "description": "I’m a 23 year old male. I’ve been dealing with severe Hashimoto’s, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, chronic insomnia, and POTs syndrome for the last 4 years. I was a former college football player with a bright future. I had several surgeries in a row to correct some cartilage injuries. The health issues started after the surgeries. \n\nMy dating life has been mostly non-existent for the last few years because I just don’t have the fucking physical/mental energy to date. Around New Years Eve, I met a girl from Tinder for drinks. We had a great time and have been dating the last several weeks. \n\nOver the last 3 weeks, my health has declined severely as a result of me over-exerting myself between work, dating, and life in general. \n\nI feel numb, flat, and just totally apathetic. My girlfriend noticed something was wrong over the last several weeks. I tried explaining my health issues to her. I told her that dark, low energy phases like this are common for me. She said she understood and was fully supportive, but still asks me to go out drinking, dancing, etc... when I really only have the energy to lay around her apartment. \n\nYesterday, I told her I needed a 4 week break to simply focus on my health and recharge. She was heartbroken. She told me she doesn’t expect me to come back, but that she cares and wants me to get healthy. I’m so torn. I care about her, but I’m not sure what I want with her right now because I’m to exhausted to think clearly. She’s the perfect girlfriend, but I can’t physically handle anything outside work and immediate family right now. AITA for asking for a break from her? ",

      "description": "I don't know if this fits here cause I'm also asking \"how am I the asshole\" because I genuinely don't know what I did but I must've done something.\n\nMy college roommate and I were paired up to be dorm roommates since first semester of college. We had a good relationship and moved into an apartment together the next year because we didnt have on campus housing. Things were great, we were good friends and spent most of our time watching tv together cause neither of us went out much. \n\nDuring the end of our junior year I got a boyfriend while on spring break. I'm very private about my relationships and rarely tell anyone if I dont have to. Once I returned from spring break I didn't have any desire to tell my roommate about this bf because in the past when i had opened up about relationships she was super judgmental to the point where I was upset the things she said. She is also exclusively into women so boys wasn't something we ever bonded over. I would've told her if he was going to be around but since it was long distance I figured it didnt affect her and wanted to avoid the judgement. \n\nWe hung out less and less as I spent more time at school doing homework or in my room skyping my bf. She was also gone a lot so I didnt think much of it. Eventually she started texting my other friends saying I was being weird and ignoring her. My one friend told me this and I didn't know what to say but didn't want to put that friend in an awkward situation by letting my roommate know she snitched. My friend just told her to talk to me, so I waited. She never did. She would just consistently complain about me to my other friends. \n\nBy this point I dug my heels in and refused to confront her about it because she was the one mad so she should come to me about it. This lasted for a few months and she'd act normal around me but complain behind my back. During this time my bf and I broke up and a very good friend of mine died along with other family issues. I didn't have the mental energy to deal with her as it was the least of my worries at the time.\n\nShe eventually got more frustrated to my face and would stop cleaning, told me not to use her groceries which we had always shared including things like salt. And she started closing her bedroom door because she was convinced I was messing with her stuff (we would leave our doors open when we weren't home so the other would know and not lock the other out.) I then started dating a friend of mine, a girl. She'd stay over some nights cause I was real anxious to be home alone with my roommate. One night we were...... doing things because my roommates door was closed so we assumed she wasn't home. Well I got a furious text calling me all sorts of names saying how dare I keep her up with my noise. I told her I didnt even know she was home and was not at all doing it on purpose. At one point she invited me to dinner cause I assumed she wanted to finally talk but she just started complaining about how bad her life was. \n\nWe lived together for a few more months until she moved out early and we havent spoke since.\n\nSo, what was it that caused her to react in such an extreme way?\n\nTL;DR spent less time with my roommate and didnt tell her about my long distance bf and she started talking shit to my friends and the internet but never talked to me. AITA for not going to her?\n",

      "title": "AITA for posting about my weight loss on social media?",
      "description": "I've always been the fat girl in my friend group, ever since we were in high school. A couple of my other friends were a bit on the chubby side and would complain about it (including my friend Jen, who this post is about), but I was legitimately obese.\n\nA while back I got tired of feeling unattractive and having health problems. I started to try and lose weight. I've never tried to lose weight before, but so far it's going great and I recently dropped into having an overweight BMI rather than an obese BMI for the first time I can remember.\n\nI don't talk about my weight loss journey much in person, since I don't want to be annoying and I know I easily *could* be if given the chance. If people comment on my weight loss (tbf it's a big difference), I just say I'm working out more and trying to eat healthier and then I change the subject. But I'm really proud of how much I've accomplished so far, so I've admittedly posted a few things on social media.\n\nOne of the few things I posted was a before/after picture to celebrate me not being obese anymore. In the caption I said something about how glad I am that I started this journey, and a few things about how miserable I was in the before picture because I was always in pain and felt so unattractive, and how much better this has been for my health and my confidence. I only talked about my feelings towards my body, and I was very careful not to bring other people into it or make generalizations about other obese people because I know from firsthand experience how hurtful that is.\n\nSo I got some compliments and the usual \"you go, girl!\" from some of my friends, but then when I met up with my friend Jen she started talking about the post. Jen's had body image issues for a long time and always puts herself down. She's talked a lot before about wishing she was thin. Her problems got worse for a while a few months ago because her now ex-bf of two years cheated on her with a skinny girl and she took as a sign that she's not good enough. I'm including this because it's the part that makes me wonder the most if I'm an insensitive asshole for not thinking of how the post would make her feel.\n\nJen said the post made her feel worse about herself and asked if I could tone it down. She said it seems kind of arrogant of me to brag about how easy it has been for me to lose weight, and that my behavior on social media looks like I just want attention. She said me talking about how I didn't like my body before would make other people feel bad, and that I should try to be more compassionate. She told me to be careful that I don't turn into the same kind of person I used to hate. I didn't really know what to say so I thanked her and told her she'd given me a lot to think about and I would try to have more empathy moving forward. Kind of regretting it now?\n\nJen's the sweetest person ever, and it's killing me to know that my post hurt her. It's true that I like the feeling of people cheering me on and complimenting me on my weight loss, after a lifetime of being the fat girl who was always insulted and never taken seriously. But I've made four posts about my weight loss in seven months. That doesn't seem like a lot. I still want to keep posting my accomplishments. Part of me is saying that it's my accomplishment and if I want to brag about it on social media, a place where everyone brags about everything, it's not my fault if someone takes it too personally. But at the same time I feel guilty, especially given Jen's history. AITA?",

We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???",

We'll both be going off to college this year, and will definitely be living in different cities, and if everything works out for me, different countries.  \n\n\nWe both knew when we started dating that this relationship had an expiry date and that this was a just for fun thing because we both liked each other. We had even talked about it and discussed the subject and concluded that it'll be best to break up before going off to college because studies matter more.  \n\n\nShe is really emotionally attached, and has been through her fair share of shitty breakups. One of the motives behind me wanting to breakup is to show her that not all relationships end in emotional trauma. That being said, I also firmly believe that I won't be able to function in a long distance relationship. I am a relatively closed off person and if things work out, I'll be in a new city in a new country in about 6 months, so the starting weeks of college are gonna be difficult enough as it is.   \n\n\nAnd plus, one more reason is that, it's not like we're coming back. I don't plan on coming back to my country to settle down, and I don't think she'll stay here for long either. I personally think long distance relationships are just a way for some people to blame geography for the breakup. I would've considered trying it, had I honestly seen a future, but I don't.  \n\n\nWe had decided that we would break up eventually, but she has been talking to her friends and they have somehow convinced her that things will work out in a long distance relationship. I can't blame her friends either as they only want to see her happy. I really like her as a person and as a friend and I really want us to part on good terms and not just be another salty ex.  \n\n\nWIBTA if I just go through and break up with her?",

      "description": "**it was not a pic that you would think it was oof**\n\nSo I had been talking to this girl for about maybe 2 months and she was pretty friendly. She would sometimes sends pics of herself (**NOT LIKE THAT).** I never did send any pics of myself as I am very anxious of how I look. One time I got enough courage to do it after I told her about my baby sis (she' soooo cute). She asked me to send a pic of my sis with me to prove it was actually my sister. So I did. She instantly took a screenshot. I was alright then, shouldn't be any harm. BUT NOOOOO. She sends it to a mutual friends WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. I was so pissed at her. She knew I was insecure, and still did it. I stopped talking to her after that and blocked her on all my accounts. This caused her to go on a rant with  all my friends, who tell me to unblock her. I don't. I think about it, but then she starts being a b\\*tch at school, so I just leave it at that. I recently found out she made a mindmap of \"13 reasons why?\", but for herself, and my name was on it. AITA?",

This wouldn't really bug me but what does is that he does it in the open and doesn't care if anyone can walk in on him. This with my room being infront of his I get to hear all the glorious sounds that come with the jerking. He doesn't even close the door to his room and when confronted about it he flat out said no to closing his door while jerking it. If I even try to close my door to avoid the sounds he'll play dumb and ask me why I'm closing my door. It's at its worst at night when I'm trying to sleep and all I hear is him.

      "description": "This is a retroactive AITA as this was about 2 years ago. As such, I may not remember all the details. \n\nSo 2 years ago I was in the midst of running a Pathfinder campaign (think D&amp;D) that was going great. Good, fun group who showed up regularly and brought good personality to the table. During April, one of my players ended up missing game for 3 weeks straight due to her working on her Master's Thesis. I recognize that as an important, and legitimate reason for missing the game. \n\nThat being said, after the 3rd week, I told her that if she didn't start showing up to game in the coming weeks, I would not hold her spot in the game anymore. I only run 4-5 players at most and we had 5. Now, this was not a threat, nor was I kicking her out. It simply meant that if she didn't start coming regularly then I would give her spot to another player if one wanted to join and showed up regularly. I felt it was an imposition on me the GM to hold a spot for someone who wasn't showing up regularly. This situation was also made worse by some inter-player drama that occurred a month earlier, but that is irrelevant to this situation. \n\nNow, I admit in hindsight that I was a bit of a dick in the way I presented that to her, making it sound like an ultimatum. It wasn't, nor was it intended to be. While I could have handled the situation better, I feel my reasoning in the matter was sound. I wasn't trying to be rude or threatening, just informing her that after a certain point of missing the game that I felt I couldn't hold someone's spot. She eventually returned and all was great, but if you're going to be gone for a prolonged period, it's a bit of an imposition to refuse a new player for someone who isn't there.",

He'd come back here and there but always put any expenses on my mom or dad. \n\nAnyways, I recently had a baby, and I let my go on vacation with my mother and grandmother to their home country(to visit his great great grandparents). Where they were told to not let my bio father see the baby. We all hated him, so they agreed. \n\n He texts me complaining, trying to guilt trip me, then tries to use my half sisters as leverage. (They live with him) He dodges any criticism I throw at him by saying that he was always there for me. I actually only seen him around a total of 16 times since he left after I was born,since he lives in another country. Anyways I cut him off completely from any social media. \n\nOkay back to now: He's sending me texts through my little sisters account pretending to be her. I know how she texts. She's 10. He keeps trying to get me to send pictures of my baby, pulling the \"I'm your sister\" card. Kinda insulting that he thinks I can't tell the difference. So I had to block her too unfortunately, even though it's technically not her texting me. \n\nAm I the asshole for blocking my sisters account because her dad is spamming me on it multiple times a day?

I stop showing up early at this point because keeping my guard up was exhausting.\n\nOne day, I leave work and I get a text from F. She’s confused because she’s been friendly and we should be close by now.  I told her that I still feel like we’re getting to know each other and that when I’m at work, I am there to work. I set clear boundaries about her asking personal questions and to not force me into acting closer to her than I perceive us to be. \n\nA few more weeks go by and F starts treating me differently and even starts talking badly about me to our coworkers. I started panic attacking at work. \n\nI texted my boss to quit my job. She called me, and we were both kind of sobbing. My boss knows my mental health situation and felt awful about the anxiety, but we both agreed that the job was holding back any progress on my mental health and ended the working relationship as amicably as we could. \n\nI found out that F manipulated our boss to think that we were best friends. Our boss said she was sorry that our job ruined our strong friendship, and how awful that must be for what I’m going through. When I told her I barely knew F and that I was confused because F made things worse for me, she said that’s not what F had to say about our friendship. I was confused but left it at that. \n\nA week later, F texted me to ask what’s going on because she got me the job and had a right to know. I ignored it because the very last text in our convo was where I asked to her respect my boundaries. Ironic. \n\nThe next weekend, F texts MY BF asking him why I won’t tell her why I left. She even tried to manipulate him by using her bf. She said “he’d like to see you once this is over” \n\nOur bfs shouldn’t have to sacrifice their friendship because we don’t get along. I was done. \n\nI texted her saying I found her threat to my bf disrespectful, and if she respected me she would have listened to my boundaries the first time. I told her there’s a difference between getting to know me and manipulating me to think we’re close. All she said was “okay, understood” and then blocked my number. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Made a throwaway just because I have friends who frequent this sub even though this is really kind of a mild post. \n\nI’m in my mid-20s, moved back in with my parents about a year and a half ago when I started grad school. I’m in my last year now. A couple of days ago, my sister also moved back with plans to start grad school in the fall. So...it’s a little crowded. My sister rented a uhaul for her stuff and had it parked in front of the house. My mom and I took it back yesterday, with my mom driving the truck and me following behind in my car. Then, we drove back home together.\n\nMy family and I live in a row house. There’s a parking spot right in front of the house, and another one down the street. Those spots are where my parents park, and I usually park on the street. So I’m driving my mom home and I go to park where I usually park, and she tells me to just park in the spot in front of the house. I kind of protest, because I don’t want to have to move my car later, and tell her I’ll just drop her off in front of the house and then go park on the street. At this point she gets a little irritated with me and tells me to just park in front of the house and leave it alone. I’m like, fine, whatever, not a big deal. \n\nLater that day my dad comes home and asks why I’m parked in front of the house. I told him what happened with my mom. I can tell he’s kind of annoyed that I parked there, but I don’t think it’s a big deal so I just brush it off. \n\nNow today, I have the day off and I’m just hanging out at home. I go to the basement and am working out on the treadmill when my dad comes down the stairs. He says: “hey, so your mother and I had a discussion about the parking spot and it’s okay if you move your car”. Now at this point I’m irritated. I said something along the lines of “what are you talking about? I know I’m ALLOWED to move my car, all I said is that I parked there because mom told me to and I didn’t feel like arguing with her!” Now I know I kind of blew up here, but I was annoyed because  i could tell he just wanted me to move my car and I don’t like when people beat around the bush. \n\nI finished my workout, took a shower, then I’m just in the living room when here comes my dad again. He looks at me and says “you know, whatever issues your mother and I are having with the parking spot, you don’t have to get into the middle of them”.\n\nSo now I’m furious. I tell him “I have no idea what you’re talking about! If you want me to move my car, just ask me to!” And he just walks away.\n\nSo I’ve decided I’m not moving the car unless he explicitly asks me to. It’s now apparent to me that my mom told me to park in the spot to piss off my dad. But honestly that’s none of my business and I had no idea when I parked in the spot. I just want to get my degree and move out, I have no interest in being involved in my parents marital drama.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not moving my car (even though it seems obvious my dad wants me to) because he won’t ask?",

      "description": "I was on the way to the movies today, and it was packed, I guess due to today being Black Friday. Anyway I was reverse parking into a space when a car comes up out of nowhere allowing me no space to reverse park. I continue inching toward the car, backing up while not hitting the car. It comes to the point where I can’t back up more without hitting her car. I roll down the window and ask the woman driving the car to backup since there are no cars behind her. She doesn’t budge. I’m assuming she wants me to accidentally hit her car so she can get some money out of it, but I honestly don’t know. I put my car in park, and we’re at a standstill for a minute. Then I put my car in drive and drive up a little to get some space to keep backing up, barely hitting a parked car up ahead. I get the space needed to park, put the car in reverse and make it into the slot, almost hitting her car.\n\nI know she’s not obliged to back up, but seriously? There were no cars behind her and the both of us could’ve saved two minutes. The entire encounter made me angry but I’m just wondering if finding another place to park was the move here and whether I was the asshole here?",

      "description": "My bf and I have been together for just short of 2 years now and it’s starting to become more serious. We have plans to move to another state together and we are starting a life. I have never been one to tell a SO that they are not allowed to speak to an ex or not have a friendship with them. But this girl, let’s call her Manda, I just don’t like and she really fucked him over. \n\nShe has an 8 or maybe 9 year old daughter and according to him is a terrible mother, I guess while they were together he developed a strong bond with this little girl bc the mother wouldn’t do shit for her and he kinda just took the daddy role (even though this isn’t his kid). Recently I found out they (him and the little girl) still speak which i honestly at first though was nice. But upon reading these messages it’s mostly him and Manda talking, and most recently he told her something private about my life that I asked him not to share, his excuse was “well you’re a big part of my life and we talk about life”. \nThe child is awesome and they seem to have a solid bond, he even mails her gifts and made sure to send birthday wishes and cute things. \n\nHim and Manda dated a little over a year and he told me he stayed with her bc of the child and the fact that they had nowhere else to go. He moved to another state with her and claims he did it so he could set them up somewhere else and then leave. I guess while they were there among other trashy and hurtful things that she did, she took HIS tent to a festival and had sex with someone else in it (her now 2nd baby daddy) and he left and came back here. \n\nI see him sending her pictures of her he took, videos of her hooping, and photos of them with the child in recent messages which bothered me. He also tells her things like her new hair looks good or she’s cute in whatever Facebook picture. He keeps saying he only talks to her to maintain an okay relationship so she will let him still communicate with the kid. I feel as though she’s using this to her advantage and I don’t like the stories he’s told me about things she’s done to him, and recently I’ve asked him to stop speaking to her. \n\nApparently she is coming to the state for a visit and her excuse for adding our city to her trip is “to spend as much time with _____ as possible” the blank being his sister who I guess is still her friend. He tells me he’s going to see her (and the child) and he’s going to take the kid out for the day etc. I once again flipped and said no that’s not cool, bc I don’t believe it’s just going to be the kid. \n\nI only heard about this child a few months ago. They were together about a year (and he was in the kids life), I feel like I would have been aware of him and the kid’s relationship sooner if it was so significant. So am I the asshole for asking him to sever ties so we can move on with our lives together? Bc he’s got me feeling like I’m being irrational. \n",

      "description": "I work as a dog sitter/dog walker. One of the dogs I take regular walks with lives in a house with a really big fenced in garden. So I usually bring a couple of dogs over to her so they can play there (with the owners consent of course). It’s really convenient for me since there’s no dog parks nearby and the dog love it. I’m there every weekday from around 11 pm to 12 pm. And of course when dogs play it can get a bit loud sometimes but it’s never an hour of constant barking.\n\nWell the other day one of the neighbors told me the dogs are making too much noise and is disturbing him when he does his yoga. I told him it’s only for an hour in the middle of the day and maybe he could do his yoga after. But he told me I had to take the dogs someplace else because it’s rude and disturbing. I double checked with the owners and they said he can’t tell me what to do with their dog on their property and that they would talk with the neighbor. But now every time I see him he gives me the stink eye. But I really don’t want to stop taking my other dogs there because then the dog who lives there won’t get to play with them anymore and I can tell how much she loves to play with them.\n\nSo am I the asshole if I keep taking my other dogs there and disturb the neighbor?

      "description": "For some context, I live in eastern Massachusetts and a friend of mine lives about an hour away by train. We are pretty close friends in college and I haven't seen her since winter break has begun. I've asked to hang out twice now and both times, she denied hanging out because she was busy. I told her to let me know of a day that shes willing to take the train and meet up. Fast forward a good two weeks from the last time she responded to my \"lmk\" texts and she suddenly asks me \n\n\"Hi whats up, I've got a doctors appointment at \\*place near my college\\* and I was wondering if you were ok to hang with \\*name of bf\\* while I get checked up. It shouldn't take long.\"\n\nJust some clarification, they are in a long distance relationship and I have hung out with him when hes visited before. I've cooked for him, gotten drunk together, and had fun. I'd say we're friends, but in a different perspective, Its a forced relationship. I hang out with him because they are happy together and I value our friendship enough to get to know someone that a friend of mine likes being with. \n\nGoing back to our back and forth texting, \n\nTo this I reply,\n\n\"Sorry, that was unexpected. Maybe? I'll let you know if I can, but you should also let me know when YOU'RE free! We should meet up some other time.\"\n\nI understand this is petty.\n\nHer reply, \"Okay yep will do, cool!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think i'd be a great time to show him around and just have a fun time, but Im not getting the motivation because friendships dont run on 1 sided motivation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the one month of break we've had thus far, AITA for not wanting to/feeling annoyed that a good friend of mine asked me to almost babysit her bf when she hasn't even made an attempt to hang out with me after I've asked her multiple times when shes free? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my roommates girlfriend to pay rent",
      "description": "Hear me out, I genuinely don’t know.\n\nSo I (M 20) live in a three bedroom apartment with two other guys (both M 20). We all have girlfriends who come and go, but one girlfriend (M 19) lives with us permanently. The three of us guys pay rent out of pocket, while the girlfriend in particular (we’ll call her Amy) has a room on campus that she has never once slept in, and that room costs more than what she would pay to live here. She hardly ever visits her own room. \n\nAmy eats food that her roommate pays for, uses up utilities with us, uses our bathroom, etc etc. She doesn’t buy food. She doesn’t pay for anything, except for herself. This is typically fine, she can pay her own food and expenses. But she wastes money paying for a place on campus when it could make living at my apartment cheaper for both of my roommates and myself. Even she would pay less.\n\nThis is something I’ve never voiced to my roommate who dates her, because I know the girlfriends me and my other roommate bring over don’t pay rent either. The difference is they come temporarily and leave. Half the time they’re not here. And while they temporarily take up space and do the same things as Amy, they leave just as often to stay at where they live.\n\nAmy and her boyfriend knew prior to moving in that Amy would be staying with us full-time. She’s cool as a roommate, but she also takes up a lot of space, makes the place dirty, sits on our couch all day, uses our shower and bathroom constantly.\n\nMy parents wonder why I live with 4 people full time and three pay rent. It’s more of a burden for them when they help me in affording college, and it would make rent cheaper for the other three.\n\nThe main reason why Amy doesn’t pay rent, is because her parents don’t know she lives with a bunch of guys. Her, and her boyfriend, have no plan on telling her parents. I can understand, but her parents are also paying thousands every semester for a room she’s never slept in. Amy and her boyfriend would rather not approach the issue then pay less for where they’re living because their parents cover most of it. I pay out of pocket for where I live a lot of the time. It’s tougher for me, when I feel it’d be easier if she paid rent.\n\nI approached my roommate who dates Amy, and low-key asked that since he knew beforehand that Amy would be living with us full-time, why she didn’t pay rent this year. He maintained the fact that since there’s only 3 people on the lease, it shouldn’t affect me at all and it’s not my problem. If she didn’t exist it wouldn’t make a difference. \n\nIt’s a small apartment, and she’s constantly around. She takes up a lot of space. \n\nI don’t know, I’m really unsure if I’m in the wrong place even asking.\n\nAm I an asshole for pulling my roommate aside after several months this morning, and asking him why she doesn’t pay rent? \n\n",

      "description": "I work, my fiancé stays home. Normally she sleeps in and we usually touch base around 11am. I have to be at work by 830. I am a manager of a company so my 40 minute ride in consists of calling my supervisors and laying out the plan for the day. Then I listen to my news and weather on my ride in, kind of my mental prep for the day. \n\nNow, my fiancé has a terrible habit of calling me but not talking. Like literally, not speaking. This happens at least daily and i have conveyed multiple times that i dont like it. She just wants to be on the phone with me and not talk. I have expressed to her this is frustrating for me as while I enjoy talking to her, I want to actually talk if we are on the phone. Also, she calls me throughout the day when I am trying to work and honestly, my ride in to work is really the only time I ever have that is just mine...so anyway. \n\nThis morning she calls, as she woke up early, and asks me one thing, then, silence...i try to talk to her and get one word answers and silence, followed by silence and, you guessed it, more silence. So I say honey, I'm going to get off here I love you. She asked if I'm at work yet, so I tell her no, still 10 minutes out. So she says \"oh, so you just WANT to get off the phone with me?\" And I reply, \"yes babe I do, you aren't talking to me.\" So then she gets pissed and hangs up...calls back...3 times...crying that I hurt her feelings. I apologize for hurting her feelings, I honestly wasn't trying to. I reiterated that it is not enjoyable for me and it is frustrating to be on the phone just listening to her breathing. Then she goes offensive and starts really being hateful to me saying that she hopes I have a great fucking day etc...i say I'm sorry again for hurting her feelings and that I love her, which, she doesn't respond to. Like more silence for a solid minute until finally I say \"bye I love you\" and hang up. \n\nUmm, am I missing something here? Am I the asshole? \n\nTldr: fiancé calls to let me hear her breathe instead of talk, that's frustrating for me. She asks if I want to get off the phone...and i say yes...so now I'm an asshole apparently...",

      "description": "warning: wall of text. Lots of backstory. \n\nSeveral years ago my wife and I had a destination wedding in another state. Her whole family went. Her parents are divorced and the older of the two brothers lived with his mom.(this is the brother in question) Because they didn't have a lot of money they road with us in the car and took a bus home at the end of the week. (We stayed a second week by ourselves for a honeymoon). \n\nHer mom talks about that trip all the time. she said it was one of the best trip she ever took in her whole life. she talks about how much she loved to go back there someday. \n\nso this year for Christmas we decided to surprise her with a suitcase and a letter saying basically that we were taking her back there this summer. Because my wife sister is older and married now they will be going also. \n\nA few days ago I find out that the brother somehow thinks that he was invited to and that he's going on vacation with us. My wife doesn't really care so long as he pays his own way. \n\nHere's the problem though. This brother is like the most socially inept person I've ever met. He never learn to be an adult and is just a complete embarrassment to be around in public. He has this really annoying need for constant attention. If people are talking about things that he doesn't know about or have any experience with, he will just start making stuff up. He makes up insanely unbelievable stories about things he's done or seen that anybody would know is not true. And when you're talkin about things he will try to correct you and tell you you're wrong and then make up lies to support it. \n\nEx: someone asked if Dr pepper is made by Coke or Pepsi. I explained the doctor pepper is its own company and not made by either. He chimes in that dr. Pepper is actually made by Coke but Coke keeps it a secret. I told him that's ridiculous. He tells me that his friend's dad is the CFO for Coca-Cola and told him that they make Dr pepper. \n\nIt causes a lot of stress in the group. He will start trying to cut me down and tell lies. I will call him on his lies and expose him. Then he will get mad and pout and everyone will get mad at me for being mean to him. \n\nso anyway I find out that he thinks he's going on this vacation. I told my wife no way. If he's going I'm not going. We have going on a week-long trip with him before and it was a nightmare. everyone was mad at me the whole time for arguing with him. They think I should just let it go and let him lie. \n\nPart of me realizes that since I'm the only one that has a problem with him, I should bow out. But my wife and I are the ones that planned this trip. This is our vacation spot that we go to every year on our anniversary. (Forgot to mention this trip would be on our anniversary). We have gone every year since we were married and I really don't want to have to skip it.",

      "description": "So for some context I have a twin sister and we get along most of the time but every now and again she'll ask me to use my drawing tablet so she could make some art. Last summer she asked me so she could make some art for people on Twitter. I said sure and thought it would only be a few days. But she kept it with her nearly the entire summer in her room. About half way in i asked about the art and for the tablet back but she says no and that she's almost done. Sometime at the end she finally gives me back my tablet and thanked me. But sometimes she'll ask me to do something or ask for stuff such as going to the store to get her stuff. If I say no she'll whine and act pretty bratty because I'm not doing what she wants.\n\nFast forward about 6 months and it's the middle of January. I was at home alone for awhile relaxing and on my laptop on a weekend day. When my little brother walked in I saw my sis then walk in to dining room where my laptop and tablet are. (keep in mind my laptop is about 1,000$ and the Tablet cost 80-90$ and she has no way to pay me back) She walks right up to me when i stand with my laptop open but doing nothing. Not even a minute in the house and this is how it goes.\n\nCast.\n\nMe: Me TS: Twin Sister\n\nTS: Hey bro can i try out your tablet since it's fixed now? You're not using your laptop.\n\nME: I'm sorry but I just got up and i was going to do laundry.\n\nTS: Cm'on there's nothing going on.  \nI sit back down and log out of my profile so she can't get in. She huffs and starts to walk away clearly angry about not getting to use my laptop.\n\nMe: Wow entitled much?\n\nShe gets real pissed off at me because of what I called her and then pushes me away from her while still grabbing my shirt hard. After that she storms up the stairs.\n\nI realize that I shouldn't of said that to piss her off more but there was one time where she called me an Asshole for simply not doing something for her.  \nPeople of Reddit was I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my mom’s best friend to join us on a trip to the Philippines to visit family?",
      "description": "Hi y’all, just wanna get other people’s thoughts on this. I figured that if my mom wants her friend to go so badly, they should just plan their own trip, but let me explain. Sorry for the long read. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nThe Situation:\n\nBack when I graduated from high school, my mom’s graduation gift to me was “a ticket to the Philippines (redeemable at a future date).” This is in quotations because there was no actual ticket, rather it was a comment written in my grad card because 1) I had already told her that even though I wanted to go, I would be in school and didn’t know when I’d actually be able to go and 2) she couldn’t actually afford a ticket at the time. This becomes important later on (imo). \n \nThis past summer, I applied to medical school and was successful(!), so I’ll be starting this coming fall. That being said, I’ve been studying/working throughout college and after graduation to prep my application and save money to pay for aforementioned apps, so I’ve never really been able to take any vacations or trips. In this span of ~6 years, my mom has gone to the Philippines (without me, because I was in school) 3 times, each time for 3-4 weeks. \n\nSince I’ll start school in the fall, I’ve started to plan my last day at work, and when I’ll finally be taking my trip to the Philippines. I told my mom about this, and asked if she would come with me and if the offer for the free ticket was still on the table. She admitted that money was still tight (which didn’t surprise me because my dad is still unemployed), and that she probably wouldn’t be able to cover her ticket, let alone mine. I was fine with this though, since I’ve been working full time and have managed to start saving a bit (after finally paying off the ~$6k I spent of my own money to apply to med school in the first place). I really want my mom to come with me, because the first time I went to the PI was with her, and I’d like to be able to enjoy a trip with her again. My tagalog is also not the greatest, and even though I know enough to get by and some of my family members speak some english, things still get lost in translation. \n\nSince I want my mom to come with me, I crunched the numbers and figured I can afford to buy my mom’s ticket, so I offered to do so for her. This she happily accepted, and we started trying to plan out dates for the trip. The main point of this trip, at least, as I intended it, was to visit and spend time with family. It’s been almost 10 years since I’ve last gone, and my grandmother’s getting pretty up there in age. My mom knows this. \n\nAs we’re figuring out dates, my mom pulls out her phone, and calls her best friend, who we’ll call Marie. Cue her telling Marie about our upcoming trip, and telling her she should come with us. She spends a good half hour discussing logistics, places her friend can stay, and other touristy islands and places they could visit. Marie sounds excited for the trip and plans to come. \n\nAfter she hangs up, I ask my mom why she invited Marie, as I wanted it to be us two to visit family. Her response was basically “Marie has been wanting to come with me to the PI forever!!! We’re finally going, so of course she should come. I told her she could the next time I went.” \nOf course, I responded saying that I wanted it to be a family visit trip, not one where we’d go around to all the touristy places so she and her could take pics (this was what she was talking with her about). She basically brushed that aside and said “She’s been wanting to go for so long, so she has to come. Don’t be selfish.” As if I haven’t too??\n\nThis is really annoying me, since this isn’t at all what I intended it to be and I feel like the trip would be much different now if her best friend does come. I’m at the point where I almost want to not pay for my mom’s ticket anymore, because I wanted it to be a trip for me and her, not here and her friend. But of course, if I don’t pay, my mom won’t be coming with me and won’t be able to see her family. So, AITA here, and WIBTA if I did tell her I didn’t want to pay for her anymore?\n\nTL;DR: Mom invited her best friend on a trip to visit family that I was going to pay her way for and calls me selfish for not wanting the best friend to come because “she wants to go too.”\n",

      "description": "I have a friend of a friend who has been occasionally staying in my apartment when me or my roommate are away on weekends. Initially he stayed with us on a two week sublet as I was on a work trip, so it worked out perfectly. At that time I told him he was welcome to finish off my food, since I was gone for weeks. He doesn't live in our city, but often visits and needs a place to stay for a few days, and I need someone to feed my cat, so it's been a good mutual arrangement. \n\nI came back from a recent 5-day trip, exhausted and hungry. He's considerate in taking off the bedding and sheets before he leaves, though the house is a bit messier than it was, but this time I opened the fridge and it was totally empty. He'd cleared out all my food, cheeses, almond butter (that I brought in a suitcase from the US) and I had nothing left. It's been pissing me off, because he doesn't seem to be aware how expensive some of the stuff he's eating is. I'm pretty sparing and I'll make stuff last for ages, and then after one stay of his, it's gone and I have to restock everything.\n\nI'm torn about letting it go and just accepting it as a cost -- he did take care of my cat--or asking him politely in future to just eat the perishable food, but I don't even know how you go about asking that without sounding like a petty asshole?

      "description": ". A former good friend started being distant after I refused his advances. A girl contacted me and confided that he had groomed her, and was flirting with underage girls so he could have sex with them the minute they became legal, then ditch them. This is a crime in my country. She sent printscreens that looked dodgy. I mentioned this to said former friend in an argument where I cut him off for stabbing me in the back. Didn't say I was going to make them public or anything like that and his response was to immediately block me. This made me suspicious but still not overwhelmingly convinced. Former friend then spent 3 months on a total smear campaign about me. Since I had blocked him on messenger (he blocked my entire fb profile as soon as he read my message saying I had seen dodgy stuff about the way he treats underage girls) and mails people I'm friends with , badmouthing me, taunting them etc. During this time, more girls came forward confirming he had done the same things to them when they were underage, and one even saying he had slept with an underager.\n\nThis was incredibly alarming so I brought police attention to it.  Police said I was right to call as this is a concern, and that they'll need to talk to the actual victims to move forward. I tell the girls this and they agree to do that. That marks the end of my involvement. Someone said former friend finds out a couple of hours later , and now everyone's calling me an asshole and posting statuses about me on FB, calling me a liar, accusing me of trying to ruin his life because I'm \"jealous\", mailing everyone I know calling me a liar. The girls' timelines all check out, and the former friend was always *extremely* questionable when it came to girls, so I'm on the fence. Especially after his reaction/the last 3 months. Even though I stated this when defending myself, people are now harassing me via inbox, messaging others etc. and saying I'm wrong for contacting the police and \"butting in and reporting stupid stuff over facebook\". The thing is if I didn't report it, and the allegations the girls were making were 100% true, then I would feel guilty like hell for not reporting it.\n\nPeople are asking for the printscreens, but if he's done this to me, I could only imagine what he would do to his alleged victims so I won't reveal names/reveal printscreens. AITA for reporting him to the police or should I have just stayed out of it? I feel like I did the right thing, but the amount of hate and ostracisation I'm getting is now making me second guess myself. I have severe depression and anxiety and the way people have consistently came at me today is making my mental state worse, even though my close friends have told me I was right to report.",

      "description": "In December, my boyfriend and I had sex and the condom broke. I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My dad and stepmom have 4 foster children, the youngest of whom is 9 and has been with them for about 9 months. I think he's a legitimate phychopath, which is why he has been through 28 homes. I find him very creepy with how he studies things, the types of questions he asks and how he treats those he thinks are weaker than him. His behavior is often disturbing. \n\nI am in my 30's and live 1800km away.  They are visiting my little family for a few days and I have watched him allow my 1 year old to climb up his legs to stand and then kick him down. I've watched him taunt the dog with a toy, and when my dog finally got the toy, he slapped her quite hard a cross the face and called her a bad dog. He actively terrorizes the cat (who recently had hip surgery) and thinks it's funny when she tries to run away from him, but she can't because she's hurt. I have addressed each one of these circumstances and each time it's \"They were being mean to me. \" or \"No I didn't.\"\n\nMy other cat recently passed and he deliberately calls her by the wrong name to ask how she died. This question comes up several times a day and each time I say that she had cancer, but I don't think that's the type of answer he's looking for. Either he wants to know specifically about the death part, or he's trying to hurt me. The way he studies my face when he asks is the creepiest thing I've ever experienced.\n\nHe also becomes very angry at the drop of a hat over perceived sleights like helping to clean a mess he didn't make or a request to help with setting the whole table instead of just his spot. \n\nAITA for wanting my parents to remove him from their lives and the lives of the rest of the kids (who I absolutely love and consider my family, the system be damned). I don't think they can benefit him and I know for a fact he isn't benefiting their family. That being said, I'm not a psychologist of any kind and I don't know what traumas he has experienced. Maybe he really does need them. How can I not BTA for hating on a little kid so much?  I don't even live anywhere near them, how can I even have an opinion on this without BTA? I'm just afraid of what adolescence is going to do to him and I really don't want him anywhere near my baby or fur babies. ",

      "description": "So I've been going out with this girl for a few months now, nothing super serious but we did have a little fling last summer so when we started dating we jumped to seeing each other very regularly pretty much immediately. \n\nWe haven't seen each other in a couple weeks, mostly due to her irregular work schedule, she's a bartender and has been working a lot more than usual recently. That's been a little frustrating but understandable. My real annoyance comes from that over the past couple weeks she's made 4 dates with me, and then bailed pretty close to the date each time. Excuses were pretty much always work related, and I definitely understand having to pick up a last minute shift, or having a really trying day and being too tired to go out. On the other hand I can't help but be unhappy with the situation. \n\nThat brings us to the current situation, I asked her last weekend when she would be free next because I'd like to see her. She responded that she was going to be getting off early on Wednesday and we should go out after. I agreed and planned on seeing her Wednesday night. Wednesday morning she texts me to ask if we're still going out, I confirm and we agree I'll pick her up from work. \n\nLater on in the day she texts me to say she still wants to go out, but she's gotta be home by 10:30. I was a little disappointed because she often doesn't get off until 9:00 or so, but it had been a couple weeks since I'd seen her so I agreed and told her to let me know when she would be off. She assured me again it would be early because Wednesdays are slow. \n\n9:00pm rolls around and I haven't heard from her, so I text to ask if she is still stuck at work. No response. \n\nToday, she finally texted me back over 24 hours later. The text just said \"I lost my phone 💀💀💀.\" I sort of doubt the truthfulness of that, but even if it were true I kinda feel like there's any number of ways she could have cancelled on me. Besides surely bailing on a fifth date in a row, this time with no contact, should warrant some kind of apology. \n\nAnyway I haven't texted her back, and I kind of don't plan to. I had discussed the situation with my best friend, and he told me not texting her back is a dick move. Am I the asshole if the way I prefer to handle it is just to kind of stop talking to her?",

      "description": "First up, on mobile yada yada, throwaway so it can’t be tied back to me, friendo is active on cringe subs and I dunno if this counts so playing it safe, with that out the way, on with the show.\n\nSo for a while now I’ve been talking to this friend online, we’ve become really close, shared a whole lotta shit that hasn’t really been shared to other people, point is, we’re really close.\n\nNow going back a bit, we’ve a history of getting each other games as gifts, typically things we want to play with each other but one or the other of us is in a bit of a tough spot financially, so we nab it for them, never really anything expensive, just more indie stuff, usually $20-30 tops.\n\nNow it being Christmas and all recently I decided I’d get them something special, and I know they’d been wanting to try this game, it was more expensive than our usual sort of game (not AAA, but that sort of pricing), but they’d really enjoyed the last in the series and had been saying they wanted to check it out when they got the money, so I figured why not.\n\nAt the time they didn’t get me anything, but I was fine with that cause again, money, and also I’m really bad at accepting gifts so I sorta refused to say if I wanted anything (though in fairness at the time there wasn’t really anything I was looking into that was particularly cheap).\n\nSo anyway, time passes by and a YouTuber I watch starts up a new series of an older game that I really get into watching and want to play, as it so happens my friend has the game and had been playing it recently, so I dropped a few not so subtle hints about really wanting to play it at some point, to be absolutely clear this wasn’t a demand for them to get me it or anything, more trying to get it in their mind for the next time they were looking at getting me something.\n\nRight now with (most) of the backstory out the way, on with the potential assholery. Recently friendo has been going through a bit of a rough time, and I’ve been trying to help them out as best as I can, and I guess they wanted to reward me (personally I don’t really feel it’s warranted, but I’m grateful nonetheless), and so in our typical fashion they decided to pick me up a game\n\nNow they’re also a frequent watcher of the youtubes, and someone they follow started playing a game very similar to the game I’ve rather unsubtly hinted at, and have been asking what I think of it. I’ve said I think it looks good, but Whilst I haven’t outright said it, I’ve tried to hint I’d prefer the other one (which I’d like to add is cheaper than the game friendo was talking about).\n\nTo round it up, friendo ended up getting me the second game, and whilst I’m grateful for the thought, I’m finding myself disappointed that they got me it instead of the other game I’ve been hinting at for weeks, I haven’t shown this at all to them, and I fully intend to give the game a go, I just wanted a second (or however many people) opinion on if I’m an asshole for being disappointed, and if I’d be the asshole if I kept hinting about the other game after a little while?\n\nApologies for the long post, TLDR:\nFriend who I’ve been hinting at wanting a certain game for a while got me another game of the same genre(?). AITA for being a little disappointed they got me the other game instead?",

      "description": "I can't go one week without my technologically illiterate family members calling me or texting me about their latest dumpster fire of a problem.\n\nI have reset my Aunt's passwords for her email accounts, Facebook and Spotify at least 5 times in the last year. I always make her write down the passwords that she comes up with and she always forgets them. Most recently she decided to get a new phone and switched from the easy to use iPhone platform that she has been using for years to Android and she's pissed that \"My Spotify isn't on here, and they told me it would transfer.\" Spotify WAS on her phone, she's just too stupid to realize she needs to sign into it and as we all know history likes to repeat itself so of course, she doesn't know the username or password.\n\nMy other Aunt can't remember her email password. Doesn't have access to the recovery email and doesn't know her secret questions. Yet I'm the jerk for not wanting to help her sort it out.\n  \nThey always love to say \"But you helped me set up the password\" when I tell them I don't remember it. I don't know in what world a person is expected to keep track of someone else's passwords but I don't live in it, I've got enough passwords of my own to keep track of, not to mention the fact that I watched them write it down last time we reset it. \n\nI love my Dad but how many times can I show him how to switch his Chrome default search engine back to Google before I lose my shit and just stop helping? \n\nIt feels like the only time my family calls me is if they have a question about their computer or phone, and I can't stand it. I work on an IT helpdesk all day talking to idiots. I wish they would just recognize that I don't want to sit and answer IT questions and fix issues that wouldn't be issues if they would just fucking listen.\n\nThis Thanksgiving within 5 minutes of me arriving I'm being asked to look at problems with 3 peoples phones and fix my Dad's web browser again for the 10th time this year. Along with other Family asking if I can drive over an hour to come figure out why their WiFi isn't working right, and to make it worse my father decides to say \"Oh yeah, he can come up with us when we come up to your house for Christmas Eve this year.\" \n\nMy Family doesn't realize that I'm beginning to resent them because the only thing they ever want from me is free IT help. \n\nTLDR: Family is bad with technology, I'm at the end of my rope when it comes to helping them. They never learn anything or make any effort to stop the problem from happening again in the future. ",

He's never been secretive about his struggles with depression and his dark thoughts, but he specifically mentioned that she didn't know he was posting. \n\nHe also had a separate post where he talked about a big falling out he and his father had over the holidays, that was a really personal and really intense account of the situation. \n\nIt was the kind of thing nobody he knew was ever supposed to read.\n\nObviously I'm never going to tell him that I know.

      "description": "We've been married for 2 1/2 years and our finances are almost completely separate. Our Auto insurance is combined to one policy, but we each pay separately for our individual coverage every month. \n\nI got an email this morning stating that our renewal was ready for review. I logged in to check out the paperwork and saw that our rates increased by about $80 a month total.  \n\nI called our insurance company and asked what was going on, to find out that my husband was at fault for an accident back in October. I knew about a large dent in his front bumper, but he told me he had hit a guard rail and it was just cosmetic damage. Never mentioned anything about an insurance claim. \n\nI feel a bit conflicted about how to handle this. Both of our individual rates increased, and we would normally pay for those separately. However,  I think he should cover the total increase since he caused the accident and then LIED to me about it. \n\nIt's not that much money at the end of the day and maybe I'm just pissed right now. We'll have to have a serious talk about the lying regardless, but WIBTA if I ask him to cover the full $80.00 per month increase?\n\n",

However, I got several texts from her asking when we were gonna go out next time, and that sort of stuff, which I've ignored, since I don't want any relationship type shit with her, or anyone really. A mutual friend said she has feelings for me, which I basically laughed off, since Imo, we did the deed, and are pretty much done.

      "description": "Well, where to start? I haven't talked with my mother regularly in two years and I think it took me a lot to get to that point. I guess I'll split this up by major events?\n\n2 years ago, pre-wedding:\n\nThere was a large family event, small-family (less than 20 with cousins and aunts) but the event was big enough to get most of them together, my mother was not explicitly invited.\n\nMy mother was not invited because the person getting married and she had not on spoken in years. It was decided that she would be allowed to act as a plus-one to any member that wanted to take her and basically everyone offered. My mom took to this as being a huge sign of disrespect, not getting an explicit invitation, and chose not to come. Eventually asking me not to participate either. I chose to go because I hadn't seen some of these cousins in years.\n\nThe out-of-town family was staying the weekend so I asked if we wanted to go to a theme park. Everyone ended up thinking it was a great idea. I invited my mom but then my aunt decided to go and my mom blew up. Also choosing not to go to that either. She had made it about herself, as if the theme park visit was about family getting to see her. At this point, I guess she decided she was having an argument with her sister.\n\nSo, I was casually asked to not go. I think a week or two before my mom tried to make plans for the weekend of the wedding to which I think I initially agreed. I think it was spring break maybe summer, I'm at uni hence the title. Once I realized the dates I made it clear I couldn't hang out with her. I think this is when I thought of going to the park and invited her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 years ago, post-wedding:\n\nMost of the family hung out excluding my mother. She chose not to come. I even pleaded for her to participate and it was a constant will she won't she. By the end of it, right as I was driving home, I think she sent a several \"page\" text (it's not really pages on iPhone anymore but you get the point?) maybe saying sorry but it quickly broke down into an argument. When arguing with her it's just so stressful trying to get all these things across and never getting a chance so I got to the point of finally saying alright express all you grievances so I can get my turn. It ended with her saying this aunt raped her with a water hose before I was born. She had never mentioned this and I don't really understand how this was relevant to the situation. It felt manipulative and I couldn't really process anything at all anymore so I told her she needed to leave me alone. \n\nI blocked her from my phone and that's really the only way to get a hold of me. She has my main email address and I never let it get out of control but shes never emailed. I could no longer handle the instability and unpredictability of her meltdowns. I think I had recently told her that and then like a day later a meltdown happened. It was like she was pretending not to hear me and would specifically do what I told her stressed me out.\n\nFast forward 1 year ago:\n\nThere was another wedding and literally, everyone was invited. I hadn't talked to my mother since the last one. I didn't sit with her at the ceremony or the after thing (the dance/ eating/ party thing after the church. I get confused on the terms, sorry.). I got pretty drunk and I think I started talking to her about my 17 years younger half-brother. He's basically illiterate and now aged in the double digits. I think she left shortly after? I know another aunt came over and tried to reconcile differences at some point. Deciding she would mediate but I think she had chosen to fight for my mom so not true meditation.  I know I got way drunk I can't remember much? I don't think I talked to my mom during this time through text.\n\nWithin a week:\n\nI've been doing great! I was constantly a nervous wreck most of my life. I always had terrible acne but I've been getting good sleep and eating well. My face is clear, I make great grades, and I'm making friends.\n\nI play Fortnite with my little brother and he has expressed that he planned on going to graduation. I texted my mother at the start of this semester, my senior year, to start coordinating plans for graduation. Earlier last week I texted her and asked if it would be okay to call, she agreed. The phone call went well. She was acting very nervous at first but I can't really guess why. She was like almost expecting a certain thing but sounded generally happy. I think she thought I was calling because I was like dying or something? I ended up having to hang up because of a quick emergency. So, I texted her back 5 minutes later and said it was good talking to you and said sorry for just springing up out of nowhere to talk. She responded with a massive text talking about how much I hurt her and that she'll remember these things \"until the day I die\" saying she left the most recent wedding early because of me. I accepted fault and said I was pretty drunk. Then it was just text after text of her resaying all the same stuff and not really listening to what I had to say. Similar to the last time we texted and maybe as it has always been?\n\nI recently read a book, the laws of human nature, and I have been considering peoples backgrounds when how they act. I have learned to understand my mother's behavior and I was trying to forgive her. I don't want to act the way she acts. This book explains it is very likely I will fall into the same habits if I don't stay conscious about it. I don't know why I reached out, I guess it's my mom. I want to be able to have a stable relationship.  \n\nAnyway, I asked my mom if it would be okay if I visit over the current winter break. She started sending all the texts about how disrespectful I was and that there need to be rules I have to accept if I'm to see my little brother. Honestly, it has been two years and she had acted cool in the texts earlier this semester about coming to graduation. Well, I didn't like the tone of the conversation so I said we would go back to not talking. She started being whishy-washy and tried to make it sound like it was her idea to not talk? Idk it sounds petty but I think it is relevant to say it was my choice.\n\nPrevious 24 hours:\n\nShe is obviously pissed and was talking about years of grief. When I expressed one thing specifically that she constantly makes me feel bad about she acted as if she was never mad about that and made it seem like it was actually me who was mad over this event 14 years in the past. She graduated from college and moved me into my dads while she lived with the aunt I mentioned earlier. I decided to stay with my dad once she got an apartment and shes always told me how it hurt her and never accepts an apology for it. I mentioned this grievance and she made it seem like she was never mad about me staying with my dad and that she thought I was the one mad this whole time. Like what do I even have to be mad about that I stayed living with my dad?\n\nI decided to uninvite her to my graduation. It is way too much stress. She hasn't helped me with the price of a cheeseburger since I started. She never really makes me feel good about myself. I just don't want to talk to her at all anymore. I've started a new book about surviving psychological abuse and she is a textbook abuser. \\*cue I can see clearly now\\*. \n\nI texted her and I think I'll just copy paste? me: Well, I put a lot of thought into it. I don’t want you at my graduation. I’m no longer interested in maintaining a relationship. You had a lot of terrible things to say and if I ever try to explain how you make me feel you minimize or ignore it maybe you say I have the wrong memory all-together. Anyway, I don’t wanna deal with it anymore. I was really trying to be nice when I reached out, you’re very angry. I think you project a lot so I feel like I sound like you when I’m trying to explain what you do but that’s for you to figure out! Bye I guess \n\nHer: You know what Erick, I’m done with you son. You’ve been so disrespectful and shitty towards me since you were about 11. You’ve got issues, and you need to grow up! I’m a good mom and was a “great” mom to you. You totally don’t deserve me. Thank God I have \\[little bro\\] because if all I had as a reference as a mom and you were my only child I’d probably have shot myself. Don’t contact me again.\n\nSo, grand-finale, my mother just told me she would have killed herself if I was her only son and that I've been terrible since I was 11? Who gets mad at an 11-year-old. She has a social work degree, I would think they tell you it is never the child's fault?\n\nI think I'm better off. I think she's being manipulative and knows full well what she does.\n\nTL;DR  First, I think you need to read it all, I know I needed to write it! Haven't talked to my mom in 2 years. She hasn't talked with most of her family in as long or much much longer. I told her she is not invited to my college graduation and that I don't want to talk to her anymore. She said she would have killed herself if I was her only son and to not contact her anymore.\n\nJust here for the judgment. AMIA?",

I should also add that since I miss virtually every afternoon with my class, I feel substantially isolated from them compared to previous years, and this secret Santa debacle has felt like being kicked when I’m down.\n\nNeither of my parents think ITA, but that doesn’t mean I’m not, was I possibly overreacting?",

Later he said the streamers he was watching were having cash giveaways that required participation to be entered. He continued to watch while he covertly built the kids' bikes in the garage as I had asked, then left to run a last-minute grocery errand for dinner, then came home and went upstairs to watch more streaming. \n\nAfter wrapping gifts, I did dishes and put dinner in the oven, and asked him to turn it off to spend time with me with/without kids. He said no. That the stream was only for today and it is not okay for me to expect him to stop doing what he finds enjoyable just because I want him to do something I find enjoyable. But if I was okay letting him spend $100 on app purchases for this game (same one he's watching) that he'd shut it off no problem. But last year he spent a little over $2,000 on in-app purchases for this game, and after a lengthy discussion, said he wouldn't buy anymore. So I'm not a huge fan of okaying any more money for it.\n\nIt's almost 6pm and says he doesn't know when it will end, but that there are 2 more streamers left. I feel like the evening is almost over and I am so disappointed and feel saddened that he would rather watch games than spend time with me. Am I an asshole for being upset and having unrealistic expectations?",

      "description": " My friend has been completely ignoring my texts as of late, so I finally called her out on it. I don't expect her to reply to every text under the sun, but there have been multiple times where I have initiated a question in order to hang out and have gotten no responses. Once or twice is fine, but for it to happen more than that finally got to me.  I kinda feel like shit, kinda don't once the conversation ended because she agreed with me that she was being rude. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor context, she does have social anxiety, but in the past she has told me that she wasn't up to hanging out because of her mental illness which I one hundred percent respect and understand, but based on her Instagram stories and posts or whatever, I felt ignored. So I called her out on it. She told me agreed that it was rude and it kinda ended with that.  She told me that she doesn't have the mental energy to talk to anyone, but was able to go out of town with someone for a day trip. But I guess certain people calm other people down and I am still trying to understand the different versions of social anxiety because day in and day out it's different. \n\nThe last message that was sent was that I told her a simple message that she wasn't feeling well would've been enough and she just ended the conversation with \"okay\". The last \"seen\" message was me telling her that she can still talk to me if she needs someone to talk to with no response, but that's fine. She needs space I get it. I've probably lost  a friend, but it is what it is. ",

      "description": "This is something I've been in the habit of doing for like two months now, ever since moving to a big city. Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!",

      "description": "Me and my gf have been dating for couple years and living together for half a year now. We get along really well and haven't had big problems. If we did, we have survived everything well. However there's this problem where we strongly disagree: \n\nBecause I'm living in a permanent apartment and she moved from far away with little belongings, I have been generous and we have shared everything we have. Sometimes though I've been little annoyed, for example when she eats snacks I bought and reserved for myself without asking me, or if she just grabs my phone to play with it (even though there's nothing I want to hide from her). \n\nLast Christmas my family bought me a small bottle of fancy shampoo. My gf has a big bottle of shampoo for women. She has a long hair so she uses quite a lot of it. So when I started using the new shampoo my gf just casually asked before going to shower if she could use it. I thought for a while and said no. Maybe I was tired of sharing everything and wanted to have something, even small, of my own. Besides my family got it as a present for me, and I was afraid my gf would use 1/3 of the small bottle on her hair.\n\nShe got angry and stormed out of the room. She spend the next hour sulking locked in a room and when I tried to ask why she's mad she just said she feels uncomfortable if there's something I don't want to share with her and she doesn't want to talk with me.\n\nShould I just share literally everything, even gifts for me, with my gf or is it normal to want to have some personal items of your own in a relationship?\n\nTL;DR: Didn't share my gift-shampoo with my gf because I want to have something of my own, she got mad and will be uncomfortable if I don't share everything.",

I go to bed around 10-10:30, whereas he stays up until 12 with the lights on, playing video games and on his phone. He usually leaves around then and comes back at 1 am, and being clumsy as he is, makes it known thats hes back. He also keeps the room very hot which is difficult for me to sleep in.\n\nAll of these little pet peeves drive me crazy. I really value being able to have consitant sleep and as it is now its very difficult to get that. But, I worry that its my fault for not staying up late and going to parties at night and not living the college life. Am i being unreasonable? \n",

      "description": "Okay, so we have a dog in the apartment and thus lots of tiny hair that ends up on our clothes when playing with it. Hair accumulates on the machine washer's door and i figured that the filter might need a little bit of cleaning. I am living with my best friend in a rented apparent with one more guy. My friend and the other guy lived here before me and in my place lived a girl which I replaced. When i tried cleaning the filter, it got stuck because there were hair clips from the girl in the filter that jammed in between the filter and the washer, essentially getting the filter stuck. I couldn't put it in fully, i couldn't take it out.   \n\n\nThis is where the problem arises. My best friend (we've known each other since kindergarten, now we are 21-22) came in the kitchen and saw me fiddling with the filter and i told him it got stuck for unknown reasons ( at the time ). When he found out, he suddenly started blaming me and shaming me - \"Why don't you ask ME for \\*permission\\* to do things? Why do you do things on your own mind? Why do you think you can do everything on your own? Why do you think you can REPAIR the washing machine by yourself? Why do you think you know everything and can \\*fix\\* things on your own? Why do you constantly brake things that are none of your business? Why do you think you are a mechanic and feel the need to fiddle around? YOU BROKE THE WASHING MACHINE, I DON'T CARE, I WANT IT FIXED! Take responsibility for once in your life, you broke it and STOP complaining!\". Now, keep in mind that i haven't really fiddled with anything up to that point in that apt. I did tell him that its not my fault that it got stuck and i told him the reason why it happened, i followed the manual and i only wanted to clean out the filter which is something normal to do with a washing machine in my mind. I would've paid for repairs \\*if needed\\*, the thing was in warranty too, hell, i would've paid for the darn whole washing machine too.  \n\n\nSo am I the asshole? I only tried cleaning out the filter and it jammed for reasons beyond me.. I fixed the issue by myself and he didn't offer any help. Am i the asshole for \\*breaking\\* the washer and \\*complaining\\* that it is not my fault that this happened ( though i held responsibility to fix it ), or is my friend the asshole for shouting at me and pointing fingers at me and blaming me for absolutely everything possible? I asked my father and he said i am in the wrong since I got the filter stuck and I shouldn't be offended by my friend's reaction.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "First post and I'm on mobile.\n\nThis might be long.\n\nA couple days ago, my friend flipped. She started ignoring us, and left our group chat. She said (after nobody responded to her), \"I guess you all hate me. I'm just going to leave then.\" I texted to ask if she was ok, but she wouldnt tell me what was wrong. She had also been talking about everyone in the group behind our backs. \n\nThe next day, my friend tried to come up to me in school and pretend like nothing had happened. I ignored her, and she yelled after me.\n\nThat day she asked someone to add her back to our group chat, and they did. She starts by saying \"I'm sorry I suck guys. I didnt mean to hurt your feelings. I love you.\" Nobody responded. I thought this was a little manipulative tbh.\n\nShe texts me and asks if she can explain. I say sure. She said she wasn't mad at us, but dealing with her own issues. I said fine. Whatever. I told her it sounded like a guilt trip to make us feel bad. Especially since she talked about how much we all hate her. She says she wanted someone to ask if she was ok because we should care about her. I tell her I DID ask if she was ok. She ignores that.\n\nShe then says that I attacked her by ignoring her? I said that that was playing the victim card. She yelled at me. I say that I would have offered help if she told me what was wrong, and she says that I \"attacked her for needing help.\" We go back and forth for a little while, until she goes onto the group chat that she was added back into.\n\nShe says, \"I know I said sorry before, but you guys are clearly still upset.\"\n\nI respond (in the group chat), \"I know I said sorry before, but you guys are clearly still upset = Its ridiculous that you guys are upset\"\n\nI called her out for manipulation. I said that she was trying to make our issues seem ridiculous and is trying to get us to apologize to her. She was the one talking about us and ignoring us. It's not fair for her to act like it's our fault for not forgiving her yet. \n\nShe calls me a crappy friend and a \"jerk.\" I call her the same. She says its ridiculous that I keep saying that she's manipulative, and I say that that's what it sounds like. I also add that others think so too. (It is actually true, multiple people told me they agreed.)\n\nA second friend and I kick her out of the group chat again. (We use a messaging app and you can do that). \n\nNow, about a week later, she texts someone in the group and asks to be added back into the chat. She says that it's not fair that I am keeping her away from her friends, but it wasn't just me. Anyone could add her back, but nobody has.\n\nI've told our group that I'm not interested in letting myself be walked all over, and people seem to agree. I want to cut her off from the group, but her best friend is in the group too and isn't so sure. So, AITA for wanting to cut her off or did she actually do nothing wrong?",

      "description": "Porn has always been a big issue in our relationship. We have been together for 7 years and engaged for 3. \nToday upon opening my laptop I came across some incest porn. Obviously it wasn’t me looking at this, and it left me pretty shook. \nI’ve known my fiancé likes milf porn and such, but I had no idea he was into THIS. We have 2 two year old girls, so the thought that he has been getting off to stuff like this is really unsettling.\nWhen he got home from work, he could tell something was off with me so I straight up told him that I saw it. He was embarrassed, of course, and kept saying that he “isn’t into it personally,” but I am just having a hard time letting this settle and I keep thinking about it. I haven’t let him change our daughters diapers or left him alone with them at all, which may be an overreaction, but I don’t care. AITA for calling him out, and not being able to deal with this?\n\nEdit to clarify: first off, I am not against porn. I don’t disagree with it or ban my fiancé from watching it, I just don’t personally watch it myself so I don’t understand the appeal. Secondly, I was trying to be very general with my post, but to be more specific by “incest porn” I meant he literally left his reddit up and he is active in multiple incest subreddits. And lastly, I don’t think it was a crazy jump for me to be concerned for my children, because invest is quite literally having sex with your family and my daughters are our family. I have never been concerned about him with our children before, but with this random discovery I deemed it necessary to be that over protective mother for my sweet girls, whether it hurt his feelings or not.

Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I’m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I’m scrolling and I’m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think “oh cool” and click on it. Still reeling from £1 night at the club I didn’t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised “wait that’s my girlfriend”. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn’t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn’t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn’t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn’t then I didn’t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn’t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven’t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I’m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my neighbor to stop calling me three times a day and pop by when I ignore her calls because I'm busy?",
      "description": "A bit of backstory, I'm 22 and my neighbor is in her mid 30s, we are both female but we are complete opposites. I moved out of my parents house to be on my own last year, so it's all very new to me. I'm not assertive at all and I have trouble establishing boundaries. \n\nI became friends with one of my neighbors and she's disabled (she weighs 500+ pounds and cannot walk/stand for long periods of time or drive). I would ask if she needed anything from the store if I saw her and I was already going. Huge mistake. She then started asking me for favors constantly; asking me to pick up her groceries or can I drive her to doctor's appointment. I have very small car and not to be mean, but she would simply not fit. She is very inconsiderate and quite selfish and basically sucks people dry and annoys people until they stop doing her favors. \n\nNow, all that being said, I don't believe she is doing this maliciously. She's had a rough childhood and her mother never taught her how to be a functioning adult. She is heavily dependent on other people. I have come to her with problems of my own. I adopted a puppy and it was very stressful and she's helped me with researching training and she's talked to me when I'm feeling sad/anxiety. \n\nI work full time and on my days off, I like to do nothing but play video games, do laundry, and be lazy in my nightgown. She calls me and leaves me a voicemail to stop being so antisocial and to come down for coffee in the lobby. I tell her that I'm not ready and I don't feel like socializing at the moment. She accepts it and we agree to talk later. \n\nI wind up taking a nap and I get woken up by her calling and I said, hey i'm sleeping can I call you back when I wake up more? she said that's fine, but I'm going to come up there (to my apartment) if you don't call me back in the next 15 minutes. And I'm half asleep and I'm just like yeah don't do that, i'm gonna fall back asleep. \n\n20 minutes later, I hear pounding on my door and i'm like oh, it's probably maintenance and I get my robe on and it's her standing at my door. I hate when people drop by unannounced. Unless it's family or super close friends, I don't want anyone just coming by because I don't feel like talking to the person. \n\nShe said \"I figured you would ignore your phone if I called so I decided to just come up\" and I'm just standing there like wtf? and she just walks right into my apartment and plops down on my couch. And I'm grumpy but I'm drinking coffee so I'm waking up. She tells me about more dog training shit and I'm just like, I've figured out a training solution that works well with both me and my dog. She still makes me take down all this information. \n\nThank god my little pup has to go outside to potty, it's been about 30 minutes that she's been in my apartment. So we leave my apartment  and she says she'll meet me in the lobby when I come back in and i'm just thinking *I do not give a solitary fuck actually*. I let my pup do her business and come back inside. \n\nI notice she has a wallet that looks very similar to mine and I ask her that I have one just like that. And she tells me that she found it on the ground and the ID says **my full name**. And I'm not trying to jump to conclusions so I ask if I dropped it on my way out of the elevator? \n\nShe says no she got it from my purse. And i'm like wtf? you went through my purse? She said that she wanted her food stamps card back because I got a couple things for her the day before at the grocery store. And I tell her \"Why didn't you just ask for it back, it's not even in my wallet, it's in a pocket in my purse.\" \n\nShe just laughs it off and says I love messing with you and I make an excuse to leave and go back to my apartment. I double check to make sure nothing was taken from my wallet but she just wanted to do a \"harmless prank\". \n\nShe called me that same night and I told her I need her to respect my boundaries and not to come over unannounced anymore because it stresses me out to have uninvited guests. She said that she just wants to be close friends with me and didn't really see the problem. Am I the asshole here? I don't want her in my space but she also justifies herself by saying she is just trying to make friends.  ",

I had made everyone aware well in advance that it was going to be a crazy dinner service, and we'd all be kept late.\n\nI come in to find that the other bartender had broken up with her boyfriend of 4 years THAT morning. She's upset and in a state. \n\nThe kitchen manager has already decided to send her home. (He is new to the country and hasn't worked much in restaurants so doesnt realise what we're in for). I repeatedly try to communicate my concerns, I am adamant that she has to stay. We cannot be short staffed, two of the servers are brand new. \n\nI offered compromises such as her solely covering takeout/delivery &amp; answering the phones. She would be completely away from face to face interactions, that way we weren't completely losing a person. Also told her she was more than welcome to take an hour to go for a walk, call somebody, go collect herself, etc. She would not be needed until the rush started. \n\nHe sends her home any ways, telling the girl he's not a HEARTLESS MONSTER, alluding that I am being unreasonable expecting her to stay. \n\nJust a side note, I am female and have worked through difficult situations before. But now he has a total dislike for me because I was adamant that she work. \n",

      "description": "I have a friend whose boyfriend's birthday is this Sunday. I've hung out with him and his boyfriend only a few times, but we're pretty good friends. He texted me saying that he was planning on celebrating his boyfriend's birthday by taking him out to a restaurant and then just walking around the city, but he also said it would be fun if I came along, since the three of us have hung out a couple of times without any problems. I told him that sounded like a good idea.\n\nNow, my friend changed his mind and told me that instead of going out to eat and just explore around and have fun, he's gonna throw his boyfriend a surprise birthday party and invite a bunch of people. I have social anxiety, so I start to feel really nervous and uncomfortable when I'm with a small group of people I don't know. It's not a huge party, it's a handful of people (like 10-12 I think) that all know each other and are close, so I wouldn't be able to just kinda fade into the background or anything. People would notice me not saying anything and just staying in my corner, which would make me feel even worse. I've been in these situations before, and every time I get too nervous to start or continue conversations with people, so I always end up uncomfortable and by myself.\n\nI told my friend I don't really feel like going for these reasons, and now he's upset. So, AITA?",

      "description": "We live in a studio apartment which means pretty much no alone time when both are home. I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.",

      "title": "AITA For disregarding fish tank size?",
      "description": "I am a freshman in college and it's important to find ways to cope with this stress. While I didn't plan it, one of my ways ended up being fish. Specifically my pet comet goldfish. How I got her is important to the story, as I didn't go out and buy a goldfish that, for those of you who don't know, grow to be quite a large size. Instead, I got her through my zoology class. One of our first labs involved fish and when the lab was over, there were about 30 goldfish in need of re-homing. I wasn't going to get one, I really wasn't...but then I did, which I fully admit was an impulse decision as I hadn't done my research first. Long story short, a single comet goldfish requires a tank size of at least 55 gallons for when they're full size. Campus rules say you can't have an aquarium larger than 10 gallons, so I currently have her in that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did my research after getting her and I'm taking as good of care of her as I can. I have everything except a big enough tank that I would happily purchase if I was allowed to have it. She's healthy and I've owned her for a few months now. The fish and fish care are incredibly stress relieving for me, even the tank cleaning is relaxing. There are days when I come home from a long day of classes and stare at her swimming around for hours to unwind myself. This is where I find myself asking the question, \"am I an asshole?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know she will need a bigger aquarium soon. She has plenty of room right now because she's a baby, but she'll grow. Many people on the fish subreddits say to re-home your goldfish if you can't provide the perfect home for them, either to someone else or to a local fish store. However, I do not know anyone who lives off campus who would take a goldfish, and I refuse to leave her at home for my family to take care of, both because I know they won't do as good a job as I do with the cleaning, and because it's not fair to dump that responsibility on them. There is no local fish store where I live, and I have no car to travel to somewhere that does. Even if I did have a store to give her to, she's a 40 cent goldfish, not an exotic fish. They most likely wouldn't take her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion, she's a rescue fish who's getting a better life than she normally would have seeing as she was a disposable \"lab rat\" fish who would have died otherwise. I really enjoy having her and I plan on buying a 55 gallon as soon as I have my own place, and if she were to die before that, I would not replace her since I now know I can't house one correctly here. That being said, I still want an unbiased opinion from people who aren't me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this isn't the typical AITA post, and I hope I don't come across as fishing for attention (pun intended). I just want an objective view on my situation/choices.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to buy a new candle my housemate's dog destroyed?",
      "description": "A few years ago I lived with this girl that had a rescue dog that she had adopted a few years before. The dog was super sweet and super clingy and loved humans. Sadly she did not have a lot of time for him, so she never walked him, saying that he was too old, which I think is complete BS. He only went out in the small backyard to do his business. He spent all his day in the living room waiting for someone to come home and play with him. He also had a lot of energy and was not properly trained, which led to him chomping on everything he could reach. We were advised when we moved into the house that he does this, so I did my best to always keep food out of the dog's reach. He still got into some of my friend's chocolate one time and had to go to the vet. \n\nNow, one thing that bothered me about living with this girl was the fact that she was not very tidy or clean. It was an awkward situation, since the house belonged to the girl's father and was already stuffed with the girl's and her boyfriend's belongings. They owned a lot of toys from TV shows and such and generally their stuff was just everywhere, while I barely ever had a place to put my laptop. \n\nOne time after christmas, I wanted to sit at the dining table to eat and discovered that it was covered in stuff, some of them wrapped presents. I decided to put the presents on one of the chairs, so I could eat at the table. Later in the day, the dog's owner calls me downstairs to inform me that the dog had gotten into the presents and eaten a scented candle and that this was a gift from her parents to her boyfriend's parents and that the candle had to be replaced...by me. Not only did she want me to pay for the candle, which is still annoying enough but whatever, but she wanted me to personally go out right then and shop for the candle, as it had to be there the next day. I was honestly shocked that she wanted me to go buy this candle. For one, she did not know what was in the presents, so she did not put a note on it saying that it might be something edible. Also, I did not feel that it was my responsibilty to replace an item that her dog ate and it is not like she replaced my friend's chocolate when the dog jumped on the counter and ate those and I would've never asked her to because it's ridiculous. Ultimately, I only had two more months living with them though, so I did go shopping for the candle, which of course was a christmas-scented candle and was now out of stock. I bought a similar candle, which the housemate said she couldn't use and offered me to keep it. How generous.\n\nSo AITA for initially not wanting to replace the candle and still feeling annoyed at this girl for this? I wouldn't have done it, but my parents convinced me to just try and keep the peace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR my housemate's dog ate a candle that I had moved from a table to a chair and my housemate wanted me to shop for the exact candle and when I bought a similiar one from the same brand didn't want it.

      "description": "A few months back two of my closest friends got together and dated for a few months before splitting it off. It was their first relationship and things got a little heated between them. The girl broke it off because she felt it wasn't working and the guy started on a downward spiral. It became an obsession of his, the only thing he talked about on his discord server was how upset he was all the time and how its all her fault for not \"trying to make it work.\" Of course I'm his friend and so I gave him my best advice but he turned it down (I suggested he simply move on, i understand being upset for a little while but at this point he became fixed on it) when he refused all advice I, and a few others in our group  had given him he started saying we \"were never there for him,\" and \"if we were going through a hard time he would be there for us,\" he said my neutral position on it was \"unhealthy\" and that I should also be upset with him. His ex, who was also pretty upset moved on and we're still quite close. He blocked me on basically everything and won't talk to me or really anyone. So, Am I The Asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to be friends with my college roommate?",
      "description": "A little background, after my freshman year my good friend and I decided we were fed up with dorms and made plans to move into an on campus apartment for our sophomore year.  We were the first ones to put our names down for the apartment and up until mid summer we were the only ones listed in the apartment.  Well room assignments came around and two random roommates were also assigned to the apartment.  This was no big deal and was something we both saw coming as it was pretty unrealistic to get an apartment all to ourselves.\n\nAnyway, after moving into the apartment Saturday morning things were strange.  I didn't see my first random roommate (we'll call him Mat) until nine at night since he was staying in his room with the door closed.  My second random roommate (let's call him Tim) didn't move in until late Sunday night and made quite a commotion doing so.  The next morning, I saw Mat in the kitchen and we introduced ourselves.  The basics like what our major was, our year, where we're from, etc. in general he's a pretty decent guy and I don't have any problems with him.\n\nTim on the other hand...\n\nI didn't see Tim until Wednesday night when I was in the kitchen waiting for water to boil.  He came up the stairs and I said something along the lines of \"hey how's it going\" and he walked right past me.  No wave.  No eye contact.  Nothing.  He walked straight past me and into his room.  Off to a great start.\n\nI saw him again the next day and tried to start a conversation.  I managed to get a small wave out of him as he passed by but that was it.  \n\nThis continued on for weeks until Mat, my friend, and I had to almost drag him out of his room to fill out our roommate agreement.  During this ,we all agreed to keep the apartment clean, take out the trash as it fills, and just generally be respectful of one another.  Well the three of us did, Tim did little more than sit there quietly.\n\nTo no ones surprise Tim didn't keep up his end of things.  He has a popcorn maker and there are constantly kernels left all over the floor and the trash can will overflow with his microwave meal packages.  On top of all of this Tim gets really into his video games.  And I mean **REALLY** into them.  He stays up late swearing his head off and dropping every racial slur under the sun at these games.\n\nSome of my favorite quotes of his include (if you're easily offended don't click the spoilers)\n\n\"&gt;!Get raped you fucking nigger!&lt;\"\n\n\"&gt;!I can barely understand you go back to your own country spic!&lt;\"\n\n\"&gt;!Don't talk to me you fucking dipshit!&lt;\"\n\nand the list continues\n\nThis finally prompted the three of us to talk to our RA and have a mediation to try and get things worked out with him.  The mediation wasn't very productive but Tim told us he'd do better.\n\nShockingly nothing changed.  Food was still being left on the floor.  He was still stuffing his trash into an already filled trashcan rather than taking it out.  And his choices in language and volume level didn't change.\n\nAbout a month later we go to the housing office to attempt to get something done.  The housing office organizes a SECOND mediation with our RA and our housing coordinator.  This mediation went a bit better and a chore chart was organized to make sure everything gets done.\n\nThings have been relatively stagnant since then, he still yells at his video games but the apartment stays clean.  There's still almost no communication and trying to talk to him feels like cornering a wild animal.  \n\nWell last week I came out of the bathroom to see Tim standing there waiting for me.  He said something along the lines of \"hey... would you and \\[friend's name\\] want to get pizza sometime?\" I told him I'd have to talk to my friend but maybe.\n\nI have no intention of getting pizza with this guy.  He's ignored every attempt at communication and friendship for months now and has been outright disrespectful at times.  I appreciate him finally reaching out but for me it's too late.  So am I the asshole for not wanting to be friends with my roommate after months of him blatantly disrespecting and ignoring me?\n\nTL:DR One of my four college roommates has refused to talk to anyone in the apartment for months now.  He's disrespectful, messy, and yells racial slurs at his video games and is just not the kind of person I want to associate with.  He finally asked my friend and I if we'd want to grab food sometime but I feel like it's too little too late after living together for four months and having no communication.\n\nAlso thank you to anyone who read this novel of a post, this is me trying to summarize four months of hell.  I didn't even include his 7' green inflatable dinosaur, his latex sex suit, or his $300 dragon sex mask.",

I told him helping out with chores around the house and cooking was all he had to do. We came to an agreement only because one we live in Texas and if it gets too hot for him he could have a seizure. Two my job does mandatory overtime so it my be problematic if I can’t drive him to work since I am the only on who can drive(we live in a small city the bus system sucks).

Finally I don’t mind if he has a job cause I would hate to be coup up in the apartment 24/7 like he does, but in the past times he tried it just ended up in the ER because the migraines became unbearable or he had multiple seizures.

      "description": "My kids are not picky eaters, but they each have a relatively common food ingredient that they don't like. One doesn't like cooked carrots and the other doesn't like onions. I don't like mushrooms and my husband doesn't like peaches so to us this has never seemed all that odd. We were at a family function that had a potluck buffet set up and they each opted not to eat certain things because of the aforementioned ingredients. A cousin I'll call Harriet of my husband's got offended because she was doing that \"I made such and such you have to try it!\" thing with some kind of multiple layer dip/salad concoction. It looked...off somehow so I don't think anyone was eating it. \n\nHarriett really tried to push it on the kids and my oldest declined politely, but my youngest kind of froze so she put some on his plate. He didn't eat it and when he went to dispose of his plate she got upset that he was throwing it away. I handled it in the moment by telling her that we don't make food a battle ground and to leave him alone. I freely admit I could have been politer but he's on the spectrum and she's knows this and does moderately aggressive boundary pushing with everyone but especially my youngest in ways that work my nerves. My MIL seems to think I could have been kinder and encouraged him to at least taste it. I think people's plates are their own business. We are not having a fight over this or anything, but I am genuinely curious if my husband and I are missing a key social grace. ",

      "description": "I'll try to put as many details as possible. \n\nI live in AL, USA. In Oct 2015, while I was sleeping next to my newborn, my door was kicked in. I woke up immediately and seconds (felt like minutes) later, one guy enters my bedroom, we lock eyes, he and his friend run. I never saw the friend, but I was able to pick the guy out of a line-up of assorted mugshots. So yes, he has a prior conviction. He was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in Jan 2016. It's now Jan 2019, and I get a call from the district attorney saying he is being put up for parole, the hearing is later this month, and if I oppose him having parole, I should show up and voice my experience for a better chance at his parole being denied. And they were also going to write a letter on my behalf. \n\nSo I go to talk to my SO about my options, and he says I should let it go. Granted, he was at work. He didn't experience the pure fear that I felt. He didn't experience the violation of a strange person in our private home, it disturbed my peace and I still have nightmares about that crack headed man's face. I've also had a friend voice her opinion of, \"oh he's been locked in that hell hole for 3 years, I think that's punishment enough, maybe he's a changed man and just wants to see his family again.\" I don't have any empathy for the man. But others seem too. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting to show up and do my best to have him serve the full 10? ",

      "description": "Three weeks ago my wife unexpectedly (well sort of expectedly) quit her job because her boss was a jerk and they had their issues. Before this we both had been working but I was covering the majority of our bills (rent, car, cable etc) while she was paying for groceries and her student loans (I have none). We share a studio apartment in the city for which the rent is incredibly reasonable and I was ok with this because getting her debt free was a priority. \n\nSuddenly without income on her end I’m paying for groceries and if she remains unemployed past this payment I’m on the hook for her loans since I co-signed them when she refinanced. Obviously this is a bit of stress for me but I have savings and I just got a raise so it’s not a catastrophe.\n\nMy wife has been applying for jobs and I’m empathetic to that struggle because I was unemployed for 9 months after graduate school but I’m more and more starting to resent her seemingly lax attitude. Multiple times last week I came home from 9hour+ days to find her in bed sleeping or with a migraine, she’s always sleeping in and has told me she’s been waking up past noon on more than one occasion, she still wants to go out even though she knows I will have to cover for her, and she’s used my credit card to make clothing purchases for herself. \n\nAll this can be explained away. The sleeping is due to depression and the fact that she needed some new clothes for interviews is something I can believe but when I ask her to maybe do the dishes or clean up the house or some errands we need done she acts like it’s a burden to her and makes me feel terrible for asking.  I completely get that applying for jobs is a full time job but right now I’m doing a full time job + commuting + house chores + taking care of her while I don’t see her making any progress and I’m feeling taken advantage of.  \n\nAm I wrong to ask her to pull her weight? Especially if I’m going to have to cover her student loans next month? ",

      "description": "So I'm a 26 year old lady from the sticks, recently relocated to NYC and still very much a fish out of water. I mention that because maybe my behavior makes a bit more sense in context, but then again maybe not. Anyway: \n\nYesterday I was on a semi-crowded subway car headed back from work. Standing up, headphones in, as is my custom. It's a decently long commute and the whole time there's a youngish couple (guy and girl, mid-twenties) across the way from me, having what seems to be an increasingly heated argument. They're not speaking English but the guy in question is clearly upset, and appears to be the more aggrieved party. I mostly mind my own business. At some point, though, he gets to the point where he's full-on screaming at her. Very public freakout. To the level that a couple jokers actually have their phones out and are filming it and others are sort of hooting and laughing. \n\nNow, the guy's not big but his body language is more than a bit aggressive, and I notice that the lady is actually starting to cry. Soooo... in what I think is an unobtrusive manner, I sidle up to the guy and say, *\"Hey dude, take it easy OK?\"* \n\nI don't touch him or anything, but predictably he shifts the full brunt of his anger to me and starts cussing me out, telling me to mind my own fucking business bitch, etc etc. Maybe not being a dude saved me from a full-on ass-kicking, but who knows. I didn't really try to defend myself, apart from continually telling him to calm down. It's difficult to read the vibe in the car at that point, but I can readily tell that nobody has my back in this. \n\nI get a teensy bit of satisfaction when he exits at the next stop (his apparent girlfriend goes and sits in the far corner), but mostly I immediately feel like a raging douche. Several people give me a sort of eye-rolly dismissive look that indicates they agree. One helpful gentleman politely tells me that doing that kind of thing is a bad move and I really should mind my own business, especially when it's between a couple like that. \n\nSo at present I feel like way less of a good samaritan and way more of a busy-body asshole. I also don't know why I felt the need to step in in that instance when I know I'll be obliged to ignore all kinds of equally disturbing behavior on public transport in the future. As I said, I'm still getting the hang of the vibe here. D'you think IWTA there? ",

      "description": "    So after the World Cup this year I was on a soccer website that had the official match ball(165$, very high quality soccer ball) on sale for 50$ (71$ with shipping and tax) . I bought it and got a confirmation email that they had gotten my order.\n    2 weeks later I was wondering why it hadn’t shipped. I emailed them and they told me they ran out of stock and weren’t going to get any more. They said I could instead get a different ball for the price I paid. So they offered me a 60$(already less than I paid)ball for what I paid(which was of lesser quality). I then asked if I could have a refund instead. \n    Another 2 weeks later and no refund. I email back in and ask if they can just give me another ball of equivalent quality(Another ball that cost 165$) they said no but they can offer me a ball from last year (165$ at full retail price/on there website, but usually around 80-100$ on other sites) for 25% off. Some quick math would reveal that they were offering 41$ off after I had already paid 71$.\n   I was getting fed up at this point and emailed a new person from customer service. They refunded the ball, and said for my trouble they would sign me up for the rewards program (10$ but gives you a lot of discounts from their website) for free. I had to email in one more time after this because the person then forgot to add me to the rewards program. But in the end I did get my refund and was added to the rewards program for free.

      "title": "AITA for getting a second cat?",
      "description": "\n\nI’d been waiting for years to have a cat again, and adopted an older one that needed to be rehomed.  I did not realize the cat was as old as she was when I took her and her age quickly started to show. She only moves to eat and use litter box.  The rest of the time she rests in one spot.  That’s it.  Very sweet cat but she’s like a living fixture in my house. \n\nWhen I was first dating SO, one of the earlier important questions I asked was if he was ok with cats, if we/I could have a cat down the road if we live together.  He said yes.  He said yes because we were newly in love and we were enamored with each other and I badly wanted a cat and although he’s an anti-cat guy he said OK.  I already had a cat, but I know she is old- I’m asking about another cat. \n\nAnd after a couple of years cat discussions came up and he changed his position on cats. He hates cats, he’s allergic (even though I’ve never seen him have an allergic reaction when he’s over at my place with my cat), says cats are horrible and murderous, they kill for sport, cats stink, litter box stinks, they don’t love their people etc etc etc.   And he took back his agreement to have a cat.   He now says NO CATS when we live together. \n\nThe subject of moving in together has come up  and we have been looking at places and without any particular rush are planning on living together, that’s the long term plan. \n\nNext thing I know, my teenager comes home with a kitten.  Now- I didn’t go LOOKING for this kitty. Neither did my teenager who just found it, it was dumped and starving.  So we fed the kitten, knowing we couldn’t keep it but just helping until I can get it to a rescue for her forever home.  I didn’t mention it to SO because we had other things going on and it was temporary anyway.  In hindsight- probably should’ve mentioned it.   ..... SO comes over and learns there is a kitten here.   I tell him the cat is not staying (even though of course I do want to keep her) I’m going to send her to rescue.  He says “No No No No- I know you want that cat your kids are in love with that cat it’s already been here and you guys are attached to the cat. So absolutely DO NOT get rid of that cat because you will be making me the bad guy and no thank you to that. The kids will know it was me who spoiled it and made you get rid of the cat.”  He was piiiiiiissed.  But told me not to get rid of the cat. \n\nSoooooo I kept the cat.   But he couldn’t sleep and was so upset because he took this as a HUGE sign that I don’t want to live with him since he said he wouldn’t live with a cat and now here’s cat that will be around for a long time. When this came up in an argument a month or so later, and I reminded him that he told me to keep the cat that he did not want to be the bad guy or make my kids upset that they had to part with the kitten.  He told me I should’ve known better and that I was supposed to go ahead and not keep the kitty of my own accord, not because he told me to.\n\nGreat when he tells me this NOW, after we are all really and truly attached to the cat and after the cat is very attached to us.  She loves and trusts us very much.   I’m reluctant to even try and rehome her now. This is her home. And I love her. I know I should’ve discussed this with SO more as it’s a big decision that affects us both in the event we live together.  And I do want to live together. I just want him to accept a cat like he said he would.  It’s JUST a cat. Its not a sign that I don’t love SO or want to live together. \n\nNow SO is so mad. He doesn’t want to come over. He’s pissed all the time about me getting a cat.  It’s almost getting worse.  The more he thinks about it, the more upset he is and it’s snowballing into a huge thing.  Also he flat out said he will NEVER EVER EVER live with a cat.  He wants to live with me 100%.  This is not him looking for an excuse not to live together. He does.  Just not with my cat.  \n\nHonestly ..... I love this cat. I really do. It’s important to me.  So important that it was one of the few questions I ask in the beginning of a relationship. Dealbreaker questions.  And for me a cat is one of those questions.  \n\nI understand how he feels.  ***He feels like I chose this cat over him. Over his feelings. Over our relationship.  And he’s very very butthurt.***\n\nBut it’s JUST A CAT.  I get it. He doesn’t like cats.  I wish he would get over it and do this for me.  He wishes I would get rid of the cat for him.   I told him, it’s fine you don’t have to live with a cat.  He said Neither do you.  \n\nI think he should accept the cat because it means so much to me.  Just deal with it it’s not the worst thing in the world. He thinks I don’t care about his feelings and that I should not have a cat because it means so much to him. \n \nAITA?\n\n",

My wife is a stay-at-home mom that sends our kid to day care 3x a week while I am gone.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, our realtor told us a few things that would help our house sell: drywall repair holes from paintings, yard debris, freshen up landscaping, power washing the house...etc. We agreed and three days later, I flew out of the country. I had to remind my wife 2-3 times a week to schedule the power washer (realtors husband) and get drywall repair. She kept telling me she was going to ask our friends for their landscaper’s number. Finally, after 3.5 weeks, she gets people out for quotes, still no landscaper. \n\nNow it’s Friday night and I get back on Monday morning. She hasn’t scheduled any of the services except the power washing. Tonight I asked her about the landscaper and she blew up at me because I was agitated she hadn’t yet schedule it. I explained that companies have multiple customers, and one week before photographing the house and listing it, not all of the repairs or services might get done. She hung up on me and sent me the 🖕🏻 emoji. This is not our first house we’ve sold, and me being away for business is scheduled out well in advance. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I’m 6000 miles away and can’t get repairs quoted or performed while gone, but stay at home wife is mad at me for asking why things aren’t scheduled yet, a week before a professional photographer is coming out so we can list our house \n",

      "description": "Was married 10ish years, 2 children, and I ended our marriage last year. Ex and I both had depression and anxiety at some point (I had pretty bad post natal depression both times and while I'd love to say he was super supportive and caring, he really wasn't.). He was incredibly difficult to live with, has a lot of autistic traits I didn't see in the beginning. I tried to involve him in caring for the kids, attending their appointments, but he had no patience with them and I often had to step in to avoid a meltdown. He did nothing to help keep the house in order, inside or out, despite both of us working and me pleading for help. Both of our children have autism and I believe he does as well. In the end I couldn't take any more, I'd begun to resent him because I felt unheard and unappreciated, more like his mother and maid than his wife or partner. I'm not perfect, I know he felt like I was too controlling and I'll admit that I probably was. Our children thrive on routine and it was always left to me to ensure it happened, my own anxiety was a factor in this as well. I didn't think either of us were particularly happy in our relationship but he claims he was.\n\nI'm in a really good place now, happier than I've ever been. The children have been spending 7 nights / fortnight with him and 7 with me (split into 5/2/2/5, not 7 straight) and they're coping really well with that. He isn't. He is deeply depressed and needs a lot of help (which he is slowly getting but has had to be hospitalised). Obviously the best thing for the children is that they spend the majority of their time with me until he's back on his feet. I respect him as a person and he's a good father. He thinks I'll end up taking them and they won't want to see him any more.\n\nI've accepted the fact his family and our friends (none of whom are speaking to me) think I'm the asshole here. I tried so hard to support him while taking care of the kids and their needs and the house and working but in the end I couldn't do it. He's hurt, and he's having a breakdown that has been coming for years, and I'm well aware that what I did was selfish but it was also self preservation.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

When we initially moved in, I was the sole person who furnished our house, including a wooden dining table, nice rolley chairs, and two nice leather couches.\n\nAbout 6 months after we’ve been living in the house, one particular roommate, let’s say Billy, got a kitten. No one had a problem with it, including me. As time went on, the kitten started growing up and discovering things around the house that it could scratch... fast forward about a month and both of the nice leather couches I furnished the house with are completely torn up with cat scratches all on the back and arms of both couches.\n\nFast forward another month and while I was staying at my other friends house, I come back and see that the wooden dining room table has two legs broken off of it that looked like they were stinted in place by the legs of the chairs as if to hide that the legs were broken off the table. None of the roommates told me about it and I had to ask them about it for them to even admit that it was broken, and I still to this day don’t know who actually did it.\n\nAnd now, in the present, the landlord is gearing up to sell the house and we all have to move out, so I told the roommate that owns the cat that he should pay me for the damage his cat did to my couches. He claims that he didn’t ask for me to furnish the house which makes him exempt from the damage his cat did to my couches. When I told him the couches were there before his cat was there, his response was that I should’ve moved the couches after I saw they were already damaged and that he was still exempt from paying for the damage. He also said that he was willing to furnish the house with cheaper stuff but he never said anything to me about furnishing?\n\nAITA?\n\ntldr; I furnished a house with nice furniture and my roommate won’t pay me for damage that his pet caused, saying I should’ve moved it and that he didn’t ask me to furnish the house.",

      "description": "So, just to preface this, I know I’m the asshole for cheating, I have no doubt about that, but that’s not what I’m asking about here in this post so please refrain from making your judgement based on this. \n\n(Also, please bear with me, this is going to be long, I’m very long-winded, sorry everybody.) \n\nFor some background, I am now 27 and my ex is 30. We dated semi-casually/semi-seriously when I was 16 and he was 19 for about a year. \n\nI describe it this way because we were teenagers, only communicated through texts (infrequently), saw each other maybe once a month (he joined the military shortly after we started talking), and did not have very much in common other than mutual attraction. However, we were “official” and did exchange ‘I love yous’ and talk jokingly but hopefully about having a future together. \n\nHe found out I was planning to cheat on him after he went through my phone and saw that I was also talking to other guys (I never was physically with anyone but I might have been had he not called me out on it and it’s still cheating regardless). When he confronted me, I lied about it, and we broke up right then and there but still continued to date on and off for about another year before we officially called it quits. \n\nI’m not excusing my behavior but I came from a really messed up background — I was in and out of foster care and was severely abused both at home and in the system. Because of this, I was also pretty messed up. I lied about little and big things, stole food and clothing, cheated on people and in school, manipulated others for my own gain, abused drugs and alcohol, was very promiscuous, and all around did not give a fuck about anyone other than myself and my 3 sisters. I was desperate to be loved but not trusting enough to ever give anyone the opportunity, so in order to protect myself and keep my options open because since that’s all I ever learned how to do, I was rarely faithful in my relationships. I was also a bitch about a lot of things but was still pretty submissive and doting in other ways, so I’m sure it was a confusing whirlwind for anyone I was involved with. All in all, I wasn’t the best person, let alone friend or girlfriend. \n\nI feel incredibly guilty about who I was back then and what I did to others. I have worked very hard in my adult life to never be that person again through lots of intensive therapy, medication, getting an education, and choosing to be better and do good each day. I can never take back the hurt I caused others but I have centered my life around making up for my transgressions through other means. I own and operate a non-profit that houses and fully sponsors homeless teens and young adults who have aged out of the system to receive counseling and work towards their future goals, whether that be college or entering the work force. This information is probably meaningless for the purpose of this but I feel as if it’s important to know that my behavior was circumstantial and it is not who I am.  \n\nMy ex and I still talk, we grew up together so he knows my situation, and I have apologized profusely to him over the years. He calls me up crying about once or twice every single year to tell me how I’ve ruined his ability to trust and love others and how hurt he still is. Sometimes he hits me up and is very flirtatious and tries to spark things up again (I always turn these advances down). Other times, if I’m dating someone and he knows who they are, he will antagonize them, insult them, and has, on occasion, gotten physical with them. I never severed ties with him because I always felt like he was justified in his treatment towards me and his resulting behavior because of how I wronged him, because I thought he was amazing and I felt like I was beneath him, and I felt so guilty for messing up such a good thing with a good guy that part of me hoped we’d get back together. \n\nRecently, about a few weeks ago, we were catching up and he started bragging to me about all these things he’s doing (he is very accomplished, has his PhD and has won a lot of awards, and is such an upstanding, good person, he adopted his cousin’s twin boys because the cousin is strung out on heroin, so he kind of deserves to brag and be complimented for all he’s done) but I thought it was strange because we hadn’t spoken in length for years. Then he started bragging about how he hadn’t dated anyone since we had been together, something he does often, even though this is a lie as I know at least three people he has seen and two he has been “official” with. He again blamed me for his unwillingness and inability to get involved with others and started saying straight up bullshit about the times we were together (saying we dated at a different time than we did by several years, saying we were never official and only talked for one month, etc). Then he started coming on to me, demanded I start sending him nudes regularly, and that we be fuck buddies. \n\nAt this point, I just lost it. I started yelling about how he can’t change the facts of things just because he doesn’t like how they turned out, how rude it is of him to always try to use me for sex (something he has admitted to in the past), that it’s not fair he pops back into my life to punish me every few months and that I was done with it, that I had always felt sorry about how I treated him before now but that I wasn’t sorry anymore because he’s acting creepy and pathetic, that it had been over 10 years since all this happened and he should have been over it by now and that not dating anyone in your twenties doesn’t make you some saint like he’s always painting himself out to be, I told him he needs to stop blaming me for his intimacy issues and stop using me to make himself feel good, that he is being ridiculous and that even though he thinks I’m the horrible person it’s really him, and that he needed professional help. I did say I wish I had never hurt him or anyone else but that I was a teenager, raising myself and living in constant fear, and that no one should be judged based off of who they were as teenagers and that he of all people should know that (he also did some very messed up things as a teenager which I won’t elaborate on as it’s not pertinent to this). \n\nHe got really pissed off and started cussing me out and saying that I was a good for nothing whore and that I would never be anything more, that everyone knew what a slut I was and that that no one actually liked me, that I can’t call him out on acting like a shitty person because I am the actual truly shitty person, that I don’t deserve to be happy or loved, that I was an idiot, that he wasn’t immature but that I was for raising my voice and always using slang words (I work with teenagers, it rubs off, what can I say), that I would never be as accomplished him and would never amount to anything, and that he was the best thing that has ever and will ever happen to me. \n\nI rolled my eyes and laughed at him and get kind of snarky and told him I don’t owe him anything, that it was gracious of me to apologize as much as I had but that I didn’t have to but did because I wanted him to know it was me and not him, and that even if I did owe him something it most certainly wouldn’t be my body and that he’s raising his cousin’s boys badly if he believes that. \n\nHe said that since I just put out for everyone and since he’s already seen it all then I shouldn’t be such a bitch about us hooking up or sending him nudes and that it’s offensive to him that I’m shutting him down. \n\nI hold him that the only reason he was mad was because I was supposedly a whore but that I wouldn’t be a whore for him. \n\nHe stormed off after this and then blocked me on all social media a few minutes later. We haven’t talked or seen each other since. \n\nI don’t really feel bad about cheating on him anymore or about how he’s dealt with that (I still know it was wrong). My opinion of him has completely flipped from placing him on a pedestal to thinking lower of him and believing he’s just an egotistical jerk who’s got everyone else fooled (we’re from a small town and he’s very popular here, everyone loves him and thinks he is literally the world’s greatest person, and everyone he meets outside of our town think the same thing). \n\nA couple days after we fought, I started to feel like I am actually in the wrong for being mad at him, fussing at him, and for having stopped feeling bad, and for starting to feel kind of repulsed by him. I know that everything impacts each person differently and I don’t want to invalidate his feelings or belittle them and I know that everyone moves on or doesn’t at their own pace and own prerogative and it’s not my position to say how or when someone does or doesn’t do this. I know that even though I might have seen our relationship as silly and was not really invested in it or him, he may have been very committed and in love and I could have crushed him, so just because I feel one way doesn’t mean he will feel the same way, and I can’t project that into him. \n\nBut truth be told, and to be quite blunt about it, I truly just feel like he’s being a little bitch about it and that he has now wronged me so we’re even somehow. \n\nI don’t really know how to feel about how I’m feeling and keep switching between feeling like I crossed the line and will never be in the right when it comes to him because of our history OR feeling relieved, vindicated, and very appalled at and vexed by him. \n\nI’m just here looking for some unbiased clarification as of course my friends support my side of it just as I’m sure his friends support his. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?

      "description": "I'll try to explain it as best as I can. I live with my dad, stepmom and stepsister M. She's 18 and I'm 20, this weekend we are home with the two of us and she decided to throw a party yesterday.\n\nI went out to a buddy of mine for a smoke sesh and came back around 11 P.M. M was having a girls night and she invited 5 people. I have seen all her friends a few times and I would consider myself to be good friends with M. I greeted everyone and went to my room as to not disturb them further. Was feeling pretty good already but decided to roll myself a blunt and took my bong out for a few bowls throughout the night. \n\nAround 12 the munchies kicked in and I went downstairs to grab some snacks. They saw me in the kitchen and it was obvious they were already pretty drunk. I got dared to take 4 shots back to back and they started teasing me and calling me a pussy for not doing it. Now I was already pretty high but decided to to do it because why not. M asked me if I had some green and I gave them my bong and took a few hits with them. Left the bong downstairs for them to use and went up with my snacks and rolled another blunt. \n\nI was just puffing and watching YouTube in my bed when someone opened my door. It was M and her friend S. They were laughing their asses off and they both jumped on my bed. I was roughly a [9] at this point and was not sure what to do. I asked them how they were doing and all they did was giggle, touch and tease me. They were both in lingerie too. Somebody called M and she left my room but S was still laying down on my bed. Usually she's pretty shy but a real sweetheart nonetheless. That was not the case now and she was barraging me with questions and kept eying me. \n\nLong story short, we shared the blunt I had left and went to watch some Netflix. This eventually escalated and we ended up having sex and falling asleep afterwards. I don't even know if we used protection.\n\nThis morning I was woken up by M who angrily told me to 'wake the fuck up'. She told me she couldn't believe I had slept with her friend and called me disgusting. I tried to apologize but she was having none of it and stormed out of my room. She hasn't talked to me since and acts like I don't exist. I have a bunch of messages from S thanking me for the night and that she loved it but she had to tell M and that she's sorry.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Honestly if I was fully sober I would have never done this but I was not in control. I definitely understand where she's coming from but I don't believe I'm entirely in the wrong here.\n",

Because they're an absolute jerk imo, now. \n\nTheir only argument they've given me about the fucking locked post was because she didn't use a question mark.

We were supposed to have 6+ free throws but were somehow negated by the refs because you cant argue against them or else you get a technical foul. Close fight. We lost.\n\nYeah, I was mad obviously. So I decided to post on twitter. I said \" my teacher probably hired some construction workers and gave them referee clothes fuck you refs\". Thought I was being creative and all instead of just saying something simple like \"refs dumb\" etc. \n\nWent to bed and the next thing I knew was my PE teacher wanted to talk to me. I knew it was about the tweet but why the teacher instead of the ref? I got called into the office and we talked. Apparently the principal saw it and she hates profanity. Who the fuck thinks profanity is taboo? The teacher's ass is getting chewed on by the higher ups because of my mistake. My tweet is also a violation of \"disrespect\" based on the student handbook. Dont know how that was disrespect but I lost one medal because of it. I asked on what the refs were thinking at that time etc. and they just kept defending them saying \"You want me to cancel next year's games?\" \"They are licensed\" \"They dont see everything\" \"We paid a lot\" etc. And they just kept talking about how we should be more respectful and respect the refs because they are licensed and experienced. I dont care if they were licensed or not but they disrespected my game, I \"disrespected\" them. But as a student, I am powerless against people with misuse of power, even if i'm right.\n\nI kinda guess my roast was too good intead of just saying \" dumb ref lol\"\n\nTLDR: Tweeted against ref, pricipal got mad, suspended\n\n",

      "description": "Context: fairly busy, but not overcrowded train I take every other weekend to see my gf in a city. The train ride is about 2 hours long and has 6-7 intermediate stops. There is a woman in the seat next to the bike rack playing with an iPad while her kids are screaming and running around the aisles. All three bike racks are taken up by her stroller (which is folded flat).\n\nMe: ma’am is this your stroller?\n\nHer: *stares at me blankly*\n\nMe: ...\n\nHer: so what if it is\n\nMe: it’s in the bike rack and I need to mount my bike.\n\nHer: *immediately begins getting super agitated and defensive and acting like i had just threatened her* it’s my stroller and I need it why the hell am I supposed to do with it?\n\n*this is the part where I start to question my temper in hundsight* It was a very long day and my bullshit tolerance was at a supreme low.\n\nMe: I don’t care what you do with it. It’s not a bicycle and there are luggage racks in every other cabbin. I will help you move it if this is too much to ask you. I’m not leaving my bike in the doorway where anyone can just take it on their way off the train.\n\nHer: you have no right to tell me what to do! I was here first and I have a ticket just like you\n\nMe: look lady, you obviously don’t give a damn about raising your kids the way you’re letting them run up and down the train and you’re just using them as an excuse to act lazy and entitled. Move the stroller or I’ll find the conductors to move it for you.\n\nShe calls my bluff and I’m honestly not willing to go through the trouble so I just say “fine, relax. I’ll put my bike in the doorway”. She freaks out more and tells me not to tell her to relax and I just shrug it off and sit down in a seat where I can watch my bike so it doesn’t get stolen. She spends the next two stops glaring at me before making one of the older kids carry the stroller off the train. \n\nObviously I was in the right on the grounds of what the rules are, but part of me feels like I could have done better with the last thing I said and prevented it from becoming a scene.",

      "description": "**Some info before hand.**   \nMy friend group enjoys insulting each other for fun, most are actual insults which would normally piss people off, but to us it doesn't really bother any of us. We treat them as over the internet \"play punches\". We have one friend who is one of my Closer friends in the group, who has gone through a tough life, and is the kinda the center of this story. Lets call him **T**  \n\n\n**The incident**  \nIt was a normal discord call between us all, with everything going normally. We were joking around and the conversation drifted to school, and things about it. **T** Dropped out of high school at a young age and because of that, and the fact he lives in Florida, he ended up being mentioned in the conversation. I didn't talk or pay attention during this time (i was playing *Warframe* and blasting music) but What transpired is one playful insult dug way to deep at that moment. I cant quote it but the insult really hurt my friend. Afterword we completely stopped with the insults about real life, with us realizing our insults about the real life dug way to deep in a good amount of the Group.  \n\n\n**Aftermath (And where the issue happened)**  \nWe mostly stopped with the insults, at times we will still throw some joking ones but not at the same level as before, i think all of us feel extremely guilty about the entire situation. But there is still a good friend to us all who will still throw the normal insults. I guess i was feeling pissed off or rubbed the wrong way but this one joke set me off. All of us recently saw a meme about sending people a box of Gummy D\\*\\*ks (gummy bears style but shaped like D\\*\\*ks). He thought it would be Glorious to send one of those to my work. with my name on it. I lost it, \"what if that causes me to get fired\" and all the lot, it was honestly when i look back at it a real massive overreaction. I straight up told him \"no one does those joke any more why do you think its F\\*\\*king ok to do those jokes still!\" and honestly ripped into him. he ended up leaving the server in the end stating \"i cant be here if im only hurting peoples feelings\".   \n\n\n**AITA** for snapping? we never told people outright in the group to stop doing those more realistic jokes / insults.",

      "description": "Basic information: My wife doesn't work and does next to nothing to contribute to the house. I'm the sole source of income and feel our relationship contribution is 95% from me. I was laid off from my previous job and had to get a new one a year ago (making more money), so I'm just now eligible for paid vacation.  I'm a member of an organization that I've been in for just over 20 years and very very much enjoy going to this event I'm going to soon, that I've had to miss the last 2 years.  I've taken my wife with me every time I've gone since we've been together,  however,  she usually just lies around the tent while we're there due to the heat and said she doesn't want to go this year. I invited a gaming friend to go with me six months or so ago who is flying to the US from Norway just to go with me, and have been looking forward to the event ever since.  \n\nHer side: We can't afford for me to go. The house needs work. I'm taking our only vehicle and leaving her without a means to get around.  Her health is not the best. Her mom will be pissed because she has helped us financially. \n\nMy defense:  While money is tight and I will be on a budget, I've gone to this event in the past with less money and we are not going to starve or have utilities cut off for it etc. The house is really old, and does need work, but over the last few weeks I've been renovating our bathroom during my off time with almost no help from her. Her license is  suspended due to a drunk driving charge so she can't legally drive anywhere. A big part of her health issues is that she drinks too much, doesn't take her daily medication regularly, eats almost nothing,  and spends most (like 90% or more) of her time lying down in bed. I suspect she has mental health issues,  but she refuses to see a psychiatrist. The financial support from her mom has -never- been asked for and the biggest chunk of cash ($2000 +)  was to pay off her fine from the DUI. ",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for a year. We've always had a very active sex life, but recently I am beginning to feel like she manipulates me with sex. She'll ask for kisses all the time and she's a very passionate kisser. It turns me on a lot and when I'm into it it's all well and good. However I have noticed that when I'm not in the mood and say no to sex, she'll still ask me to kiss her and she knows that turns me on, even when I just said no. \n\nWe got into a fight because she accused me of not showing her enough affection, but I think she is manipulating me by trying to turn me on all the time, even when it's inappropriate. Even when we have just had a fight or when we're in public, she'll go in for it. I'm getting tired of it and I think she is ignoring my boundaries, and I'm sick of her pestering me about affection when I don't feel in the mood. I told her to back off and now she's mad at me.

They were best friends and ended up hating each other. I still talked to both if them because I didn't want to pick sides. Let's call these people C and R.\n\nC and R both went to a mutual friend's party.  C noticed that R was being rude while the group party was eating. R was on their phone showing another person at the party (J) a video. They both had headphones in. C wanted me to mention this to J so I did. J didn't like this and told R. R told J that I was 'untrustworthy'.\n\n I began to ignore it and bottled it up for a few months until I finally broke down. This meant a teacher got involved because they can't have a crying child in school. The teacher pulled R out of class and we had to have a meeting. R emphasised the point that she couldn't trust me anymore and I pointed out that C wanted me to say it. We left it at that and ignored each other ever since. \n\nThis has left me questioning 'Am I the asshole?'\nSo am I?",

      "description": "About a month back, two friends, my husband, and myself went to a concert together in Manhattan. One friend, \"Mitch\", somehow got very drunk during the concert (we were all drinking, but he was especially drunk at the end) and suggested we go back to his place to play some Jackbox Games. \n\nI expressed hesitation because I had a feeling that if he was this drunk, it meant that he would pass out early. He insisted that he was fine. We talked about getting food before leaving but everyone said they weren't hungry. Eventually, I agreed to go to Mitch's place with my husband, \"Caleb\", and the other guy, \"Rob\". I hailed a cab off the street and then we went to Mitch's place in Queens. Tip + fare is \\~$24. \n\nWe get there and Mitch is alternately smoking (on his balcony) or talking about making Vietnamese noodles. He gives Caleb and I a beer... to split. I'm frustrated so I tell him we came there to play games so sit his ass down and stop talking about noodles. We play approximately two games before he falls asleep on the couch. \n\nCaleb, Rob, and I play another game while Mitch is asleep but they're really much better with four people so we head back to our respective places via Lyft. \n\nThe next day, I get a text (on the group text with Mitch, Caleb, and Rob) from Mitch asking everyone to each pay him $6 for the cab to his place. I sent a text back, \"No, that's part of being the after party host\".  A couple hours later, I get a request from Venmo for $6 (as did Caleb). I send another text explaining that I wasn't kidding, I'm not paying and that if we had gone back to our place, we would've paid for the cab. This dissolves into an \"epic\" text fight where neither of us are understanding how the other doesn't get that they're being ridiculous. My main argument is that he is asking to pay $6 to get home, while Caleb and I would pay a total of $26 to get home ($12 for the cab to Mitch's plus $14 for the Lyft). His argument is basically we split the cab, so we should split the fare. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Additional info that may be relevant:**\n\n* We are all well paid professionals - with Mitch making the second highest single salary out of the four of us (so it's not about needing the money).\n* We regularly host people at our place, and buy all the beer/wine and snacks. We don't ask for reimbursement. \n* Mitch also hosts, but is generally less likely to have beer to share.\n* From Mitch, Rob lives slightly less than a mile away and Caleb and I live about 2 miles in the other direction.\n* I was convinced that I was not the asshole here, but we recently met up with Mitch for the first time after this fight and he (and Rob) expressed total confusion that I thought I was in the right. We're no longer fighting but I wanted to make this post to see once and for all who is in the right. I will accept the outcome either way, and will show the post to Mitch as well. \n* We never paid him the $12\n* I asked my husband to chime in on the text battle and he responded dryly \"It seems like you've got it handled\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Some relevant background information: I have a myriad of health concerns, most of which are joint/back related. Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It affect my stomach and I can't eat certain/most foods. My friends know about my disability because it eventually came to the point where didn't want them to think I'm bailing on them when they invite me to go out to eat. I'm not the type of person that tells people about every detail about my life, disability, financial issue, and etc.\n\nI'm not working because my disability is affecting me 24/7.

      "title": "AITA for not giving my broke girlfriend $2 for a tamale?",
      "description": "This happened last weekend but she's still not talking to me so I decided to bring it here for judgment instead.\n\nMy GF and I (both late 20s) have been together for about a year and a half. When I met her she was financially stable, though I make mid-six figures and she makes mid-five figures. I appreciated that she was frugal (as am I) and didn't waste money on things like trips or expensive meals out or material items no one needs. After a while she admitted to me that the reason she is so frugal is because she grew up very poor and does not have a safety net. Last spring she had an accident that resulted in her being in the hospital for some time and saddled her with a great deal of medical bills. From day one she was adamant that because we had only been dating for a few months, I was not responsible for any of her bills, nor did she even want me to know the financial specifics of them. I was fine with that and we continued as usual. I did notice that she has become more frugal than before and has acted as if she is under more stress, but I honestly thought it had more to do with the accident than anything else.\n\nLast weekend we met up with two of our other friends for brunch. My GF said she wasn't hungry and didn't order anything during the meal and just had a cappuccino and some of my home fries, but we all split the meal four ways anyway because that's how it is with these friends. It wasn't a huge bill but she was obviously annoyed about having to put her card down for it, even though we've all paid our share of meals where we had the smallest item before. Anyway, when we were on our way home we passed a woman selling tamales on the corner for $2 apiece. GF says to me \"Babe, do you have $2?\" I did have cash, but she had literally just sat through a meal saying she wasn't hungry, and I was embarrassed by the way she had rolled her eyes while settling the bill, so I told her there was a bank across the street. She went \"I don't want to have to take out a $20 just for a two dollar tamale,\" and I told her \"Fine, don't get a tamale then.\" She got really quiet and went \"I'm just really hungry,\" and I kind of snapped at her and told her that she should have ordered something at brunch instead of just eating my leftovers. Then she told me that she has been \"food insecure\" over the past few weeks because of her medical/credit card debt and that she didn't have the $20 in her bank account to take out because she had to pay at brunch. She said she hadn't told me about any of this because she \"knew\" I would judge her for not handling her money more wisely, started crying, called me an asshole, and walked off. I haven't spoken to her since it happened on Sunday.\n\nI don't think this is fair for a number of reasons, the biggest being that I'm not a mind reader and wouldn't know anything about her finances because she expressly told me her medical bills were none of my business. I highly doubt the \"food insecure\" claim, but either way, she has been way too eager to let me pick up the bill when we go out to eat over the past couple months (even though at the beginning of the relationship we always split it evenly, or she'd pay if she ordered the more expensive thing). She makes a salary and I have no reason to believe she can't afford food to eat, so I'm pretty sure this is a guilt trip situation. But like I said, she hasn't spoken to me since Sunday and it's Thursday morning, so I am looking for an objective opinion: am I the asshole for not giving her tamale money, or does she need to realize that she can't keep mooching off people just because she's in debt?",

My parents were not in the room at the time, but when they saw the bus driving away without me they got angry I didn't get on. I explained to them that the bus didn't stop, so it wasn't my fault. They started yelling saying ¨I can never see my wrongs¨, ¨I should have been waiting outside¨ (keep in mind its like 10 degrees), etc., etc. \n\nI guess I could have been waiting outside, but I've been doing it like this since last year, the bus driver knows what to do.

      "description": "My sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm gonna try to keep this short but basically I (19) broke up with my boyfriend (22) of 10 months (my first relationship, his 7th?ish but longest) and I did so while referencing a list that I'd wrote; the list including how he'd been taking out his anger at other things on me and would just say \"yeah, sure, fine, you're right\" when I showed him proof that I wasn't doing the things he said only to bring them up later, it included the 3 times he didn't stop when I said no, and how he kept pushing me to do sexual things when we agreed that we'd stop because I didn't feel able to say no, an incident where he'd left me alone at his parents house (an hour away from mine) after promising he would help me move out of my parents that weekend because he spontaneously decided he wanted to go to their cottage, gave me 3 broken toes, a concussion, and a black eye accidently by doing unnecessarily dangerous things to me, or just straight up ignoring my wellbeing for his own comfort, refused when I kept asking him to get help for his problems, finally culminating in a month where he told me he didn't know if he wanted to be with me wherein I didn't sleep and had dozens of panic attacks a day because I'd become so isolated I thought he was the best, or the only thing, I'd ever get. The last straw for me was finding out that during that month he'd begun relentlessly flirting with other girls on social media, whether they were interested or not, and was taking another girl on dates near identical to our first dates, all while burying any posts of me under his woodworking and not telling any of them I existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, as for why I wrote it all out; any other time we'd fought, he would yell and throw things I'd end up so exhausted from the flashbacks and panic it caused, he'd have a panic attack and I'd drop everything to take care of him even though he never stopped yelling or physically intimidating things, and I'd give up. The next day he'd promise he'd try to do better, and make me laugh and smile even though nothing had been solved. I didn't want to give in without having fixed anything this time so I wrote out the points I wanted to make on my phone and read them off my phone. I wanted him to realize everything that he'd done. I wanted him to never do that to anyone else. I wanted him to realize he needed help, and get better. To be completely honest, a part of me wanted him to try to make it all up to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not proud of how I handled the breakup, I said a few things I regret (told him to rot when he asked me not to end it), but I agreed to be friends with him like he asked me to. Then, he changed his mind, so I said goodbye and he asked why it had to be \"this existential\". We've fought twice since the breakup and every time he says something like \"why don't you send me the essay you wrote about me being a terrible person and I'll go over it with my therapist\". (I know I shouldn't have kept talking to him, but I really wanted to help him get better). I recognize that the list was definitely weird, and probably a Bit Much^(TM), but am I an asshole for what I did?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: wrote out a list of reasons I was breaking up with my ex because I didn't want to give in without getting it all off my chest and without solving anything as usual, AItA?**",

The other day I notice that I've had about four missed calls from my flatmate (lets call her Sarah) and a message asking 'Are you in?'.  So, I message her back asking what's up - theres no reply after so I put my phone back down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout an hour later, my other flatmate finds me in the kitchen and starts to shout at me because \"Sarah has been locked outside in the cold for an hour!\". Obviously, at first I felt really bad thinking she had forgotten her key. However it soon transpired that she had returned to the apartment with far too much equipment (we're film students and often book out loads of stuff for shoots) to carry herself and didn't want to abandon anything to make trips. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter hearing this I tried to argue that Sarah's choice to be dropped off outside with all the equipment has nothing to with me.  She hadn't planned for me to help previously and as aforementioned, she didn't even know if I was home. Meaning she probably knew while getting dropped off that she might be stuck outside for an hour. Why didn't whoever helped her carry it to the flat also help her get it upstairs? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I had known of course I would've helped her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I walked into the kitchen the next day to find them talking about me and we all proceed to have a big old argument about it all and we haven't spoken since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n ",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to give my grandma's friend information",
      "description": "Hubby and I moved across the country to help my mom with my grandparents (shopping, doctor visits, etc). My grandmother has alzheimer's and it's still in the beginning stages, which makes dealing with her a little difficult. She's in her late 70s and refuses to be told how to live, even if it's good for her health. Because of insurance changed, we have had to change their doctor a couple of times. Her last three doctors have told her that she's diabetic, but she refuses to believe it and continually sites the doctor before them saying she's \"borderline\" only. She's actually gotten into full blown arguments with my grandfather, my mother, and myself about the fact that she has to take her medication as prescribed and the fact that her diet absolutely has to change in order to keep her healthy. I have even gone so far as to threaten her with a home (not that I could ever follow through with the threat, I was just grasping at straws). My grandfather is and has been ready to be put in a home for over a decade because he does not want to become a burden to anyone. My grandmother, on the other hand, refused to talk to me for almost two weeks just for mentioning it. Then, about eight months ago, a friend of my grandmother's moved back into town (she had been living with her son and hated it). She's on the list for section 8 housing, but jumped the gun and moved into my grandparents' house. From what my grandfather was told, she would be there two weeks, she was there three months and only left because she had to (my uncle was coming into town and my grandfather told her that they needed the space). She still takes my grandmother out all the time, and while they are out she borrows money from my grandmother with no real repayment plan in place. She also comes over a few times a week to eat dinner, completely uninvited. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomewhere in the mix of all that (about three months ago), my grandmother started calling on her friend to take her to the doctor. I would show up to take her to appointments only to find out that she was already gone. Or I would find out, after the fact, about her going to an appointment that I didn't even know about. This is especially problematic because her friend doesn't tell us what's happening and my grandmother doesn't remember everything or just refuses to tell us about her appointments. When my mother confronted my grandparents about it, they responded by saying that I'm unreliable. Which blows my mind because until this started happening, I was always the one taking them to their appointments without fail, and I am still the one that takes my grandfather to all of his appointments. Of course, asking them how I can be considered unreliable when I don't even know about the appointment gets met with silence. So, we've officially told my grandmother that she is no longer allowed to go to the doctor without me or my mother, on at least four separate times now. I even went so far as to call her friend and tell her that she cannot take my grandmother to any appointments. Like, I don't even care if you take her shopping or whatever. That's between you and her, but no more doctors. That's my job. That was two weeks ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week, my grandmother had outpatient surgery. Her friend went with us because my grandmother had no idea where she was supposed to go and I wasn't involved in any of the planning for this surgery. There was a mass removed, which had to be sent to pathology. I set up the appointment for the results. I also set up an appointment for my grandfather's dermatologist later on the same day. That day is Monday. I woke up sick as a dog on Friday, but I have been forcing medication down my throat to get myself well enough over the weekend to not have to ask my mom to take time off work for this. Well, midday on Friday, grandma's friend calls me.  \n\n\nFriend: Hey \\[my name\\]. I heard you had to go to the Social Security Office on Monday?\n\nMe: No...?\n\nFriend: Oh, well, your grandmother's appointment is on Monday. At what time?\n\nMe: Why?\n\nFriend: So that I can go.\n\nMe: Why?\n\nFriend: \\*mumbles\\* Okay. Okay. Talk to you later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother comes home later on, from being with my grandparents. She caught my grandma attempting to make plans with her friend for Monday. Her excuse is that I'm sick and I won't be able to take her. I'm at the point where I want to call her friend and reiterate that she is not to take my grandmother to the doctors anymore. Am I being unreasonable here?",

      "description": "TLDR at bottom\nBackground: I’ve known my ex (J) since 2013.\nI currently pay rent and live with J’s mum, J’s step dad and J. J and I are still best friends post breakup.\nJ’s family has had this dog for the last 8 years, and for the last 5 years it has always shit and piss inside the house and none of them bothered to retrain her.\n\nJ’s little sister (R) moved out Easter 2018. Occasionally she comes back to stay for a few days.\n\nR shows up out of nowhere unannounced, and sends a Facebook message to myself and J saying:\n“Idk if you guys are here but I'm at home in town tonight and until Fri or Sat”. \n\nThen starts the problems. \nSpare bed upstairs isn’t made, she complains to us that it isn’t made. R is 21 in less than 2 months. She lived in this house for 4 years before moving out. J tells her to make the bed.\n\n20 minutes later R says:\n“Also do you guys not know how to pick up dog shit and air out a house. That shit i just picked up looks like its been sitting there for days.”\n\nJ and I had spent 2 hours cleaning the entire house, and there was no dog shit there at 8:30pm when we went to bed.\nI have always in the past just let her walk over me. I decided enough was enough. \n\nMe: “Jfc R we’ve been in bed since 8:30 which is more than enough time for her to shit\nThe house has been open every day, if you have a problem remember she’s YOUR family dog”\n\nR replies:\n“The shit was white and crusty it did not just come out of her ass, hence why I made the comment \nNo need to go off on a tangent and be rude.\nYou literally haven’t even seen me to say hi and you’re already having a go at me when I’m literally not even mad?\nHOME SWEET HOME HEY!\nRemember who’s house you’re actually in”\n\nMy reply:\n“Well it wasn’t up there when we went to bed.\nYou were the one being rude R, “don’t you know how to pick up dog shit and air out a house” is pretty fucking rude, and I’m not putting up with that shit.\nSorry for not getting out of bed at 10pm to come and say hello? \nTemember that it’s you MOTHERS house, NOT yours, and I pay RENT to live here, which means I’m entitled to be here”\n\nR replies:\n“It’s called sarcasm darl \nStop trying to fucking argue and prove a stupid point haha\nThis is literally so dumb, come talk to my face if you have further irrelevant &amp; petty shit to say”\n\nMy reply:\n“Hmmmmmmm or you could’ve just dealt with it and been an adult about it\nI don’t need to prove anything, you’ve done that yourself.\n“Remember who’s house you’re actually in” ?\nThink you’re the one being petty R, wake up to yourself.”\n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR; my ex’s little sister (21) came to her parents house where I currently live and pay rent and ex lives here too, proceeds to complain about dog shit on the floor which wasn’t there when we went to bed, I call her out that it’s her family dog then call her out for being rude and petty after she tells me “remember who’s house you’re actually in”",

I’ve talked to him a bit just to see what he’s like I suppose and he wants to get to know me more but like, this is a lot. And I’m already going through a lot on the side. Even if I wasn’t, I don’t really know how I feel about talking to him because I’ve grown to resent him for making a kid and then just ditching . Like wtf, furthermore he made his G R A N D entrance to my life.... on *FACEBOOK* \nFacebook. Because messenger is where you have all the life changing, reality shattering conversations.\nAll these things combined make me not want to talk to him or let him in my life but I feel really bad about that because he genuinely sounds apologetic about leaving . \nI just don’t really know what to do and I want to know if I’m being an ass by not forgiving him or something. \n\n(Sorry if this was confusing I was kinda panicking about it and sorta just word vomited about it)",

      "description": "To start, I don't use facebook. I think I made 2 posts in the last year, neither of which were important at all. I don't even log in. Almost missed a graduation party because the invite came through facebook, luckily I ran into the person before it happened. I don't like social media, I don't like my life on display, I have like 100 friends on there, it's pointless to me, along with IG, Snapchat, etc. I don't use social media. I'd rather live my life in the moment and enjoy the time and effort I put into the relationship instead of hearing what other people think.\n\nSo, she asked if I would post a pic of us and I said I don't use facebook. she's my friend on there, but again, that means nothing to me. She got all upset and was trying to force it down my throat, but I stood firm. I don't post to facebook and I don't need validation from people online.\n\nShe talked to her friend and her friend, who gets upset when her on/off boyfriend adds girls to facebook all the time, chimed in that I'm immature and she should dump me if I don't \"Claim\" her on facebook. I think this is petty. I explained I spend 4-6 days a week with her, our kids hang out, we crash at each others places all the time, we go on road trips, we're planning a trip to Europe this summer. It's not like I'm hiding anything and I don't want/need validation from people. I don't show off, I don't brag, it's just how it's always been with me. I don't even post pics of places I go. The important people in my life know, I've sent them pics of us together and that's it.\n\nHer son can't get off snapchat and constantly lies and advertises that he's drinking underage and using drugs (another story, it's being worked out). I just don't like putting my life on display.\n\nI said I'm not changing my mind on this, facebook doesn't define my relationships and if she wants to end it over somthing as petty as this, then go for it. Her friend is already telling her to end it, which taking advice from here is backwards since she is dumping/getting back together with this guy all the time over stupid stuff. I think this is more an insecurity thing and at this age, shouldn't be. This is high school drama to me and is unecessary.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. ",

      "description": "Okay, I'll do my best to make this brief.\n\nI recently found out I will have to go to Wisconsin for some medical reasons unimportant to the story. For years, my friend and I have \"game shared\" on PS4. This allows only one copy of the game to purchased but it can be played on two consoles. So my friend and I, trying to save some cash, decided to buy a bunch of (digital) games through my account but split the price because his PS4 would get the game as well (gigantic mistake). The issue with \"game sharing\" is that the PS4 games we bought cannot be played offline on my PS4, but they can on his. With my trip coming up, I will be offline for a few weeks and would like to play my games during that time. If I were to un-game share (which I don't need his approval to do), all the games we split the payment on would be unplayable on his PS4, but playable on mine. We split the price of almost all the games, so he spent money on them as well as I. WIBTA for rendering his games useless so I would be able to play?",

He told me that seeing all his classmates score higher than him in exams made him had less confidence in himself(he’s depressed because of it if I remembered correctly). Being me, I pondered on this thought for awhile and came up with a solution.\n\nThe week after, I sat beside him in class and asked him mostly the questions that were kinda hard. My best subject was Maths but that was also his worst.  I asked him questions after questions. If he explained it to me wrongly I would know and did the ‘but i though u need to do this first’. I can see why Maths was his worst as he had no passion in studying it at all. I lied to him about how i cant study at all and barely passed everything. After I mentioned that, he said that he is glad to have a friend that is not as smart as everyone else and on par with him.\n\nLong story short, I scored above average in the mid-year exams while he barely passed. He got transferred not long after due to family issues. We haven’t got intouch since. Im just wondering if I did the wrong thing or not.\n\n(I know this story is kinda WAY out of league with other AITA stories but this thing has been on my mind a lot and i wanna lift the burden off my shoulders by sharing this with others and reading take on this story.tqvm)",

For example, he once got her a bath robe and had us give to her while saying that it was a gift from all of us. I didn't really have a problem with this, but now that both me and my brother are older and have our own sources of income he keeps telling us how we have to get our mom separate gifts on Valentine's day, then again on her birthday on the 21st.\n\n I didn't really think about it too much until this year. When I asked my dad why he expected us to do this he completely blew up on me, he told me that I was being cheap and didn't love my mom enough to give her two gifts. He kind of made me feel like an asshole and when I mentioned it to my brother, he told me not to think about it too much. At this point, I honestly just feel confused, is what I am saying justified or is this normal and I am just being an asshole?",

      "description": "About 2 weeks ago I had a party for my mom and I invited my best friend, we can call her Candle. So I invited Candle and she told me that she would be there. Fast forward to the day before the party, her and I are hanging out and I asked her what her plans were for tomorrow she mentioned everything but coming to my moms birthday party and when I brought it up she said nothing, but “oh okay.” So I assumed alright she might not be coming, whatever no big deal. \n\nThe Day of the party I have family asking about Candle wondering if she was coming, not really having an answer I decide to text her “hey are you coming tonight ?” I didn’t get a text back for the rest of the day. Later on that night though she post a Snapchat story of her with her other friends getting ready. Now at this point I’m drunk and a little hurt and reply back to the story about how I couldn’t get a text back. She opened that and never replied back for the rest of the night. \n\nNext morning I wake up and she text me saying, “sorry I couldn’t make it but HMU after work and I’ll smoke you out fat.” I’m sorry but to me that isn’t an apology. I didn’t respond back to her for a few days she tried calling me and I really didn’t want to even answer so I didn’t. I did what she did to me I ignored her. A week later I decide to talk to her and see if she says anything maybe even apologize in person. Guess what? she didn’t. I’m the one that had to bring it up and all I got out of her was “Yeah I fucked up,” and “you caught me while I was faded” those aren’t apologies and she obviously didn’t see it as a big deal so I left it at that and I left knowing that I don’t want to be friends w a person like this. so I took her off my family sharing which we had Apple Music together. Later that day she notices and we have an argument and our friendship had ended. I just wanna know am I the asshole in this? Should I have just let it go? I’m willing to share the screenshots of our argument so you all can get a better understanding of that as well. ",

I repeatedly told him let's reschedule when I should come but he refused to do that, and eventually sent me his aunt's number telling me to tell her myself nexuses he's sick of being a \"messenger\".\n\nWe're long distance but he usually drives 6 hours north from Missouri to visit me every few weeks since he's in graduate school and I work full time. I've only visited him once via plane so I know this makes it look like I don't want to bother visiting him ever...I explained my reasoning with the weather, and his parents, but he wouldn't listen.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Context: Myself and three friends of mine were planning to go to a basketball game on Sunday(yesterday) night. We had planned in on Tuesday of last week (Election Day), and I bought all the tickets then. Everyone paid me and what not things are all good. A little more context: I'm on the quarter system at my university, so this week is pre finals week/finals week and the week after is finals week. So Sunday arrives, game is at 6pm. We all kind of preemptively set 4:45-5:00pm as the departure time. 4o'clock rolls around and one of my friends texts us saying he isn't feeling well and has a lot of HW so he sold the ticket to one of our mutual friends; nbd because I like the guy and he's pretty chill. I come downstairs (we all live in this \"house\" on campus thats for like 30 people so kind of frat style but it isn't a frat) at 430, after finishing up studying to ask the other two how soon they want to depart. They both then look at each other and say sorry they don't want to go, they have a lot of homework.\n\nAt this moment I just become pissed because this is literal last minute cancelling and I essentially bitch at them. They say its not personal and that they just have homework to do and that they just don't feel like it. Plus, \"its finals week, cmon man\". This is all in the commons room and a bit extra people are there, like 1-3 who aren't involved, and I essentially tell them that they are giving me a big fuck you by cancelling last minute. I kind of go on to abscond them for a minute about how this is just bs leaving me because you couldn't get your shit together. My rationale is that not only was this planned Tuesday, but we all know our workload in advance so its not a shock like there was a lot of work this week. Secondly, we were all watching football downstairs that day, but I left for three and a half hours to do homework in leu of going to the game. And now I'm being called a child by my roommate (was one of the ppl that was going) and that I'm overreacting to something that wasn't personal.\n\nI understand that it isn't personal, but I'm still upset about it because they are my friends and they couldn't go because they couldn't plan ahead. \n\nI talked to my dad about this and he says that people just do this, that people look out for their own self interests and that cancelling plans last minute happens all the time. So AITA for calling out two of my friends?\n\nAlso just for closure sake: I went with the first guy, and invite two other dudes in the house I wasn't friends with particularly, but just wanted to not waste the tickets.",

You might hear a bit more stomping than usual. Also I would like to ask if it's possible for you to avoid doing any noisy activities such as using the washing machine, hoovering or using the bathroom fan during this time? Sorry to have ask you this but the sound will be picked up in the film due to the lack of sound insulation. We should only be filming from around 2.30-4pm. Hope this is ok. Thanks\n\nMy response:\nI dont want to be an issue but there needs to be more notice.\nI know how film projects go. Do you think it is likely you will be earlier than 230 or later than 4?\n---\nSo I am left wondering what to say next. Do I just agree?\n\nI do not like the short notice nature of this. I do not want them to make me an after thought. My gut says do not be an ass but I know filming usually goes over what you plan. Maybe they won't but I do not feel like they asked, just informed me I needed to be quiet.\n\nTalk sense to me reddit. I do not want to be an asshole but I also do not like being dictated to.\n\n",

I would visit him on weekends but as I got older, visits grew less frequent. I even remember him not showing up to my highschool graduation. Around 10 years ago he married another woman and has 3 kids with her now. I'm 22 now, in school full-time and working part time, still living with my mom. \n\nAs time went on, I would often forget to text him and he would never really text me, except maybe once every four months. He lives ~3 hour drive away and I don't have a car, or alot of money/time to take the train down to visit, and the one or two times I do visit every year I'm met with \"why do you never come visit\". \n\nThis is where I begin to wonder AITA because I'm done with making every effort and only being met with complaints about why I never visit. My siblings there even call me a \"ghost brother\" which kinda hurt me to hear. Meanwhile every time I ask to meet up halfway (they have a car, and don't work weekends...) I'm told to just take the train down and see them. I just think of it as a two way street and if they're not making any effort, why should I? \n\nThis is a big deal for me even though it may not seem significant because I have anxiety and I'm already stressed out enough about putting myself through school. It's always gnawing at the back of my head like \"shit I should really go visit ...\" but I just hate confrontation and hate how they have no sympathy for me trying to get an education. ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I started dating about 6 months ago. For the last 5 months, we have been in an exclusive and serious relationship (he basically moved in with me). About 2 months ago, he let me look at the photos on his phone so that I could send myself some pictures he had taken on a recent trip together. Apparently I scrolled up a bit too far because I found that shortly before we went on this trip, he had taken several close-up shots of his ex's ass in tight sweatpants as she was laying on the ground playing with the 4 year old daughter they have together (he sees his daughter and ex about 4-5 times week as they have shared custody). \n\nWhen I confronted him about the photos and told him how much it hurt me to find out that he would look at another woman that way and would go as far as to take pictures of her body even though he is in a committed relationship with me, he barely acknowledged my feelings. When I asked him why he did it, he said it was \"hard to let go\" of his ex (she was the one who left him).\n\nHe basically showed no remorse about the photos, and said it doesn't mean anything so he has nothing to apologize for. I know they have a history together, and he promised me that the only reason he sees his ex is because they have shared custody of their daughter. However, I am his girlfriend now (he pursued me, if that makes any difference), and it bothers me so much that he did this. We have a great sex life and he always tells me he is very attracted to me and loves me, but this incident is starting to make me question our entire relationship. It really makes me wonder what else he does behind my back.\n\nAITA for getting upset at these photos? I am sure he wouldn't physically cheat and FWIW his ex basically wants nothing to do with him aside from their responsibilities to their daughter, but I still feel like he is being unfaithful to me.",

      "description": "So... we're in grad school and currently taking a dance class together (along with 2 other friends). \n\nThis guy man. He is relentlessly trying to spend time with me, even after he rejected me. I've been trying to distance myself from him as best I can without ruining the friendship, but it's been hard.\n\nHe asked me to hang out on Monday, which I said no to. He asked me on Tuesday, which I said yes to since I had to be on campus anyway for the dance class. We spent 4 hours together and then went to our dance class. \n\nHe insisted on us getting there at exactly the right time and going in together. I told him clearly I wanted to get to know other people in our class. \n\nWe did. We warmed up next to each other, but then I moved away from him a bit. When it came time to choose dance partners, I chose a random guy who was closest to me.\n\nAfterwards, he told me he wanted to dance with me. I didn't want to say why I didn't want to dance with him, but I did say that we switch dance partners each class, so it wouldn't be a big deal. He told me \"you had to look at me before you looked at him, and you still chose him. We walked in together so I expected us to dance together\"\n\nI just don't get this guy at all. AITA for not dancing with him? ",

      "description": "I've been with my boyfriend for 1 and a half years.  My bf is kinda the typical frat bro and honestly nothing from the outset screams anything but heterosexual, so when we started dating I assumed he was straight.\n\n About 6 months in he mentioned that he had a \"bate buddy\" in college, so I replied \"oh who was she? Did you date\" and he just laughed was like \"it's not a she\". I'm bi myself so it wasn't a big deal at all to me, but I definitely was shocked so I told him I didn't know he was bi, to which he laughed and said he was \"100% straight\" and it was \"just a guy thing\". I obviously thought it was an odd excuse but I grew up with all girls so I don't know much about guys so I just left it alone.\n\n\nSo shortly after that we were having sexy times and he wanted me to describe my past romps with woman, so I ask him about his past \"bate buddies\" and he gets really quiet and admits that sometimes they went further than just masturbating beside each other and goes on to tell me that he's done just about anything you could think of with another guy a couple times. So I made a lighthearted joke about it; something along the lines of \"should I be worried another guy is going to take you away from me\". He didn't get mad but I could see he was a bit upset by it and just kept saying that he's straight and he was just experimenting but he doesn't have any interest in guys. \n\nSo today I ask to use his phone to quickly buy something online because mine broke so when I opened it I'm greeted by gay porn. He snatched it out of my hand and laughs but was obviously embarassed I say to him that they're is nothing wrong with being bisexual and I don't care if he watches that type of porn. He just kinda blows up and insists he's not bisexual and that he's tired of me trying to say he is. I really really tried to explain to him there is nothing wrong with it and I'm nit trying to but labels on him but I think he should just accept it if he's okay. But he just got even angrier ans stormed out.\n\nI feel super bad about it but I honestly just want him to be comfortable with who he is. I used to deny I was bi so it's a bit personal to me. I also think that the reason he won't admit it is because his dad left his family for another man so I think it might be some internal hostility (even through they have a very good relationship now)\n\n\n\n",

We are in the process of trying to split our finances/debts/things up (luckily we are both young and our only real asset/debt is our house). We have been together for 4.5 years but we were only married for 11 weeks...\n\nIn one conversation about how to split some of our finances and random items I asked to get both the engagement ring and wedding band back (worth ~4K together originally). I worked my ass off selling my soul for a contracted project that I was miserable doing for almost 6 months to be able to make the money to buy them. Considering that she had little regard for our marriage I felt it was reasonable to get them back to try and recoup some of my money. When I did this she looked at me like I was an alien but reluctantly agreed.\n\nAm I the asshole for asking for them back to try and get some of my money back?",

      "description": "So the whole situation was unusual. I lived on the west coast and I was dating a guy online that I had met on Wow. I was in a bad situation where myself and my two cats were about to become homeless. \nSo me and my boyfriend (we can call him bob) were only really dating for about a month. We got along fairly well but obviously there's only so much you can do with someone long distance. Anyways, when I told him about my situation, he offered to fly me to him, with my cats and I could stay in his second bedroom (or with him in his bed if I decided). He was going to pay for plane ticket, pet deposit fees, etc. Until I could get back on my feet financially and such. He even said he'd fly me back home if so desired. \nI didn't really want to accept such a big offer like that, especially since I hadn't been with him for very long.. but I was put in a position where it really was my best option. So I accepted.\nMy first week there, things were weird. He would not have sex with me, or anything intimate. I tried to sleep in his bed but every day he'd say that it felt like I was pushing him away. So much so, he felt I was doing it in my sleep. (Creating physical barriers between us using a blanket?) \nA few more weeks go by, I still haven't been able to find a job in the small town I moved to. Therefore I haven't been able to help pay for anything, but he did know this beforehand. After 2 months, I finally get a part time serving job. I make enough to pay half the bills but not reimburse him for what he's already paid.. and he reassured me he doesn't want me to pay him back. He also had put me on the lease, too.\n After starting my new job and spending time away from him, I realized how much we didn't get along. We could not communicate in a productive way at all. When I started to show a lack of interest, he immediately assumed I was cheating. He began to go through messages of mine if I left them open on my computer. \nI finally decided I wanted it to be over because nothing about this was healthy or normal for a relationship, but I didn't have anywhere else to go so I thought maybe I could stay. I wanted to be friends with him since he did so much for me but i also didnt want to be pressured to stay in a relationship. I wanted to stay in the second bedroom, continue to pay half rent. At least until I could save and afford my own place. He told me that if I didn't want to date him, then I had to move out. I was disappointed but obliged. Started to look for a new place, staying in the second bedroom (Where I had nothing but a twinsize blow up mattress and about 80% of the room filled with Bob's boxes). Since I was single and so ready for this relationship to be over, especially after 3 months of no sex, I was flirting with a guy at work via texts. Bob found a friend to help him hack into all of my accounts and cell phone number so that he could read all of my messages. He showed up to my work multiple times to yell at me in front of customers to \"get my shit and get out\". I had to have my manager escort him out because he would not leave. He simultaneously changed the locks on the front door so I couldn't get in. He would call his mom over to babysit me whenever I was home alone so I didn't \"steal anything\". When I finally moved out (onto a work friends couch) he refuses to give me the rent money I paid for THIS month, and is telling me to repay him for everything he spent before...\n\ntldr; long distance boyfriend pays for my plane ticket to live with him while I'm broke and homeless, when relationship doesn't work out, he hacks into my accounts and messages, changes locks on door, and accuses me of lying and cheating and kicks me out even though I am on lease and pay half the bills.

      "description": "Two ex-coworkers and me were meeting up for dinner. I left that job, but they were still working together. Before that we all had the same income level, but that changed after I got a new job with a higher income. We had a good connextion and met up for dinner frequently. As I'm the only one with a car and one of them was pregnant (let's call her M) I suggested to come pick them up and drive them to the city where we would have dinner. And so I did. \n\nAs M did have a way of previously not offering to split parking fees when I drove us home (or any other costs) so I asked her the night before if she was willing to contribute if the parking fee was higher than the cost of public transport would have been. Which seemed fair to me and she agreed. Little backstory, I'm the only one with a part-time job now and need my weekend days also to run arrends and clean my house. From 13:00 on she was texting me about different parking lots, their costs per hour and the number of cars they could hold. I didn't really look into her suggestions because I was busy and just went to pick them up. They got into my car and at that point we didn't make a decision on the parking lot and I didn't really acknowledge all of her research on parking lots. I did ask what parking lot she would like me to go to and she came up with a whole cons and pro's list. I told her that I'd prefer the closest as I liked the convienence. She continues to discuss options and at that point I'm a bit done with it and try to shut it down with a joke along the lines of ''I would almost think you have never parked a car before, I've never seen so much research go into costs and places of parking lots!'' And she loses it. Screaming that I should shut up and that I'm ridiculing her and that not everyone earns as much money as I do. \n\nI immediatly apoligized for my comment (hardly could get a word in) and drove to the parking lot closest to the restaurant. We did sort of talk it out later that night and she blamed it on pregancy hormones. I drove her home later that night and that was the last time we really spoke. After that she texted me that she realized that it wasn't her hormones and that I put her down with that joke and made her feel small by saying something like that. \n\nSo the friendship has ended but it made me kind of insecure about it. Was I out of line not to acknowledge her research or worries on something so trivial to me? ",

One of the people who was let go I’d become quite good work friends with. Now when I was told that I’d got the contract, they said I had to keep it to myself until the end of the temp contract, which I did, I didn’t speak to anyone about it and basically acted like I was leaving too.\n\nAfter she left, I found out that she had been talking to another co-worker saying that she couldn’t understand why I hadn’t told her I’d got the job because we were apparently super close friends, then she started texting me, like A LOT (she’s got my number off the work WhatsApp group), and if I didn’t reply to her within an hour or so, she’d Facebook message me and WhatsApp message me saying she didn’t understand why her messages weren’t getting through to me, it was bordering on harassment to be honest. At one point, I didn’t get back to her for a whole day because a string of family emergencies (a family friend passed away, my parents house almost burned down and my sister went into labour all in the space of about 24 hours), and when I finally checked my phone, I found a really ragey text saying she didn’t understand what she had done wrong and that she would delete my number and never text me again. I told her what had happened and she said she obviously hasn’t deleted my number,  then took this as an invitation to repeatedly text me again.\n\nI know her husband died a few years ago and she’s in her 60’s so she’s probably super lonely but I’ve not text her since, aita?",

      "description": "I will keep this short. I live in America, two British guys came into my work. They gave me $50 for something that cost $9. They said, “keep twenty, give me back the rest”. So I gave them back $21. Then they started arguing with me, saying to give them back thirty? I pulled out my calculator, repeated what they told me, and showed them the math, and his friend was like, “yeah that is correct”. But the main British dude got really upset with me and got huffy and walked away. So I ended up keeping the twenty anyway. Then my coworker was like, “you PERCEIVED them wrong”. I said.... “when someone says ‘keep twenty’, that hardly ever includes the total and if so, he should’ve clarified... but instead he got upset and walked away”. But my coworker was adamant and tried arguing with me. She kept saying I perceived him wrong? I said, “there wasn’t anything to perceive? It was a language miscommunication and all it took was two seconds longer to find a middle ground???” And she’s still angry with me. So, am I the asshole? Honestly ",

      "description": "My friends and I were debating the ethics behind what happened the other night when buying beer. I got a usually pretty expensive 4 pack of local craft beer. As the lady was ringing it up, I told my friend that I'd get his water as well, and when I went to pay I realised the total price was 6 bucks and change (for the beer and water). That was way less then it usually is, but I didn't really think about it until my way home, paid, then left.\n\nWhen telling my other friend about the price he said I was a scumbag for not pointing out the error, and that she probably rang the beer up as 1 can. My defense was it's not my job to point out store pricing errors and I didn't do anything shady to get try and pull the wool over their eyes. We both agree that you should always tell a clerk if they forgot to ring something up or that's straight up stealing. We defer about if a wrong price gets rung up if we should notify the cashier.\n\nWhat do you guys think? AITA and should have said something, or did the beer gods shine a ray of sunshine on someone who has spent a ton of money on great beer?",

Apparently he had picked fights and caused a lot of drama. I don’t want that on my discord server, for obvious reasons. I ask other people about him and that said something along the lines of that he liked to pick fights and would encourage others to get involved (keep in mind their experiences were a few years ago) and they also said that they were very uncomfortable with him there. The discord server in question has like, 20ish people in it and there was only 4 that were uncomfortable with him. So me and the co-owner decided to ban him. There’s been a lot of backlash from other servers for banning him. I do want to give people a chance but at the same time, he was making people uncomfortable and I don’t want that to be the environment in my discord server. He might have changed from a few years ago, but he also makes people uncomfortable. So AITA for banning him.\nSide note: the discord server I run is for people with PTSD and other related disorders mainly to get support and tips and stuff. So, him being there as not only uncomfortable, but triggering to them as well.",

      "description": "So without getting to specific, im in my early 20's and have been dating my SO for almost 4 years now. We've had our good times and bad times and in the beginning we both just got out of bad relationships and both made mistakes of misloyalty, i wont go further into detail, but this comes in later..\n\nIn the beginning we lived in different towns, i lived at home, we would see eachother as much as possible, this died down a little after highschool and when we got jobs. But we still hung out whenever we were free. No problems with no replies on texts. Then more recently in the past couple months, ive been noticing when i tell her good night and i love you, which i just thought was a nice thing to say and help someones night go well.\n\nHowever, my texts seemed to be maybe 3 to 4 lines, and hers would be 2 to 1 lines. But now she hasnt really texted me back more than once since i last saw her a couple days ago. I wont see her for about a week now,\n\n and ive had past relationships and earlier issues with cheating and whatnot years ago. I try to shrug it off and believe her excuses of 'oh i was just talking to my dad and then took a shower and forgot.' and i cant help but think  the only reason she wouldnt reply even in the morning is because when she looks at my text she opens it and just says 'fuck it, not worth my time' she is a couple years older than me, so idk if she just doesnt like texting or what, but when shes over, she'll reply to people right away. \n\nI guess this turned into a rant but whatever. If anyones reading this long, let me ask you this,  Am i also the asshole for wanting to have sex? Its been a good amount of time now and she never seems to be in the mood around me or to me. We'll mess around a little with foreplay and stuff rarely but it hasnt gone farther than that for a while. She says she just doesnt like sex, but idk what im supposed to do when i do. Also im going to be moving out of state toward the end of the year and dont know if i should try to keep this going or what. Thoughts, advice? Thank you.",

      "description": "High school senior here. A little background, I have been a hockey player my whole life, and I broke on to my school's varsity hockey team as a freshman, and have started every game since day 1. Through hockey I gained popularity, made friends with both peers in and out of school. This season, I was sure to break the school record for career goals of 111, as I was at 89 through 3 years. I also had a real chance to break the county record of 122, considering I scored 37 goals my sophomore year. It became a running thing with my buddies, and I gained a lot of notoriety for it around the smaller town. Well, a week before the season starts, my older sister (22) and her boyfriend were home on Thanksgiving break. This guy, a big guy mind you, wanted to play football with me and some of my buddies in the yard. I said sure. However, in an effort to impress my sister, this guy tackled me as hard as he could in a simple game of touch football. He ended up breaking my wrist, and we had to go to the hospital for it. Doctor tells me I can't play for minimum 8 weeks, considering the physicality of hockey. This takes me to the near end of my senior season. Now, I won't be able to break either record, and I feel like what I loved has been ripped from me. My sister told me to \"man up and how its not a big deal (missing the hockey season). She knows this has been a big part of my life my whole life, and doesn't seem to care. This was in late November, and I still haven't spoken to her more than saying hello over the phone. Am I in the wrong? Thanks. ",

      "description": "My fiancé has been friends with this guy Paul for twenty five years. \n\nAcross our relationship I've gotten to know Paul and I like him. He's a great guy. He's funny and personable, if a little quiet. \n\nBut Paul's wife Sharon is... something else.\n\nThe few times I've gone to their house, Sharon has been nothing short of frigid. She is silent aside from \"hello\" or \"goodbye\". She will stare daggers at you the whole time you are in her presence, like you are completely inconvenient to her existence. Basically from the minute you walk in their house, even if you've been invited over, it feels like she is counting down the seconds until you leave. She's not verbally rude, but she gives off a definite negative energy and body language.\n\nI asked my fiancé if maybe I did something to piss her off or offend her, but apparently she's been like that towards him for the last twenty years so... that's just her personality I guess.\n\nOriginally I was going to invite her to the wedding anyway. But then it came to my attention that she has made multiple posts on her social media denigrating us and our relationship (usually alongside denigrating Paul). Comments about her loser husband's loser friends. Comments about me being an idiot for dating my fiancé. Just snide little posts that are vague enough someone on the outside might not know who she was talking about, but specific enough that it's pretty obvious to anyone who knows my fiancé or I.\n\nBetween her obvious disdain for her husband (repeatedly calling him names, questioning his masculinity, disparaging his income even though he's the one supporting both of them) and her obvious disdain for my fiancé and I, I don't want her at the wedding. I would LOVE for Paul to attend, but to be frank I feel like Sharon can go fck herself. I don't want that energy anywhere near my celebration.\n\nFiancé thinks it would be an asshole move to invite Paul without inviting Sharon, and is worried Paul wouldn't show up if his wife is excluded. His feeling is we should take the \"kill them with kindness\" route. \n\nSo what say ye, Reddit? Would I be the asshole to send Paul an invite with no +1 attached?",

I punched him multiple times but I was too weak he tried to put his hand down my pants. The cops came I was still very drunk and I sent them away, in this time he passed out and another friend was able to come and get me. I was safe that night, I got my refund and that was that. \n\nI'm pretty shaken up about it considering I've been sexually assaulted countless times in my life and I get flashbacks and nightmares and I can't even look at my own body sometimes. My brain is a constant mess around men and I find it hard to trust anyone at all. And on top of this I'm staying with a friend for a week, and last night he said something about how he didn't want to parent me but I had chose to drink the alcohol and to be there and it almost sent me into a panic attack. Another friend keeps telling me that because of how I dress and because I was there with him I had to have known why would have happened and another who I trusted a lot told me that he wants to know where I am when I go out because I put myself in these situations. This is why I turned the cops away.\n\nI know its my fault already I know I'm stupid and I fucked myself over and I get they have good intentions but all I want to do is scream at them and cry and my head starts spinning and ringing so much I can't hear or see them. I went off at the last guy and he told me I was being crazy and he was only trying to help. I just really REALLY need to know, AITA here? Are they really just trying to help? ",

He swears it was for the game and not anything else, but of course how can I trust that?\n\nAm I never going to be able to lend him money ever, even if/after he gets clean?",

      "description": "TL;DR. My mother mistreats me and my little brother but I don't know if I am making it worse. I feel like my lack of contribution around the house is not helping, and while I'm trying to fix it, I'm busy with school and constantly tired. I just want to be able to be a normal teenager--make mistakes and slack off sometimes--but I don't get the chance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom has had abusive tendencies since I was young. Her first response to my negative behaviors as a child was to beat me, and when I got too big to beat, to yell and scream, knowing quite well I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. She treats my younger brother similarly. He's 8, I'm 16.\n\nHere's an example of her behavior.\n\nA few weeks ago, she sent me in an Uber to pick up some food for her from Popeyes'. She demanded a particular deal that involved a leg, wing, and thigh, as well as a biscuit and drink, for 3.99. I knew damn well they didn't have that, especially in the pricy neighborhood I was in, but I asked anyway. I'm cripplingly shy, so I didn't want to press the issue, and bought her and my brother tenders by mistake.\n\nWhen I brought them home, she FLIPPED OUT. An honest-to-god screaming fit, tears, voice-breaking, the entire 9 yards, hollering she didn't like tenders, she wanted (insert dead bird parts here). To me, they're the same fucking bird, but okay, I guess. The part that pissed me off was when she insisted I didn't care about her because I didn't know she didn't like tenders. To this, I asked her which condiment I preferred--barbecue sauce or ketchup. She said ketchup. I like barbecue sauce. She insisted that it wasn't the same thing, and said I was inattentive.\n\nLater, she \"apologized\". Well, not really. She forgave me for bringing her tenders and said she appreciated my efforts. She did not say sorry for calling me, in so many words, an awful daughter. Over fried chicken.\n\nTo me, it was a completely childish response to a relatively simple problem. Howling your lungs out like a four year old because you got a piece of a bird and you wanted another piece of a bird is not how adults should behave. If I, a hormonal teenager, who has panic attacks about makeup sponges, can understand that, a woman in her forties certainly should. \n\nHere's another example.\n\nToday she screamed at and physically threatened my 8 year old brother for emailing the teacher about a missing assignment--to clarify, she asked him check Google Classroom, and he misunderstood . I was too afraid to go look, but based on the changes in her voice, she hit or pinched him at least once. In the same paragraph of speech, she insisted that TV/computer use is making him stupid and then said that he wasn't stupid and could listen to her. \n\nNow, from what it you've just read, she seems like an asshole. Granted. \n\nBut today, after more screaming when I told her she's always angry at us, she brought up two things: one, that I am ungrateful, and two, that me and my father aren't doing enough in the home to help my little brother.\n\nWith the first, I can kind of understand where she's coming from. In her mind, she's never wrong, and for me to be upset with her to the point of crying for throwing a skirt at me seems like a ridiculous and unfair thing to do. I disagree, of course, but I see her logic. \n\nWith the second, she's right. Completely. For a lot of my life, my dad has been just \"there\". He provides, and sometimes talks to me, but he doesn't try to do things with me or take me anywhere. He doesn't really give me advice unless I ask for it, or tell me to do anything if it doesn't directly pertain to him (i.e. I don't want to do this, so do it). He's the same way towards my younger brother (with some improvements). But my mother has made my brother into a little tyrant: he doesn't listen to or respect anyone but her. He fusses at me and is short with his father. We can't really tell him to do anything, and I can't really make him.\n\nAnd I admit, I am a lazy piece of shit. My room is a disaster, and other than taking care of our three dogs and making sure they're fed, clean, and toileted, I don't do much. I try to help with the sink--make sure stuff doesn't build up in there, and that kind of thing. I'm a senior in high school--I skipped a couple grades--and just generally going through some tough stuff right now, so it's kind of difficult. Studying for tests, keeping my grades up, making sure I graduate by getting my service hours--it's a lot on my plate. My workload has increased 1000x since last year.\n\nI'm also super irresponsible. Just in general. I'm working on it, but I feel like I lost a good chunk of my development to depression in the 8th, 9th, and 10th grades. I feel stunted.\n\nAnd I'd just like to share that until very recently, my mother didn't do anything around the house. She has walked the dogs maybe 6 times in the two years we have lived here (she forces them to be in a little room near the garage because \"she doesn't like animals up under her\"\\[our dogs are cuddly\\], and complains that my room isn't clean enough to have them live permanently with us). She does not wash dishes, nor clean up after the rarity that she cooks--she recently started baking bread, and leaves the sink piled high with dishes every time. She then proceeds to complain that the sink is full of dishes and no one is doing anything about it. \n\nBut she works a lot. She just graduated school and is running three businesses. I feel like she resents me a little because I was born at a time that wasn't opportune for her and disrupted her life. I do feel like she's in the wrong a lot, but I want to extend sympathy to her. I can't imagine the amount of stress she's put herself through for us, and I am grateful for what she has done. I just wish she wouldn't treat us like shit and say it's fine because she provides for us. I didn't choose to be here. \n\nShe is not open to communication, and no amount of discussion will fix this, so I just want to know: is this entirely her fault, or are me (and my father) partially to blame? If so, how much?",

      "description": "So I currently work, but I've been searching for another job since October due to job dissatisfaction, only getting part time hours when I'm considered full time, and looking for better pay.  It's a tough market.  Anyway, I digress.  My friend interviewed at this place and \\*has an offer\\* from them.  I asked her if she had an e-mail or knew who I could contact, and she provided that information.  So I e-mailed them and got a call a couple of days later to schedule an interview.\n\nShe asked if I told this person that I got his e-mail from her.  I didn't.  He said it was his personal e-mail and he wasn't sure how I got it, \\*but\\* he didn't ask AND I didn't tell.  He just proceeded to tell me about the position, and how they are hiring for all positions (FT/PT/PRN) at the moment.  He told my friend (when she interviewed over a week ago) that they weren't hiring anyone else.  Well, my friend spoke to this contact person today because apparently, she has not yet given them their decision on whether or not she accepts.  She is still waiting to hear back from another place that is basically her dream job, and asked if she could have until Monday or Tuesday.  Well, I guess this person sounded a little irritated and wants her decision by today.  Personally, I don't think this has anything to do with me, because she \\*has an offer\\*, and I don't.  I still need to interview.  \n\nShe said I should have waited, blah blah blah, I thought you were my friend, and didn't think I would have e-mailed them so quickly.  But see...she could have told me to wait, or not give me the e-mail at all, and I would have respected that!  I also saw this position on Indeed some time ago, but when I found out she applied and was in the process of scheduling an interview, I held off, out of respect to her as a friend because I knew she was desperately looking for a job and I have one.  I told her I would wait to contact them until after she got an offer.  Well, she got an offer, so I thought it was okay for me to go ahead and proceed.\n\nIt's not like I'm stealing this position away from her.  She already has the damn offer, and they need her decision.  I have no offer, just an interview scheduled in about a week.  Am I the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "My mom started feeling sick something like 10-15 days ago, and since my dad was away at the time, it was my job to take care of her (I am a student living at home). I wasn’t super happy about it, but I put up with it because I know that she has been there for me when I was sick.\n\nNow, whenever my dad or me gets sick, we take a range of different medicine regularly to try to fight it off ranging from DayQuill/NyQuill, to zinc tablets (which have been clinically shown to shorten colds), to Dimetapp at night. Apart from that, we drink lots of liquids.\n\nSo as I’ve been taking care of her, I suggest that she takes some medicine, but she rarely would take anything except for Advil, which lowers her fever I guess. To top that, she would drink barely any fluids (like maybe 10-12 oz per day). All of this made me mad, but I didn’t try to push it too hard on her.\n\nToday however (basically a couple of weeks since she first started feeling symptoms), I woke up and felt really sick. I went to my mom (still sick btw) and told her that I was a bit mad at her for getting me sick because she didn’t try to take any medicine to shorten her cold. She told me that she’s sorry I got sick and that, yes, it’s probably from her, but that she doesn’t think the medicine has any correlation.\n\nObviously there are no guarantees with something like this, and I could have gotten sick from her even if she had been taking medicine, but I still feel like she’s to blame for not really attempting to fight the sickness at all. But maybe I’m wrong - am I the asshole for blaming her?",

I've always thought it's a great practical joke when I'm with someone who I've known for a little while and I've only spoken to them in English so far, and I pick up my phone and start speaking Spanish fluently, or start speaking to a cashier in Spanish. The look on their face is priceless! Usually they are really surprised and then I explain how I know Spanish.\n\nMy question is, would it be different if I did this to an SO? I thought it would be pretty funny to play the long con on them, and then maybe in a few months bust out the Spanish on some random occasion and see how they react.

Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says “no no, there’s no need, I have some” but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here’s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says “No we’re using mine,” and says she won’t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we’d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that’d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said “no, why’re you so persistent.” She then states that if I wasn’t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol’ reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn’t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should’ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn’t let me use my own condom, said i couldn’t smash until I used hers",

      "description": "My mom has pretty extensive cardiac/other health issues. Ever since I graduated from undergrad six years ago and moved back home to help out, I’ve been wrapped up in the world of her health issues. This means that I have sacrificed travel and job opportunities in order to accommodate her needs. I would estimate that she’s been in the hospital for more than a year (if I were to add up the length of all her stays in the past six years). \n\nAs time has gone on, I have found myself unable to emotionally respond to her health issues anymore. I can logically respond and ask her questions about whatever her current issue is, but there isn’t an emotional switch that goes on. This is odd to me because I work with patients in other capacities and I often overly feel concerned for them and their wellbeing. But with my mom, it’s like my feelings have been overstimulated so much that they have fizzled out. As a result of this, I find myself getting irritated or exasperated whenever she tells me about what feels like yet another issue and I end up being very short with her. \n\nMy post today was prompted by her telling me about chest pain (which she always has to some degree, but tonight it’s been worse) after I spent literally 13 hours outside of the house. I was visibly irritated which I know hurt her feelings since she views me as her main confidante in the house, but I honestly couldn’t even pretend tonight. I love my mom dearly and she has done so much for me and advocated for me while I was growing up so I feel terrible about my inability to connect to her issues emotionally/feel empathy. \n\n\nPlease tell me if AITA! If any of you have been through a similar feelings progression, I would appreciate your thoughts!",

At first she moaned and said she'd only go \"to have fun with her friends\" and that she isn't \"like that\" though i know that her friends are a little promiscuous, but then changed her mind a couple months down the line saying that she doesn't want to, and that it's not worth \"losing me\" over it. Now today we were facetiming as she was pretty busy and so was i so we didn't get a chance to meet up, and she mentions that her friend invited her this week to go but she was busy with work that night, but her mate invited her to go this weekend or something and that she wanted to go, now her exact words were \"would you break up with me if I did though?\" and i started to get a bit heated but tried to keep my cool and was like \"do whatever you want i don't care\" i then found an excuse to get off the call and i got upset since she knows how i feel about it and it's not the first time she's tried to swing me round to agree with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif you wonder why i'm not a fan of it, you should see the type of girls that club here in the UK, and the usual \"it was a drunken mistake\"",

      "description": "This may be scattered and all over the place, I have been thinking on this for a while and finally decided to get some advice maybe. On mobile while the kids are having naptime, forgive any errors please. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nMy Great Grandpa(GG) recently turned 89. I am 29, turning 30 very soon. All my life I was the \"favorite\" grandchild of his, but I am pretty sure its just because my Grandma, (who raised me, and whose Father GG is), took me to hang out with him so often. But even if that was the reason, GG and I always had a good relationship. \n\nI have always been bigger then other kids and people my age, but it wasnt until maybe the past four years that I have slipped into the probably obese category. (I am not really wanting any advice regarding that, I know my issues there.) Between heavy depression, lack of care for myself, being content in a happy relationship, and PCOS, I have quite a bit of extra weight that is a struggle to lose. (But I am trying one pant size down this year! :3) Before this bit of weight gain, even though big, I was \"fat in the right places\" big. My GG used to creepily call me \"Hot Momma\" whenever I hugged him in public... Which was often as he always invited me out for lunch and dinner. I also spent a significant amount of time just hanging out with him at his house too. \n\nBut once I got properly fat, he stopped inviting me out as much, and whenever I would stay at his house he didnt really talk to me and just sorta acted awkward for lack of a better word. He would quickly finish dinner and be off to his \"man cave\" rather than socializing like he used to. We always go over to his house for Christmas, and for 2018 Christmas he decided to not give any of my family presents. (Husband and 15 year old daughter, as well as me.) I didn't say anything at the time, but all three of us sorta had our feelings hurt as he had made sure to give lots of other people presents, but somehow forgot us. \n\nThis was relayed to me by my Grandma later:\nMy Grandma asked GG if he had given me a present, and he grumpily said \"No, and I didn't give daughter or husband any either.\" He then told her that he didnt like me being around as much \"since I got fat\" because I make him, my 89 year old Great Grandpa, \"look bad\" and I am not \"hot\" anymore. \n\nOnce my Grandma told me about this I was livid and my feelings were so hurt I almost felt nauseous. I haven't said anything to GG as he's mostly deaf and really doesn't listen to me anyways. But since then... I have had no desire to go see him. I feel guilty about not doing it, I know he's old and doesn't have long but I just can't stand him at the moment. \n\nTL;DR \nAITA for not wanting to visit my Great Grandpa anymore after he said he didn't like having me around since I got fat and am no longer attractive in his mind, making him \"look bad\" in public? \n\n\nThanks in advance for any advice. I need it for sure. ",

      "title": "AITA To Suggest To My Wife That We Both Curtail Our Drinking",
      "description": "I'm an alcohol abuser. I binge drink sometimes, self-medicating sedative for sure, but pot's more my deal and I love how it helps me create and be up, optimistic and engaged, whereas drinking numbs my issues and just shuts me down. Socially, I drink more, part of the flock, but, when I'm home, I largely avoid it to remain productive and would love to quit entirely, no judgement on anyone who relies upon the drink to get them through. I understand.  I'd just like to stop, altogether. \n\nMy wife drinks too, but not really socially, more like constantly.  It's been every night for years.  Happy times, sad times, all times, a bottle of wine a night.  I know of issues she has, and I understand how self-medicating works. But she has always shown such a lack of interest in trying to rein it in. I don't push - I get it.  But it started to attack her health, and she gained weight, her health deteriorating over many years of nightly pounding the wine down, along with questionable dietary habits. I ride mountain bikes, walk a lot, work out, and she just doesn't want to be active, for whatever reason, I still don't know what that block might be.  \n\nFortunately, our doctor confronted her with a diabetic prognosis, as a result of her weight gain from both food and alcohol abuse as well as physical inactivity and she had a woke moment and decided she needed help.  So, she got gastric bypass surgery as a way of forcing her to pay closer attention to her health.  She would have to follow a dutiful regimen because of the surgery.\n\nIn a year, she lost 125 pounds, and I've been so proud of her.  She's been ecstatic, glowing, excited and empowered.  I've loved watching her rediscover life and have shared in all of her victories day by day.  Our marriage has strengthened as we've affirmed that we were in this together.\n\nIt's well-documented that there are some psychological side-effects that come from this kind of surgery and that also, many still revert to their old ways in time.  My wife has been a model patient, defying all of the standard results for this procedure.  No complications, a tremendous boost of energy and dedication to remaining fit and the realization that she'd committed to a life-long lifestyle.  I told her from the start that I'd be there with her, side by side and step by step as she redefined her approach to physical and mental well-being.\n\n9 months after the surgery, she stopped working out so much, very much pleased with her progress, and then she dropped right back into drinking heavily again.  But, her smaller stomach couldn't process the booze as well, so she began getting drunker quicker and more severely.  This progressed to full-on drunk-every-night sessions that would leave her on the couch, head hanging forward, dead to the world, full-on passed out.  I'd never seen her like this before.\n\nWe'd go out somewhere and we'd both be ordering drinks, but she'd end up wrecked in half the time, and we'd often have to bail on our plans in order to get her home.  She was stumbling drunk every time, and she had to lean on me extensively as we aborted date nights to get her back home where she could pass out in private.\n\nI thought I was getting my wife back when she got the surgery, but there are issues that continue to press her towards the booze.  I recognize my own issues with the drink and have decreased my usage over the past few years, especially at home, where we could support each other.   I've told her many times that I would stop drinking completely if she would do the same.  Because the two of us are stronger together than each of us alone.  If both of us are of like mind on something, there's no stopping us.  We're like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis at the end of \"True Lies\"; working the room together and owning it.\n\nI told her again, tonight, that I would cut back on drinking if she would.  Together, we'd get a handle on this thing.  We didn't have to stop drinking forever, just maybe not as much. I'm ready.  She said that she wasn't quite ready, yet.  The same thing that she's been telling me for years.  I went alcohol-free for a year, for myself and to serve as a witness.  She didn't change her intake one bit.  I got something out of it, some lucidity, some better habits, a sense of control that I didn't think I possessed.  But she didn't share that depth of attempt. And it was hard to quit cold turkey in a house full of booze.\n\nI'm willing to dial it down to zero and she's not willing to dial it down at all.  I know she's dealing with a lot of baggage, from childhood to some of the mindfucks that come with the surgery that she endured a year ago.  I don't blame her for drinking.  I just don't know what to do in the face of her saying, \"I can't stop right now.\"\n\nShe was very sweet when I told her all of this.  We're not arguing.  I asked her if she's happy and she said, exuberantly, \"yes!\"  I'm happy too; she's a wonderful woman. We have fun, we have a great relationship, we enjoy each other's company, it'll be 15 years of marriage next year and 17 years of being together. But something is compelling her to drink in excess seven days a week, and I just don't know what to do.  \n\nAnd because I DO drink, and know WHY I do and tell her so, but refrain from the intense levels at which she imbibes, I just wonder if I'm being an asshole.  Do I even have room to speak?\n\n",

      "description": "Disclaimer: Long but light hearted situation for ya!  \n\nI'm cramped into an airport van with 10 strangers who are being transported to our various hotels in a town that is a 6 hour drive away. We have all come off the same flight which was delayed by 2 hours, so are 2 hours behind our individual schedules on top of the impending 6 hour roadie.   \n\nWe're having toilet breaks along the way but are all keeping it as brief as possible. We're driving away from a lunch break when a girl yells out to the driver to stop- she's lost her phone. A bit of communal panic ensues and we of course turn around and head back.\n\nThe girl is travelling with her bf who is obnoxious in a few ways: yawning ridiculously loudly in a small space without covering his mouth, falling asleep numerous times and essentially resting himself on my shoulder (I would politely inch forward until his gf would pull him back over), ball space to suit 3 men, etc etc. \n\nSo, she loses her phone and is STRESSED. We pull up, she jumps out, the driver jumps out as well and helps her look (we're on a small touristy island - in my home country - I can confidently say that if someone finds the phone, they're not handing it in). The bf doesn't get out to help her (???) but kind of looks around the seat half heartedly and ends up finding it under the seat. \n\nHe announces with zero sense of urgency: \"Yeah it's here ha ha, she's unbelievable.\"  We're all relieved. Maybe 15 seconds goes past and everyone's like uhh are you going to tell her? And he says, \"no she deserves to panic, she's always losing her shit, this happens all the time. Let her panic\". He says that she has to learn her lesson one day or another. I say half-jokingly, (enough for him to hear but not making a statement to the whole van) \"maybe right now isn't when she needs to learn the lesson though?\" He ignores me.\n\nWe're a van full of strangers watching her and the driver frantically run around this dodgy restaurant and he's laughing, and someone comments \"it's funny but the driver is out there stressing too sooo...\" Bf responds with: \"classic. She's so ridiculous. She would be so pissed.\"   By now we've awkwardly watched this shitshow for about 5 minutes. \n\nMe: \"surely tell her now?\"\nHim: \"no, it's funny?\" (Smug at this point). \n\nSo I lean over him, open the door and yell \"WE FOUND IT!\" She gets back in totally relieved and apologetic, we're all kinda laughing (with her) to make light of the situation. I say, \"he found it the moment you got out of the van\" and again others laugh, she laughs too but also looks at him like seriously?! \n\nHe then gives me absolute you-asshole daggers, mutters something under his breath and, to let her into her seat makes a point of completely shoving me out of the way (he's a 6 foot 3 male, I'm a 5 foot 3 female). Tbh this wouldn't sit well with me any other day but I've gotta sit next to the bloke for another 3 hours.\n\nSooo AITA for \"ruining the joke\"?   ",

      "description": "a bit of backstory, i had just gotten off of work and i left to my friends high school to help him practice some wrestling, since his tournament is tomorrow. I got there a bit late but no one was ready and about 30 minutes of being there my girlfriend texted me if i was going to pick her up from her cosmetology school so we could go hiking. I had completely forgotten but i told her i'd leave and would still leave to pick her up. A bit of fuss comes from her side as shes mad that i forgot, which is understandable. its about a 40 minutes drive and i get there and i'm as happy as possible because i don't like seeing her mad at me, i try cheering her up and i end up fixing things with good attitude. We get to the mountain to go hiking after we eat and turns out its closed. We head back to hers and stay there for a good 40 minutes, 10 of which were us sleeping. At this point i'm tired and have been out since about 9a.m and its 8. I decide i want to go home, she gets mad and gives me attitude as i leave. \n\nI understand this because we planned to go hiking since the beginning of the week, i was as excited as she was, granted I forgot, i am always excited to see her. Before I even leave her neighborhood shes texting me about how excited she was about seeing me and how shes mad i left early. I'm thinking to myself, \" just because our plans didn't go like we thought, doesn't mean i'm obligated to spend more time with you\". Call it selfish but i like home and just felt tired. When i'm home she calls me and demands an apology for not wanting to spend time with her, how i don't want to see her, and because i left early. In my mind, I am in control of my life, if i wanted to go home, i have that right. I mean i don't want to be extremely biased but is that not natural? Extra: we have been dating for three years and she will constantly tell me she doesn't feel appreciated and that i don't show that i love her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting to spend some time alone after a failed date?",

      "title": "AITA for calling out a friend for being a terrible friend? She hasn't spoken to me for 9 months",
      "description": "We met in college about 10 years ago and hit it off immediately. She is the loud, sometimes obnoxious, attention loving performer-type and I, the goofy, introverted hermit, emotional artist-type. \n\nThe dynamic of our relationship has always been that I'm there for her whenever she needed me and if she was struggling with something, I was happy to spend however long talking her through it. I'm assuming with as much as I've done for her and helped her out in the past, she felt like she could rely on me. But, it wasn't so much the same for me. See, most of our conversations would always somehow end up focusing on her, even if it was something \\*I\\* wanted to talk about. Still, I considered her as my best friend and even an extended family member for all the events/family dinners she's been at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, fast forward...I leave our hometown, move across country a few times, get married. She stays back home, pretty much doing/living the same life before I left. We halfassedly keep in touch while I'm away, and we even organize double dates/hangouts when I'm back home. But, over time, keeping in touch becomes more and more difficult and there's resentment compounding on my end for ridiculously stupid things like \"she never likes my pictures on instagram\", \"she didn't message to ask if I was ok when she saw I was in the hospital\", \"I'm always the one saying hello and she takes forever to respond to texts, yet she hits me up when she needs help with something\", etc...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo eventually, I got sick and tired of her shit and sent her this text;\n\n \n\nHey dude,\n\nJust wanted to reach out to apologize for being in town for over a week and not getting in touch. To be honest, I’ve been kind of upset over the past few weeks and I got to a point where I thought it would be best not to reach out. It hit me some time later that letting anger get in the way of honest expression is the reason why most friendships wither and die over time. So my idea in being completely honest with you here is so that I have a chance to get it off my chest, give the situation an opportunity to unveil all of the hundreds of other possibilities my one perspective might be missing, and most importantly give this friendship another chance to survive. \n\nI want to be super clear that while this message may seem one sided - it’s just me expressing everything I feel. And, what I feel is all I know. I fully open the possibility of being completely wrong and having misunderstood things. Ultimately, I’m reaching out because I’m not comfortable in making my own assumptions of the truth to a two sided story. How could I possibly?\n\nAnyway, for as long as I’ve been capable, I’ve always done my best to help you. I answered your call when I was on vacation to walk you through Instagram marketing, set up your YouTube ad campaign over the holidays, and have never hesitated to share with you anything and everything I’m doing that has helped me - in order to help you. I never expected anything in return because that’s not why I chose to help. I helped because I thought we had a mutual respect and care for one another as friends and as independent artists. But every time I reached out to say hello, I’d never get a response, and when I did it was super delayed and the excuse was always the same. I became extremely ill right around your birthday but I messaged to wish you a happy birthday but you didn’t respond until a week later, after you saw that I was in the hospital. By the end of all that - you reached out to ask me what happened, I was so tired of not being responded to, that I answered in a way to cut the conversation to avoid waiting for a response that would never come. That made me so sad. And made me wonder if you really cared. \n\nSo, ultimately it was time to go back home for a visit and I was extremely resentful towards you. To me, it feels like I’ve inserted many coins in this friendship vending machine only to feel like I’ve just come up short. You may have noticed that I didn’t mention being busy as an excuse I’m interested in talking about. I know how busy I am and I’m assuming your schedule is no different. \n\nIn all honesty, I wasn’t going to send this at until I played this 30 min exercise / game and it opened my eyes to why I should. [http://ncase.me/trust/](http://ncase.me/trust/) (do it on desktop browser to fully understand what I’m talking about). \n\nWhatever happens I feel good about being honest with you. Life’s too short to be angry and I don’t want to keep thinking about it. I will always love you.\n\n\\----------\n\nShe responded by saying she needed time to think things through and that she loved me and respected me...but then turned around to unfriend/unfollow me and she hasn't bothered to reach out like she lead me to believe she would. I feel hurt and used obviously, but the question that wracks my brain constantly is this...Am I an asshole for calling her out? Did I make it impossible for her to want to remedy the friendship? Was I too aggressive? I want to know what I did wrong to warrant her wanting nothing to do with me. It's so f\\*\\*\\*ing confusing. \n\nThx for reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This past fall I started college and decided to room with a high school friend of mine who we’ll call Dan. I had been good friends with Dan throughout high school. We had many similar interests and he had actually gone on vacation with my family the year before. \n\nAnyway, a bit into the first semester everything is ok, sometimes he’d ignore me if I tried to talk or would just walk in and out without acknowledging me, but overall it wasn’t too bad. Eventually pledge week at college rolled around and he pledged and I didn’t. Everyone that I knew pledged, and it was really hard for me to be the only one that wasn’t. I had the option to but long story short it really wasn’t for me. Anyway I spent most of the week depressed and lonely because everyone I knew was so busy and couldn’t even talk to me due to pledge week. I had a panic attack one day and my parents came down to make sure I was ok even. By the end of the week I was doing a better and was more stable. One of my other friends informed Dan that I was having a rough week at the beginning of pledge week and needed a good friend. Dan ignored me all week. That Saturday Dan was sick from pledge week, and I went to lunch with a friend. While at lunch Dan messaged me and went off about me needing to change my attitude before I came back to the room. And continued to go off at me. I asked why he was acting like that because I hadn’t done anything and he just kept on. I eventually ended up breaking down in my friends car due to this. The next day I decided to confront Dan on what he’d done. He claimed that he never sent those messages (they were on Snapchat) and began to scream at me and told me to go to hell. That night he ended up in the hospital, so the whole argument had no effect.\n\nOnto before Thanksgiving break, everything is perfectly fine between us. Then once break happens he invites our old friend group from home to hang out multiple times and excludes me. He ignored me in person one day on break. Upon returning to campus he continued giving me the silent treatment. Rarely replying to me and looking away when I walked in. He would blare music in the room when I was trying to work or sleep, and would slam the door when he left the room. All of this caused a substantial amount of stress on me. Near the end of the semester I told him that I was moving out. I started to explain that it was just a stressful situation and I didn’t want any hard feelings (it’s not you it’s me), and he interrupted and said if I didn’t want to be there then I didn’t want to be there and that’s all there is to it. We didn’t talk again until winter break. I moved out and headed home and he sent me a text message saying “Since you left without saying bye, bye have a good break” he hasn’t talked to me since and I’ve since found out that he’s gone to his and my friends telling them I stopped talking to him and was an asshole to him this whole time, and some of them take his side.

      "description": "I love my gaming group. We get rowdy, make inappropriate jokes and have fun. My issue is that when we go out to the bars in our small town, one of the  guys, lets call him Josh, gets really weird around girls.Now Josh is in decent shape and smart but when he opens his mouth to talk to women they get this look on their face like they are about to vomit. This has happened 6+ times. In his defense one of our other friends told  me a story about how the first girl he took home made fun of his micro-penis and he hasn't been with one since.\n\nLet's call the next one Emily. She's a bigger girl, whose Bi.Whatever.Tons of fun. When she talks to new people it goes \"HiMyNameIsEmily.I'm bi. I like boys and girls. I have a bf hes cool with it can I get your number,\" all in one breath. In her defense shes better than Josh. \n\nSo  Josh, Emily and I are at the bar. We just getting drunk keeping ourselves until the third bar and I run into this Hottie I have been talking to for a bit. I go over to say Hi how are ya, shes laughing everything's kosher. Emily and Josh slide over. Josh says \"You know this guy he's fucking asshole, total a piece of shit.\" \n\nHotties like \"uhh what?!!\"\n\nMe- \"This is Josh hes my friend hes just joking.\"\n\nEmily-\"Hi my name is Emily.I'm bi.That means I like boys and girls. I have a bf hes cool with it.Do you want to play pool with us?\" Hottie-\"Sure that sounds fun.\" Emily -\"We should hang out more whats your number..Did you hear me, whats your number.\"\n\nShe gives her number like okay lets get this over with. And its almost okay until Josh starts making jokes about raping dead babies that fall flat. He doesn't know what to do, so he doubles down. Doesn't work. So I just lean over and  I'm whisper \"dude chill just try to be normal,\" so only he can hear. And he shouts \"Fuckman, I'm just being the scumbag so you look better by comparison and  can fuck this girl, you'll see, it will work.\" She and her friends hear, total cringefest. She turns around and just completely ignores us, to talk to random dudes that swaggered up, like sharks that smell blood. Then Emily says to me \"Well, you really mess that up, I'll talk to her tomorrow see if she wants to hang out with us.\" At this point I  am in awe. If I didn't know these people I'd say they were fucking with me.\n\nI go to  the bathroom Emily and Josh pull an Irish exit. Hottie instantly walks away from sharkies back over to me says I don't know how I am getting home, I have to move my car do you want to come with? Sure love too. She backs to happy and giddy. We get to her car and  shes says \"I texted my friend to come pick me up. (Cucked.) but I had  fun.\" No worries\n\nNow  it's not the first time that Josh and Emily have made me feel awkward around women. So reddit AITA for not wanting to go out in public with my gamer friends and suggest we keep our relationship at the gaming table?\n\n2 many words. Lesser cringe stuff cut.",

      "description": "I am 29M, my SO is 27F. We have been dating for about 1 year and two months. I have social anxiety, and this is the first girl I have even kissed. Things escalated quickly and we decided to start a live in relationship about 4 months ago. \nIt was decided that we would split the household chores equally. I was completely fine with it, because we both worked an equal amount of hours. Even though I earned a fair bit more, I was home for roughly the same time as her and all was good. \nIt was going great till 2 months ago, I got an opportunity to become a key member of an emerging company. I was a bit reluctant because of the work hours but my SO convinced me to go for it since there was a massive salary hike too. \n\n It required a lot more extra effort from my part and I often work 12-16 hours a day now. I ended you liking what I did, and my salary almost doubled. The ratio was now about 5:1 in terms of how much we contributed. Not saying I don't let her treat herself with our money, I obviously did... but I expected to at least come home with less dishes in the sink and vacuuming done.\n\nApparently not, I often end up staying up till 12 am and wake up at 4am. I confronted her about this yesterday. She goes out to watch movies and binge watches Netflix, something we used to do together, everyday. I honestly couldn't handle it anymore.\n\nYesterday,I didn't shout or anything, I just told her that we should honestly consider changing the agreement and she should ideallydoing a little more work. When she said that I had promised on the 50/50. \nI told her straightaway that I couldn't handle it.\nI told her that I would be fine with doing a good amount of things, just not an equal amount or the majority of the work load. \n\nShe suddenly just broke down and slammed the door shut. Saying I was supposed to be a good guy but I had somehow made it all worst. \nMostly because of the door muffing my voice, I shouted and told her I did my fucking best being a good guy for the people around me.( but I do confess that there was a trace of anger and aggression.) She told me to fuck off and I ended up sleeping in the other bedroom.\n\n\nToday at work I was getting bombarded with messages from her friend's on how I am being a complete moron and should better bring a box of her favorite chocolates by the time I reach home.\n\n\nI am at a local library now, honestly a bit stressed out....I genuinely need some help and even constructive criticism is welcome.\n\nI honestly might be the asshole, this is probably more of a confirmation. I am ready to listen to criticism and improve myself in any way possible.\nI am just stressed out.",

      "description": "So my friends and I are all in a discord server together where we talk, play games, and generally have a good time together. A few weeks ago I had this idea to basically create starter pack memes of each of my friends poking fun at all the quirky and small things they do or have done. This went really well for the first few of my friends as I quickly slopped together some Google images and pasted them in mspaint. \n\nHowever, we have this one friend, we'll call him T, who is generally kind of recognized as the pretentious friend of the group. As I worked my way through each of my friend's memes, T takes notice and asks for a starter pack of himself. I tell him that he'll have to wait until I get through some of the other people's before I started working on his. He obliges initially for a little while, but then he begins to become a little more persistent while also requesting that I pull no punches on his, making sure to really \"push his shit in.\" His words, not mine. Anyway, I finish up and begin working on his  starter pack when he says that anything relating to him \"acting smarter than he actually is\" is low effort and unoriginal.\n\nHere's the thing about T. I mentioned that he was the \"pretentious\" friend, but in general he's a pretty good guy. However, sometimes, he gets too big for his britches and I feel like I need to knock him down a few pegs, so hearing that I should pull no punches on his starter pack, I went all out on him. Over the next couple of days, I made a giant collage of all the weird and strange things he tends to do, but also went after all of his deepest insecurities in making his starter pack as he had requested.\n\nAfter it was all done, I immediately thought that perhaps I had gone a little too far. However, persistent as he is, T demanded that I post it. I really hesitated posting it, even going so far as to make him sign a \"consent form\" for what he was about to see. I upload the image and immediately T shits on it, calling it unoriginal, low effort, disappointing, and 0/10. I felt a little bad as I had worked on this for a few days only for it to be put down, but whatever.\n\nHowever, things got weird from here. Following this, T completely and suddenly disappears off discord and cuts all communications with the friend group for the next two weeks, deleting his discord account one week in. Rightfully so, the whole group starts to get increasing worried about his whereabouts as we try to contact him to no avail. A few hours ago, though, one of my other friends broke through to him to ask what happened to him, only to learn that he left because of the image that I had posted.\n\nAm I the asshole? Did I go too far in trying to roast him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I've had a couple of issues with accounts getting hacked, before being with current GF but she is aware that for me this has been issue, and that I reticent about sharing accounts because of this.\n\nI originally started sharing a Netflix account with her. A few months later I suddenly get a warning that someone logged in on Netflix on another country. Worried about it, but seeing as it was from my GF's homecountry, I asked her about it and yes, she had given account access to her mother. I told her I didn't appreciate it the fact that she didn't ask me about it first, honestly if she had done so I wouldn't have had an issue with it. \n\nAbout a week later, I get another notification, same country. Took me longer to find out, but apparently her mother had given her brother the account as well. Now I was pissed, because at this point I felt like I had no control over who was using my account. She was telling me her mother didn't think anything of it, which fine, I think it's rude but let's give her the benefit of the doubt. I told my GF that if there were going to be more new login or access requests to please tell me first and I would be fine with it. It costs me nothing per month, and it's a major plus for them. \n\nBut then this dude started to log in on different devices, and I got in about 2 weeks repeated log in notifications from Netflix (about one every 2-3 days), and every time I would ask my GF to please check with her family. Every time it was. The tipping point came when my subscription got changed, supposedly I guess because the maximum number of simultaneous devices had been reached, and her bro (according to her not knowing English) just saw some pop-up  and clicked \"OK\" to continue and watch whatever. \n\nI was mad at this, I felt that at the very best case scenario her brother did not give a shit about using someone else's service, not understanding that this was lent as a favor, and should be letting me or my GF know before hand when logging in or asking if he didn't know what he was doing. At the worst, I now had a bunch of unknowns using my account. \n\nMy GF ended up getting her own Netflix account, which to me is a relief. But she still says I am a mayor asshole for making a big deal out of nothing and still gets incredibly upset when the topic comes up.\n\nI honestly fail to see how sharing something of mine with people I have never met, but asking the to notify me on Whatsapp/FB/Skype/whatever before logging in on different devices is asking for THAT much. Especially having told my GF time and again that sharing accounts and passwords is difficult for me in general. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I a paranoid asshole here? Or is she being unfairly critical of what she sees as distrust in her family? I honestly would be just as mad if it were my siblings or best friends doing this.",

      "description": "\nSo I have not spoken to my brother in almost a year. I live in Virginia and he lives in Las Vegas. My mother told me months ago he was engaged to be married, but I never received an invitation. I have not spoken to him in over a year because he decided to spout off a bunch of anti military 'your husband is just a killer' B.S. two days after my husband left on deployment. (Myself, or my husband do not expect people to kiss his ass, if that's my brother's opinion then whatever, but going off about it two days after my husband left was inappropriate and poor timing IMO. He was extremely rude and explosive about his opinion and said my husband would deserve whatever happened to him on deployment, if he was hurt or killed, because the U.S. was responsible for the deaths of innocent people)\n\nAnyway, yesterday out of the blue, he sends me a messenge on facebook asking me if I would fly to Vegas to be at his wedding in October. I said I would see what I could do because I would flying with two young children across country because my husband would be deployed again. Also, a cross country ticket and hotel in Vegas is pretty pricey. He seemed happy with this answer and said he would let me know definite dates soon. And that was it. \n\nI was a little upset after this exchange for a few reasons:\n\n1) He never acknowledged we haven't spoken for a year, or that he said some messed up stuff to me, about my husband. \n\n2) My son is two and half and he has never acknowledged that his nephew exsists. He never congratulated me on this pregnancy or his birth. Never asks me about him or acknowledges him in anyway.\n\n3) He knows I'm pregnant again, due in four weeks and have been extremely ill throughout with HG and liver problems and never asked if I was ok, how I was doing or about the baby. I've been hospitalized a few times, all of which he knows about because my mother tells him about it. \n\n4) He's always crying that family should support family no matter what when he has something going on,  but is never supportive of any family when they have something going. I.E. he was still living in the same town as my older brother when his daughter was born, but never went to the hospital to see her and didnt bother to meet her until a family event months later. \n\nAfter thinking about all of this, I didn't see why I even should spend the money and go through the headache of long flight with two small children. However my parents and some family members have told me I am being petty and should just be a good sister and go. To the point where I'm starting to question if they're being ridiculous or if I'm really just being petty.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I just say fuck it, like he has for so long?",

      "description": " I am conflicted in my self about this matter, please help resolve.\n\nHappened on the last Friday, I am an engineering student and had an exam on Friday on physics 2.\n\nBringing a calculator was a bliss because there were very difficult calculations with integrals, so I finish the exams 2 hours after it started, I pack up and a student from a different faculty comes to me and asks for my calculator(he forgot his), I say no because I don't know him and I am going north so I won't stay in the city, he keeps asking until I say firmly no, afterwards he looks defeated and walks away...\n\nNow I go home and ask my wife about this, she says I did the correct thing, but let me point couple of thing.\n\nI love to help, I rarely deny my help if someone asks.\n\nThe exams indeed required a calculator because there was a specific question that asked a question in this format 0.234 and not 1/2(the exam was hard af too)\n\nI felt kinda bad for not helping him for the reason that in Israel after the army you are a part of the country brotherhood in a sense, most of the people act very friendly to each other...(except the elderly who still show racism toward Russians).\n\nI had a spare one at home.\n\nAfter couple days of reviewing my actions and the situation I kinda wanna go for the not an asshole, but something prevents me from doing it.\n\nSide not: after reading my post it appears it is very difficult portraying this situation properly, but still AITA?",

      "description": "I have a close friend who has a habit of flaking out on plans last minute. She has cancelled on me for shaky reasons and then made plans with other people the same night more than once before. Last night, I reached breaking point.\n\nMy friend and I had plans to go to pub quiz yesterday, plans which which we had for a few weeks and I was really looking forward to. In the afternoon, she text me to say she was off work sick (which is definitely true if it makes a difference) and therefore wouldn't be coming out at night. This isn't the problem, at the time I sent her back an understanding text and said it was no problem, just focus on getting better.\n\nWe were supposed to go to the pub quiz for 9pm. At 10pm, she posts an Instagram story of her at another bar having a drink with another friend.\n\nHonestly I was angry. I'm not sure whether it's personal to me or she's just generally flakey but I was hurt since this is a developing pattern.\n\nHere's the kicker: it's her birthday on Friday and I just bought her a ticket to see a performer I know she really likes. It was expensive relative to my budget.\n\nI'm considering keeping it for myself. I don't really feel like giving a thoughtful birthday gift to someone who has repeatedly treated me thoughtlessly. If I kept it, I'd just get her a generic gift like a box of chocolates or a small gift card.\n\nWIBTA? ",

I'm from an unspecified Slavic country and I'm determined to move to an English speaking country in not-extremely-far future, because I just don't like my country and my language for various reasons. I avoid online communities speaking my language and reside on the English part of the internet except when talking with irl friends online. The only emotional ties I have to here are to my parents (no extended family at all). I have a very good relationship with my mother with whom I live (I'm a student and plan to leave to move from her shortly I find a job after finishing studies). She only speaks our mother language. I consider my English to be very good and same goes for my dad.\n\nWith my mom I've been discussing my plans about moving abroad with which she doesn't have a problem. In fact both my parents were always pushing me into moving abroad in future/working abroad in future, even though they were always looking more at non-English speaking European countries. I told her that if I had kids abroad, she'd have to learn English to communicate with them since I'll rarely come back and so I feel they'd literally be learning my language just because of her. She told me that I'd basically cut her off from them and that I should not be selfish and shouldn't only think of myself. I understand she'd like to be able to talk with her grandchildren if she had any (I'm the only child), but I personally feel that it would be more selfish to teach kids a language they would barely have any use for while I could spend time teaching them something actually useful like French or German.",

      "description": "I am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.",

      "description": "I have a half sister who is 11 years old. My mom is a single mother. I've grown up taking care of my sister and almost serving as a parent figure in her life. My cousin found her twitter I guess and saw that she had quoted something with the word \"bitch\" in it (it was like don't be a bitch, be happy or something along the lines of that), she screenshot it and let my mom know. My mom and I talked about it in private since she doesn't really understand Twitter and how it works. I told my mom that, yeah we should talk to her about being careful about what she says, especially on the internet but to not worry because when you're in middle school you think cussing makes you \"cool\". I reminded her that I did it as well on my \"fan account\" on twitter and that was she said wasn't even bad. My sister's account didn't have her picture or name on it, if that's an important factor. It wasn't an urgent matter so we didn't address it right away although we obviously planned to. Literally 2 hours after she texted my mom, my cousin decided it was her place to call my sister and lecture her over the phone. I was sitting next to her and could hear my cousin lecturing her and it made me absolutely furious. I told my sister to hand me the phone and I blew up. I started by saying \"That's really not your place\" and she started saying that we weren't dealing with it (IT'S NOT HER JOB TO HANDLE THE SITUATION ANYWAY). That made me even more angry and I told her that she wasn't her mom or her sister and that she needed to mind her own business. Notifying us was enough but it is absolutely NOT HER JOB to lecture my sister. She texted me a half-assed apology. Basically one of those \"I'm sorry IF YOU FEEL blah blah blah\" basically not taking responsibility or seeing anything wrong with her actions. I responded saying that it wasn't her place and that my mom and I had talked about it and she just went ahead and assumed that we weren't dealing with it and had the audacity to call my sister and lecture her. She responded saying that she was calm about lecturing my sister and that I had no reason to be mad (I beg to differ) and I responded with \"It doesn't matter how you delivered it, it was wrong. Period. You were out of place. We talked to her about it and it felt like you were undermining not only me but my mom by calling her. You're not her parent. Like I said, I understand the concern but it's not your job to call her and lecture her.\" My cousin is neither a mom nor a big sister and knows nothing about handling middle school children anway. Even if she did it's not her job to call someone else's child and lecture them. Am I the asshole for blowing up?",

The reason I did this is because I honestly have an awful memory and idk if this is perverted or weird or what but I would just like to remember majority of my sexual experiences? And keeping pictures of the guys is sort of like a visual diary or something anyway. \n\nAnyway, fast forward to now, I’m in a relationship, we’ve been dating for about 7 months now and it’s gotten to the point where I’m totally comfortable sharing everything with him, even the passcode to my iPhone. \n\nThis is where the trouble started. \n\nI hadn’t actually hooked up with anyone in almost a year before I met my current boyfriend, so because I didn’t make any updates to the folder of past hookups, I completely forgot I even had it (terrible memory). \n\nSo last night, BF is on my phone when he shows me the folder full of guys faces and asks me what it is. I didn’t think it was a big deal and I thought we were comfortable enough with each other that I actually laughed when he showed me. But when I told him what it was he completely lost his shit, saying it’s “super fucked up” and threw the phone at me and left and now he isn’t replying to my calls or messages. \n\nI managed to explain that they were all hookups from long before we even met and that I forgot I even had the folder in the first place but he just accused me of lying and asked when I would be putting his picture in there (yikes).\n\nSo AITA for having this folder in the first place?\n\n... and AITA for not wanting to get rid of it now?",

      "description": "Obligatory apology for being a mobile user and for using a throw away account!\n\nFor some context, I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about 4 years, living together for almost three years.\n\nPreviously, we had a very happy relationship. This was someone I could envision myself spending the rest of my life with. However, the last year or so I’ve been growing more and more discontent. I’ve noticed a decline in his personal hygiene and the amount of effort he puts into our relationship.\n\nI feel completely unappreciated. I do most of the cleaning, purchase most of our food, give him as many rides as I can, and initiate sex more often than not. Lately he’ll just fall asleep on me if I try to get us to do anything of that nature.\n\nI’ve brought these issues up multiple times. I’ve tried to be as compassionate as possible. I KNOW that some are the issues are because he is depressed. We’ve talked about it at length. I also suffer from depression and anxiety, but I have been to therapy and he has not. I have given him links to several different programs for “affordable” mental healthcare, but I know he hasn’t followed up with any of it. \n\nAny time I try to talk about ANY of our issues, he either gets irrationally angry with me or completely shuts down and refuses to talk at all. He’ll tell me what I want to hear or go into self destruction mode, saying that he’s the shittiest person in the world (which I do not agree with, obviously).\n\nI just feel at this point that I CAN’T talk to him about how I’m feeling at all. I don’t want to keep harping on the same issues. I don’t want to pressure him into having sex with me. I don’t want him to tell me what I want to hear. This is why I had the thought of just writing a letter or something, completely detailing everything that I’ve been having issues with. I’m just afraid of that blowing up in my face as well.\n\nI’m not sure exactly what my next move should be. I want to work through these issues, not just immediately give up on our relationship. This is the only thing I can think of that would allow me to get all of my thoughts out in a cohesive manner, but I’m afraid of him taking it the wrong way.\n\nSo, Reddit, would writing this letter make me the asshole? Is there a better way to handle this that I can’t see? ",

I know these complaints will go nowhere but I’m getting fed up and would like to at least pretend that I can make my voice heard. I apologize for any cruelty that may come across in the following message:\n\n   \n I bought a pizza. I was not given a pizza. I bought a dessert that came with ice cream. I did not receive ice cream. I don’t understand why that’s not enough information. I really liked your service when I first discovered it a couple years ago. Now, it seems as though the service quality has totally dropped, you pay your dashers slave wages without even compensation for gas, you even seem to take their tips from what I’ve heard from my friends who are drivers, and you increase the prices of dishes to get more money, while still taking advantage of the dashers who actually do the work and provide the service. I’ve recommended the service over competitors and used it despite obscenely high delivery fees but you can be assured that won’t be happening any longer. I am extremely disappointed in your management. If you could send this to anyone who might actually care and be able to do something to rectify this repugnant behavior, I would appreciate it.  \n \n\nSincerely,\n\nA dissatisfied customer\"",

His dad has remarried and has been with his wife for 5 years. I found out my son has been bullying a special needs kid at school with a speech impediment. He got in school suspension for 3 days and when he came home from school, his stepmother spanked him. It was with her hand and there's no bruising but he told me it hurt a lot and I'm fucking pissed. She also made him write an apology letter to the student and grounded him for 2 weeks with no electronics. His father works long hours so his stepmom feels entitled because she's a stay at home wife and she's with him more but it's not okay.\nI'm very upset at what my son did and he absolutely deserved to be punished but this woman had no right to touch my kid. His father supports what she did and gave her permission and I'm ready to raise hell. I need her to learn her place as a stepparent NOT a parent.",

      "description": "I'm pretty mad right now, and of course I wouldn't \"flip\" but I'm really tired of being nice about this. \n\nThe cat box has become an issue between us. We live in a small apartment and it's in a closet off of our living room, so the smell can creep into our living room when not taken care of.  She cleans it once every four days (scoops just the clumps and never replacing the litter entirely or scrubbing the box at all) and honestly our apartment just smells like cat litter and poop. I've had to become complacent because every time I explain to her nicely that I pay the rent just like her and would appreciate if she cleaned it every 1-2 days instead, especially since he's a big cat and lays huge turds. Every time I asked her, she would get kind of defensive and would tell me that I jump all over her every time she makes a mistake, and that she's only human. I get that she is only human, but this happens a lot.\n\nI just got back from a week of spring break. She left the day after me, and is coming home in about two hours. I come inside and it REEKS. I check the cat box room, and lo and behold, it's full of shit. She let shit fester in our house for a week. Took the cat with her, but left the litter.\n\nI don't know how to approach her about this. If anything, I am moving out in May. But I am just so, so livid. Especially after talking to her multiple times and it being known that the cat box is a source of serious contention between us. \n\n\nWIBTA if I said something, expressing how angry I am about this? Or do I have to say it calmly, again, that her cat box cleaning habits are fucking disgusting? Or not say anything because I am moving soon?\n\nP.S. Love the cat tho. He's a good boy. \n\n",

My mom who was sitting next to him asked me why I replied like that (implying it was an asshole thing to do) and I explained to her (and also for my nephew to know) that he had asked me a few minutes ago and I told him I’d let him know when he could play (my computer is updating, takes a while) and I’m not going to let him ask me every 5 minutes just because his mom lets him do that to her. \n\nI did say “he’s got to learn, so I’m not going to put up with that. I told him I’d let him know, but now I decided I’m not going to let him play on my computer, so if he asks me again the answer will continue to be Never” which I think sounds a bit asshole-ish but he’s 9 years old and his mother made the big mistake to make him think he can argue with adults over everything so whenever he wants something or doesn’t want to do something he thinks he can argue to get his way, and when it comes to his mom he pretty much always succeeds, which I find frustrating not only because it makes the child increasingly annoying but because I know that he will suffer a lot more in the long run when his little tantrums don’t get him what he wants in the real world. \n\nAlso, I can’t explain any of this to him cause he’s friggin 9, that’s self-explanatory, and his mom because she has a very fragile ego and she takes any parenting tips as a direct criticism of her abilities and immediately shuts down any conversation about the topic by talking louder and louder until it becomes a shouting match (she is also very immature so when she “argues” with her son she goes down to his level and says the most cringeworthy things you can’t believe it’s an actual adult speaking)...\n\nAnyway, so AITA for trying to educate my nephew through some “tough love”? (Or in other words, AITA for denying him something he wants because he whines to get his way and I repeatedly told him that it doesn’t work like that with me?)",

      "description": "Important to note that I’m a huge animal lover. I’ve rescued a handful of stray dogs and two stray cats from the streets, however I am not a vegan or vegetarian.\n\nI’ve been dating this guy for close to six months now. Everything’s been going really well except he recently surprised me with tickets to Sea World. Although I appreciated the gesture, I explained that I don’t think I would want to visit a place that is so cruel to its animals and was surprised he didn’t know the living conditions of the animals there. He got defensive and said that Sea World rescues animals from the ocean and that it’s hypocritical of me to say all this when I eat meat (he’s sort of a pescatarian—only eats sushi a couple times a year). He said he had already spent the money and the ticket isn’t refundable, so either way, Sea World has already benefited from the money whether we like it or not and we might as well go if that’s the case (he said we won’t have to eat any of the food there and won’t buy any souvenirs—essentially we won’t be giving them any more money than he’s already spent).\n\nStill, I don’t feel right going to Sea World because I don’t support the establishment. I understand that the money has been spent and it’ll go to waste if we don’t go, but I told him I just didn’t want to go. He doesn’t seem to understand this and keeps saying that Sea World isn’t all that bad and that they help animals too. I’m frustrated that he doesn’t see the cruelty behind their actions and because I love animals, I’m really considering breaking up over this. I can’t tell if I’m overreacting or not but all I know is I’ve always wanted an SO who, at the very least, cares about animals.",

      "description": "The tile probably does make me sound like the a**hole, but let me just explain it all. \n\n          My friend (14F), I’ll call her Ashley, went through a state of depression during the end of the last school year. I (14F) was very close with her up through that but then when I started 8th grade I realized that I actually didn’t like being around her. The bad things hadn’t started yet though. \n\n       A couple months ago Ashley came over to my house and told me that she had started doing drugs. Not cocaine or anything, but weed and experimental things like cough syrup. Also, weed is legal where I live, but certainly not for minors. It’s not for medicinal purposes or anything, either, she just does it for fun. And okay, yes, if I’m being honest, I don’t know that much about drugs and how safe they are, but I just don’t want to associate myself with anything that could end up hurting me or my future. \n\n        So I didn’t do weed with her when she invited me and now I’m beginning to subtly push her away. At least I thought it was subtle. Ashley  said before that she didn’t expect me to pick up the phone when she called. I think she knows I’m pushing her away. She was already very clingy and used to call me every day to ask to hang out, so she still called a lot, just without an answer. \n\nI’m worried that if I directly tell her that I don’t want to be her friend that she would go back into a state of depression, because she got close to hurting herself last time. She missed about a month of school because of it. I’ve begun going to therapy too because all she is is a negative energy in my life. \n\n\nTo sum it up: I feel awful about trying to leave my friend who went through intense depression  recently but she started experimenting with drugs and I don’t want to put me or my future at risk. She’s also manipulative naturally and I still wouldn’t want to be her friend even without the drugs. AITA??",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons\n\nOkay so I'll give some necessary background information, I'll put an TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nOne of my friends is really rich, and the first of us to get married. We'll call her Mia from now on. In our friend group we have 'karen', now Karen has always been a bit defensive and hostile towards Mia. Not enough to have Mia notice this but enough for me to notice.\n\nMia never made a big deal about being rich, whenever we planned a girls night we would have dinner as places all of us could afford, but she would always cover us if needed. Her gifts for us were always personal, and it took Karen at least a year being in our friend group to discover Mia is rich.\n\nNow upon hearing about Mia's engagement it came to no ones surprise that we would be her bridesmaids. Now I have to say I've known Mia the since high-school so I know that she has been low-key planning her wedding for years. So Mia is going all out, it will be a themed destination wedding. Now before anyone says anything about it being a destination wedding she will pay for anyone's travel expenses, she will also pay for all our custom made dresses.\n\nNow here is the issue were I could the potential a-hole. Karen is one of the bridesmaids and I've heard through some other friends, that aren't invited to the ceremony, they are for the reception that takes place at a later date in our country so more people are able to attend. That Karen is badmouthing Mia to a lot of other friends, saying how she is unreasonable, spoiled and a b-word for wanting her dream wedding apparently. Now Mia has no idea yet, and might throw Karen out of the bridal party if she knows, Mia may be sweet but has a low tolerance for people who are nasty behind her back.\n\nNow of course I don't want Karen to act like this to Mia, I'm not even sure why she is in our close friend group. Although I am not sure if it is my place to tell Mia about this.\n\nSo WIBTA if I tell Mia about Karen's behaviour and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.\n\nTL;DR my friend is getting married and generous enough to pay for everything, another bridesmaid is being nasty behind her back and now I want to reveal the truth about her and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.

      "description": "Bit of a backstory, a few months ago during the summer I moved in with my Dad, since my Mom was moving across country with my siblings. I didn’t want to move because I am currently doing my GCSEs in school and moving would’ve meant moving schools and restarting my ongoing coursework for my exams.\n\nFor Christmas 2017 (when I was living with my Mom) my Mom bought me a new Phone as my main present with some clothes and chocolate. It was all nice and I was very thankful, and showed my appreciation by helping with preparing the Christmas food and helping clean up. It was a great Christmas altogether.\n\nWhen I moved into to my Dad’s house 6months later my Mom didn’t say anything about returning the phone to her, since she did pay for it. But this Christmas, my dad bought me the newest iPhone. When I went up to my Mom’s house to spend Christmas with her side of the family, my Mom asked if my Dad bought me the phone, I said yes. My Mom got weird and said something under her breath to my Aunt and I got a bit pissed and asked ‘what was that?’, since she’s always badmouthing my Dad to my other siblings. She replied in an offended tone, ‘Glad to see where his priorities lie’. I asked her what she meant by this. And she went off saying about how he never buys by siblings stuff (which was a lie, he bought my siblings a lot of clothes and toys) and buys be a brand new £1000 iPhone. \n\nI told her I needed a new one since my old one was running very slow. So she asked if she can have it back. I said ‘Why? You bought it for me for Christmas.’ And she said that it’s hers since she bought it for me, regardless of whether she gave it to me as a present, I need to give it back to her.\n\nSo I refused since it was a Christmas present for me, I shouldn’t have to return it just because my dad bought me one.\n\nDoes this make me the asshole?",

      "description": "Need some insight here. My wife has a very “old school” or traditional way of viewing how a marriage/relationship works. It all started when we met about 9 years ago. She would expect me to pay on our dates etc. (This is normal, I get courtship, and continued doing this for some time) until things got more serious. 2 years or so into our relationship we began splitting tabs when going out etc. we made roughly the same income and were students at the time... little did I know that she resented me for this.. she hated splitting the tab and bills after we moved into together. She always believed the man should be the breadwinner. Despite us both graduating from college and getting good jobs, I still feel the tension is there. We now combine all of our finances. I make roughly double her income now... but I know that if I made less than her, we would probably argue a lot more. Her mindset is even applied outside of finances. She simply believes that the man should take the burden of everything. She believes her gender allows her a free pass to bend the rules. We fight about this constantly. I feel that she has a double standard when it comes to our relationship. She can spend money on things because she needs them, but I’m rarely ever allowed to spend money without her complaining. Funny thing is that when it comes to chores, she wants 50/50 in that area.. seems pretty convenient... She’s like a “selective” traditional gal. Fall back on her gender roles when it’s convenient for her, but become a feminist when it’s not. \n\nI’m at my wits end about this. \n\nSo AITA for believing this?? Counseling is certainly an option, but I don’t know how much it will help. It appears we have fundamental differences in values. ",

      "description": "I'm an university student and I always want to work well and have good grades. Therefore, I ways do all the homework and study a lot.\n\nLast semester, my friends and I had some group project to do and there were 4 (small) papers we had to submit, one per month. The professor gave us a grade for each and it counted for 20% of the yearly grade for this class. I was really motivated to get good grades and so I organised the group work. I told my friends to review all the stuff we had to so we could talk about it the next week and do what we have to do. One of the friends (R) did nothing though, and since he was not informed, he did not participate in the first group project. \n\nIt was the same for the 3 other papers. R did not do anything, all he did was text us to ask if we want to do it or if we already did it. He never took action and did his part as he was supposed to. When I once asked him to do something, he just asked another group for their solutions instead of actually doing it. It would have taken 10-15min! \n\nThe problem for me is that I really hate people who profit off of other people's work. It's not about grades or time spent but it's a matter of principle. Furthermore, R is overall a very negative person who makes derogative comments about people/friends and talks behind their back. Every time I see him, he's also complaining about everything and anything. As I am a very positive and happy person, I don't like this attitude at all.\n\nRecently, R asked me for some help for a homework. I told him no and that he should please just ignore me. AITA for not wanting this person in my life because I do not like his attitude and behaviour? I should add that we were good friends before, but we didn't meet outisde of university a lot.",

I feel like its just so boyish and not sexy at all seeing him in briefs and asked him a lot to try boxer briefs or boxers. I even bought him pairs of calvin klein boxer briefs because he wears the brief version but he said he didn't like them. Everytime I see him in briefs I just know he'd look way better in boxer briefs because he's really fit and works out a lot. He said he likes briefs because he gets the most support from them (his balls are pretty big I guess). Also he's been having slight pain in his nuts and he said his doc said to wear briefs.

      "description": "This is gonna be a long one - TL;DR at the bottom but I’d appreciate it if you stuck around for the whole story because this has been bothering me for months.\n\nBackground information: I’m (M18) transgender, but my ex (M19) knew me before I came out. I’m going to call him Jeff for this post. We met in middle school and ended up going to the same high school too, but we had an extremely rocky friendship (even longer story so I’m skipping it) until the end of my sophomore year when he convinced me to join a club at our school. We started hanging out a lot during my junior year, and I developed a crush on both him and my now-girlfriend about that October. I had come out to him two weeks previous and he was chill about it, but I knew he was straight so I figured if I asked him out, he’d just reject me and I could move on with my life since that avenue was entirely closed and ask out my current girlfriend instead.\n\nTo my surprise, he said yes anyway. The way he said yes should have been my first red flag. He said, “Well, you’re a dude, so I won’t date you, but we can be friends with benefits.” Now, I was stupid and felt validated and was shocked so I said sure and we made out in his car. When he took me home after that, I felt weird, like I wasn’t really myself? It’s hard to describe, but I found myself staring at my reflection in the mirror and feeling off for a while that night. I brushed it off at the time, but it’ll come back up later.\n\nOver the next two weeks, he slowly warmed up to the idea of us dating. These are the next red flags. He asked me if he could call me his girlfriend, which I was so...weirded out that I was left speechless. We also did a lot of semi-public making out and third base which made me sort of uncomfortable but I wanted the relationship (one that I felt I barely could even have in the first place considering the circumstances) to work so I didn’t say anything and just went along with it when he’d ask to make out for an hour in his car or for me to give him a handjob.\n\nEventually my own anxiety caught up with me and I impulsively broke it off that December. He seemed crushed, as he was finally developing romantic feelings for me, but the addition of romantic pressure to what I recognized was mounting discomfort with physical stuff (particularly because the dynamic of the physical stuff made me feel like “the girl” of the relationship) was too much for me so I nipped it in the bud to save myself.\n\nIf only I had listened to my gut and my raging dysphoria.\n\nHe ended up dating a girl pretty soon after and I started dating my current girlfriend for the first time (our first relationship was pretty dry because we were both pretty awkward so we broke it off after a few months, but we’re extremely happy and almost at 6 months going strong this time around!). However, after we had both broken up with/been broken up with our SOs, he asked me if I wanted to try a relationship again in June. We had been best friends the whole time we were broken up, so it wasn’t hard for feelings to be rekindled there and I agreed.\n\nThis time he upped the ante sexually and every single time we hung out he’d ask for some sort of sexual act, usually a blowjob but sometimes more. He’d also ask me if he could do things to me that made me extremely dysphoric (touching certain parts of my body for extended periods of time and using certain language) and I’d tell him no repeatedly but he’d still ask almost every time we hung out. Our relationship continued into my senior year, which worked because he was in college but living at home. We only saw one another on weekends, time that became unspoken “his time” with me.\n\nI barely hung out with my friends outside of school functions that year because all of my weekends were taken up with Jeff. He didn’t have any friends at college (this probably will come off as biased but everyone I’ve known from high school agrees that he has a weird superiority-inferiority complex that leads him to not give people the time of day if they’re not “smart enough” for him) and his high school friends largely went elsewhere except for two of them.\n\nMost of our time in person and over text was taken up with him talking about his interests and his financial problems with me just having to go along with the conversation and him asking for sexual favors (either sexting, which I was uncomfortable with, or actual sex, which I increasingly turned down out of the crippling anxiety/dysphoria it gave me and actual physical pain it caused me in some circumstances). Because I was in senior year, more and more of my time was taken up with college applications and big projects, so I started saying no to more and more invitations to hang out.\n\nI will admit that that’s not always the only reason I said no, as he was becoming clingy and demanding to the point where just thinking about the weekend made me uncomfortable. I tried my best to communicate my discomfort to him, to the point where I broke down crying on his bed trying to explain my discomfort when he kept asking me for a blowjob when we were watching a movie. After I finished crying, he asked me again and coerced me into putting his dick in my mouth, after which I broke down crying again and asked if he could drive me home. He did, and that was the last time we hung out, as after that I would both deflect for OBVIOUS REASONS! and also because AP exams were approaching and I needed to study.\n\nThe night before one of my exams, he texted me asking if I could come over. I said no, I was studying and had an exam the next day, but he then launched into a long message about how I was avoiding him and “he never had this much work in senior year and he had taken much harder classes than I did” (which may be true on some level as he was taking engineering classes, but I was still taking 4 AP classes, a dual enrollment math class, and an intensive film seminar where I had to make my own short film that was due in a few weeks, so the comparison wasn’t fair in my opinion). He threw out a few different arguments all with the intent to keep me from studying for an exam (including but not\nlimited to making fun of the college I committed to when it’s literally the same college he goes to!) I paid $93 dollars for just so I could give him a blowjob and cuddle him for two hours maximum. I had had enough at that point and told him as such and ended the conversation.\n\nWe didn’t talk much from there and two weeks later he broke up with me, citing how distant I was for the previous few months. As he was breaking up with me, he asked if we could “still cuddle sometimes” to which I said yes, mostly because I didn’t want to burn the bridge at that point, didn’t want him to be upset with me (as he had fallen into a depression in the past over ended relationships), and was riding the relief high of no longer being trapped in the relationship.\n\nFor clarity, I didn’t break up with him myself because I was too scared of disappointing him or at worst sending him spiraling into depression. He was still my best friend, and I cared about him, but I know my choice to sour our romantic relationship without talking to him properly was a very very bad one. I apologized to him for it the day we broke up and he seemed to understand and forgave me.\n\nWe broke up a week before prom, so I ended up going with a group of friends (he didn’t even want to go to prom so this was the plan anyway). It was a great night that I still remember well, except for what happened afterwards. My best friend who we’ll call Nina planned on having a get-together afterwards. We usually had holiday parties or afterparties at her house so this was normal, with the only difference being the very small number of people coming to her house this time around (only like 7, two of whom left before the sleepover portion and one of whom being her boyfriend who was on break from college). Jeff asked her a few days before prom if she was having a party, to which she said yes. No other words were exchanged - he didn’t ask what kind of party, how many people, times, and not if he was invited.\n\nAt midnight, we hear the doorbell ring. I’m upstairs in the spare bedroom (which is on the third floor, for reference) with my current-girlfriend and her then-best friend while Nina, her boyfriend, and our other friend are in the kitchen downstairs. I don’t hear who it is or know what’s going on until a few minutes later. Jeff and his friend are standing in the doorway of the spare bedroom. Nina is standing behind him looking EXTREMELY uncomfortable as he just stands there, smiling awkwardly and not saying anything.\n\nMy CGF asks him what he’s doing here, to which he responds that they were coming back from a metal show and decided to stop by since they were in the area. Keep in mind this is a private party, it was literally the middle of the night, Nina’s parents and sister were sleeping on the second floor, and he had shown up unannounced and with an additional person most of us weren’t really friends with. And he thought this was okay.\n\nHe doesn’t leave until every single person there expresses to him that they’re not going to speak with him until he leaves (apparently he had specifically asked Nina where I was so he could come talk to me, which he should have realized was weird because we hadn’t spoken sense the breakup). When asked about it repeatedly after the fact by me and other people, he refuses to see that he did anything weird, wrong, or otherwise.\n\nAfter that, talking was a bit awkward so I asked him if we could take a bit of a break from our friendship too, as I knew he wasn’t totally over me and I wasn’t totally over my own discomfort being around him (multiplied by that weird encounter after prom).\n\nThe longer we didn’t have contact, though, the more I realized that - not to be dramatic - I m",

I met up a girl from tinder 2 weeks ago, went out on a nice date a few drinks etc nothing crazy left on good terms and agreed to meet again.\n\nLast weekend we meet up and do the same, a few drinks have a good time get to know each other. Towards the end of the night I suggest we go back to hers. She agrees and we grab a drink for the road. While at hers we get intimacy but she doesn't want to have sex, admitally I'm a little thrown off by this but we chat about it and it's fine, there are other alternatives. \n\nAnyway so here's my slip up, I run to the bathroom and when I come back I tell her I'm not looking to get involved in a relationship, I thought she felt the same way but wanted to make sure. I was wrong apparently and we had a chat about what she did want, she decided she wanted someone commited to her 100%..\n\nI understand my timing was probably the worst it could have been but I wanted to do right by her and not lead her on - I'd rather make it clear earlier than wait until feelings might have time to develop..\nWe talk a bit more and decide it's best if I go home - I get a cab home.. \n\nA few days later I message to apologise and for upsetting her. She says she's not upset just thrown off and feel like I'd thrown her efforts &amp; advances back in her face.. She's since deleted me off all social media etc.\n\nI know the ship has sailed, clearly we're not meant to be and that's fine - I just can't help feeling like a bit of a twat for how it all went down, am I a complete asshole in this situation or just a bit? \n\n\nP.S sorry for the rant",

      "description": "Throwaway because my roommate knows my Reddit account.\n\nI live in a shared house with five other roommates off-campus at my university. I lived with one of these roommates last year and we got along well, but the other four are completely new.\n\nLast year, I lived in this house and we had a command hook in the bathroom that I would use to hang up my towel when I showered. While I was out of the country last summer, one my roommates (J) basically redecorated and refurbished the place. When I got back, the command hook was still there, so I hung my towel up there for the shower. Throughout the entirety of the fall semester, no one complained about this whatsoever. I assumed it was the same command hook that was there from last year, but in reality, J bought a new one and hung it up.\n\nAt the beginning of this month, I came home drunk from a bar and for some reason, J decided that 1:00am on a Saturday would be the best time to tell me that I could no longer use this command hook because he bought it and would like to use it to hang up his clothes while he showered. Drunk aitathrowaway1321 slurred \"yeah okay, whatever\" and went to bed. \n\nThe next morning, having absolutely zero memory of this conversation, I showered and then went to the gym to sweat out the hangover. After coming back, I jumped in the shower and noticed that my towel was missing! There was a little blue sticky note next to the hook that said \"missing something? Follow the sticky notes!\" I followed the sticky notes downstairs naked (because no towel) and was greeted with my towel hanging downstairs next to a sticky note that said \"bet you must've missed me after you came back from the gym! Next time, buy your own fucking command hook!\"\n\nI hung the towel on the bannister outside the bathroom to avoid a fight, but I chewed my roommate out for being passive aggressive and not talking to me beforehand. We still sometimes have arguments over this when I forgetfully hang the towel on this command hook, which he really only uses to hang his clothes on while he showers. I feel like his passive aggressive response and him getting angry at me is way overblown for this kind of situation; furthermore, it's kind of unreasonable for him to expect me to change my routine which bothered no one for five whole months! Furthermore, command hooks are literally like $2, so I feel like the response is disproportionate to the overall crime. This situation has also caused my other housemates to gang up on me too, so needless to say, I'm not too happy about it.\n\nAm I being an asshole for thinking that my roommate is being unreasonable? I'm trying to avoid a fight, but it's kinda hard to when all of my roommates are now ganging up on me about this. ",

I reported them but they ran of school grounds. A bit on my bike slipped on black ice and nearly crashed into someone who promptly screamed at my for nearly hitting her.\n\nFinally a bunch of old people were moving very slowly along the pavement so i rang my bell nothing, rang again nothing this continued 5 more times i thought they were death when one turned round and shouted \"STOP RINGING THAT FUCKING BELL!\" I was not expecting that and so i said \"Could you please move im in a hurry ( I was not).\" They said i either get on the road or i could sit behind them all the way to my destination i was really fed up at thos point BTW i was facing the oncoming traffic so i couldn't possibly get on the road i told them this and they just yelled \"well thats your bloody problem isnt it!\" At this point I was completely sick of them and threatened to run them over and that did the trick. \n\nSo AITA Im kind of thinking im not the a-hole but threatening to run them over is a bit harsh.\n\n",

      "description": "Okay so I (M22) am in the hospital and my wife (F21) has visited for many hours each day. On 11/18 I had a bowel perforation. This led to a surgery that removed 25cm of my bowels and I now have an ostemy bag for 3 months. While staying here in the hospital we have had many of her friends visit, and stay for many hours. She's received a ton of love, and her mom and sister drove 12 hours to be with her while I'm in the hospital. Dude that's awesome.\n\nSo I was getting better here until Thanksgiving when I threw up twice within 2 hours, and my diet was shot down from soft food to liquids. I had horrible acid reflux, my head was pounding, and my chest was on fire. We are laying in the hospital bed together when she goes to bite my shoulder. I pull away because a playful bite doesn't sound enjoyable right now. \n\nShe says \"you don't let me do that anymore\". I say \"well I don't really want it right now considering I've thrown up twice now\". She says \"you say that like this is so much harder for you than it is for me\". I don't respond other than apologize for being short with her. \n\nBut you know what. No. It is harder for me. Your life as a whole might feel hard, but two people you deeply love and say you miss came to spend thanksgiving with you! I am the one a few days out of surgery and am now having complications. Your situation in this is tough sure, but I would argue this is harder for me. You had a thanksgiving meal, and I ate nothing. You set foot outside the hospital with your family. I laid in bed all day and walked as the doctor would allow. You know what, my life in this situation is harder. I get this one",

      "description": "My son loves sports, actually he was a kid who seemed to keep to himself. He went through a stage in life when he really wasn't social. He's come out of his shell you can say. He's going to try out for the baseball team but he really wants to play football. I played football, it was some of the best times of my life. Made life long friends and loved playing.\n\nHe's going to be a sophomore in high school next year and wants to try out for the football team. They also train in the summer from what he's telling me at the school. A few of his friends are doing it and were on the team this year. \n\nI said yeah, I of course have no problem with it. My wife is pretty livid though, she's telling me that he isn't going to play and get seriously hurt. I basically told her he's going to play because he wants too, I don't see the big fucking deal. He's growing up, he's tall for his age, his friends are doing it, he loves sports. She told him she is going to refuse to sign whatever waiver they give, and if he goes to the practice she will show up and bring him home in front of everyone because she isn't joking. I did NOT expect her to be this livid about it. Of course it's me she's pissed at the most. Telling me I'm encouraging him while she is upset over this. It's going to be hard to convince me that he should not play. \n\nTo be fair, the game is safer right now than it's ever been, especially more than when I played. I told him he can play, she's basically saying no and that she WILL stop him and won't sign the waivers (even though you only need 1 signature I believe). I really don't plan on changing my mind about him playing. It's what he WANTS to do.",

      "description": "Throwaway because I’m honestly a little ashamed to be telling this story/asking this question. It’s long, I’m sorry. I’m trying to be thorough. \n\nA little backstory: shit’s been rough lately. I used to be very outgoing, very spunky, had many friends. I ran a small local business and was very involved in the community. I’ve never had many problems with friends before, at least not on my end (that anyone has told me about at least). I made friends relatively easily—though I was still picky and cautious about who I let get super close to me—and have never been the kind of girl who’s a gossip or has big falling outs with friends or lots of drama. For the most part, my friendships (definitely the close ones) last a long time...like years, decades long. \n\nBut almost three years ago I was in an accident and it fucked everything up. I broke my spine and got a brain injury. I’ve already had one surgery and we’re waiting on number two. I had to move back in with my parents and temporarily close my business. I cannot do a lot of basic things for myself...including bathing. It’s been extremely hard on me, not just physically, but also mentally. To add to the craziness, I was recently diagnosed with cancer, and then almost immediately after, sexually assaulted by my ex-boyfriend. It’s been a ride, y’all. \n\nBut over the last few months I’ve lost **everyone,** and I don’t know why. \n\nThree of my very best and closest girlfriends have straight up ghosted me. These girls helped me through my first surgery two years ago no problem. These were the girls who were my cheerleaders and helpers for my business, who threw me surprise birthday parties and called me when shit was going down in their lives. I thought we were ride or die. But when I asked girlfriend 1 (we’ll call her Micha) if she still had pictures of her wedding cake that I made for her a few years back, her answer was oddly distant and cold. When I tried to reply, I was blocked. No hints, no conversation, just blocked. \n\nI asked girlfriend 2 (let’s call her Kelly) about it to see if she knew what was wrong, and she brushed it off. “I think Micha was scared because you mentioned committing suicide (over a year ago).” This didn’t make any sense. Micha was the girlfriend I’d had the longest of the three, and she saw me through a horrible breakup in college where depression and suicide was mentioned. I did the same for her about a year later. That had never been a spooky topic before. And besides, that comment had happened over a year ago. I figured she just must need space and dropped it. \n\nThen maybe a month later, Kelly says life is too busy to continue talking to me, and she wants a break. She sends that message to me and at least one other mutual friend. I didn’t take it personally at the time because she was pulling away from everyone, not just me. I was concerned for her, but I wanted to respect her wishes so I told her that I loved her and whenever she was ready to chat and hangout again I would be here. \n\nBuuuut a month-ish after that is when my doctor first said “you might have cancer, I’m sending you to an oncologist.” I was freaked the fuck out. I felt so alone and scared and I didn’t want to tell my parents because it wasn’t a definite yet and I didn’t want to worry them. I needed my best friend so badly. So I called Kelly. She didn’t answer (which I expected), so I left her a tearful voicemail apologizing for calling and saying that I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful and invade her space, but the doc says I might have cancer and I was very scared. I just wanted a hug, honestly. She never returned my call. \n\nGirlfriend 3 (Nancy) moved to another state about a year ago, but we still stayed very close. Sending big birthday packages, long chats, lots of pictures back and forth and keeping each other very involved. She was supposed to be coming home soon and promised to visit, as my place is right down the road from her parents. But suddenly she stopped messaging too, around the same time as Kelly. I finally sent her a text that just said “Nancy, I have something important to tell you.” after the diagnosis was confirmed. She said “So do I. You go first.” I asked her if she could FaceTime, but she said she was still at work, so I said that was fine we can chat when she gets off or tomorrow, whatever works best for her. I never heard back. \n\nI sent all three girls a “wtf is going on” message one tearful night not too long ago. It was long, and probably overwhelming (in fact I sent an apology for the length the next day) but honestly, for a “best friend” it shouldn’t have been some crazy message. I told each of them my diagnosis and that I’m truly at the lowest of the low right now. I feel like I’m trapped in this shell of my body and there’s nothing I can do. I begged them to please tell me what I did wrong to make them ghost so I can fix it. I pleaded with each of them not to leave. But I also told them that they really hurt me, and I felt like I have been abandoned by those that I trusted the most during my deepest tome of need. I sent this individually over Facebook messenger because I naively thought that maybe I wasn’t getting replies because their phones were dead or something. I have been left on read for all three of them, and Micha deleted me as a friend immediately after reading my message. \n\nI don’t know what to do guys. All I can think of is that saying “if you keep smelling dog shit everywhere you go, maybe you should check your shoes.” Please tell me, AMITA? I’m so fucking mad at them. I would never straight up ghost a normal friend, never mind a best friend. *Especially* after they tell me that they have cancer, godfuckingdamn. It feels so shitty and I’m honestly more torn up about it than I am about the cancer.   \nI can provide more details if you want, I just didn’t want to make this longer than it already is. Thank you for reading. ",

      "description": "My grandmother passed away yesterday. I do not have a relationship with her. When my brother, sister and I were young, she always treated us as second class to my uncle’s kids. I think this is because she didn’t like my mother. My grandfather died when I was around 8 and he was a lovely man but he didn’t prevent her behaving the way she did. \n\nMy parents separated when I was 11 and she didn’t bother to stay in contact with me, my brother who was 16 and my sister who was 18. I don’t believe she should take any blame for this lack of contact as we were the kids in the situation and she was the adult. \n\nMy dad basically disappeared from our lives for about 5 years or so as well and I later found she was abusive to him when he was growing up although I’m not sure what form that abuse took. \n\nMy brother’s eldest son was her great grandchild. He is now 15 and she has never met him. My brother has since had another child and my sister has two kids who again she has never met. I am now pregnant with my first child and I know she would not have them this baby either. However she has met and had a relationship with my cousins kids. \n\nI saw her for the first time in years at my Dad’s 60th which I helped to organise, but I didn’t know she would be there. My  Dad’s girlfriend must have invited her. She didn’t acknowledge me or my brother. My sister did not attend as she doesn’t want a relationship with my father. \n\nI have somewhat repaired my relationship with my Dad but I keep it up for his sake mostly. I don’t really get anything out of it. I just feel guilty if I don’t have some sort of relationship with him. \n\nI’m really uncomfortable with the thought of going to the funeral. I barely speak to my cousins and I know they will be fully involved in the funeral. I’m worried they will judge us for coming and blame us for not having a relationship with her. I also don’t want to listen to a eulogy about how great she is when she treated me, my siblings, our kids and my Dad terribly. I also had to take time off sick from work lately due to pregnancy related issues and they were so understanding. I’m entitled to bereavement leave but I hate asking for more time off. I also don’t want people at work hearing my grandmother died and being all pitying and I’ll just come across heartless because I’m upset about it. I mean I feel really weird and anxious about it but I’m not sad that she died. \n\nDoes that make me a terrible person? My brother thinks we should go to be there for my Dad, that it’s the right thing to do.  And to be honest if my brother has to go back home to face all the small town gossipers, I don’t want him to face it alone and I feel like we should be able to walk in there with our heads held high as we did nothing wrong. I just don’t feel like honoring this woman. \n\nTL:DR: Didn’t have relationship with grandmother. Not a nice woman. AITA for not wanting to go to her funeral? ",

      "description": "Okay, for some context, we are both in High school. A few years ago, when we were 13, we were “dating” aka hanging out together after school and during weekends. After three months of our relationship, we shared our first kiss and it all went downhill from there. \n\nAfter our first kiss, he started wanting things from me, specifically sexual favors. He would constantly ask me for a blowjob and I would always refuse. Eventually, he would start pulling his dick out and making me touch it and pleading me to suck it. I was VERY uncomfortable with this, and he managed to convince me that I was a bad girlfriend for refusing to blow him.\n\nHe would also constantly try to touch me, but most of the time, I gave the excuse that I hadn’t shaved down there and he would leave it be. Once though, I did shave before hand, because for some reason, I thought I would be ready. When he came over that day, I realized I wasn’t and told him not to. He shoved his hand down my pants anyway. As. I. Told. Him. No.\nI remember pulling his hand out of my jeans and him brushing it off and smelling his fingers to tell me that I smelt good. I don’t remember what any of the other encounters were that day, just that specific memory.\n\nI was really starting to get into feminism at this point, and joined my junior high’s gay straight alliance. We had this event called the GLSEN Day of Silence where students were supposed to wear black and pledge an oath of silence for the day to protest against bullying and harassment of lgbt+ students. People would ask why I was joining and I wrote down a cute pie chart of how much I felt I was attracted to boys vs. girls and a title that said “I’m Bisexual! :)”.\n\nThis was my first time coming out to any of my friends, and it was the first time I told my Ex. He read the note, looked up at me, read the note again, and then with the face of Joseph when Mary first told him she was pregnant, he said “You’re bi?”.\n\nWe had an argument over FB messenger on the way home from school. He told me he couldn’t date a bi girl because I was more likely to cheat on him. That’s when we broke up.\n\nOver the summer, I met someone new and started a long distance relationship with said person. I was happy with him... then the flashbacks came. I don’t know why, but that memory of my ex shoving his hand down my pants started to constantly play, and I would panic attacks over it. Luckily, my new bf was supportive when I told him what happened and would even call when I’d have panic attacks so I could calm down. \n\n I didn’t tell my parents that it even happened until a year after my ex and I broke up. At the end of 8th grade, I told all of my friends what happened and many took my side (but some still hung out with him afterwards)\n\nRight before Freshman year, I contacted him on social media and we had a nice conversation. He apologized for what he did to me and promised that he would never do that to another girl again.\n\nAnyway, here we are present day.\nLast night, a girl contacted me (Let’s call her A) and told me that her BFF (B) is dating my ex, and she wanted to know if that was the same Ex that had sexually assaulted me. I told her yes, then proceeded to answer any questions she had, as well as tell her my full story.  \nA tells me that B has admitted that my ex does sexual things to her without her consent but she is “okay with it” (A thinks she’s lying). A said that she gets a really bad vibe from my ex, and that she thinks that he may be doing similar things to B.\n\nThat makes my blood boil and want to confront this girl and tell her to break up with him as soon as she can because I don’t want another girl to go through the same trauma that I did!\nBut at the same time, what happened to me happened when we were technically kids, and I don’t feel like it’s my lane to sabotage his relationships. I fear that it will make me seem jealous and I’ll be known as his “crazy ex”\nIdk, should I talk to B? Should I let her know of the monster that her boyfriend was when we were together? Have I slandered his name enough just by telling our friends about what he did to me? Am I an asshole for not putting the whole thing aside  and moving on with my life? \n\n\nTDRL: My “ex boyfriend” sexually assaulted me when we were 13 and now we’re in HS and I suspect that he’s doing the same to another girl even though he told me he wouldn’t. I told our friends about him and part of me feels like I slandered his name enough but the other part of me wants to protect other girls from him.",

Which isn't an excuse to be an ass, but I'm kind of a cuck to my parents, probably because I hate them. But recently I did something pretty extreme. I had 2 people call DCF on my parents for child neglect. They don't take me to the doctor/dentist, and I've got a pretty bad tooth (infected- used to swell to the size of a gumball and I couldn't close my mouth) that was supposed to be pulled over a year ago. My bed is broken and I have scars all over from where the springs broke through and tore me up. I keep begging my parents to fix it, but they won't. My room has a draft (windows really thin, trailer house so there isn't good insulation so it gets COLD).   \nThey keep saying that it'll all get fixed over the summer when we move to a new house, but they've been putting off getting a new mattress for almost a couple years, so I don't know if I can trust that it'll get done.  \nThere's a lot more I could be doing to help myself (Call in my own appointments, which I'm too scared to do because my parents keep telling me not to) etc.\n\nThey do a lot more bad shit other than that (they're pretty emotionally distant and they smoke $400 worth of cigs a month and then complain we don't have enough to pay bills) but I do some more bad stuff to (whenever I make money, I don't try to help out)\n\nThey also keep trying to kick my mentally disabled brother out for being a \"freeloader\", which would force him to be homeless. They threatened to kick him out because he asked my stepdads daughter if he could have a ride to his friends. (honestly, my brother isn't the best either. He's refused to shower for almost a year, he doesn't clean anything, and he just sits on the internet all day)\n\nAITA for having people call DCF on my parents? Should I have called it in myself instead of asking others to do it for me? or should I have just left things as they were since I only have a year until I can move out?  ",

She's 34 and I'm 35.\n\nI continued to date her knowing it was risky. I really loved her. So much in common. All that good stuff you hear about good relationships. Yet, she was constantly being shady. Always talking to men behind my back. Would invite them over without my knowledge and hide it from me. She would break up with me temporarily and then claim anything she did was fine because we were broken up.\n\nEventually I couldn't handle it and we went our separate ways. So about 4 months ago we decided we would try to make it work again. I setup counselling. We set boundaries and it was rocky at first but I could see it working. She wanted to stay in contact with men she had been dating and or sleeping with.\n\nI wasn't overly comfortable with this because of how she can be unfaithful but I eventually agreed as long as she didn't talk about our relationship with them in great detail. Didn't flirt with them or have them over and get black out drunk. Well of course you guessed it. She couldn't stick to the plan. We would argue about that and then she would have them sleep over. Claiming she wasn't sleeping with them but they just slept in her bed. She consistently said they were just friends and it was okay even if we were dating for them to sleep in her bed because friends.\n\nAnyways. I got laid off from work yesterday. I came to her place and I can't remember exactly what we argued about but she was drunk and it was about a guy I told her to stop flirting with and inviting him over because she tried to sleep with him last time he was there. She kicked me out. She said she was sorry a few hours later but I wasn't having just a simple little I'm sorry. I told her I wanted her to be nicer to me and stop doing this thing with other men.\n\nWell she got drunk that night and had a man come over and she fucked him. I was really upset. Less than 12 hours and she was already fucking someone else. So I called her a slut to her face. She slapped me and told me she wasn't and claims what she did was not slutty.\n\nAITA in this situation?",

      "description": "Some context about me and my older brother: \n\nWe are both grown adult men living with our parents. I’m 24 and he is 30. He works as a head cashier at a retail store. I’m an accountant with plans to move out and go for my masters after saving enough money.\n\n \n\nMy brother has a bit of a rough past so I’ll try to keep it short. About a decade ago, he attended a UC pursuing a major in Chemistry. He lied to our mother about his grades and he ended up dropping out due to his inability to keep them up. This left him with a big ass loan that needed to be paid off and no degree to show for it. At that point, he was forced to work retail. There, he developed a meth addiction and was diagnosed with depression. With years of AA meetings and constant support from our mother, he was able to stay sober for years and was able to find another retail job with better conditions. Fast forward a few years later, he’s traded his addiction to meth with an addiction to junk food. He's a head cashier now, but has no plans of either moving up in the position, or backing down to go back to school.  \n \n\nMy brother and I used to be pretty close. During my college years, we would often bond, watch movies, and go out to eat. During the time however, I would notice things about him that would bother me. I was aware of his situation, so I tried to keep quiet in order to not upset him. One of them being that our mother would always do his laundry. He would also never clean up after himself. He’d never do the dishes. In fact, sometimes he’d just leave his dishes on the counter. He never did any chores either because he would always be too tired. He's extremely pessimistic and aloof about every single thing. He's also very prideful. Whenever my mother would try to offer some advice, he would straight up yell at her. He constantly complains about how tiring his job is and claims that one day he’ll quit or step down so he can go back to school despite showing absolutely zero signs of doing so. Whenever he’s home, 90% of the time he’s asleep. This kept up for about 4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, I eventually snapped at him about his behavior. It became this full blown argument which ultimately ended with him calling me a condescending asshole. Since then, I’ve stopped communicating with him. This caused me to stop eating junk food with him. After a few weeks, I lost like 10 lbs alone just from not spending time with him. This motivated me to lose even more weight. It's been a year since I've stopped all communication with him. I’ve lost around 100 lbs. and I’m no longer obese or pre-diabetic. Our mother has always been worried about me and brother’s health so she's delighted with this change. Not only that, but ever since I’ve called him out for it, my brother has been doing his own laundry and has started to wash his dishes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I a childish asshole for not wanting to speak with my older brother anymore? I feel like we're both better off just not associating with one another. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

During my four years at this college there have been a number of reports of random people in the dorms. Some of these people would do things like: Steal, peak in on the girls bathroom, walk into peoples rooms, and sleep in the lounges. One of the big rules they tell us every year is to NOT let people you do not know into the dorms. I take this rule seriously because I would never know who I was letting in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to what happened this night. While waiting in the entrance to the dorm for my friend so we could go out to get something to eat. A guy (we will call him David) walks up to the front door and tried to open it. Now the doors are electronically locked and you need a fob to get in. David then starts pounding on the glass of the door to get my attention. I look up at him, but turn around and walk the other direction. David then starts pounding even harder on the glass. At this point his (I'm guessing) girlfriend lets him into the dorm. David then walks up to me, and starts yelling about letting him into the dorm. I look at him saying that I do not know him, why would I let him in? David then shows me a Tupperware container saying \"Yeah I look like threat.\" He then says that I should let him in because he was \"freezing his ass off\" outside. For some context it is about 5 degrees out right now, but he was not out there for more than a couple of minutes. David then turns around and walks off with his girlfriend into the stairwell. During that time he was calling me an asshole and a \"inconsiderate jerk.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for not letting him into my dorm?",

So when my daughter started talking about Santa and believing in him, we reluctantly decided to play along just enough to keep her from being the a-hole that \"ruins\" Christmas for her preschool class. \n\nFast forward to a few days before Christmas.  We go to a family function and within minutes of arriving my 5 year old niece tells my daughter that Santa isn't real.  Daughter asks me if it's true,  so I ask her what she thinks.  Daughter replies that she thinks he's real and crisis averted.  But later at the gathering, my brother-in-law (that niece's dad) boasts about how they don't do myths at their house.  It seems that when niece learned the truth, she wasn't taught that some people prefer to be kept in the dark.  I say nothing to niece or brother-in-law about it. After all, if I don't expect my daughter to be able to keep a secret, I can't expect her cousin who only a few months older to keep one either. And everyone has the right the raise their kids as they see fit.\n\nBut I'm feeling annoyed about the whole thing.   Both at being peer pressured into a tradition that we  didn't really care to do and for not getting the same consideration from our brother-in-law that we were trying to give to others.  So I'm sure I'm an asshole for being a hypocrite.  But I'm also wondering if parents who want you to lie and pretend to keep up a tradition that you don't follow are the assholes. Or are you the asshole if you ruin another family's tradition by being honest?",

      "description": "Hi!\n\nMy boyfriend and I have a great relationship and go to college about 3 hours apart. A return ticket costs between $40 and $70.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am seeing my boyfriend from Wednesday- Saturday in 2 weeks time. However, he wants to come and see me from Friday-Monday (i.e. going back to his college literally a day before I come down).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (gently) have told him not to come as there is no point in him spending all that time and money if I am seeing him the day after. I saw him this week already. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI **haven't** told him the other reason, which is that I also have work to do and am usually working weekends (I work 5 days a week) so this time to myself is a little rare and I would like to use it to relax before I see him.  I also am careful to maintain friendships here, as if I see him I wont be able to spend any time with my roommate and college buddies as I work so much. Meanwhile, he hasn't settled in so I think he's lonely. He seems quite upset. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really love spending time with him, but I don't think this is a good use of time or money. He is lonely though which I'm very sad about! So I don't think he's being an asshole at all, he's just lonely and doesn't know that I need space (but if I told him this, he would maybe feel even lonelier). But that's so much money to spend and so much time away from other commitments like college and friends etc. Bc we are no longer in highschool, we can't see eachother as much anymore, but I don't know if he gets that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***TLDR;*** BF wants to spend $60\\~ to see me on my free weekend even though I am coming to see him within a day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole here?

At the bachelorette party, one girl was upset by $6 club sodas, and splitting the check after dinner was an entire ordeal.\n\n\nNow she's asking us to buy matching heels.

      "description": "So a little back story. My dad is the best person I know. I have three sisters. When he met my mom he adopted my two other sisters, they were 8 and 12 at the time.  None of us were very easy teenagers but he always handled and dealt with with love and support.\nHe never hesitated to come help Fix the house house or babysit My mom would almost never help us and if she did she made it very clear she was doing us this huge favour.\nHe has always took care of us working 10 hours away for two weeks at a time.\nHe did this so mom didn’t have to work.\nDropped everything when my mom seriously injured herself which took a year of recovery.\n\n11 months ago my dad had a massive stroke. We thought he wasn’t going to make it. My sisters and I spent every night alternating who stayed the night in the hospital with him. My mom refused and would just get a hotel. Plus it helped mom knowing he wasn’t alone while she processed what was happening.  \nAfter 5 weeks in the icu he was able to be moved to a rehab facility about two hours away. My sisters and I still stayed with him.\nHe is paralyzed on his right side and had lost the ability to speak. We’d bring the kids up several times a week.My mom in the mean time would go up about once a week for a few hours then go home. \nAbout three months after the stroke he was able to turn his voice on and say two or three words. Since he was making so much progress he applied and was accepted to the only brain rehabilitation centre in the province. About four hours from where we live. Which then my mom would go up once a month.\n\nFrom my dads work they continued to pay him full salary till his 65th Birthday which was 4 1/2 months away.(he was going to retire)  and they wrote a cheque for $75,000.00\nHe was able to start walking again and saying more words, my sisters and I would each visit once a week.\nWhile we were helping and stressing ourselves out financially to be there to help our parents. My mom decided now was the perfect time to go to Belize and buy new furniture and a new horse, among a million other things. ( the money was suppose to be for my dad and his rehab, making the house handicap accessible.\n\nOur husbands came into their house and made it handicap accessible on their own time and money. We took control of everything we could to make things easier on my mom. I drove the 8 hours every Friday and picked him up, My sisters would always be there to help.\nHe has severe aphasia but does ok with us.He is getting ready to be discharge him home with the help of home care and us but my mom absolutely refuses. She wants him in long term care.My mom has almost blown through all the money she received for dads care and now needs to sell their acreage. She still won’t look for a job.She plans on buying a holiday trailer so dad can never come and parking it where ever. Any time we bring anything up she cries and says we are ganging up on her.\nWould I be the asshole to give up on her and focus solely on my dad?\n\n",

Even trying to get physical despite me pushing her off many times and telling her, in no unceryian terms, to fuck off.\n\nOne day me and a friend were talking about this. He told me that he thought the only way to get someone like this to back off was to hurt thier feelings. So the next time she tried something, i told her 'I hope they make whaling legal again so somebody harpoons you'. Of course, she went off crying to her friends. It worked though.\n\nDid i go too far?

Ef texted me later that day. A little background bf had just come out to his family as gay and I am also gay and my family is very homophobic and thinks it a phase (yes this is important later on). Ef text me and says she hates bf, I didn’t know why so I asked her. She said he had screwed her over, now bf and I have been best friends for 5 years while ef and I only really got close this year, by not doing a favor. I didn’t know what this “favor” was and ef wouldn’t tell me. I show up to school the next day and ef instantly start to mention the text, ef goes on to say I’m not really gay, that bf is really gay and that I am just sucking his d***. It doesn’t sound that bad but with bf past and mine it’s just really offensive. I have told ef to stop numerous times by this point and just want her to cut it out. I finally decided to ignore the situation by trying to change the subject but ef didn’t like that idea and said that she would kick my a** if I did anything and now I’m scared to be alone in a room with her do to her past history of violence.

      "description": "So to start off my parents are out of the question havnt been apart of my life since I was very young. I'm 18 years old graduated high school in June and working 40hrs a week to buy a new car. Mines broken down so many times I'm not putting another $1000 into it. My aunt raised me since I was 3 and we lived with her now ex husband till a few years ago when they divorced. She has epilepsy and has seizures pretty commonly. She hasn't worked in 2 years and has no income other then alamony which runs out in March. It's been 2 years and she still isn't working but she is constantly flipping from dating 9ne guy to dating her ex husband and others for a few years and goes out pretty regularly with them. Now time is pretty close and she still isn't putting effort in to find work but rather waits for me to get home with her car from work and goes out and returns the next morning most times. Now most days she spends sitting on my couch scrolling on her phone and watching TV that's it never any cleaning or job searching. She makes very poor financial decisions like leavin lights on 24/7 I'm not kidding all day lights and the TV will be on all the time . The days she has a seizure she will sleep and in and I will take care of her and the dog and cats. Yesterday she slept all day and because of that I had to stay home on my day off to take care of things. Now today I get home and shes all dressed up and getting ready to go out with her ex husband. Nothing has been done around the house even remotely in fact she just left her dirty dishes on the coffee table. Now I've lost my shit before and she always just cuts me off and stops arguing with me stopping all talks and will just ignore me when I try to bring it up to her. AITA for getting upset with her when she does this ?\n\nLong story short:\nMy aunt is unemployed living off alamony and not putting effort in to find a job. She has seizures which makes it hard for her to find work I understand that. But she doesnt clean around the house and just sits on her phone until I get home from work and goes out with her a husband. AITA for being upset and not wanting to  be around when alamony runs out and she has no where to turn.",

      "description": "This past weekend I was driving with my wife and my 6 month old daughter to have dim sum with my parents. Unfortunately, it started raining and we didn’t have her blanket. She pooped in the car while leaving the house, so we rushed back in to change her and inadvertently left her blanket there.\n\nWe parked a block away from the restaurant, I held her close to my chest and covered her with half of my jacket . As my wife and I were walking to the restaurant an older Chinese man looked in shock, pointed at my daughter and then at me. He told me “That baby needs more clothes!” I responded that she’s fine. She was actually in 3 layers: a body suit, a cardigan and a fleece onesie. I live in the Bay Area, so it was maybe mid 50’s. I stood near the doorway trying to look to see where my parents were sitting, when the old guy came up to me and said, “She is not fine, she’s too cold. She will get sick” I told him I didn’t ask for his opinion and to mind his own business. My wife found my parents and started to walk towards them and I followed, the old guy then gasped and essentially said “ABC (American born Chinese) kid doesn’t know anything.”\n\nAfter finishing dim sum with my folks, I told them what happened. They were shocked and told me that’s not how I treat elder folk. My wife came to my defense and said people shouldn’t butt into other people’s business. This was actually like the 5th time a random Asian elder made a comment about our parenting. 4 of the times they commented that my daughter “looked too cold” and the other time one woman commented that “she looks hungry, mom needs to feed her.”\n\nMy Dad said that “well if you saw a child in danger you would speak up too.” I told him, yeah but my daughter wasn’t even close to being “in danger” and he said maybe you need to bundle her up cause it’s cold outside. I just told him he was wrong and I told him many times already she’s getting over a really bad heat rash. (Long story, but essentially her room was too hot and needed to wear less layers at night).\n\nMy parents just told me to be more considerate and not be rude to older people. I just shrugged and that was that.\n\nAITA for telling off an old man that made a comment on my parenting?",

      "title": "AITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?",
      "description": "My ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?",

      "description": "Just a brief backstory. \n\nMy dad is an alcoholic and my grandma is homeless with my dad. I go to college across the nation in an attempt to forge my future so I can take care of myself and my family and later my community. I send them money frequently and don't really have money to spare. (Full time college student with no job). A close friend of mines mother has recently gotten a bacterial infection that might kill her before the night ends or over the course of the next week. Naturally, he bought a ticket to leave tomorrow morning but a bunch of my friends bought him a ticket to go home tonight (it was over 500$). They created a group chat acknowledging what had happened and I instantly sent him my condolences and wished him well. The guy collecting money came to me and told me that I was a selfish prick if I don't give him money to help pay for his ticket. Mind you, the guy who's mother is sick has money to pay for a ticket and has a family that is rather wealthy. They are saying that I an abomination if I don't contribute and that they will never talk to me again. I l feel extremely sorry for his family and him and hope that everything works out for him but I'm feeling attacked and upset. It's not like they came to me and told me about the situation, the first thing they did was tell me that if I didn't, I'm an asshole. Meanwhile, I have my own world of problems. Am I the asshole for not helping pay for his plane ticket? ",

      "title": "AITA I didn’t tell a friend about my recent suicide attempt, but told a different close friend",
      "description": "I have quite severe depression and suicidal tendencies, and so to keep track of my mood, I note it all down in a planner. I had another attempt recently, which I told my best friend, M, about. A friend of mine was flicking through my planner and found out that I recently had another attempt. \n\nFor some context, she and I have bonded about our mental health issues before, so she might want to be updated about these things. She also comes to me often when she’s not doing so well, and trusts me enough to tell me about her attempts and episodes. The only issue is I’m not close enough to her to tell her about all my numerous suicide attempts and etc, and also didn’t think it was a big deal. I also didn’t really want it to be spread around, and she has a tendency of telling our other friends want happened, because she thinks “they deserve to know.”\n\nWhen she confronted me, she texted me: “I saw your planner. Why don’t you ever tell us [she and our other friends] about this shit? Why don’t you talk to us? We just want to help you”\n\nMe: “I’m okay now, don’t worry! I just didn’t want to tell lots of people. I did tell M, though, because I just wanted to get it off my chest” \n\nF: “You’re not reading my tone right, why wouldn’t you tell me” \n\nMe: “it’s not a big deal, I’m feeling loads better right now” \n\nF: “No, it is a Big Deal. If it wasn’t, then why’d you tell M instead of me” \n\nAt that point, I stopped responding because I didn’t know what to say. I saw her yesterday, and said hi, and was ignored. She’s been sending me death glares, and blatantly ignoring me. \n\nTL;DR - a friend, who shares a lot of her experiences and depressive episodes with me, and who I have bonded with about our terrible mental health, is mad at me for not telling her about my recent suicide attempt, and talking to my best friend M about it instead of her.

      "description": "I know at first glance of the title it seems obvious that, yeah, this is an asshole move. Even I was convinced that I was, in fact, The Asshole at first, but as the night went on I began to have my doubts.  So here's what happened.\n\nLast week a big group went out for a coworker's birthday.  We have a pretty tightknit crew at my job, and there's a big group of us that goes out almost every Friday rain or shine.  The birthday boy is a regular part of that crew.  The person who planned his birthday outing is not, but she works closely with Birthday Boy and wanted to do something nice.  She's old enough to be most of Regular Crew's mom, and is friendly enough, (or so I thought?), though can be a bit sassy.  I've never had an issue before. I like her! I still do, I think, this incident nonwithstanding.  Anyway. She plans an outing into the city to go to dinner.  She asked if I wanted to come a couple weeks before, because she wants to get a number for a reservation.  I say of course, I'll be there with bells on.  Sounds cute.  She does follow up several times, to make sure she has the right number for the reservation.\n\nFast forward to the day of the event. As I'm getting ready to leave work, a couple buddies in Regular Crew ask if I'm going to this party.  I say yeah and ask if they want to ride together.  They do. It's me and three others in my car.  \n\nWhen we arrive, Party Planner gives me side eye so hard I'm afraid they'll get stuck that way.  As the evening goes on, she continues to make a show of acting visibly annoyed.  One of the people I ride with ask me what her name is.  That's when I put two and two together and realize that the three Regular Crew buddies I brought don't know Party Planner.  They were not on her guestlist.  Considering they were already aware of the party, and that they are friends with Birthday Boy, it didn't even occur to me that they wouldn't be part of the official count.  I pull someone closer to Party Planner aside and ask if she's angry with me.  Party Planner's friend says that while she personally thinks \"the more the merrier,\" yes, it's me Party Planner is upset with and maybe I should say something. \n\nI should mention that there are probably about thirty of us here, and while we do have a private room, it's very cramped.  The waitstaff doesn't bat an eye and whips out a couple more chairs, and we all scoot in and get cozy.  But at my first opportunity, as people shuffle around and a chair opens up next to Party Planner, I sit next to her and say, \"Hey, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to throw off your plan or anything,\" and without looking up at me, all she says is, \"I'm annoyed.\"  Yes, I'm thinking, you've made that very clear. I'm kind of at a loss for words that she wouldn't just brush it off and say \"no big deal,\" and I awkwardly retreat back to my friends.  She continues acting bothered down at her end of the table, and apparently not being shy about rude she thinks I am to her friends at that end.  \n\nThe night goes on and people are starting to get rowdy.  I'm not one of the people on a mission to get absolutely twisted, but I have had a few.  I see Party Planner not talking to anyone, and I ask if she's having a good time.  She responds \"Not as good as I could have.\"  Reddit, I am shook at this point! I thought a few drinks in and it would all just be smooth sailing. Everyone seems to be having a good time but her, and do feel bad about that, since she planned this and was really excited to hang out with everyone.  But again, I don't know what to say to her response.  I'm regretting going out of my way to talk to her again, feeling like maybe I rubbed salt in a wound. I confide in Birthday Boy that I am feeling like The Asshole, and he says don't be ridiculous, he's glad the people I brought are there, and that there are a bunch of random coworkers he never even talks to there, and it would be weird if those people were invited but the Regular Crew homies that just happen to not know Party Planner weren't.  \n\nAfter a few hours, Party Planner and the other older coworkers start filtering out, I suppose because they have lives and kids and stuff.  The rest of us young jawns go to a bar down the street that has a lot more standing room, and enjoy each other's company well into the night.  I do hear from someone at some point that Party Planner left in tears.  The person who informed me of this was of the perspective that Party Planner felt neglected and unappreciated when she left.  But at this point I'm kind of over it, and think that if you're going to go out of your way to act miserable, you shouldn't be surprised when people don't want to sit next to you at a party.  \n\nSo thanks for reading my long-winded ass story, y'all.  I await your judgement and will gladly accept whatever outcome I get.",

      "description": "So. A lot of context is necessary to understand why I was so upset to begin with. I don’t tell many people that I have a disability that basically makes everything I feel extremely intense, sadness, happiness, everything. I get upset a lot because of it and I don’t want people feeling bad because they didn’t technically do anything so I normally never say anything. I also hate using my disability as an excuse but it is important to mention in this story.\n\nWhat’s also important to mention is that I spent three months in an extremely abusive relationship prior to moving to university. I never did anything about the relationship because I was convinced that I was over reacting due to my disability and my manipulative partner told me the same.\n\nA friend of mine, let’s call him weeb, knee all of the above. He was someone I trusted a lot and he knew and the insides and out. \n\nWe were at the bar and I was alone at the table while everyone else was playing pool. I didn’t know how to play pool so I didn’t want to humiliate myself by going up there. Another friend of mine (let’s call this one memes) came up to me and asked why I was sitting alone and I explained. They said that I should come up anyway so I did. I went up and joined in on a great conversation. It was a blast.\n\nBut that’s when Weeb told me to move out of the way of the pool stick thing. So I did. Then he asked me to move more when I was clearly out of range of it (unless home runs are a thing in pool?). So he says “go away, you’re not wanted” and he pushed me so hard that I still have a bruise from where he touched me.\n\nI got really upset by this. He knew everything that I had been through. He knew how many times I had been pushed down a set of stairs. He knew how much I was hit, and kicked and everything. He knew. I went to the ladies and I cried. I didn’t want to make a thing out of it because I often over react to everything and it’s just easier to hide. That way the only feelings that are hurt are mine.\n\nThen another friend came in, let’s call him cloud. I was really surprised that he came into the ladies as he was transitioning. Coming back into the ladies must have been really upsetting for him but he wanted to console me. I was very thankful for that. I told him what happened and the context in which it happens (as vaguely as possible - I didn’t want to name names and I didn’t want to go into the exact depths of my abuse). \n\nCloud told me that I should go and speak to whoever upset me and talk to them about it. So I did... just not the way that Cloud recommended.\n\nI walked up to Weeb who was at the bar ordering more drinks with memes and I aggressively ask him “was there really a need to push me that hard” and Weeb says “I didn’t even touch you”. I responded with “but you did” and he rolls his eyes and turned away from me. I got so offended, Memes and I made contact and he had “oh teas gonna spill eyes”. \n\nI turned away and just sat by myself for the rest of the evening. When we were saying goodbyes I hugged everyone but Weeb and I said to Weeb “we need to talk when we’re sober” and he gave me major stink eye as he said “do we”. I said “yes we do.” And I walked home alone at 2am.\n\nAITA for aggressively confronting someone about something personal in front of their best friend?",

      "description": "So basically my Sennheiser headset broke down (again) so I decided to buy a new one (piece of shit needed repair every 3 months, never going back to that company). I got a new one, and it sounds good so far and feels comfortable. \n\nWhen I record my voice over the windows voice recorder, everything sounds ok. In TS3 however quite a few friends have complained that it was \"shit\" and when I asked what was bad they never replied. I played with various settings, but always got the \"shit\" response. As said, in voice recorder or even if I log onto discord with a second device and listen from that it sounds ok. In the end I just got so pissed that I blocked them (I only see them online, we live in different towns). If they can't even answer a simple fucking question, they aren't worth my time. AITA?",

      "description": "Context: I’m a backpacker in Australia who’s living at a working hostel with a lot of other backpackers. I was seeing this girl for a solid few months (in this environment, people tend to build relationships very quickly). \n\nAnyway, we called it off shortly before Christmas because she wanted to carry the relationship on once we left this particular hostel and I was a little more realistic, as we obviously have different plans to travel round Australia. \n\nOnce we both arrive back in the hostel after the festive period, we both missed each other and realised we want to carry things on together, even if it means changing our individual travel plans. It turns out she got both her nipples pierced whilst she was away. She asked my friends (one of them including one of my best friends who I came out here with) if they wanted to see her new nipple piercings, and he (amongst others) said yes. \n\nSo she showed them this entirely topless photo showing her complete upper torso. When she told me she asked if they all wanted to see it, and they all said yes, I felt angry/upset that all my friends have seen a potential girlfriend’s tits. \n\nAITA for being upset/angry at this? It’s making me question if I want to carry on seeing this girl and I’m also annoyed at my friends for saying yes they wanted to see her nipple piercings? (In my opinion, just an excuse to see her tits). She says it wasn’t a sexual thing, but I can’t help but feel my male friends just wanted to see her topless (cynical?)\n\nI feel I may be the arsehole here, but I just want confirmation as I don’t really know if I have justification to be pissed off with her and my friends.

      "description": "I love my SO and see myself marrying her one day. We are both young and in post-secondary school so that is a long way off. We get along very well for the most part. We often talk about marriage and kids and our future. \n\nWhen it comes to wedding rings, I hate the idea and the tradition. The absurdity and immorality of the diamond industry and how it became a tradition from tricky marketing makes me sick. I feel that many men feel that they HAVE to buy an expensive rock to show their love but that is absurd. IMO buying an expensive diamond ring means I'm buying into everything about the industry that disgusts me. \n\nMy SO desires a nice wedding ring, and it has been a dream of hers for a long time. Bringing up my distaste for the tradition always leads to an awkward fight, and now we cant talk about it at all without her saying she doesn't want to talk about it. She knows very shallowly from my rantings about the industry, but she doesn't care enough to not want one. \n\nI have talked about the idea of synthetic diamonds, but she is not interested and wants the real deal. She has came back and said she would be fine with synthetic for the band, but she wants a decent sized real diamond in the middle, something around the 2k to 4k range. This boggles my mind as that money could be a downpayment on a house, kids college money, exploring the world, etc. Why waste it on a little rock that I morally do not agree with? \n\nI'm not asking anyone to put down my GFs beliefs as I know a lot of people has distaste with diamonds. I get where she is coming from, a lot of girls dream of the real deal fancy ring their man will get them one day. I just choke up thinking about actually putting that cash on a single ring. \n\nAITA for not wanting to ever waste money on an expensive diamond wedding ring? I would do anything for this girl, but just giving up and doing the deed only confirms my thoughts that men are trapped into buying into a shitty industry. ",

My mom offered them her bedroom so they wouldn't spend $$ on a hotel, &amp; her &amp; I would sleep on the couch, no biggie. Meanwhile bad timing, mom ended up sick with bronchitis &amp; not feeling well, I'm taking care of her the whole night. \n\nThey went out all evening &amp; came in after midnight. I was exhausted as last few nights i didn't get much sleep &amp; I also have been feeling ill, so I was tossing &amp; turning, didn't end up falling asleep til after 4 am. While at 3am I hear moaning, &amp; sure enough I had to hear them having sex... in mom's bed... While we're just on the other side of the wall on the couch. \n\nI'm thinking WTF? They're adults &amp; couldn't wait 1 day to fuck back at home, but instead decided a family audience Next to them was no obstacle? Next morning they shower &amp; eat breakfast with us like nothing happened. After they finally leave, we change the sheets &amp; clean up the place. I brought it up as I was grossed out &amp; apparently mom didn't hear them (she was passed out). She's not as bothered about this as I am, probably bc she didn't have to hear it. \n\nAm I wrong for feeling they betrayed home boundaries &amp; were just disrespectful for that choice?

      "description": "Hi all. The title sounds a bit confusing, so here’s the full thing. (Fake names are used)\n\nI met this girl named Maya this year in my 9th grade class (I’m 15 years old). I didn’t think I’d ever talk with Maya, but we were put in a group project together, and soon started to talk with each other. We didn’t exactly become best friends, but did hang out with each other some lunches.\n\nFast forward a bit to Monday, my other friend, Helen decided to hang out with us. Helen is quite shy, and does have anxiety, but she is a really good person to be friends with. While talking in a our group about people we didn’t particularly like, Helen brought up that she actually used to be in Maya’s friend group last year in middle school. She told us that Maya would constantly harass her, by showing/sending her nudes/gross pictures, reading out sexual stuff to her, making remarks about her body (She’s around 5’0, while I’m 5’6) and calling her a ‘vampire’ because she’s quite pale. Helen would even go as far as to skip school just to get away from her. When I asked if she and Maya were on good terms now, Helen said that she never apologized for what she did to her, which made me angry.\n\nI haven’t talked to Maya since Monday, and when she asked what was wrong, I told her that she should be ashamed of herself for what she did to Helen. She told me that she doesn’t care, and that it shouldn’t matter because it was a year ago. I said back to her that it doesn’t matter, and that it still made Helen uncomfortable while she was around her. Maya said that I was just over reacting, and I didn’t have to be such a bitch to her the past couple of days.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n(Sorry for any spelling errors)",

I love to play video games but I have a crappy monitor. My grandma gave it to him for no reason. She just didn't have a use for it. His is WAY better than mine. And I'm kinda broke and can't afford a good monitor. I asked him a few days ago about the monitor and got into an argument with him. He says he can hook it up with his devices which o guess is fair, but he doesn't even have a computer for it!\nNot to mention he has a laptop. If I save for a couple weeks I could buy a monitor, but the way I see it I could have one way faster. AITA?",

      "description": "(This is my first post here, tell me if I do something wrong)\n\nSome context: \n\nMy birthday is right around christmas, and so usually my family combines both of those celebrations to get me one gift per year (I'm only 17, turning 18 soon, and so I live with both my parents). I know, it already sucks enough.\n\nI also have grown up with a huge respect for money, because I've not been allowed to have a job, so I spend the money that I get very wisely. That's why, I usually look to any opportunities to minimize family spending, meaning that I usually only ask for one expensive thing a year during that one period. That being said, if something is too expensive, if one of my parents tell me that buying that thing is impossible for financial reasons, then I've never argued with them about it.\n\nFor reasons that will become clear in a bit, I'm a decently athletic person, with a decently healthy lifestyle, and I go the the gym very regularly, though I don't enjoy exercising.\n\nNow to get into the story:\n\nI ask my dad for a set of those trendy new true wireless earbuds. The ones I request cost around $140. Pretty expensive, I know, but not out of this world costly. My dad says no, because he's ordered me an exercise bike/desk combo (yeah, seriously) that costs around $170.\n\nAs I said before, I'm a pretty healthy guy, so believe me when I say I do not need this bike. This is not a passive-aggressive push towards a better lifestyle because I'm not unhealthy to start with. Naturally, I politely tell my dad that I'd rather not get that, because for my yearly gift, I would rather have something that I actually want. I ask him to cancel the order. \n\nI'm fairly adamant about this, and my mom is on my side, and so one day my dad tells me that he ordered the earbuds. However, the ones he ordered are of much lower quality ($50) than the ones that I asked for. He orders them prior to telling me though, so I can't protest. However, he says that if the earbuds are not of good quality, he will return them.\n\nI'm somewhat peeved, but decide to give them a try. They arrive, I test them, and they're what I expected: okay but not great. I'm probably somewhat biased, but after reading reviews, it's clear that there is a significant drop in audio quality.\n\nSo, I text my dad if he can return them. Here's where the problems begin. He accuses me of taking him for granted and caring about simply the price of things instead of the feelings behind them. He claims that neither I, nor my brother (he's eight years old!) have any gratitude for him. \n\nI then explain excessively politely that I'm simply annoyed at how he always buys things first and then tells me after the fact (this has happened several times where he buys something different from what I ask, and I am too timid to speak out). \n\nThis receives no reply.\n\nI then say \"Also, about (brother). He is far too young for you to have the expectation of him showing gratitude. You can have it for me, but not for him. Please dont extend any of this onto him because he definitely doesnt deserve it.\"\n\nHe blows up and accuses me of teaching him how to parent, and refuses to speak to me afterwards, not replying to any explanations that I have.\n\nAITA for thinking that instead of buying a $170 chair and $50 earbuds, he could've simply bought the $140 earbuds and called it a day? \nAITA for expecting him to speak to me before buying stuff for me?\nAITA for trying to protect my brother from my dad's toxicity? \n\nFor the cherry on top:\n\nThe chair and the earbuds have not been returned. The earbuds are being charged and the bike has been assembled. I'm fairly sure that he's using both of them, or at least planning to. So I'm left with no present whatsoever. I'm suspicious that he bought the bike knowing he would be the one using it anyway. I'm not sure because we haven't spoken in three days.\n\nFor years now, my dad has emotionally blackmailed me in ways like this, and it always results in days of not speaking to eachother before my mom (an angel btw) convinces me to go and apologize several times to maintain the relationship. I'm beginning to think that silence is better than continuously sacrificing my dignity.\n\nHere's to the new year. \n\nP.S. The reason this is even a post is because of how convinced my dad is that he is right. Maybe there is something I'm missing.\n\n",

      "title": "AITA For Telling My Wife to Check Her Sugar?",
      "description": " I've been with my wife for almost 4 years. We have one child together, and she's pregnant with our second. She's a great mother and partner, and I love her to death. She is currently about 8 months pregnant. She has gestational diabetes, so she is forced to eat a diabetic diet and check her blood sugars.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, she has been on and off about eating healthy and checking her sugars. She was very busy with work and school during the first trimester, so she primarily ate fast food between classes, etc and didn't check her sugar. I didn't really find out about her diet until later on when she said she was too busy/stressed to eat healthy.\n\nI try to do everything I can to help and be supportive. I almost always have a diabetic-friendly dinner made for when she gets home and lunches packed for her. If she is out running errands and hungry, I tell her to text me before she gets home and I'll make sure there's healthy food ready for her. I also do the majority of our cleaning to keep her from being stressed. In my mind, we're in the pregnancy together, and I want to do everything I can to help keep her and our baby healthy.\n\nFor awhile, she was rarely taking her blood sugar. She was busy, stressed, and I think the pregnancy emotions were making things very difficult. After eating fast food (5 months pregnant), she came back home and I told her she really needs to take her blood sugar. She was annoyed, but took it to basically appease me. It was almost 300. For those unaware, those are dangerous levels. She took that as a reality check and started to manage her gestational diabetes better.\n\nShe finished school around 6 months. For the next couple months, AFAIK, she was doing better. The other day (8 months pregnant), she came home with fast food. I asked her why she didn't message me to make her food—she said she didn't think about it. I don't expect her to be perfect, so I just asked her to please take her blood sugar in an hour so we can manage it through exercise or whatever if necessary.\n\nAn hour passes by, I remind her, ask her if she wants me to get her supplies for her, etc. She said no she'll get it. Another 20 minutes passes, she said she is busy scheduling appointments. I told her I would literally bring it right to her since blood sugar is time-sensitive, and that her health is more important, but she needs to take it. She throws her papers in the air, yells that I'm annoying and nagging, and storms out of the house.\n\nI can see how it can be perceived as nagging, but it's not only her health, it's also our daughter's. It's frustrating because I'm completely reliant on her actions—all I can do is try to make sure we have healthy food available and ready. We had a rough last pregnancy (ended up fine and healthy). So far through her appointments, everything has looked okay, but I'm still nervous about the birth.\n\nAm I nagging? Should I just let her do her thing and not worry so much? Or is she out of line getting pissed at me?",

      "description": "My son is currently 5'6 and 230 pounds, at the age of 17. Not a healthy weight at all! We have tried everything to help him lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle. I cook as many healthy dishes as I can, we measure and weigh all of his portions at home, and we've even dished out hundreds on personal trainers for him to try and help him get more active, but our efforts have not helped him at all. \n\n\n\nAll that being said, we give all of our children a $25 a week allowance for helping out around the house. While it may not be much, it usually covers anything they may want to do with friends, and of course they are free to save up if they choose. Recently however, it just dawned on us just how much of that money is going to my son's fast food habit: every single cent. We found a bunch of receipts he left lying around after cleaning out his backpack that showed us he eats out almost every single day!\n\n\n\nAfter confirming with him that this was all true, my husband and I decided to cut him off. He wouldn't have to help out if he didn't want to around the house anymore, but we aren't giving him an allowance anymore. We told him that at his age, if he wants to ruin his body then he can do it on his own dime by finding a job. \n\n\n\nThat said, obviously until he does so we aren't actually going to cut him off. If his friends are going out, we'll give him a few bucks, we just don't want him to have the means of eating out as often as he does.\n\n\n\nAnyways, this has been a cause of a whole bunch of arguing in the house. He's saying he's too busy  with school, and that it's unfair that he gets nirbinfi while his siblings  still get an allowance, so if you have any opinions on this, please let me know! \n\n\n\n\n\n",

She is very easily distracted, and usually about 50% of the time we hang out she will be on her phone chatting to other friends, or she falls asleep and asks to wake her when we're leaving, which we gave her shit about constantly but she would see it as a joke and part of her personality and wouldn't really stop. \n\nI think it's rude and after a while I kind of stopped putting effort in keeping in touch, and she in turn didn't do much on her side. \nThe 2 other girls from the original group and I all live nearby so I see them quite often, though rarely as a group. \nOnly 1 friend remained in semi-regular contact with her (Kate). \n\nAmy is going on a trip that will possibly last a few months and she sent a text in our group chat that if we want to see her before this we should do something about it. \nI thought it was bizarre that she sent that text in a chat that's been dead for the last year, and couldn't meet her in the time frame anyway so I didn't respond. \n\nKate met with her yesterday and she mentioned that Amy was hurt that me and the other friend didn't reach out. I felt quite bad about it honestly, but after I thought about it a little I'm not so sure she's in the right. \n\nI think that it's weird that she got offended with how distant we've obviously become, but maybe she felt that we were still close? AITA? \n",

      "description": "This past Friday, I had a party at my house. I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what’s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say “Hi”. At this point, I’m starting to see what’s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they’re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he’s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn’t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn’t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n",

      "description": "I am a university student and I live with three other people, all students. Overall, we are relatively clean. We have weekly chores that we are all assigned, and the general rule is to wash your dishes within the day you use them. \n\nOn Tuesday, we noticed one housemate (let's call them Housemate A) had not done their dishes in a while. They were starting to pile up and they hadn't been washed out (there was food stuck to them). I had seen an ant in the apartment earlier so I sent a message to the group chat, asking everyone to remember to do their dishes within 1-2 days to avoid bugs. Housemate A responded, saying they could probably not do the stack of dishes until the weekend. They said they were busy since they had 4 midterms, and had no time. I was a little peeved but I told them that I understood they were busy.   \nFast forward to Thursday night, and the dishes were still not done. There was a dead fly in one of the cups, the plates and bowls were not rinsed out, and they were starting to smell. It was so gross. One of the housemates and I started complaining to each other in the kitchen, just saying that we were grossed out, and it was incredibly annoying that Housemate A had left them this long, *especially when we have a dishwasher*. Said nothing bad about them as a person, but we expressed our general annoyance and exasperation with the situation. \n\nThe next morning, we wake up to see that the housemate has posted a long rant on their Snapchat about people they trusted talking behind her back, talking shit, etc. We realized that they probably heard us discussing the dish situation the previous night before. They posted all these quotes about how people are quick to criticize but never congratulate them on their accomplishments -- just generally really passive-aggressive stuff. I feel bad for complaining to my other housemate, but I also don't think they should have left their dishes that long when we have a dishwasher. It's been three days and they have yet to say a word to me or the other housemate; it's pretty obvious they are ignoring us and giving us the cold shoulder. Were we assholes for talking behind their back? I don't want to lose our friendship over this, but I also think they are slightly overreacting. ",

      "description": "So, I'm trans, if that wasn't obvious.\n\nMy mom and I have a complicated relationship, and she isn't exactly the greatest mom in the world, but she had always been supportive of me being trans. Until last month.\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, she started questioning how I \"knew\" I was trans and if there could be some \"underlying cause\" that was just making me think I was. I kept telling her that uh, no, I'm actually trans, and that isn't how it works. She didn't believe me, and started insisting I see a different therapist to get a \"second opinion\" on my own gender identity. She also tried to keep me from seeing my current therapist, who specializes in working with LGBT people and who I've seen for 3+ years, because she wasn't asking these questions and was just \"encouraging it\". At one point she even considered talking to my doctor to try and take me off my hormone replacements, which I've been taking for over two years.\n\nI was a complete wreck. I had never felt so betrayed in my life. Dramatic as it sounds, it felt like I didn't even know my mom anymore. Every time I tried to talk to her about this it ended with me leaving the room in tears. This wouldn't have been such a big deal if I was independent, but because of debilitating anxiety issues I have to rely on my mom for a lot, and she was basically trying to cut me off from the things that had been helping me the most for years. I was terrified.\n\nThis goes on for a few weeks, and then as soon as it started, it stopped. I was relieved but extremely confused, because at first my mom refused to tell me anything. After I kept pushing for answers she finally told me that a friend of hers had been influencing her and putting harmful transphobic ideas in her head, and my mom believed them. She finally snapped out of it because she saw how it was affecting me and didn't want our relationship to be ruined because of something like this.\n\nAnd, well, I'm having trouble forgiving her. I was really hurt by all of this and I felt like a huge amount of trust had been broken. I'm constantly questioning how much she actually accepts me and I'm afraid to be as open with her as I used to. Plus, she trusted the words of somebody who doesn't even support trans people over mine. She understands why I'm not over it, but she's also kind of pushing me to \"move on, it's over\". Should I just forgive and forget? I want to believe nothing like this would happen again, but I was led to believe that nothing like this would have happened in the first place, so I don't know.\n\nI suppose on the bright side, my mom's looking into family therapists for the two of us to talk to, so hopefully that'll do some good.",

      "description": "I’ve been with this amazing girl for about a year now. She’s funny, smart, kind and my friends and family all love her. But I get the feeling that I’ve only been with her for so long because I feel sorry for her. \n\nHere’s a bit of background on us. We met on an online dating app last year and have both come out of abusive long term relationships and kinda bonded over some shared experiences and the fact that we’re both decent, caring people. The trouble is that, although we’ve been together for so long and have tried to be intimate a few times, it just doesn’t seem to happen. \n\nShe gets aroused and everything and even initiates the sexy time escapades but I can’t penetrate her. I do know she’s a virgin (not sure if that matters) but as an adult in a relationship, it’s hard not being intimate after being together for over a year. \n\nWe’ve been together through some tough times and we know that we’re always there to support each other, but without that physical part of the relationship, I just don’t know if I feel like I’m in love with her or whether I just love her as a person? \n\nWe’ve had conversations about this before and she says that she’d understand if I left, but I can’t do it because she doesn’t have any friends or family to care for her. And I just want her to be safe (she has a crazy ex husband that has threatened her many times before) and most of all I want her to be happy.\n\nAny advice would appreciated guys ",

      "description": "I'm in my bed awake at 3:37 AM as we speak because my next door neighbor has woken me up, again. He does this, on both week days and weekends, by coming home (seemingly wasted) with friends and shouting in the hallway until they get to his place. Even once they're there, he's so loud that I can hear him through the concrete walls of our building. Every time, I can kiss a productive workday the next day goodbye. \n\nThe work thing is not the worst part. I also have Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy, with which I get seizures only if I am sleep deprived. Awakening startled from sleep is the #1 trigger for a seizure. But, he doesn't know this. I've actually never even spoken to this person, I just pass him in the hallway, at which point he avoids my gaze. Tried to be friendly but feel like he doesn't give me the opportunity. \n\nApparently I'm a wuss and afraid of confrontation, so I left him a note on his door that said exactly the following: \"Please be considerate of your neighbors when coming home after 12am. Have a lot of early mornings. No hate, just would appreciate it. Thank you :)\" \n\nAnd yes, I did draw a smiley face lol. I really didn't want this to get ugly with someone I have to live next to. \n\nThen I popped some meditation music into some headphones. But THEN, I hear him THROUGH the music I'm playing (again, in headphones) and take them off, and hear him saying \"....and she tells ME to keep it down?!\"...among other undetectable things. He was pissed, and I was shocked. If I received a note like that, I think my reaction would have been \"omg, I had no idea I was being loud, I'm so sorry, I'm mortified.\" Instead, he's angry. At ME. \n\nI'm also not sure what he's talking about when he says that, I'm an extremely boring neighbor and don't even have people over because I live in a tiny studio apartment, lol. I try so hard to be undetectable. \n\nI actually thought I had left him the note after people had left as to not embarrass him, but it turns out there was still one person still left over. As they left, he made a point of shouting even louder in the hallway. \"BYE!.....BYE AGAIN!....TEXT ME WHEN YOU GET HOME!.....GOOODNIGHT!....\"\n\n?? This is a child, right? I mean, we all make mistakes, but if I found out I was waking people up, I would apologize. Instead, looks like I just made it worse for myself. Am I the asshole for leaving him this note?",

It started when he was around 9 i was about 11 at that point. He was starting to be mean to evreyone around him including our parents. I was very awkward and shy at that moment i had no self esteem so i was an easy target. I would be mean he would hit me and i wouldn't say anything(they didn't hurt.) But when i was 13 he became more aggressive he would hit me with objects. I actually hit him with my hand (not very hard) but he made into a whole scene and told my parents so i thought it was a fitting time to tell my parents. They were mad at me because he was younger this got me very angry because he was free to do whatever he wants. I am now 16 and he is 14 i only speak to him when it is neccary. But i feel horrible because this has caused a massive gap in our family. So tell me am i the asshole?\nP.s this is my first post so if i sound like a dumb 9 year old with my sentence structure it's because my sentences are exactly that",

      "description": " For context; my sister (I'll call her Rachel) just turned 18 and I just turned 20. I emigrated at 16 years old with my mother and Rachel stayed with our father in her country. Our mom got diagnosed with cancer after 6 months and 2 years later she died. I still live alone in the other country.\n\nHer illness had different effects on the both of us. I had a lot of time with my mother and it allowed me to make peace with our limited time, but my life became really hard since I had to do a lot on my own and don't have a family near me that can support me, I am over stressed and am in the process of dropping out of (high?) school.\n\nI imagine that our moms death came fast for Rachel, but her life seems stable enough. I do know that she has a lot of emotional trouble, not a lot of friends and has problems with my father (he has the tendency to always complain about our mother, hurray) but she is economically supported and is encouraged to discover the world. She has one more year to go before she finishes college.\n\nPeople always had the tendency to compare us (as any other siblings) but it was terrible last summer. Rachel seemed reasonable happy, was having fun and just generally in a good mood, while I didn’t know who I was anymore, felt like a complete and utter failure and I thought daily about commiting suicide. People saw that I wasn’t happy and wanted to cheer me up by pointing out how Rachel and I are the same. It only made me feel worse since the things they said weren’t correct.\n\nFast forward 2-3 months, I made it a point to concentrate on myself and find my own passions / hobbies (Rachel and I shared a lot of hobbies when we were younger) and do something that made me feel like my own person and not just a worse version of Rachel. I became interested in cooking and started to experiment more. November comes and I finally find something that I really like, cocktails.\n\nI got excited since it was almost my birthday and I would finally be allowed to buy alcohol at the liquor store (drinking age here is 18 but you can’t buy anything above 3,5% until 20). I am looking up ingredients, shakers, types of alcohol etc. and deciding how to collect my own bar. I spoke about this new interest / hobby / passion with my dad and he seemed happy that I found something that really sparked joy for me.\n\nSo I finally found a shaker that I liked this week but I have to wait until end of this month or next month to make sure that I can afford to order it, I inform my dad that I found ‘the one’ and show him the picture. His reaction?\n\n‘Nice, I gave one to Rachel for her birthday.’\n\nI have the tendency to be jealous of Rachel, since dad had the habit to treat her better than me in general when we were younger. These kind of actions don't help.\n\nAm I the asshole for being pissed of that he gave my sister a present for her birthday that I wanted to buy myself for my birthday and?  \nNote: I am disappointed that my present feels ruined, but I am not angry at Rachel.",

      "description": "Some background:\n\nA couple of months ago I was sick. My girlfriend asked if I wanted anything and I said I was okay and could take care of myself. She had soup delivered to my apartment regardless. This was obviously a really sweet thing to do and I was very thankful. I expressed this to her. She also came over while I was sick to hangout despite my warnings that she would also get sick, which she did. \n\nFast forward to now, she is sick. When she told me, I asked if there is anything at all I could do. I told her I would get her soup and all that and she said she was okay and had no appetite. She said if I came over it would help. I have a pretty bad nose infection right now that has been effecting my lungs and I really don’t want to get sick on top of that, especially because I leave soon for military training and any doctor visits need to get reported and come with a ton of paperwork (and in bad cases even a disqualification). I told her this and she got upset and we had a whole fight over it a couple of days ago. It was resolved mostly, and now today she again asked if I would have dinner with her tonight. Obviously, my answer was the same thing. She told me things like “it says a lot about a person how they act when you’re sick” and that I’m choosing a “5% chance of a cough over hanging out with her before i leave for training” and when I challenged that, she said she won’t argue about it and will see me in a few days. \n\nI get that she was really attentive when I was sick and I appreciate that, but it feels like she’s assuming I should act the same way regardless of circumstance. Am I the asshole for not hanging out with my sick girlfriend?",

      "description": "Weird title, weirder story. But best with me here. \n\nMy dad is essentially a wannabe politician. He's pretty rich but also pretty obscure, and wanted to be a politician but lost the only election he ever contested because he's introverted, a bad speaker, and gets easily rattled in debates.\n\nSo, he's kind of projecting his dreams onto his three kids [25F, 23M, and me, 20M]. He has pretty clear roles for each of us:\n\n25F, let's call her Carla: Carla's a former D1.athlete, and currently in the Navy. My dad's train of thought here is that she's extroverted, charismatic, good-looking, and a veteran, so a natural for elected positions. \n\n23M, let's call him Max: Max is in law school and really into debate/public speaking, and is a national-level debater and mock trial attorney. Therefore, my dad wants him in high-profile legal stuff, eventually maybe becoming a judge on an important circuit.\n\nMe: The most like our dad: introverted, not super charismatic, but also assertive and a good organizer/leader. Have been interning on campaigns since I was 16, and am fascinated by the topic of campaigns and marketing in general. Also, I'm studying economics and international relations, and planning to pursue a phd. So, my role's supposed to be basically strategist/manager/policy advisor. \n\nRecently, Carla has been expressing that she doesn't like our plan anymore because she's now apparently a libertarian. One time, this devolved into an argument. I pointed out that both parties had libertarian wings, so it's ridiculous to break with our plan. Don't get me wrong, if she doesn't want to go into politics, that's one thing. But if she's backing out because she's a libertarian, I think that's just stupid, considering that both parties have libertarian wings. \n\nEveryone agreed with my point, except for Carla, who called me an asshole and left. On some level, I'm glad she just considers me an asshole, as opposed to the whole family, since she might listen to them. But I've been wondering, am I?",

After my second shift(Tuesday) I fell ill with an intense cold that's been plaguing my household for about 2 weeks. My throat hurt, I was nauseated and snotty constantly. My next shift was scheduled for Friday(also my third shift) , I knew I would probably be better by then but regardless on Thursday morning I decided to let my boss know what was going on.\n\nWe talked on the phone, he said it may just be hay-fever and I said it definitely wasn't. I said I was still happy to come in the next day but just wanted to let him know what was going on. He said that calling in sick on my third shift was a bad impression, I said I wasn't calling in sick, I was just telling him I was sick. He said he was starting to reconsider employment and told me he would let me know that night(the night before I had to start early the next day).\n\nI shoot him a text to tell him that I was 90% sure I would be well enough on Friday to come in but after reading all the informational packets he sent me I thought it would be better to let him know.\n\nAt around 6pm he sends me a message saying hes terminating my employment.\n\nNow, I can see where he was coming from if I was actually calling in sick and wasn't sick. We talked on the phone so he should've been able to hear my strained voice.\nHe said it was a bad impression to call in sick (again wasn't actually calling in sick, just letting him know) but I feel it would've been worse if I showed up to work snotty and gross without telling him, especially because I work with food.\n\nTl;Dr. Wanted to let my new boss know I was sick. He fired me for leaving a bad impression.\n\nAnyway, I came here to ask your opinions so let me have it.",

She said that I am forcing her pay more because of my plans. I just think its ridiculous go to all that trouble to save her 100 bucks, when the apartment is still equally mine until the 31st and I should be able to stay until I’m ready to leave.\n\nWIBTA if I told her that Im not leaving early and that she is going to have to pay her rent in full?",

      "description": "So I’m (20F) pretty newly out of a long term relationship (2 years) which ended pretty terribly. I had been wanting to be out of the relationship for over a year, but was always somehow reeled back in, gaslighted and manipulated. About 1 year into dating my ex (21M), I met an amazing guy. We really hit it off and became amazing friends- or at least that was my take on it. All my friends and even sometimes myself did have an idea that he was into me, but obviously nothing could have been said or done because of my relationship. \n\nSo I keep getting to know this guy, and started to develop some feelings for him. Things were not going well in my relationship, but I still felt really guilty to be having feelings for someone else, so I just ignored it and pushed all of that aside. \n\nFast forward to now. About one year after meeting this guy i’ve been getting close with. I finally ended my relationship and have been feeling amazing. Haven’t really been looking for anything. Me and the “friend” guy are still close and one night he started sending me flirty texts. We ended up talking about how we felt and he admitted to having feelings for me ever since we met, about a year ago. I told him that I felt something for him too. \n\nSo here’s the problem: he’s been in a “situation” with another girl for going on 5 months now. He’s talked to me about it a lot since we have been so close. Basically he doesn’t want to get super serious with her, even though it’s clear that she wants a defined relationship. So it seems they want different things, but they still hang out a lot. This guy seems to be pursuing me, and honestly I’m super into it. But he did mention to me one day that if that girl knew me and him were talking about this kind of stuff she would be pissed. So he’s being dishonest with her about what he’s been thinking about with me. Not sure how I feel about that either. \n\nBut WIBTA if I went along with his advances? I don’t want to step on anyone’s toes here but also could really see me and this guy going well together, and maybe even just having fun right now, who knows. \n\nTLDR: WIBTA if I went along with the pursuits of my good friend who is talking to/ has a situation with another girl? Me and him\nare into each other and she isn’t aware of any talks me and him have had about our feelings. But the guy is being super forward with me about wanting to hang out and see where things go.

      "description": "I love my boyfriend but it's recently been brought to my attention that he doesn't always treat me the best.\n\nDon't get me wrong, he's nice. Doesn't insult me, occasionally pays for dinner (he's a student), says he loves me, etc. But he doesn't always take no for an answer. For example, on Friday he was over at my place. We were spooning in my bed watching tv and he tried to put his hand up my shirt to rest on my stomach. I said no and pushed his hand. He fought me back and clearly didn't care that I didn't want his hand there. Once it was settled on my stomach where I didn't want it he asked why, and I said \"I don't like when your hand is under my shirt like that.\" Instead of pulling back and saying \"oh sorry\" he left it there and was like \"I think it feels nice\". He also puts my hand under his shirt the same way. I don't like that either.\n\nAnyway, lately I've been dreaming of paying off all my debt, saving a bunch of money, and moving to Toronto (big city in Canada; basically our version of NYC). I also want to get hot AF, dye my hair, get a tattoo, and get my belly button pierced.\n\nBut, I want to do it alone.\n\nI want to do it alone because I'm polyamorous so I would like to hold out for a relationship that better suits my needs once I move. I also would like to change the name I go by, and my boyfriend has already said that he would not call me by any name other than my first name, even if it was still a legal name (ie my middle name).\n\nPlease don't tell me that I can reinvent myself with him around, or that I don't need to move, or whatever. I'm aware that I don't *need* to be single and I don't *need* to move, but I also feel as though due to familial abuse and my boyfriend's lifestyle (very sedentary with lots of junk food, and 100% happy working a mediocre job with crappy hours, driving a shitty vehicle that only has insurance because of bandaid fixes that have now worn off, with toxic friends who don't have anything in common with him and who can't treat his girlfriend with respect), I wouldn't really accomplish the level of \"reinventment\", if you will, if I don't.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "(Ik this isn’t nearly as bad as some other stuff going on here and this is just middle school drama but I really don’t know what to think here)\nSo just a little backstory, back in October I helped one of my friends (opposite sex, who we’ll call B) start dating one of my friends, K, just because I knew B really wanted to date him and it wasn’t that much to ask of myself, so I did help her and they started dating. When I was helping her with this we both kind of talked about our problems and got to know eachother better. (Remember this for later). \n\nWell they started dating and we didn’t really talk as often until around their 3 month “anniversary” of starting dating, when B started having some problems involving him not paying enough attention to her, kind of just not being the best boyfriend to her. Yet again I helped her out with that and we would FaceTime a lot and ended up getting closer than before, so now we both know a lot about eachother that other people don’t really know about (like funny stories that she’s never told and what not).\n\nAround this time, I developed a bit of a crush on B and this other girl, who we’ll call J. J also had a crush on me, so we started dating, and I stopped having a crush on B, for a few reasons (for one I was dating someone else and two I just wanted to be friends). \n\nSo yesterday B said that she has had a crush on me for a while and still does (she’s still dating K), and just said that she is really jealous of me and J, because B has had a lot of problems with K, and I’ve always been there for her. But she said that she knows J and I are happy together and that it would never work out if B tried to date me.\n\nWell I am a very empathetic person, and it always makes me feel bad to see someone else crying so I always try to help. She started crying about telling me and she felt really bad for having a crush on me, so out of empathy I said that I kind of have a thing for her too, but I don’t, because I’m dating J and I just don’t really like B in that way. I just felt super bad and knew it would make her happy, but it just feels weird, even though I don’t like her and haven’t liked for for like 2 months, even though I did like her before, and talk to her all the time still. \n\nTL:DR A girl who is taken told me, who is also taken, that she likes me, and started crying, so I told her I liked her too because I knew it would make her happier, even though I don’t like her, and we’re both taken. \n\nSo AITA here?",

Throwaway because my roommates know my Reddit account.\n\nI live in a shared house with five other roommates off-campus at my university. I lived with one of these roommates last year and we got along well, but the other four are completely new.\n\nA few nights ago, I came home from the library and two of my roommates were sitting on the couch. I had earbuds in, but I took them off and she asked me to hand her a box of girl scout cookies sitting on the table. I gave her the box of cookies and she ate one cookie. She asked me if she could have another and my response was \"yeah sure, they're not mine though.\"\n\nUnbeknownst to all of us, those cookies were actually my roommate's Girl Scout cookies. In our roommate group chat, she then called me out for telling her the cookies were mine even though they weren't. I legitimately have no recollection of being asked if the cookies were mine or not until after she ate one (maybe the question was asked while I had earbuds in when I initially walked in the door and I went \"huh?\"), but they her and the other roommate that was there both got mad at me for saying the cookies were mine.\n\nI responded in the roommate group chat with \"literally fake news\" and huffed upstairs after they continued to accuse me of letting her steal my roommate's cookies. Am I the asshole for not stopping her from eating a cookie and for calling her \"fake news\" in the group chat? Or is she just overreacting and am I in the clear?",

It still smells really bad and makes me gag whenever I cook food in it (not sure if she left the fish in there for too long, but it really does still smell bad, and 2 weeks is a generous time period, probably closer to 3). \n\nOn the day this happened, I said to her that it smells insanely bad and to try not do it if she can avoid, but she said she doesn't mind the smell of fish, which lead to me thinking it was just me being anal (as I don't like fish, esp the smell), so I didn't really talk about it much more. She also said she's trying to eat healthier so will be eating fish more, she was apologetic but isn't going to stop reheating fish in the microwave.\n\nWe both pay equal rent and the microwave is mine (but we share things like that, I use her pots, etc). We're both female and we aren't dating (in case not obvious).\n\nI was scrolling down a reddit thread today and read a joke about reheating fish in the microwave at work, which lead me to search am I the asshole threads for this topic. I stumbled upon [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aicbvp/aita_for_heating_fish_in_the_microwave_at_work/) and the general consensus was that the guy reheating the fish in the office microwave was the asshole. This made me realize I probably wasn't being pedantic and maybe it wouldn't be unreasonable for me to ask my roommate not to reheat fish in the microwave - but I understand that reheating at home is different to at work.\n\nSo, WIBTA for asking my roommate not to reheat fish in the microwave?",

Yesterday I decided to clean the messiest room in my house; The Laundry. This room was disgusting, not even gonna lie. It was filled to the brim with clothing that had just been messily thrown into the room and I cleaned all of it, including putting on all the washing. This is while I'm in constant pain and I can't stop sneezing/wheezing. It was so bad that I actually lost my voice from how many times I sneezed. Our lounge room is the next messiest room, though it's not that messy. Just a few bits and pieces out of place. I, by myself keep in mind, cleaned every other room in our massive house besides the lounge room. My Dad had the audacity to say I wasn't doing enough around the house and I needed to also clean the lounge room. I refused and said he was being emotionally manipulative (trying to pray on my sympathy saying things like \"I have a full time job to support us so the least you can do is clean this room\" type of thing as well as \"I'm so exhausted because I come home and I see this mess after a full days work\") and I didn't want to be in the house with him right now, so I went outside and tried to calm down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would also like to point out I have homework I need to be doing and I get really bad asthma attacks when dust starts to rise.

One of the employees, we’ll call them Stan, has recently been promoted to trainer as well and has been working with two new hires since the beginning of the week. \n\nI typically work morning and they work nights, so I haven’t really interacted with these new hires. During the shift change today the shift lead had asked me to train the new guy (NG) how to evaluate what’s under the make line and decide what we will need for the upcoming shift. While I’m teaching the NG how to make the list Stan comes up and watches us. I had told Stan that I will finish up with NG while he goes and sets up for the upcoming shift since I was about to leave. \n\nI finish the list and bid all my coworkers goodbye and head out, until I see Stan walking out the back door with me. He started off saying that I was out of line for training HIS NG and that I should’ve asked him first to do so. \n\nAt this point I was really confused because when we first opened the store together we had learned that training was a group effort and that it’s not one sole persons responsibility. So I asked him about it and he said that he understand that, but that’s not his way. I told him that I’m not trying to personally attack him or his new position because it’s honestly not that big of a deal. \n\nHe then said, “Well I take it personally and want you to back off. I can understand how you feel but that’s not how I work.” \n\nTo which I responded that he might need to re-evaluate his position then because that’s not what it’s about and left because I really didn’t want to talk about it anymore. \n",

I would spend about half the time with my dad and have the time with my mom.\n\nNot every other week either, the weeks were so brokenly split in half at one point that I was switching houses every other day. Needless to say, that was a nightmare.\n\nSince I am an adult now I am trying to put a stop to it. The thing is my dad feels that he deserves to spend time with me every weekend. I don't want to go over there every weekend anymore. It's too much of a hassle for me to pack a bag and go to his house to sleep in a room that isn't even mine (It's basically a second living room that happens to have a bed in it. There isn't even a door and him and my grandparents just like to come back there sometimes.) I don't like being there over night for this reason. Here is the conversation we had about this today:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nMe: What if you pick me up tomorrow and we do something then?\n\nHim:  What are you doing tonight\n\nMe:   don't know, it's just stressful to pack a bag every weekend. \n\nHim:  You don't have to work you don't have to pay bills we buy your clothes in your food if that's the only stress you have in your life then you're doing pretty good\n\nMe:  Um... Not the point? I really don't want to stay over this weekend. We can do something tomorrow during the day\n\nHim: All right fine I probably won't see you for a couple months I will be moving down to \\[Redacted\\] and I know you will never come down there.\n\nHim:  Stay home this weekend I don't want to add to your stress\n\nMe: Don't throw a fit about it\n\nHim:  I'm not throwing a fit about it but you're acting like it's so stressful that you can't move.\n\nHim:  There are millions of kids who would love to be in your situation at this point in your life.\n\nMe:   I don't like packing bags every weekend Dad, that's not a wild concept.\n\nMe:  I'm 20 and I enjoy living in one place, that really has nothing to do with either parent. My word I've been doing this since I was 7.\n\nHim:  Okay \\[OP\\] it isn't like you're busting the door down to see me anyway I know tomorrow's going to be a bad storm so I'll be staying home.\n\nHim:  I just offered to do things for you and to get you things but you know because I think it'd be something to do something fun you wouldn't be any less dress tomorrow about seeing me so I don't want to stress you out I'll be gone next weekend \n\nIt was at this point that I just stopped replying to him. We have this fight every so often and it usually ends in me caving first, because I really am still financially dependant on my parents and I feel bad for that. For context, I'm a student and while I don't have a job I am trying to find other ways to make money. So usually I do feel like an asshole bringing this up but I'm pretty sure he's an asshole too.

He came to school stoned a few times and he has traded weed in the classroom (Everybody noticed because he dropped his weed behind the radiator, lol). I have been thinking about reporting him to the police because of his smoking. Now, this is Germany and he is only 16 years old. If he got punished, it would'nt be particularly hard. He could probably expect a fine of 100-300€ and a couple hours of social service. He may not be prosecuted at all, because I would file an anonymous report.\n\nI guess this would be some r/ProRevenge, but I am still not sure if I should do something like this. I think it would pretty much be the only way to get revenge on him, I could of course try to anonymously contact his parents....",

      "description": "To cut a long story short, after Christmas my mum got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. The majority of her anxiety is unfortunately aimed towards me (F18) as she thinks I’m losing hair on one part of my head. I personally have not seen/ noticed a change in my hair but I hate seeing my mum worry so I went to the doctors. That wasn’t the end of it unfortunately, I’ve been to around 10 doctors appointments with all of them saying I don’t have an issue and that she shouldn’t worry about it. My most recent visit to the doctors proved helpful as the GP said he was going to send me to a dermatologist to help calm my mum as they specialise with skin. \n\nAll was good until I had to book an appointment online and the earliest date they had was the 18th of April. My mum was upset with this for a while as she felt it was too far away but she came to terms with it and was feeling a lot better knowing that soon if she a specialist. Cut to today, I’ve had a letter come through the post saying the appointment has been cancelled and rescheduled for July. My mum is mortified and so am I. I thought this appointment was finally going to help my mum and try to make things go back to normal, but now I have more months of what feels like hell. \n\nBecause of this cancellation my mum wants to take my privately as we’d be able to see a dermatologist a lot quicker. I don’t want to do this. I feel there is no issue with my hair and that going privately would just be a waste of money that we don’t easily have. So AITA for telling my mum I don’t want to go privately even though she’d be paying for it?",

      "description": "My husband hates his job. HATES it. There are no pros to this job. They don't pay well, the bosses are terrible managers (overbooking appointment when they only have so many workers to cover so many customers), he's on a wacky 6 day a week 12 hour night schedule so I don't see him and his friends don't see him. It has thrown him into a rut. \n\n\nI've told him to look for a new job, or just flat out quit and I will support him/keep us afloat until something else comes along. I told him to apply for things he's passionate about even if it means a page cut. Anything to get my husband back to his old self. \n\n\nHe's asked me for help and says he doesn't even know where to start, doesn't have the time to do anything etc. so I've done the following (at his request for assistance):\n\n\n* Updated his resume (I do this for my job so I know it's good quality)\n\n* Drafted a cover letter\n\n* Found a list of jobs he qualifies for and put them into an easy to read Word Doc\n\n* Made him an Indeed account\n\n* Started covering all the chores so that he can focus on applying for jobs when he is home (did this without him asking but made it clear \"I am doing this so you can focus on applying for new jobs\")\n\n\nHe has done nothing. He said he \"tried to quit but they wouldn't let them.\" He hasn't turned in a single application, or even opened the document I've made with a list of jobs. And of course he isn't doing any chores at home. \n\n\nThis has been going on for months. He's clearly depressed so I also suggested he talk to a therapist about all this, he says he doesn't have time because he's so burnt out. All he talks about anymore is how he hates his job, and feels like it's eating away at his social life, mental health and everything. \n\n\nAt this point the CLEAR common denominator is just this job. If he quits he can see friends again and will have time to see a therapist if that is still an issue, but I highly suspect a change of scenery will greatly improve his mood. He is a good worker and I know if he turned in an application he'd get a response. But I can't force him to submit applications and he JUST WON'T DO IT.\n\n\nHe comes home every day and talks about how much he hates his job and wants to do something new, and I'm getting tired of it. I stay up late listening to him complain about his job, and I've done everything I can think of to help, but he won't meet me half way. \n\n\nWould I be the asshole if I flat out tell him I'm becoming unsympathetic to his complaints when he has done nothing to fix his situation? It'd be one thing if he was applying for jobs and still stuck in his current one, but he won't look, won't quit, won't go to therapy and he can't give me a reason why.",

The host has decided to give everyone an extension but-- it's  only 10 days, and now I feel like I'm going to get a rushed gift (as it usually is with extensions) with no effort put into it. Obviously they dont care to put effort into my gift if they didn't do it yet, when they had a month to do so. I spent 3+ weeks on my drawing.\n\nI'll most likely accept whatever I get for the sake of civility, but since it is past the deadline, I'd like to know who I'm actually waiting on so instead of having to go and check the group folder in the hopes my gift is finally uploaded I can just subscribe to them and see their uploads in my feed once/if it finally is posted.\n\nWIBTA for wanting to find out who my SS is?",

Recently, I ran out of water bottles (although I have since swapped to just using a Brita) and I asked him to pick me up a case while he was at the store, saying I'd pay him back. He agreed and when he arrived, I told him I didn't have cash and if quarters would be okay. It was $4.50 in quarters, which admittedly isn't fun to have on you but I personally find it useful for vending machines or making exact change at stores, I figured if he was the same way he'd be okay with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe wasn't a fan of this. I put them on his desk in a neat stack and said if he wanted to keep them he could, but that I could just owe him one instead if he wanted. I also didn't know he had Venmo, and he failed to ask if I could use it instead. So his reaction to this was not to give them back and tell me to just owe him, pay with Venmo, or hold onto it and just use it for vending machines or change, but to take them and throw it in the trash. I figured it wouldn't be a good idea to escalate his nonsense so I figured that meant the debt was settled and left it at that. Nothing else to add really, that's about it.",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis did happen a few years ago but to this day it still haunts me. I met a girl at work (lets call her T), and she was perfect. We went out a few times and everything was good. Unfortunately T had to move away for school, not super far but far enough that we couldn't hang out to much. \n\nNow T and her sister (we can call the sister K) both worked with me. I was not the biggest fan of K but she was the sister of T, and i was determined to be in good graces with her, as Those two were very close.  So, maybe a week after T went back to school, I was working a shift with K and another friend (we can call him Q) the first half of the shift was fine, people pouring in and we barely had time to talk. Things took a turn when we all went on break together. I was craving a burrito and there was a Starbucks near by where I was going, so I offered K a ride since she was going there. We get back and Q is sitting there in the break room. \n\nWe sit down and Q looks at me and asks if I want to see this YouTube video of \"The Ultimate Vape\". I'm bored and have nothing better to do so I agree. We get to the point where its time to choose the flavor for the vape, and its churro flavor. This is what sets off the argument, because the man in the video didn't roll the R in churro (this is important to K because her and T are both half Black half Mexican women).  this is the conversation that followed.\n\nQ: Some people just can't roll their R's.\n\nK: That's why i hate White people,\n\nQ: ... that's kind of racist...\n\nThat's all i can fully remember was said but the events that followed were K saying you can't be racist towards White people and that's what THEIR argument was about. I considered both K and Q to be my friends but they were not necessarily friends with each other. So I sit aside let them have at it because if I choose a side I'm definitely loosing one of them as a friend.\n\nAt some point K turns to me, and she says,\n\nK: hey LexeL... I forgot my phone in my car, can you use yours to look up the definition of Racism?\n\nMe: I'm sorry K but this is between you two and id rather not get in the middle.\n\nAnd then she goes back to Q. i should mention that arguing over the Dictionary definition of racism had gone on for 3 minutes prior to this conversation. and Q had correctly said, Word for Word, what the definition of Racism was but K would not accept it.\n\nWe can skip to the end of break. I'm getting ready to go downstairs and K stops me.\n\nK: Have you talked to T lately?\n\nMe: Well I messaged her on Friday, but I know shes busy so I don't expect to talk to her until we Skype tomorrow. Why?\n\nK: Oh... well i just would expect to hear from her at all.\n\nThis interaction led me to believe that K had talked to T way before her argument with Q, and that she knew something I didn't, I spent the rest of my shift, nerves on end hoping I'd get to the bottom of this. \n\nK got off work before I did, terrible start to the rest of my night TBH. So as soon as I get off work this is the following conversation that I know by heart.\n\nText messages -\n\nT: what are you playing at??\n\nMe: Listen, idk what you've heard, who you've talked to, or what you're thinking, but I think we should talk.\n\nT: I agree.\n\nMe: Are you able to Skype tonight?\n\nT: We should just call on the phone...\n\nMe: okay.\n\nI have quite the drive home and I call her as soon as its over, we have a long talk about the situation that happened and she says that my story lines up with K's story. But... sadly I was in the wrong. Because I took no side in the situation, I actually took Q's side. \"a bystander is just taking the oppressors side without vocalizing it\" T said that she didn't think we should continue talking. We said goodbye for the last time and I never really got over it. so Am i the Asshole for not choosing her sisters side when her sister was wrong?\n\nTLDR; The sister of the girl I was seeing and another friend got into an argument about the definition of racism during break and i didn't choose a side, thus making me the bad guy in the eyes of the girl i was seeing.\n\nI wanna thank anyone for reading, even the TLDR, and I appreciate any comments. I'm just looking to learn from a past experience.\n\nThanks again!",

Im not some kind of incel asshole about it. I also want to say that my other standards are considered \"low.\" I don't really care much about appearance, job, education, career, race, age (I've been into girls ten years younger and ten years older)... Ive even somehow gotten the reputation among some of my friends as being into \"ugly\"girls. But for me to be physically interested, she has to be thin!",

There wasn't any direct mention of suicide in there but she definitely wasn't \"all right\". \n\n\nI convinced my parents to talk to her about getting medical help. She went to a psychologist for a while, took medications for another and in the end she went through.\n\nAt face value I would like to think I did the right thing by worrying, but then I think how I might have felt If someone had read my diary back then (my sister never found out).

      "description": "So tonight my friends and I were having a big smash tourney/party, good 25 people showed up, including my ex girlfriend. Obviously in order to have that amount of people there, it takes a considerable amount of planning. One of my friends, let’s call him John, tells me that my ex is coming on Tuesday and he has no clue who invited her. He was saying that just to let me know and I figure, whatever, I’m not gonna let it ruin my night. \n\nFast forward to tonight. My ex tried hitting on me while I was drawing the bracket and took away my pen because she wanted info on John and a girl who I had hooked up with in the past, who is now friends with benefits with him. Mind you my ex was very insecure about said girl throughout our relationship, but she had nothing to worry since at that point i wouldn’t touch the girl in question with a 10 foot pole. I told her to give the pen back and she’s refusing so I just go and get another pen which she takes as well, so I just say fuck it and let her take them because I don’t want to get involved in her drama. \n\nI go upstairs to get another pen and continue drawing the bracket, and I see her hitting on a mutual friend of mine who is really into it, and people were speculating they were gonna hook up. I’m fuming. I’m not over this girl in the slightest despite me breaking off an extremely toxic relationship. I play my first round match and I lose because I’m so damn tilted because A, my friend was cheesing bowsers up throw, and B, my ex and the other dude were being really flirty literally 20 feet away from me. \n\nI just dipped immediateIy tell everyone some family thing came up and just dipped and didn’t look back.

      "description": "Hello there, well here goes.\n\nIve been in a relationship with my boyfriend going on 3 years now . He has 2 kids from a previous relationship which in itself has been a huge adjustment. He is 27(m) and I am 25(f). When we initially got together he didn't mention the kids and so it was a surprise to me . Kind of a turnoff but I liked the guy so I stuck around. His kids mom is as crazy and obsessed as they come . Everything the first year was an issue because I was in the picture. She wouldn't let him see his kids ,and she'd pick and choose when and where and for how long. He would go without seeing them for months due to this. His kids are small 5 and 3 both girls, sad thing is due to all of the drama his 5 year old has the mentality of a 15 year old and carries out insults and conversations her mother talks to her about to try and cause friction. Now ironically his 5 year olds birthday is on Valentine's day . For some time his mom or sister would be the ones to contact his babymama for visits . Just recently tho his babymama said that wasn't good enough and needed to have direct contact with him or no go on the visits. It's really bothersome to me because of how toxic she is . So my boyfriend is trying his best and has begun messaging her and calling her to see his kids which he hadnt seen in 3 months. The other day I asked if he was gonna ask to have her for Valentine's to which he said yes . I gotta admit I was bummed .. things have been Rocky lately and Idk what I expected but that wasnt it. I got a little quiet with him and he got really upset and said I was being dramatic and that he sees me all the time. He also told me that he needs to be a dad and to stop thinking the way I do because its stupid.\n\n I can't put myself in his shoes as I don't have kids and I wouldn't know how to deal with this but I also feel so much pressure. I really tried the first year we were together by doing birthdays and holidays with them but I always was talked negatively about from both his family and his babymama. I got tired of trying and I stopped coming around especially because his oldest daughter would say things like \"daddy my mommy was showing me pictures of you two kissing , you love my mommy huh\" he would just tell her not to talk about those things and that,that was a long time ago ... Honestly it would get me really upset because I know she doesn't come up with those things on her own.. as I mentioned before I've been around going on 3 years now ,the other day i seen his kids and his oldest said \"hi  ohh what's your name again , ummm ,umm hey you what's your name?\" He told her stop playing you know her name and she got serious and said oh yeah I remember now .. idk why but that really got me going... Anyway , am I the asshole for wanting the Valentine's experience even though I know I'll always have to share him? ",

My husband calls and asks if they can guarantee a time for tomorrow and they just tell him “no, it’s a free for all” I just don’t get it. If you hate working with people, don’t work with people!

The compensation was snacks, and you had to bring your own garb and submit pics of you in it for consideration. He was also stupidly having men in Viking garb, and women in French high middle ages garb for \\*reasons\\*.\n\nI have worked in payroll for 10 years, and I'm very familiar with the FLSA (US law that regulates minimum wage, contractor/exempt/non-exempt employee status, and overtime pay). I even looked at the SAG requirements to make sure that movies were not an exception to FLSA (they aren't). I then spend the entire fucking day arguing that what he was doing was illegal. Somehow, I was \"killing his art\" and \"ruining his chances to make it in films\" and \"shitting on independent filmmaker who don't have the money of big studios\".\n\nI replied that he should fund raise to get the capital to keep up with his legal requirements. That the film company (because yes, it was a company that received pay for work) could get a loan from a bank. Or they could do a GoFundMe, or something other than wage theft. But of course, I'm the asshole for caring about the artists getting fair compensation for their art, but not about his art.  He was incredibly rude to me in front of my community.  When I reached out to his film company to inform them that what they were doing was illegal, I was rudely mocked and then blocked.\n\nSo, what he is doing is illegal.  The film company is being hypocritical, because they charge for doing film work like advertising and commercials, but they aren't compensating their extras.  I am a huge fan of the arts, and actively support my local arts scene.  But I'm also very much a fan of workers rights, and I happen to think that if your art relies on fucking over other artists than you don't deserve to \"make it\" in the business.  So Reddit:  WIBTA for reporting him to the state Department of Labor?",

      "description": "So, I am currently in a job (faith-based organization solely for background information) where I am extremely unhappy. Mental health, spiritual health, and happiness wise I am at a low point. I don't have a good relationship with my supervisor, there are lots of expectations on me that I didn't expect, and I don't feel I am treated fairly for several reasons. I am currently in the process of applying to jobs and have an interview tomorrow for a job I believe I have a good opportunity to receive. The job is in the same small town I currently work and many people who are part of my current job (members of the faith-based org) are connected to the new place I could be working (local college).\n\nMy current employers have no clue I am even looking to leave and it will be a blindside when I do it. Am I going to be the asshole when possibly come Monday I will be turning in a two-week notice and leave them down a staff member on a small staff? This new job will allow me more flexibility to be with loved ones during some currently hard times and gives me an opportunity to have help with school being paid for (grad degree), but now there's going to be different programs without someone supervising them, the different technology needs will not have someone to maintain them, etc. \n\nThanks for any input given in this very stressful situation.",

      "description": "Hey everyone. So basically, I’m 22 and live alone for a few years now. I basically had to move out because my relationship with mom was terrible. Dad left us and I’m an exact copy of him, I have the same hobbies, listen to same music and even look like him. I was reminded about this daily, and I remember a day when I was just standing around in kitchen and got told to \"stop looking like my father\". I knew I had to get out. Fast forward to today, I’m a nurse, I live a happy life and my relationship with mom is a lot better. \n\nSo to the reason I think I’m an asshole. She keeps calling me about my older brother. This dude got everything handed to him. Mom payed for his school while I had to get in debt, she decided he needs to start living alone so she gave him a house. And well, he doesn’t give a sh*t about all of that. He loves partying, drinks a lot and never even had a real job. He often throws tantrums when he can’t get more money and that’s when I come into this. Mom keeps calling me about these tantrums and issues with him, and I just feel like I don’t care. I moved on, sure it’s my family but I have my own life now and I don’t see why should I solve their problems. I remember that I was lost when I moved out, and whenever I called she would never even let me start talking about stuff that was bothering me. And if I finally after 30 minutes got to start, she’d just quickly had to go, always. Now that I live a happy life I don’t see a reason why I should bother myself with problems that are between them. I feel a bit like an asshole when I hung up quickly on these calls but I don’t want to listen to those things. So what’s your opinion AITA?",

      "description": "TL;DR: I work at a place where the \"established\" staff ignore new people or cause them problems instead of being helpful or considerate. Last Friday I had a really rough day in spite of my efforts not to let the negativity get to me and ended up crying in my car at the end of my shift. I then posted a thing on Facebook detailing all of my issues which I deleted shortly after. A girl I work with took it to my bosses and I am waiting to be told about it. \n\nI have to be quick because I have to get ready for work. \n\nBasically I work in a place where the long time staffers bully the new people. I don't know any other way to put it. New people are oftentimes ignored if they need help. We are barked at for not doing things while we're in the middle of doing those things. More than once I have cried on my way home from work because of how cruel these other girls could be.\n\nI thought maybe it was me so I changed my attitude from dreading going there and taking everything really hard to a positive attitude. That worked for a few days. Then, the Friday before last, I got yelled at for literally everything. \"You need to go to the dining room!\" When I was going there. They didn't need to say that. \n\nI made a very dumb mistake and I owned it but one of my co-workers threw paperwork at me and yelled at me that she wasn't doing her job because I screwed up my job and that i would have to do both. A nurse was nearby, heard this 40 something woman yelling at me, and did nothing. \n\nAfter a long day of one thing after another I got told that I \"never listen\" because I wasn't paying attention to a woman who I didn't realize was talking to me while I tried to do some paperwork on a resident. She was trying to give me more work to do when I was supposed to be going home shortly. I told her that it sounded like another shift should do that, as I was going home very soon, and she said \"well then it'll never get done!\" Which I guess is a compliment but by then my feelings were in the gutter and I burst into tears. \n\nI clocked out early against the rules and went and cried in my car because I had really tried that day not to let the bullying get to me but it didn't matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't stop and eventually I broke. \n\nSo when i got home I posted this thing talking about my experience there. All of the new people who started with me also have similar experiences.  I deleted the post very quickly but a girl still took it to one of my bosses and I only found out about it last night. It really explains why different people in different departments really ramped up the bullying in the past week. The post must have been passed around. \n\nAITA for posting that on Facebook after my bad day ?",

      "description": "(I apologize if I lack a little clarity at time, non-native speaker here!)\n\nI (F27) recently began a new Youtube channel that has been accumulating a steady amount of followers, most of whom are just perfect and civil, and I try to engage them whenever possible. But there is one account owner that has been particularly clingy, messaging me a lot initially and with growing frequency. His messages were a bit TMI at times but it was friendly enough. \n\nHowever, at some point he started to express feeling of attraction toward me very explicitly. I told him that I did not feel the same way and to please stop saying these things. He began messaging me many times daily on YT and instagram, saying he wanted to be in a relationship with me. I tried to continue to be polite but he seemed frankly obsessed. After a few more firm messages, I decided I had to block his account. \n\nNow he is messaging me from an alternate account saying he is very depressed and has thoughts of suicide. He says that if he hurts himself it's my fault. The whole thing has gotten very dark and is making me feel horrible about myself. I'm not sure what my duty is here. Like maybe I should unblock him and continue to be civil, and I'm just avoiding it because I feel he's difficult to talk to.\n\nWould you say IATA in this situation, or maybe being insensitive?  ",

      "title": "AITA For telling my father to shut the fuck up?",
      "description": "Hey guys, I know this title already seems crazy but let me explain in detail.\n\nI’m a 17 year old girl who lives with my grandma and father (although he never comes home and doesn’t spend any time with me) in Toronto and I have lots of mental health issues. These issues have been diagnosed by many psychiatrists and I’ve even been hospitalized for months on end because of them.  This may seem irrelevant to the story I’m about to tell you but bare with me it comes into play. BIG TIME. \n\nSo my father, we will call him Joe, he has a girlfriend whom we will call Mary. Joe and Mary have been together for around 8 months now and Mary even has a daughter who is fairly close to my age (her age being 20) and we share the same interests and mental health problems. We both have anxiety and clinical depression, her having anxiety more intense than mine and I also suffer from something called borderline personality disorder. (This causes you to have extreme mood swings and fear of abandonment issues) We shall call the daughter Mei. \n\nSo here’s where the actual story takes place. A few days ago on Saturday, Joe and I went to his girlfriends house to spend time. Me and Mei were telling Mary about how once we ordered Uber eats and both had anxiety attacks that the delivery guy was going to kill us and I had pulled a knife and hid behind the door. Joe chimes in even though he’s not included in the conversation and starts downplaying our mental illnesses. He starts saying things like \n\n“Oh, how can you guys have anxiety! Just done give a fuck about what’s going on!” \n \n“Oh come on really? BPD isn’t even that bad hahah you could’ve had cancer or something just shattttupppp” \n\nGee, thanks, my anxiety is now cured. Anyways he kept saying stuff like that and it was clearly angering everyone in the room. Me especially because he kept mentioning my disorder (BPD) even though he knows it causes me to cut myself and that’s what got me hospitalized. \nSo I accidentally slipped up and said\n\n “shut the fuck up” \n\nAt that point I knew I done goofed and instantly lowered my head. I apologized profusely and said I didn’t mean to say that and that I was out of line and he laughed it off and went upstairs. The next day when we were leaving he started screaming at me in the car. He told me he should’ve slapped me in my face and embarrassed me. I was super tired and the words went right through one ear and out the other.  \n\nFast forward to Monday. Me and my father joe didn’t speak all Monday with exception of him sending me texts saying what he told me in the car but now with a twist. \n\n“It’s February 11th and you have until the end of the week to get another job or else I’m selling everything you own, because I bought it. Welcome to reality.” \n\nThis caused me to have an anxiety attack at school and I went home early. I did apply to some places and thank goodness got a call back and I have an interview on Thursday. Anyways, on Tuesday I had to stay home because schools were cancelled due to an snow storm and he didn’t go to work for the same reason. He took this as his chance to burst into my room and scream at me. He called me every name in the book, he threatened to yank my piercings out my face, he even took it upon himself to yank the hood of my sweater basically choking me just so I would look at him. Mind you by that time he had already screamed at me to clean my room so I was folding clothes, that’s why I wasn’t looking at him.  I started screaming because I thought he was going to hit me in my face like he said he would and I had a major breakdown. Now my grandma says that if I try to leave and stay anywhere else he and the rest of my family will cut me off. \n\nAITA for telling him to shut the fuck up? \n\nEdit: guys how I put screenshots ?? I have text conversation with my aunt and mom, I don’t know if that’ll add any proof but I don’t know how to use reddit .. \n\nEdit 2: hey guys I had deleted the app shortly after posting this, I honestly just needed to vent. But all that aside, me and my father made up, we talked about it. I’m fine for those who are asking, no need to worry! ",

      "title": "WIBTA if I left spoiled food for a food thief to steal?",
      "description": "Ok, so I'm coming here before acting on this, but here is the situation: I live in San Diego with my wife and son at her parents house currently. We live with roommates as it's a 6 bedroom house. We rent the rooms with all utilities included, access to the pool, laundry room, and both patio areas are open for them to have late night guests. We offer them cheaper for students, as that's who we mainly attract being close to the university. In doing so we share common areas. The kitchen being one of them. I cook, A LOT, and whenever I cook, I always tell the other three people living here that there is plenty of food for them to share, and most nights they will come and join us for dinner, or at least eat leftovers. This is done out of generosity because I see how hard a lot of them work, and two of who are here from out of state and away from family. This is where the problem started, and I thought should have ended. \n\nAbout three weeks ago, I took my wife and son out to a Japanese restaurant. My wife loves sushi, and that is our treat usually once a month. My son loves teriyaki so it's a win for everyone. After eating, my wife ordered two sushi roll to take home and eat with the movie we picked for that night. So we grab the to go sushi and head home. A few hours after arriving home, we start popping corn for the movie and my wife noticed her sushi is gone. We asked around, and sure enough the only make tenant we have ate them. Actually went into the bag, opened it up, and ate her two sushi rolls. About 16 pieces. I was flabbergasted. I asked him very angrily why he would do that, and he says, \"You always offer us lunch or dinner, so I thought leftovers would be the same way.\"\n\nThat to me screams entitlement, and I am not excited that my wife's food was just taken within just a few hours of even being purchased. He obviously saw that it was not leftovers either, but an entirely separate purchase. \n\nI discussed with him that it was not acceptable to go into our possessions, whether it be food or otherwise, and to use common sense before eating anything that is not his, as I have NEVER ordered takeout or from a restaurant for these tenants before.\n\nThis brought up a discussion with the other tenants, and we discovered that one had actually purchased a mini fridge because her food would turn up missing also. When confronted with this information, the food thief admitted to drinking her iced coffees, her cheesecake, etc. Overall, not fucking cool. We told him he had 30 days from the first of this month to be out, because he violated the tenant agreement by stealing others belongings. We have to look out for those renting our rooms, so the eviction was a mutual agreement. \n\nHe argues of course, but ultimately knows he can do nothing. Yet, he now knows he has nothing to worry about with stealing food. So yes, food has been disappearing ALL week from everyone.\n\nHere is where I need an opinion. I want to buy a nice steak and leave it in my car for a couple days, then prepare it with some veggies and potatoes and leave it on the refrigerator, obviously for the food thief to eat and get sick. Is this illegal? Is there any other suggestions for me to get my petty ass revenge on a food thief in my home?",

She refuses medication and believes that everyone is constantly out to get her and sees herself as a Godly figure and the things that she does because of her illness are SEVERE. We fight frequently to say the less.\n\nThis has obviously put a great strain on my family. My father has to work 3 jobs to keep us stable and is constantly tired because of this. I’ve never had a close relationship with either of my parents and I’ve grown up mostly independent (other than financially). \n\nNow for the AITA part, I want to move to another country FAR away from here (mainly to get away from my mother) for college but my father doesn’t want me to leave the country for college.

      "description": "So Reddit, last year, I graduated from college and moved to a new city. My roommate (F, 23) and I (M, 24) were acquaintances in college and decided to room together as she had also gotten a job in the same city. Soon after arriving, I started dating my girlfriend, who I met through my roommate (friend of a friend).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue is, our shared bathroom has gotten so filthy I try my best to avoid showering at home – I shower literally anywhere else: my girlfriend’s place, the gym, my friends’ places. After my roommate showers, there’s just a thick layer of slippery soap scum and long hair. I slipped and slided around in the tub for months before giving in and buying a shower scrubber. I’ve bought every cleaning product in an attempt to reduce the slipping risk in the bathtub. If I have to shower at home, I spend a good 5 mintues before each shower trying to get rid of the soap scum so I don't have to step in it. \n\nI’ve mentioned it to her a few times, pretty passively (“Hey, I’ve had some good success with X product for the tub, give it a shot!”) trying not to actively blame her for the scum, but there’s really only scum after she showers – it might be the coconut oil or something. I've gotten neutral/negative response, no change in behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be an asshole for suggesting we hire a professional cleaner? My girlfriend thinks that would be really passive aggressive, but there are some other areas that could use some cleaning (kitchen, living room) and I wouldn’t mind footing half the bill in order to have a clean home to return to. Part of me hopes she'll get the message and start cleaning up after herself instead. I’d like to reiterate that I don’t expect her to clean because she’s a girl – I clean up after myself in communal areas and just expect her to do the same (even though she makes more of a mess).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t want to piss her off/directly confront her since she’s in the same social circles as my girlfriend, and they seem kind of gossipy/cliquey and I don't want to do that to my girlfriend. And I don’t want to be an asshole, but I’d also like to shower in my house without having to clean up her mess. For the past 2 months, I’ve basically been in between staying at my girlfriend’s house or crashing with my friends 70% of the time in order to avoid my place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The problem with this however, is that I planned to make some large purchases, buying an appliance and small piece of furniture. If I had pulled through, this guy would have snugged right up behind me and when I came back out I wouldn’t be able to open my back hatch/gate and load my items. So I stopped in my intended spot and parked. This guy was furious, laid on his horn and rolled his window down to berate me. I simply replied that I needed to be able to load large items in my car and this was going to be a big shop. I couldn’t have my back end blocked. He was so mad. His wife flipped me the bird and they sped off like crazy people in a parking lot with pedestrians everywhere. \n\nI guess I could have pulled right through and out into the next aisle, done like a 5 point turn and reparked in my required direction, but the lot was so crowded and I probably would have just confused another car in the next aisle while doing an Austin powers technique getting my car turned around. I felt bad, the guy was so upset and I guess it looked like a douche bag move. AITA, what should I have done?",

      "description": "Am I the asshole? I lived in a crappy apartment with my disabled Mom, who I take care of. We had a crazy neighbor who decided to threaten to kill us so we packed up and moved to my Mom's sister's house. Now my Aunt is messy, like filthy, rotting food on the counters, toilet unflushed, garbage everywhere, never washes her hands. She isn't a hoarder she just doesn't seem to notice or care. Her granddaughter has lived with her most if her life since my cousin died and the girl's mom is a deadbeat. My little cousin is a brat with a capital B, and as messy as her grandmother. She will spill ice cream and when asked to clean it say no S (me) will clean it up, it drives me nuts. Both sides of my family have mental health issues which are prone to blossom in women in their early twenties and I have been going through hell with it. I almost did myself in last October and my Mom and my Aunt were there for me to keep me going and now my work has cut my hours in half . So my Aunt came up with the idea that instead of paying rent to live in her half finished basement, I can just keep the house clean for her. It's making me so resentful and angry. My Mom can't really clean up after herself but at least she tries, my Aunt and cousin have no excuse they are just gross. I will clean the place just about spotless but still there will always be something she finds fault with. The pillows on the couch aren't arranged properly, I load the dishwasher incorrectly, anything of mine or my mother's being visible is not acceptable. Yet when I moved in you couldn't sit on the couch and the sink was always full and smelled like death. I know I should be thankful, I have a free roof over my head even if it is an unfinished basement room. She didn't have to help us, she did it out of the kindness of her heart, she could have insisted I still pay rent but she didn't. I used to clean the place like it was my job but I just care less and less. It's starting to look bad and I'm hurting no one but myself and my mom. I can just hardly stand to be out of my room most of the time anymore. The complaints hurt as I'm doing my best and I am starting to feel more like a maid than a member of the family. I feel awful that I am so ungrateful, I feel like I should be happy for what I have been given but I'm just mad and not sure if I have a right to be.",

      "description": "Hear me out, if the title was 100% true I wouldn’t be posting here.\n\nContext: I was a hs freshman at the time  and the kid was a senior. I’m now a college freshman.\n\nThis all happened in my freshman year in concert band. There happened to be a kid with autism in my class. The first day when I met him, we chatted about random stuff like football and other sport-related things. I can definitely tell without anyone telling me that he has autism, as I worked as a ilc tutor for most of middle school. I am totally fine talking and hanging out with pretty much anyone as I don’t care what a person looks like as long as their actions aren’t bad. Things are going smoothly, until 1 day about a quarter way through the semester he asks me a very inappropriate question relating to my genitals. I tell him “that’s not an ok thing to say” and everything is fine. Or so I thought. Throughout the next month the frequency of these sorts of comments increase, as do my response intensities. It got to the point where I felt sexually harassed, and I started telling him to “shut the fuck up and leave me alone, asshole.” He went away after that.\n\nNow it’s at this point in the story where some of you are gonna say “just tell a teacher,” and yes, I agree, that would be a great thing to do except since he has autism, unless he physically does something to me, the teachers won’t do jack shit.\n\nAfter I said that to him, the next day, he started saying that he was going to get me expelled from my school because I was a discgrase (bad spelling sorry). I had enough at this point so I started messing with him a little bit. I went along with his game, and every time he would say something about me being a bad kid, I would go along with it and make up stories about being a criminal. (My favorite was telling him I was a time traveling bank robber.) other than this, I didn’t say anything insulting to him. \n\nOne night, after a concert, his twin brother who doesn’t have any mental handicaps told me to stop messing with his brother or he would beat me up. I stopped after that and just avoided the kid entirely. \n\nI know it’s been like 4 years, but this still sticks in my mind. I really don’t know if I was the asshole in this situation so I’d like Reddit’s opinion.\n\nThanks for reading. Let me know if I should put a TL:DR",

      "description": "So, I was having a minor discussion with someone on tumblr about a series we both follow. For context, the series is a manga about kids training to become superheros. Anyway, the OP was complaining about how the girls in the series don't seem to be as muscular as the boys, and I chimed in by saying that its harder for women to become visibly muscular like men, but that a lack of muscle doesn't mean that a woman isn't physically fit. Another person chimed in and said that I was sexists and that this line of thinking was a lie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I initially wrote off the other person as being overly sensitive, but I later realized that I could've been mistaken because I don't have a lot of knowledge in this field. I found some articles that supported my statement, but I wasn't sure if they were reliable or not. Even if my statement about women and muscle gain was correct, is it still sexists to say something like that?",

It was pretty late by the time I realized we had to go to bed, but he didn't want to: he had to be at work at 5 am and thought that if he went to bed, he wouldn't be able to wake up early. \n\nI insisted a bit because we had a very busy day: took the dog to the vet and helped a friend of mine move an elliptical bike she bought, and SO basically dismantled it and rearranged it. However, he was firm and I let him be, went to bed. \n\nI remember that I left the lights on and the door slightly open so I could see movement, but I don't remember what side did I fall asleep at. This is important because I have a slight deafness in my left ear and I'm a very heavy sleeper so I usually try to not sleep on my good ear, or else I won't hear a thing. \n\nI woke up at 6 and found him gone, the doors wide open, his gear on the bed (he's a physician)  and his keys on the lock. I was freaking out about what the heck had happened when the phone rang: he had run out of the house to grab his glasses and got locked out. Called me 20 million times, both to the landline and my mobile. Honked the car. Had his Uber call me. Nothing. I woke up an hour later. He went to work with nothing and had to come back home for his things.\n\nI feel awful, but I can't help being a heavy sleeper. I want to know if IATA because it sure feels like I am :(",

At 6:30 L sent a message notifying us: “@everyone sleepover my place” this message popped up on my phones home screen so I could see it easily\n\n     \n     At 6:37 another friend said that he couldn’t go. At 6:42 L said “sick no sleepover actually”\nHe sent this message without @‘ing anyone and I didn’t see it.\n\n     C and I left the tournament at about 7:15 PM, dropped a friend off at home and went to L’s house. His sister opened the door and let us in. She said that “L is upstairs in his room.” On our way upstairs, L’s mom said that he had just left and that he would be home probably in an hour. So C and I spent an hour in L’s room playing games while he was out. \n\n     At 8:40 L’s mom said we might just want to leave and that L told her to kick us out. He said to me “I told y’all not to come ya know.”\n\n     I believe that he should’ve @‘ed us to notify me that it was cancelled and that it was reasonable to expect that I wouldn’t see a message I wasn’t notified for. \n\n    He and others think that I should’ve seen the message and not just arrived at his house.

      "description": "This is kind of an off my chest, genuine concern, and somewhat of a guilt trip all in one. Sorry if this cuts too deep for some;  a NSFW tag is recommended or requested, I’ll add one, no questions asked.\n\n(Excessive backstory - skip to end if you want to save yourself a few minutes)\nAt the beginning of last spring break, my grandmother on my fathers side passed away due to medical complications resulting from old age and a history of rather heavy tobacco usage from her early teen years to shortly before her first pregnancy in her early thirties, let’s say twenty years. No condolences needed; it is a fact of life and I’ve since moved on completely.\n\nThis warrior of a lady’s death was expected but MASSIVELY sudden in a way. She had, over the course of nearly half a decade, brushed death, dodged death, experienced it for several seconds, and everything in between. If death were a person, she gave them a taste of their own medicine before giving up. This absolute unit of a human was pronounced legally dead a dozen times before she succumbed to a peaceful, endless sleep in her warm living room surrounded by her dog, my mother and father, and me.\n\nI’ll spare you the novel that I could easily write right now, but when she finally left us for good, I was overcome with... nothing.\n\nMy father and mother both were silent for a few painful moments before shedding any tears. I had seen my mom cry plenty of times, but my dad went from the most humble and masculine stereotype to a sobbing mess. However, it wasn’t just sadness. It was anger.\n\nI decided to excuse myself, as it was very late and I had school in a matter of hours. Before I could finish my sentence, my dad turned me to and said, completely un ironically, “Why did you even come down here in the fucking first place, Waynard_Ferguson?” \n\nThis was a bit jarring to me. My father didn’t particularly like his mother, and she wasn’t exactly what you would call a sweet old lady, so his attack towards me specifically was not expected.\n\nI explained to him in a stammering sentence that I wanted to be there for support and since I had been the only person there besides my mom (brothers moved out), that I would at least stay and offer my very real sympathy. This didn’t sit well with him, either.\n\n“You could’ve just told me the truth, and stay locked in your room like always. Had you not come down, I wouldn’t even know you were home!” this was delivered in not much less than a choked up, grieving whisper, but was deafening nonetheless. I looked to my mother, who didn’t speak, which was the right move in retrospect.\n\nAfter this, I didn’t really know what to say, or if I should even say anything. at all. He broke an uncomfortable eye contact with me after a few seconds, and told me in a hushed tone to go to bed, along with an assumption that I only wanted to leave because of my selfishness.\n\nLong story short, my father wasn’t mad at my predetermined lack of care for the situation, as he explained after his irrational state of grief passed. He was upset by my outwardly emotionless reaction to not just his mother’s death, but really anything related to the situation. It’s not that I didn’t care about my father and what he was going through. It’s just that I didn’t have the strong emotional connection that my father had, or anything close to it, to display that I was in fact emotionally moved by a VERY raw display of reality in front of me. I will admit, I didn’t cry or have a very strong reaction, if at all, to her death. I’m not sure why, I just couldn’t find it in me to be upset.\n\nTo be fair, she was quite the grandmother. She would insist on taking me to and from school regardless if my mom was or wasn’t going to, she would take me shopping for anything I needed with a seemingly endless supply of money, and wouldn’t show the slightest bit of irritation whenever I broke something of hers or said something stupid out of child ignorance. Not to mention, she would fix me meals fit for an entire family. She did this for not only me, but my two older brothers, and only stopped when she couldn’t breath on her own anymore.\n\nMy father, at the time, seemed to only think that I was leaving the room because I was uncomfortable being around him, and not really thinking about the fact that I just watched someone die for the first time.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not being upset from her death, and more specifically not feeling obligated to address her condition in a way that wasn’t dismissive? And this isn’t really asking if my dad was the offender, because he wasn’t. Is there something going on with me that would justify my lack of guilt or sorrow? Or am I just an unfeeling person? I left the room because I was uncomfortable, sure. But I was 17, exhausted, and just witnessed something not many people can easily forget about. ",

      "description": "I know that sounds pretty bad from the get-go but hear me out first. My mother had recently turned 50, and wanted a party to celebrate this lifetime achievement. In her mind it would be a small house party like we have every year but just slightly better or over the top. \n\nI decided to go all out, getting reservations for a small club. Inviting her group of close friends, there’s about 10 people, I specifically planned for no kids because this was supposed to be special. I made sure I had drinks covered, music she liked and all the decor set up.\n\nWhen she got here she was shocked, we had a blast at first. Eating food, drinking, it all went wrong on the dance floor. My moms friends were pretty drunk and began doing some scandalous dances, such as twerking and grinding on friends in a joking manner. \n\nThat’s when it got more serious and my mom joined in and began twerking furiously, being the supportive daughter I am (and very drunk) said “Yeah, fuck it up bitch!” Like in a friend way, not like being derogatory.\n\nShe immediately froze, and began tearing up, I was so confused. She ran out of the venue and I went after her, she explained that she felt massively disrespected and ashamed on her birthday. She went back in later to finish the party, but everyone was acting awkward afterwards. I dropped her off in silence, we haven’t spoken since.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

Three nights this week, some guy parks in my space. On the second night he did it, I wrote him a note warning him that he was in a reserved spot and that I’d have him towed if he didn’t move. Meanwhile I’m stuck parking on the street quite a walk away and I pay for this spot just to avoid that. His car left both days, so I know it wasn’t just left there. Two nights later, he’s in my spot again. The note was gone, so I assume he got the message. At this point I’m thinking that I’m just gonna keep getting jerked around, so I had him towed. \n\nOn a somewhat unrelated note, I got rear-ended less than twenty minutes later on my way to dinner. I was waiting to enter a roundabout and the kid behind us either wasn’t paying attention or wasn’t experienced on wet roads. Poor kid skidded in the rain and just blasted into us. Everyone was okay, and my car is still drivable. I harbor no ill will against him. Nice kid. But it felt like some rotten karma. Friday is turning pretty sour. I’m gonna need a new bumper. \nAnyway. We exchanged info and I went to dinner. \n\nDinner was great. When we returned home, the owner of the vehicle I had towed was waiting for me at the spot. In the rain. He was understandably upset. I offered a pretty meager apology, but he wasn’t having it. Fair. I just gave him the number to get his car back. \n\nSo am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I have dedicated the last 12 years of my life to gymnastics. Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?",

I've been trying to get him to eat more food in order to gain weight, as he tends to get sick easily and runs out of energy a lot.\nHe has gone and got bloods done to test if there was an underlying condition, but the doctor also confirmed he's just not eating enough.\n\nSince living together I've done my best to cook food that is healthy and tasty, bought breakfast cereal, given him larger portions, tried to make more meals a day, basically tried to find a way that worked for him to eat more.\n\nHe is a very slow eater, and so ends up feeling full well before dinner is over, and frequently doesnt finish. I dont like throwing food away so put it in the fridge or just finish it myself.\n\nHe also tends to eat lots of low nutrition food. Like eating toast, and drinking tea and coffee all day so he doesn't feel like he's hungry. \n\nAfter over a month of this I have ended up gaining weight, which isnt the end of the world, but he has actually lost weight.\n\nI got frustrated with him and now I want to just prepare my own meals from now on and let him do what he wants, because this method isnt working for either of us. \n\nHe got upset at this and said he was trying, and that I wasn't being fair, but I dont think its my responsibility to be monitoring his food intake and constantly trying to find meals that I think he'd want to eat, while putting my own desire to eat a differing diet in the background \n\nAITA for deciding that its on him to care for himself and not on my shoulders and wanting to just do seoerate meal prep? \n",

We have two mutual friends through work L who is at work with us now and M who moved about 6 hours away from us in December 2018. \n\nThe original plan is that N and M would go on Tuesday to visit Ns new house a few hours away and then go to big city dress shopping to go to bridal shower on Thursday and then Friday stay at Ns house just hanging out. \nThe new plan was M wanted to have lunch with her Nan on Tuesday, meaning N can’t go to her new house to see her boyfriend, and Friday M wants to go out with a guy. \n\nThis is a huge problem for N. She went on an absolute rant yesterday about how M is ruining her plans just to spread her legs. That she just wants to get laid. She said a lot of this kind of slut shaming stuff. I was in shock so I didn’t say anything other than I think she is being unfair. \n\nThen we were on lunch, we were sitting with L and L was explaining how she has a stomach infection and I felt really bad for her. When L left, N started saying that she has no sympathy since in the past L had a major sexual history and left guys stuck it in her butt and that’s probably why she is sick. \nAgain I was in shock and didn’t know what to do. \n\nOvernight I had a big think about it. Realised how much it bothered me and so this morning when we had our morning phone call I confronted her about it. I said it was inappropriate and I didn’t like that she was so willing to dish out abusive comments and if she was going to continue to not do it around me. \n\nShe fought me on it. I said that it wasn’t the kind of thing I want said about me so I would appreciate her keeping the comments to herself. \n\nToday she came up to me and asked if we could get lunch together and I initially said yes and then regretted it. So when lunch came and she was already talking to another co-worker I left and ate elsewhere. \n\nShe is now complaining to anyone who will listen about it all, including our manager. \n\nAm I being the asshole for standing up for my own beliefs? Because she sure as shit is making me feel like it. ",

The problem arises when we chat over the phone, she will usually starting tapping the phone and often do this without realising, it doesn't help that her phones microphone sucks. Anyone speaking from more than a hands length away from the phone becomes basically inaudible while anything closer is alarmingly loud. So when the tapping inevitably begins we are unable to hear each other. I've kindly asked her to not tap the phone a few times but she'll often do it without realising. Am I the asshole for bringing it up with her all the time? I feel like Im nagging her but If I dont say anything then we wont be able to hear each other over the phone. Thoughts?",

      "description": "For the backstory, I am in the 11th Grade. A dude cheated in a test and the teacher had her own doubts. She wanted to orally grade him (in front of everyone) and I told my classmate \"how about she grades him (written) again.\"\n\nShe heard me and did just that, saying that \"Ms. Cryoniko came up with a great idea, get out a piece of paper.\" She didn't pay attention to him during the test, so he could have easily done it again, while in front of the class he would've made a buffoon out of himself. \n\nFor whatever reason, he didn't cheat (and he failed), and at the end of school I almost got beaten by the guy. I did not apologize yet and I'm still receiving vague threats from him through a popular messaging app. \n\nNote: he perfectly wrote the commentary our teacher sent us, word by word, while completely failing every single class including the one he cheated at. It was supposed to be shady from the beginning.",

      "description": "I'm not very used to posting on reddit, so I'm sorry if this comes off as rambly. I just really need a neutral perspective on this. \n\n  I have ADHD, which makes it pretty difficult to sit and focus in class without doing something with my hands. In highschool I'd find myself constantly doodling to help me listen to teachers. Through both highschool and college I've never really had any problems with it, until today. \n  \nCurrently I'm taking a communications class that's required of my major. Everyone gives a speech in class every two weeks or so. This class goes for 3 hours, so going in I knew I'd be fidgety. I got my speech out of the way and started drawing in my sketchbook. \n  \n It must have taken her sometime to notice me, because in the middle of class after a student gave their speech she called across the room for me to close my book and pay attention. She then announced to the whole class about how doing anything besides listening quietly was unacceptable and horribly disrespectful. Everyone went on break for a few minutes and I had time to put away my things.\n \n This is the part that probably puts me in asshole territory. If I was smart I would have not done anything and just sat quietly. But this is the 3rd time this professor has passive aggressively lectured me in front of the whole class, so I was feeling pretty grumpy. I didn't want to risk disassosiating and getting anxiety because of this teacher. So I took out my smaller sketchbook and turned more towards the speakers to show that I was paying attention. She was not happy about this.\n\n  After class was finished she told me to stay when everyone left. She then berated me about how horribly disrespectful and distracting I was to everyone. Because of this I'd be losing 10 percent of my grade on my own speech- and she was going to bring it up to the chairman because me drawing was that problematic to the rest of the class. She went on to aggressively tell me how horrible I was for a good few minutes. Even after explaining why I was doodling she said she didn't care. because I didn't have an accommodation letter, she couldn't(wouldn't) accept the excuse; and that other kids in class have problems and don't bother anyone in class. \n  \n I think she handled the whole situation rather horribly, but she has a point- I should of gotten some resources from my school's student disability services awhile ago. No matter what I end up doing I'm definitely going to talk to them about accommodations in the future so situations like this don't happen again. \n\nI grew up being a good student, so I'm honestly not used to handling teachers that don't like me. AITA?",

      "description": "Over the holidays, I was at a party with some friends. One friend (f) was there, and we talked for a while. I later saw her go to the door and greet her boyfriend. I'd met him before at various parties, they'd been dating around 6 months. He'd brought his kids with him, who we'd never met. His girlfriend met him at the door (not her house) I jokingly made a comment about their lame side hug. Apparently he hadn't told his kids he was dating anyone. At dinner the other night, they brought it up and told me I'd single handedly spilled the beans to his kids, and the tone of the conversation wasn't jovial. I do feel bad, and I did apologize, but the more I think about it, the more I'm annoyed (on the verge of being pissed) that I was put in that situation.\n\nIf it was that big a deal, why couldn't she subtly mention it before he arrived? There was probably an hour at least and it wasn't that large a group. And why would you bring your kids to a party hosted by your girlfriend's friends (he knew everyone through her) and expect no one to mention it? This wasn't a new relationship, I think it's reasonable to presume after 6 months he's told his family. \n\nSo AITA? ",

      "description": "So some context here, I was a Senior and it was  my last semester of HS. I was ready to graduate and only had to pass 1 more final to walk. This final happened to be for my theatre class. We were to perform 3 showings of a play over 3 days. I was a major character and had NO understudy so if I didn’t show up the show could not go on and I wouldn’t be able to graduate with the rest of my class. \n\nAt the beginning of the semester our teacher gave us the 3 days the play was  going to be on so that we could make sure that we had ample time to plan our schedules around it (May 1st, 2nd, and 3rd) My mom tells me she’s thinking about having her wedding (her 3rd marriage) during either the first or second week of May and I told her that if it was on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd that I wouldn’t be able to be there for it because of the play.\n\nFast forward and it’s May and we’ve already done our first 2 performances. A month earlier my mom told me that she and her husband were having the wedding on the 3rd at 2pm. I said alright and left at that thinking that she remembered that my final was that day. I should have followed up with her to make sure she remembered and that was my mistake.\n\nSo it’s the 3rd and we’re all at the theatre rehearsing our lines and putting on make-up etc. But then I get the phone call.My mom wants to know when I am going to be there for the wedding to help set up. I tell my mom that I’m not going to the wedding and that I had told her I couldn’t go because of the show like I had told her months ago. \n\nShe flipped her shit and immediately began screaming at me. Telling her I never told her that I couldn’t come (bullshit) and that she never heard that I would be busy ( she went to this play and had a play bill IN HER HAND with the dates and times of the showings) and that this is important to her so I should just come anyway.\n\nWhen I told her no I could not just come because of my role and the fact that my entire graduation depended on me doing this performance (like I had told her) she called me a liar and asked how stupid I thought she was that a play would be my final. She then threw at me that “Well this is my third wedding so I bet you don’t think it’s important anyway you’ll just make it to the next one,” and I got angry and said “yeah that’s exactly it.” \n\nI know it was petty and childish but she had pissed me off. She didn’t talk to me for a while after that and to this day refuses to believe that I A) told her about the play B) it was my final C) I wouldn’t have graduated if I bailed. So am I an Asshole?",

      "description": "Her parents rent a big enough space at a beach that they, their Moms, and my family (Wife, toddlers, and myself) each have a place to sleep if my wife and I share a bed. It's extremely generous of them to do this, they let us stay there for free and we're free to do whatever we want from there, but 90% of the time all of us stay together. It's essentially a half paid for vacation yearly.\n\n\nThe problem for me is two fold. The first thing is that my side of the family lives far away, and I have to use vacation time to see them. Family is extremely important to my side of the family, so this is a huge problem for me when I don't get time with them. We live close to her family, and it uses half of my vacation allocation yearly which severely limits the time I get to see my own family. Regardless, we've done this twice, once each for the last two years, and I find myself missing my family often and it's getting to where it's really effecting me.\n\n\n\nThe second issue is that last year my wife and I had a huge fight while we were there, and she tried to use her family against me while I was there. It didn't work, because thankfully they were all reasonable and told her what she was doing was wrong, but it was a HUGE embarrassment to me. She apologized profusely but this is a reoccurring issue with her that she knows I get sick missing my family, she knows how I feel isolated, and then she tries to involve them and have them gang up on me. It used to work but lately they've stopped listening to her. She has promised me it won't happen again and we've been great since then. Regardless, it has completely ruined the idea of being there for me. \n\n\n\nWhen I think about going this year there is zero joy in the thought. I would honestly rather stay home alone then go. I dread the thought of having to go again. AITA for rather wanting to spend that time at to visit my own family and let her go with the kids with her family? \n\n\nShe's a stay at home mom so she doesn't have to use any vacation time.",

So I was hanging out with a group of friends (maybe 5 other people) and we were all in this public parking lot. Then suddenly this random guy walks up to us and says if we could give him some money for some gas. Keep in mind that he didn't look like a guy who had no money ( I think he also drove a Nissan). All of us didn't know what to say since we all don't really like denying giving people money. It creates the most awkward situation for us. So after a while of back and forth, I say that all I have is my card, and he says to me that if we could drive to the nearest gas station with him to pay for his gas. Now, I already said no to having any money, and I didn't want to say no again. So I offer to drive to the gas station with him. But I still had my suspicions that he was just trying to get free gas. So with no evidence on whether he needed gas or not, I just decided to tell him to meet me at the gas station, but I never went there. My friends said that I shouldn't have done that, and that I just wasted what little amount of gas he had, for no reason. AITA for doing this?",

She never had a bad word to say about anyone, sure she was a little relaxed but it was an absolutely amazing job. \nCut to October, she finds a better job and we all sadly said goodbye. This is when my new manager started. From that moment on, she has ridiculed me about everything. From my hairstyles to my shoes, my clothes and even so far as to blame my mental health. So this week i decided enough was enough, after they cut my contracted hours from 16 to 11.5, that’s it. I handed in my notice. \nBasically, i’m now getting a huge load of grief from her because i’ve ‘let her down’ and ‘let the company down’ because i work in a small franchise with only 2 other people who will now have to share the 9-5:30 hours 5 days a week between them. \nAm i an asshole?",

      "description": "hear me out on this one \n\nMy SO and I had planned to attend a jazz performance at a small cafe, and we paid for our tickets in advance. You were supposed to have bought a ticket to be in the cafe during the performance. We get there before it starts and order our food. The place is pretty packed, and there were no open tables. But we figured that if we waited a little for the music to start then people who weren't planning to stay for it would be clearing out.\n\nUnfortunately this never happened. We had our food brought to us and we were basically awkwardly standing in the corner, holding our plates and hoping that a table would clear soon. I think eventually somebody brought us some plastic stools or something but it still really sucked given that we had paid for the opportunity to be here.\n\nOne of the waitresses alerted me that there was two ladies in a booth that were supposed to be leaving, as they didnt pay to stay for the music, so they should be gone soon. Guess what, they never left either. They had finished their food 30-45 minutes ago and were still here. The waitress kept apologizing to me. I was pretty pissed at both the cafe for prioritizing people who didnt buy a ticket over us, and also the women for not having self awareness. After about 45m to an hour from when the performance started, and my SO was already visibly upset by how everything was turning out, I went over and tried to politely ask the women if they'd be leaving soon. I get that this would be rude under normal circumstances but I didnt really give a shit. They give some BS answer like \"oh yes we were JUST about to leave\" (sure) and I go back to my SO hoping they'll just go. But nope, first they call over the waitress to tattle on the big bad man who just dared to ask them when they were leaving, who then comes to me and sternly tells me \"please dont ask our customers when they'll be leaving.\" and on top of this the women stayed another half hour or something, clearly just to piss me off.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole? What exactly was I supposed to do in this situation?",

      "description": "so. I had a rough childhood. social isolation. semi neglectful parents. intense bullying etc. this doesn't matter much now. but it provides some context. \n\nso just over two years ago things had started going good for me. \n\nI finally had started treatment for my depression. I started a job that had decent enough pay and hours that I could live well. \n\nand I had even started to get into dating for the first time in my life at 24. \n\nI had been living in a nice house with a few good friends. (jake, Phil and a couple others) \n\nthen a once close friend and longtime roommate jake. started spreading lies and using me as a scapegoat for his being a slob. \n\nall because jake didn't want his new girlfriend to find out he was a pig. \n\nnow. I tried to be diplomatic. I didn't want to point fingers. and I tried to take responsibility. I know that my depression tends to make it hard to keep up with household chores. \n\nthat wasn't good enough. I was made out to be responsible for the mess of three people. jake, his girlfriend, and myself.\n\nand I was given an ultimatum. \n\nmove out or we (jake, Phil and other mutual friends) will all hate you. (this is where my issues with ostracism and social isolation come into play) \n\nso I tried to appease them. I agreed to leave. but I had just started my new job. money was tight. \n\nthen I got Into a car accident. I was fine. my car was totaled. and insurance takes a while. \n\nI was spending $50 a day just to get to work and back. because public transit didn't reach my new workplace. \n\neventually the stress of it got to me. I couldn't sleep more than two hours a night. \n\nI lost my job. I had to move back in with my parents to my hometown. my own personal hell. \n\n\nI had to spend a miserable, lonely year of my life there. \n\ntook me working 14 hour days for nearly three months straight just to get the money to move out again. there was no other work there. \n\nthen it took me breaking down in tears for my parents to actually help move. there are no moving companies in the town either. \n\nsince then I've been putting back my life piece by piece. it's been rough. \n\nand I REFUSE to associate with jake. the scumbag who's lies did that to me. \n\nbut according to Phil.\n\nmy being unwilling to forgive him is \"selfish\" and \"ignorant\" and I just need to let it go. \n\nthey, along with a few other friends have directly told me \"they wish things could go back to the \"good ol days\" \n\nand I have made it clear. that even though that would be nice. it's not going to happen. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\nTL:DR a one time friend majorly screwed me over. other mutual friends say that I'm being selfish for not forgiving him.",

      "description": "My SO has a thing about keeping his slate clean. He wants to tell me absolutely everything, even if it isn't necessary. Here's my list:\n\n1. He told me he told his best friends about my mental health issues and some of my insecurities. On several occasions he also told me what they advised him to do. I understand his need for an outlet but it hurts so much to know my privacy isn't protected and I'm constantly wondering what they're thinking when they see me.\n\n2. He tells me what he honestly thinks about me, like, he can't respect certain things about me because I make poor life choices because of my mental health issues. Let's just say he has no filter. Sometimes the things he says absolutely shatters me. It has come to the extent of me not telling him things sometimes for fear of his response.\n\nI'm not blaming him for saying these things because I get where he's coming from and he's just being honest but I feel like his need to keep his slate clean is at the expense of my mental and emotional well-being. The cumulation of everything he has said is exacerbating my depression and anxiety and sometimes I can't even function because I get so preoccupied with every little word.\n\nI told him I need what I define as a gentleman. Someone who will understand what to say and what not to say to me by prioritising my feelings. E.g. telling me what he tells his best friends is unnecessary. I would honestly be completely fine assuming he doesn't tell them my deep dark secrets. But now I can't unknow it. Every time I know he meets them without me, it ruins my entire day because I obsess over what they're saying about me. I have gone through a lot that I don't want the world to know - 3 suicide attempts, self-harming to the extent of endangering my life. P.S. - I'm not even forbidding him from telling them. I just feel like there's a combination of him prioritising himself and his friendships over me. But he says I carry too much shame over my mental health issues and it's a vicious cycle.\n\nHe says he needs to be able to tell me everything because that is what strengthens emotional connection for him and also he's lived a very fulfilling life adhering to this philosophy. No lies, no secrets, no omissions. A complete open book.\n\nBut it's also killing me. AITA for not wanting him to practice this philosophy with me? Or is it a deeper compatibility issue that cannot be solved?\n\nFor context if it matters, I'm 31F, he's 40M and we've been together over a year.",

      "description": "The context: a guy a went to school with (and now college) has cerebral palsy. He’s confined to a power chair and cannot do very much by himself. He seems like a nice guy on first impression, but once you get to know him he’s really not as nice as he seems. He talks rudely about people behind their backs, will be rude to your face sometimes, and acts as if the rules don’t apply to him in most situations. \n\nAm I the asshole for not glorifying him or putting him on a pedestal like everyone else does? He gets elected for things like homecoming king and other things like that because (I think) people feel sorry for him. He also likes to play the disabled card when he wants something to go his way. \n\nIt’s not that I dislike him because he’s disabled, but I genuinely don’t care for his attitude. I’ve asked a few friends if they have a similar opinion and they basically said I’m the asshole for not supporting him unconditionally.",

      "description": "Let me start by saying I didnt exactly impose an ultimatum or anything like that. Those are automatically YTA material. \n\nNow she has always loved animals, which I get and I love them to, but not to the extent which she does. Animals are a lot of work and a lot of money to take care of between the food, the litter, (for cats which is what we have) replacing the litter boxes every so often, etc... Well when we first got together she had 2 cats. Fine and dandy, 2 is manageable and I like cats so no big deal. Well after picking up a few strays along the way, and not having the money to get them fixed when we should have (don't start about that, I get it, bad cat owners. Remember what I said about them being expensive?) we eventually topped off at 6 permanent cats with litters of kittens that we got rid of along the way. It hasn't been easy and its caused a lot of stress between us and to us personally but we made it through. Last year we lost two of our cats due to health complications (we got them to the vet, they were sick with feline leukemia and we had to have them euthanized for different reasons between the two of them). It was very hard on both of us but we were back down to a manageable, albeit not ideal, 4 cats. Well guess what? The only female kitten we have got pregnant again and had a litter of 5 kitten, we still have all 5 6 months later with no end in sight. Oh, and guess what? She's pregnant again and about to burst. Our last male cat has an appointment to be fixed this month and I told her outright that if he doesnt get fixed, and the kittens that are 6 months old aren't gone by the end of the month, I'm leaving. \n\nNow let me explain why, besides the ridiculous amount of stress it puts on me since I'm currently staying home and have to clean up after 9 cats, and stay up all night to make sure the kittens don't end up pregnant. When our pregnant cat has kittens again, I can see her current kittens causing issues for the new litter. The current litter likes to try to be around mom, obviously, but the mom doesnt like it, I guess because she's pregnant again. So I can see that being a problem when mom is with her new litter. I also am fearful for the health of not only our cats, but the 6-month old litter. Feline leukemia is contagious and we aren't yet sure which of our cats, if any more, have it. The longer this litter is around our cats, the more susceptible they are to the disease. Also the 6-month old litter is causing a lot of stress to our current cats, cause we simply dont have room for 9 cats plus ANOTHER litter right now. \n\nI'm at the end of my rope. She won't meet me halfway when it comes to getting rid of them. The animal shelter is very expensive to surrender them to ($100 per kitten) amd she doesnt want to post them online because she wants to make sure they go to a good home, which I understand but look what that's costing us. I left home almost a week ago to get a break from all the cats and if it were up to me I wouldnt go back, but I wanted to make it clear to her that I absolutely would be leaving again for good if the kittens weren't gone by the end of the month and our last male cat wasn't fixed. AITA here? ",

This crew would grow naturally as we all found peps we digged and would hang with.\n\nBut once those numbers grew, relations kinda stretched, even peps I met were not around as much. The original couple of peeps would ask me to help them, ask ideas, but would neglect any efforts and belittle any efforts I had in their endeavors. Then once done with the convo, go and hang out with the new peps for fun and games and yadda yadda. Stopped kinda being interested until they needed help.\n\nFew weeks later of this type of behavior, asked them about it. And they would get defensive, stating that my view of the situation was flawed, that I had no understanding and that I should be more humble. Despite the treatment during said endeavors.\n\nA few months later, the situation hasn't improved. And it evolved to feeling like a crutch rather then a friend, and when mentioned, the response to this from them was that. It was invalid, manipulative and psychopathic to tell them my feelings on the subject.\n\nRecently said to hell with it, and cut them from my life.

      "description": "Using a throwaway because a couple friends follow my main.\n\n\nSo awhile back I started to like this girl. A friend of mine liked her at the same time. I knew that he liked her, he might’ve known that I liked her. We never really talked about it. My friend ended up dating her for a little while. She was his first real girlfriend and they dated for about two months or so. It was in tenth grade so it didn’t get super serious or anything, but it got serious to him.\n\nWhen they broke up he was really torn up for a while. I never really talked to him much about it because he never opened up to me too much, but everyone could see how upset he was. I stopped talking to the girl for a few months. The two of us weren’t super close and I figured I needed to stand by my friend.\n\nAfter a little while passed I started to talk to her again. Feelings started to re emerge. As some more time passed we actually became pretty good friends and it became clear we both had feelings for her. I didn’t make a move though because even though it was almost half a year later he was clearly still hung up on her.\n\nAbout a years passed since there relationship happened. My friend started to get upset with me a lot. He had a tendency to get pretty mad at people, and around this time it was especially me. He caught on that I like the girl, but rather than talking it out he started to get mad at me constantly. To be fair though, I didn’t talk to him either.\n\nAfter a little while of this, this girl tells me that she likes me. I tell her I like her too, but I say before we do anything I have to talk to my friend. I talk to my friend and ask if it’s ok to ask her out. He says it is so I ask her out. \n\nWe start dating and it’s all ok for a little bit, but then my friend starts getting extremely mad at me constantly. He explodes and then all together stops talking to me. \n\nUltimately the relationship ends, and my friend still won’t talk to me. According to the rest of my friends, he wants to be friends again and has forgiven me. But I don’t want to be friends with a person that stopped talking to me after he said it would be ok to date this girl. My friends have told me to be the bigger person and apologize. So am I the asshole here for not wanting to be friends again and for ignoring him from here on out?",

      "title": "AITA for leaving work early because my Dad was picking on me?",
      "description": "This is a long story and it's a bit hard for me to describe the situation since there are lots if details  and I'm not going to omit info since details matter \nTL:DR at the bottom\n\nSo a little background. My work consists of me helping my dad on our own construction site. It's a pretty large construction site for the fact that there are few workers. Usually it's my Dad and an unskilled labourer. When I have a holiday I go to help him because I understand that he is working for me and my brother's future. Usually I go from 7 am-11 am (4 hours since I'm underage). In these Christmas holidays I've been going everyday except Sunday and Christmas. I didn't go for the last 2 days since I had to go do voluntary work for a school project. \n\nAnyway, yesterday I told my Dad that I didn't need to voluntary work tomorrow (which is today) so I can come to work he said he'll find me something to do. My dad pays me since he thinks that motivates me to come to work and I'm grateful. This morning I woke at 6:30 had breakfast and changed  my clothes to the concrete caked ones and rode my bike to the construction site it takes me about 5 minutes to get there at normal speed on my bike. On arrival I left my bike near the door and closed it and went inside the kitchen put on safety shoes and drank a glass of water.\n\n I went up stairs to the part if the building still being built and I found my dad and the unskilled labourer (Who was pretty new about 3 weeks) building the roof of a room. I asked my dad what I should do and he told me to take the scattered stones around the room near the buzzsaw. After, I helped the labourer take up a stone on his shoulder (about 30 by 8 inches of limestone) and he climbed onto the ladder to pass it to my dad. My dad told him not to lift it like that (from his back) and when I helped him lift it onto his shoulder again, my dad told me (in our language, the labourer was foreign) \"Has this guy never seen anyone lift a stone?\" I wasn't sure how to respond since I forgot the proper way to lift it too. Then he showed him how. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later he got a call from the guy we borrowed the material lift from that they were outside and came to get it. My dad said to me \"Already? We just have to lift these last few things and we will give it to them, go open the door for them.\" So I went downstairs and opened the door for them I couldn't see them clearly due to my -7 eyesight and me not wanting to break my glasses at work so I waved to them but when they didn't respond I taught they were the neighbours and got slightly embarrassed/awkward.  \"Come in\" I said but they must have heard \"Coming\" instead and said don't worry. I was confused so I went back upstairs and saw my dad and the labourer carrying the lift and then tying it up so we would lift it with the crane (Which was in the courtyard) onto the ramp were the truck with stones usually comes for deliveries. \"Go open the gate\" my dad said. The gate was locked from the outside so I had to go open. I opened the gate for the truck to go onto the ramp. \n\nMy dad then asked me from the 1st floor where the lift and room with roof they were working on where \"Did the truck come in?\" Why did he ask me this? Sound travels badly here so If I could hear him asking me this question he should be able to see the truck. I respond with a loud \"yes\" so that he can hear me. I went back upstairs and drove the tower crane with the lift onto their truck and proceeded to go back downstairs and close the gate. When I went back upstairs my dad asked me why I was shouting I told him so that he could hear me. He told me the I embarrassed him in front of the truck drivers by yelling and getting angry. What? He didn't even talk to them! I've been told I always sound angry which is probably true but what was I supposed to do! He asked me a question! \n\nWell whatever I brushed it off and went back to work. I started sweeping the floor off debris and stone dust into a wheelbarrow. While doing that I talked to my dad about something that popped into my head, \"I thought Noel (my brother) was coming with you guys tonight to the dinner of your friends? Is he coming with me to sleep at our grandparents? Did he change his mind?\" He then said \"Let him do whatever he wants.\" My dad then went to cut some stones in the other room with the buzzsaw. \n\nI continued sweeping the floor. Labourer comes in the room with a stone carrier and a stone on it and lays the stone on the floor.  He then stares at the ladder breathing heavily. Then after staring for about a minute at the ladder proceeds to move it to the side and also move the concrete bricks underneath to make the ladder higher. He then goes back out of the room. He then comes in with a new stone on the carrier and dies the same thing again. What? Why does he keep doing that? He didn't even use the ladder before. And instead of going round the pile of stone dust he proceeds to trample over it with the carrier and his himself. He did this last week too. This fucker. He can spend a minute staring at a fucking ladder but he can't waste a second to go round the pile I was sweeping. Ok I wasn't that angry since it happened before but I was annoyed. Whatever. He then comes back into the room with a new stone and proceeds to do the same thing minus the trample thing.\n\nWhat even is going on? I go to the other room. \"Dad, what was is it you told him to do? He keeps moving the ladder around.\"\n\"I told him to move the ladder so he can put stones instead of the ladder\"\n\"Why is he moving it each time he comes into the room?\"\n\"Every time you do this! Mind your own business, I'm in charge of him! This isn't school! Going to report people to the teacher.\"\nWhat the hell! Last time I did this was 5 months ago when a different labourer kept staring about and doing nothing when he could be doing something! \n\nI got the wheelbarrow I was filling with stone dust and debris took it to its room. I put my broom and shovel in the storage room and went downstairs. I checked my phone it should be 9 at least by now right? 8:20 and a missed call. It was mom, I called her back\n\"Honey, ask dad if he opened the garage so that the maid can come in and call me back with his answer\"\n\nSo I went and asked him.\n\"He said yes mom, also in coming home early\"\n\"Isn't there anything to do?\"\n\"Not really, bye\"\n\nMy dad always told me if you don't want to be here you can leave I'm not forcing you. I never did leave early since when I started in June since I felt guilty, even in days where it was 35°C and I was stuck driving the crane. \n\"Dad,I'm leaving\"\n\"Bored already?\"\n\"Yes\"\nIn my mind I rationalized there was no crucial work to be done and I would end up wasting time.\nI already felt terrible for leaving work early because i felt entitled and thought it would be awkward later today when he comes home.\n\nWhen I arrived home I heard Mom in her new office talking in the phone. Then I realised it was dad.\n\"What's going on?\"\n\"DAHunter go get your laptop down here you're not allow to use it\"\n\"What? Why!\"\n\"Dad has been telling me how you yelled at him in front if the construction workers, reporting your brother and reporting the labourer!\"\nI couldn't help it, I yelled at her\n\"WHAT THE HELL HE IS MAKING STUFF UP I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT\"\nShe then got off the phone, my mom has a problem with stress and I felt bad for shouting.\nI then proceeded to explain my side if the story.\n\"DAHunter, you're racist! You always go report anything the labourers do wrong just because they are black!\" \nWhat has that got to do with anything?\n\"I don't hate black people mom! I hate idiots!\"\n\"That doesn't excuse you embarrassing your father!\"\nShe then shouted from across the house \n\"Noel! Get off your computer and come do your homework!\" (Noel is 12 and that's not his real name). \n\nI then went to take a shower for about 20 minutes. I still can't see what I did wrong. Maybe from their point if view I did something wrong because I'm easily angered. My shout sounds angry, My dad thinks I always pick on my brother even when he is not there and apparently I'm a racist and can't stand people. Sorry this was so long but I wanted as much if the story here since I'm not sure during which moment I was an asshole in.\n\nTL:DR My dad got mad at me at work for yelling and apparently embarrassing him and asking him what the hell the labourer was doing. I went home and he called my mom with a version that was to me, twisted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I'm an introvert, my SO knows this. I also happen to despise weddings, but go and try to have a good time when I'm there. We have 5 weddings every weekend for the next 5 weeks that I am attending. Leading up to this, I dread it. I usually want to vent about why I dread it to sort of communicate that it's not easy for me to have fun at these things but I really don't want to have a bad attitude while I'm there, so venting helps me with that. Sorta gets it all out of the way early.\n\nThese weddings are all SO's friends/family and she feels self-conscious when they all pry as to why I'm not there, so I attend to ensure she isn't in the spotlight.\n\nMy SO views my ranting as pessimism and that it isn't going to help anything, so why have a bad attitude? She also happens to love weddings and be very extroverted.\n\nI really don't want to be a drain on her though, so lately I've taken to venting to my siblings/friends, when she joined a conversation with me and my sister who relates well with me on this subject, my SO was somewhat offended I was venting about it to family.\n\naita? Is venting about or dreading the receptions a jerk move that I need to correct in myself?",

      "description": "The first month of marriage my husband and I created a brand new budget where we merged all of our accounts. This included $50 that was being sent to my sister monthly toward her ministry (she's a missionary/ my husband is an agnostic,) and a $300 phone bill that included my husband, his parents, his sister, and her boyfriend (including, phones.) \n\nWhen I met my husband he was living with his parents but wasn't paying rent so it made sense that he contributed to expenses by paying the phone bills. At the time his mom wasn't working, and his sister was in college and had never worked before.\n\nI'm close with his family, we get together a couple times a month and for the most part get along well. However, there is certainly a cultural divide. The family is from the middle east, it's not unusual at big family gatherings for my FIL to call out my husband, in front of his extended family, for being cheap. Which I know bothers my husband, though it doesn't push him to change our spending habits. His father can be a generous person, it is not unusual for him to decide in the moment to drop $100  for everyone's dinner. \n\nSix months into the marriage, my SIL had her birthday and her dad surprised her with a brand new I-Phone. During the party my husband looked troubled, I kept asking what was up and he would just shake his head, \"Not now.\" On the drive home he took out his phone and checked our phone bill. My FIL had purchased the phone through our account, adding a payment plan. We were both furious, we turned the car around, my husband and he argued, and I completely lost my temper. When his sister found out, she was embarrassed and offered to return the phone (which my FIL refused to pay for,) neither my husband nor I felt right about that, so we dropped it. \n\nWe have now been paying for everyone's phones for two years. We have lived on our own the entirety of that time (I've had my own place since I met my husband.) My MIL has been working for a year. My SIL graduated and now is working a fairly decent job. Her boyfriend is also working but in retail. All of them live together with my FIL. \n\nMy husband suggested they begin to pay for their own phones in a month's time and the shtf. My SIL said straight out, \"No,\" like it was her decision. It was the most uncomfortable week ever. Their arguments were that it was family obligation, and that because individually they make less than us (everyone but my FIL,) that we should continue to pay.\n\nWe were holding firm in our decision, then my FIL got injured at work and went on unpaid leave. So we backed off, because that would have been messed up, and helped out with their electric bill. But, now he's working again, and I want to move forward with our plan. My husband has lost the desire to though, seeing his father in a weakened state has left him unsure of what to do here. I can get waiting but will this ever happen, should this ever happen? Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So I joined a club at my university and became fast, close friends with Michael, the president of the club. Our relationship started off a bit strange and we did things that people who aren’t just friends should do, but both of us knew it wasn’t serious and it was never like super over the top or anything. I joined pretty late in the semester though and didn’t realize that Michael was close friends with a girl named Amy.\n\nAmy was dating Ben, but I quickly found out that Michael was desperately in love with her. They were best friends and always talking and he fell HARD for her. She would tell him that even though she was dating Ben, she and Michael were meant to be together, that she was in love with him too, that they would get married right after college. Michael, meanwhile, kept attempting to convince her to breakup with her boyfriend so they could be together finally. It was a shitshow and Amy’s boyfriend was aware this was happening the whole time and would mock Michael about it constantly. There was also a lot of evidence that Amy had two boyfriends (not Michael, it was another random guy outside of our university), but Michael was blind to it and supported her 100%. Anyways, eventually it became obvious that Amy was just stringing Michael along to get a higher position of power within the club. I convinced Michael that Amy was toxic for him and that he needed to cut her off and he agreed, although he didn’t really want to and Amy ended up leaving the club. \n\nA couple of months later, he called me and told me that Ben and Amy had broken up and I told him I was really concerned because I knew they still talked sometimes and he told me that he just wanted to be there for her because he had experienced a similar breakup in the past, but that there was no romantic feelings between them still.\n\nSure enough, a couple of weeks later I find out that they’ve started dating. I know she’s no good for him whatsoever and frankly, I’m tired of having to deal with all of the drama she brings to Michael’s life. There’s a lot more details about why I just don’t support this relationship or really want to be friends with him while he’s dating her, but these are the most major reasons. I sat him down and told him that I was going to quit the club for a while because I’ve become more busy with schoolwork and that I think he and I should stop hanging out or talking. I never specifically told him it was because of Amy, but I think we both know it is. I feel like shit because he seemed so crushed and even started crying, but I absolutely refuse to clean up after his relationship with her anymore and watch him suffer while he’s with her. She might also still have that second boyfriend. So, AITA for cutting him off like this?\n\ntl;dr: Best friend is now dating a girl who we both know is super manipulative and borderline emotionally abusive. She might also have a second boyfriend. Don't want to deal with it, cut him off.",

      "description": "I teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don’t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend’s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I’d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour’s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can’t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that’s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I’d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn’t care about the kids, I’m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don’t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?",

      "description": "5 years ago in high school I ended a 3 year long relationship with a girl (called C). C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? ",

      "description": "Title is pretty self explanatory but here goes.\n\nOne of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn’t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn’t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn’t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn’t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn’t have bothered her if it weren’t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other’s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I’m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n",

      "description": "Hi Reddit. Posting this on my main for humility’s sake. I’m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don’t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don’t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don’t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details?

      "description": "My husband bought a brand new car last year. He was working at a company that offered monthly bonuses. His bonus per month, at minimum, would cover the monthly car payment. At the time I thought this was an OK idea, he'd get a car that would last us the next 10+ years, and even if he had a rough month, the bonus would cover most of the payment without really affecting our remaining budget.\n\nFast-forward to now, my husband left that job. It was a toxic workplace, I fully supported him leaving. However, his job prospects would make him significantly less than what he made before.\n\nBasically I crunched the budget, and even if he lands a job on the optimistic side, I'd still be taking a majority of the costs over in order to afford this car. We would also have zero money for savings. He's made it very clear that he wants to buy a house together in the next couple years (his big dream, I don't mind renting), with this car that simply isn't going to happen.\n\nHusband keeps saying he can \"make it work\" but I'm looking at a budget where I'm covering 75% of the household needs and it leaves us with maybe $70 extra per month if we are strict as hell. There's just no way we could save enough for a house at this rate.\n\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA for telling my husband if he wants a house in the next couple years, we need to ditch his new car?",

      "description": "It's a long story (I can try to bulletpoint if anyone wants to know) but I took a DNA test months ago. Found out my dead father isn't my father, it's my godfather who is estranged to us. My mother actually made him my godfather *because* she knew I was biologically his. I suspected for a decade but didn't know till I got the test\n\nBefore my bio father became estranged to us he had a son with his girlfriend. I met the son when he was a newborn. The girlfriend left with the son to another state and my bio father left us to be with her a while later. Didn't talk to him for over a decade. We still don't really talk and I found out the girlfriend became his wife and they're now completely separated. They had two more kids and he's not allowed to see them, so I can't even speak to them through him.\n\nOut of curiosity I decided to look the son up since I remembered his name and realized he'd be a teenager. At one point my bio father, who lived with us at the time, was going to seek custody of him. So for a few months I anticipated this kid being my little brother.\n\nShockingly, the kid looks *exactly* like me. His childhood photos look exactly like my nephew. My sister is also my godfather's, we knew that for sure 100% for years. She took her own test and it says we're full siblings. I showed my friends and therapist his photos from his Facebook and they thought they were old photos of me with long hair. We're almost twins.\n\nSo, yeah, the kid is 16 now. He has his own Facebook and Instagram. \n\nI messaged his mother on Facebook to ask her permission to speak to him months ago. I wrote the letter with my therapist and was cordial and delicate considering the circumstances. She never responded. I was heartbroken but understood. \n\nMy mother brought the kid up the other day and said she knows I'm probably sad that I can't have a relationship with my two little brothers and sister. I told her I was going to wait till the youngest is in their 20s before reaching out (that'll be in 10 - 12 years). She said the oldest is 16 and she thinks he's old enough for me to at least PM him to introduce myself.\n\nI'm super conflicted. I don't know this kid and I don't know if he can handle something like this. On the other hand, 16 is old enough to understand. At the end of the day I want him to decide whether he wants me in his life or not, not his mother. Obviously, she can decide that for right now, but when he's an adult he can choose on his own.\n\nMy mother disagrees and thinks 16 is fine. She's under the impression that he probably wouldn't tell his mother and just talk to me. I wouldn't want to do that, however. I don't want to burn bridges or cause unnecessary issues with his mother. \n\nFamily is super important to me, especially siblings. My sisters and their kids are my best friends. Would I be the asshole if I PM'd him despite his mother indirectly telling me no? Should I wait till he's 18 or in his 20s?\n\nAdvice? Has anyone been in this situation before?",

      "description": "Actually i dont know where to start from. But i happened that my first gf and broke up peacefully about 3 months ago and i feel quite good about it. From time to time i think about the good times we had and get melancholic but its not like i am sad or something.\n\nNow i happened, that a girl i know from when we sometimes meet at a friends, approached me while going out. We chatted and started to text a lot quickly afterwards. I felt great to have someone to talk to again and was happy about how well we get along. The thing that bothers me is that she is turning 17 next month and me 20. Its not like i would be a huge gap but sometimes i feel like she isnt mentally on my age and i would like to rather have her as a friend instead of as a gf. But i kinda sense she feels not that way.\n\nNow two weeks later we still are chatting a lot and i still feel like there is not much room for feelings on my side even though shes quite cute. But yesterday when we went out partying i meet old friends of mine that i havent seen in a long time. (long story short) One of their friends that was there with them started to dance closer, then back to back and then we kissed and made out. \n\nI actually dont know how and why that happened but i kind of feel guilty. Guilty for actually not intending to have a relationship right now because i dont feel able to have romantic feelings to anyone, guilty for the girl i kissed because she could be thinking i feel something for her, guilty for the girl i am texting with and the old friends of mine that think there is potential for us two\nI keep thinking what shall i do, did i fuck up or was that ok, Am i a dick or just to concerned?

      "description": " Ok so I've (19f) been dating this guy (19m) for around two months now and everything has been going pretty good:) I got out of an emotionally, and semi-physical abusive relationship in August of last year, and my current boyfriend is the opposite to my ex, which is great. I only have one issue with my bf, and it's that everytime he compliments me, he calls me \"hot\".\n\nI know that this is a really stupid thing to bother me but I got 2 reasons why I dislike it. The first being that I think it is a sort-of objectifying term, and it makes me think that my body is the most important thing to him. I would much rather him call me \"pretty\", \"beautiful\", or \"cute\" because I think those compliments take my personality into consideration. I feel kind of uncomfortable if he sees my sex appeal as my defining trait. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the thought behind the compliment and I find him really attractive too so I try to compliment his looks aswell. But the term \"hot\" seems to only focus on my body and sex appeal, and not to sound like a stereotype but I want our relationship to be deeper than that. (Another important note here is that me and my bf haven't had sex yet)\n\nThe other reason I don't like him calling me hot is because my ex used to use that term constantly to describe me. My ex coerced me into sex on two occasions before I found out he actually had a girlfriend who he was cheating on her with me. He used to get me incredibly drunk and then take advantage of me in some way, thankfully we only dated for a month. I never really realized it was an abusive relationship because he seemed so loving towards me, he constantly called me \"hot\". I remember specifically he would say \"you're so hot you're making me so hard right now\" to hint that I should give him a bj. I was 18 at the time and really wanted to save having my first time with a guy I knew really well and I wanted the relationship to be deeper than sex. Anyway the word \"hot\" was his go-to compliment and that's why it triggers me a little lmao.\n\nAnyway so I've been planning the next time my bf calls me \"hot\" to explain my reasons to him and ask him to use another word. I'm afraid it's gonna sound like I'm picky or ungrateful? I'm sorry if this is too small of an issue for this subreddit btw",

      "description": "I am currently unemployed, finished Uni, still living with my parents, but wanting to move in with my bf soon and strongly allergic to furry animals, which resulted in me getting 4 or 5 years ago asthma since I live with cats. The overall allergy doesn't manifest as an usual cat allergy - I can be around cats, what really triggers asthma and allergy for me is dusty environment.\n\nSince I want to move in with my bf, who is from a neighbouring country with a totally different language (its Hungarian, with I understand only a few words), I have problems to find a job suitable for me - no work experience except a part time job and translation/ language related Uni aren't helping me much. At my bf apartment, I get less of allergy symptoms even if he owns 2 cats partly thanks to having a normal bed. At my parents' apartment, I sleep on a pull out futon sofa, which wasn't really build for every night sleeping on - the pull out part is wood with thin foam on top, which got worn out quickly and isn't comfortable anymore + the whole sofa is covered in cat hair collecting textile, it doesn't matter how much you try cleaning it you can't get rid of all the dust and cat hair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn't happy with the futon for a long time, hinted to my parents for at least 2 years that I would need a better and proper bed and they tried to compromise by buying a thin mattress to put on top and an air filter for my asthma that I have constantly running next to the sofa. Both helped somewhat, but my asthma always got back a month or so after. When I sneeze, have a runny nose and cough for several nights in a row and have to take meds and inhaler to just be able to fall asleep and feel terrible in the morning,I manage to get a big grumpy when parents don't seem to care enough, bring in more saved stray cats (have 5 in total now, but we have a big apartment so cats are doing well, no overcrowding) and tell you to just do sports outside, while the allergy doctors are alarmed my lung capacity dropped so low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast month I caught a cold that concentrated on flooding my lungs with slime I was coughing constantly and not getting any air when trying to sleep. The only place I could sleep was closing myself in the bathroom and sleeping on the floor with a yoga mat under me. Parents bought me a sleeping air mat, which didn't survive longer than a week, even if I tried to not let the cats near it. After the worst part of the cold went away I evacuated to my bfs appartment since my asthma still was extremly strong but I still need to get back to my parents place once in a while sice all my doctors (allergy, dentist...) are there.\n\nI still can't sleep on the futon since that cold, even with meds and parents refuse to buy me a new bed stating I can buy me one from my first salary (my parents are well off if they wanted to buy a bed its not a problem).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven my bf can't sleep on that bed well (back problems) and started to have his own first signs of allergy there.",

It wouldn’t be too big an issue for me to swap, but I know this flat is the best for me, so I refused a swap.

      "title": "AITA for snapping getting angry over a friend folding my underwear",
      "description": "Last week I got into a pretty severe car accident. A friend and I hydroplaned while entering the freeway on a roundabout, which caused the little Yaris we were in to slide into oncoming traffic. We got broadsided by a semi-truck. Amazingly, we both walked away unscathed, with the exception of some back pain on my part.\n\nIn the days following the accident I had an amazing outpouring of love and affection from my friends. People brought me food, family from out of state called to check in on me, and one of my college TAs was even cool enough to drop by with some edibles to help with my back pain.\n\nTwo days after the accident I got a message from my friend Eliza asking if I wanted some company. I said yes, and asked her if she could do me a huge favor when she got here and take my trash to the dumpster. I live in a second story apartment and getting down the stairs with a bag of garbage and a bad back just seemed like a monster of a mission at the time. Eliza says of course, and everything is set.\n\nCue to a few hours later and I'm lying on my couch being stoned and pathetic. I hear a rattling at my door and in walks Eliza, who I fully expected, but she also had our friend Wren with her, who I did not expect. Wren can be a bit much in a lot of ways.\n\nAfter greetings Eliza jumps into cleaning my kitchen, which I appreciated, but I kept trying to tell her that all I needed was the trash taken out. Eliza didn't listen.\n\nI had a basket of unfolded laundry sitting in my living room. Wren jumped right into folding that. Again, I kept insisting that she did not have to do that, and again, I was ignored. At one point, she pulled a pair of my underwear out and I immediately was like, \"hey, I don't like other people touching my underwear. Please stop.\" Wren took this as an opportunity to just chuckle, then proceeded to tell me a story about the first time she went to our friend Willowe's house and how she started cleaning and Willowe was uncomfortable and visibly angry, but Wren just kept going and how she could see that same discomfort in me and how she thinks it's funny.\n\nThis didn't sit well with me. Who the hell gets off on making their friends uncomfortable?\n\nSo I told Wren straight up that she needed to stop. I said I get that she's trying to help, but honestly, I'm sore and high and feeling really violated, which is mixing with my high and giving me this weird anxiety that I really don't like. I kind of snapped. Both Eliza and Wren felt the mood change, so they both left after that and said they were going to let me rest.\n\nI've spoken to Eliza since, but not Wren, and honestly, I don't want to talk to Wren. I don't think it's out of line for me to set boundaries and I don't think it's okay to intentionally cross someone's boundaries, even if it's in the name of \"just trying to help.\"",

      "description": "TL:DR- I allowed a friend to play on my steam account so that he can test out/ have fun on some games he's been wanting to play. I warned said friend about not buying games on my steam so that I would not have to worry about paying him back. He goes on to buy two games that add up to nearly $80. I bought him the key for one game and I still need to reimburse for the game that went on sale.   \n\n\n  \nLong version- Sorry if my  TL:DR didn't make a lot of sense. I am not really good with them.  \n\n\nI have a friend that wanted to play more PC games and try out certain games that I had in my steam library. Trying to be nice, I allowed him onto my steam so that he can play those games that he was interested in. I warned my friend that if he wanted to buy games then he would need to make his own account, so I wouldn't have to worry about reimbursing him for anything. Lo and behold he bought two games; one worth $20, and another worth $60. Of course, I was pretty livid, but I said I'll try to reimburse him for the games to the best of my abilities. My friend has not touched it since then, but recently asked me to reimburse him for the $60 game since I just paid him back for the $20 game. I literally had a mental breakdown because I barely have the money right now to pay back for those games since rent/utilities/etc has been kicking my ass. I confided in my boyfriend and he told me I don't need to pay him back in full; I just need to pay him back with a key.   \n\n\nI felt super guilty about it since I feel like I'm scamming him, but my boyfriend had reminded me that I had warned him about buying games on my account, and that it's not fair to me for reimbursing games that I'm not going to touch unless I'm actually interested.   \n\n\nI had asked for the receipt for the game, but he had sent me a screenshot of the first time he had bought the code. I asked where he had bought the CD code and he said amazon, and then someone else bought him another CD code for the same exact game through amazon again. And right now, there's a sale on it for $35.99 on steam. So I told him I could have just gifted me a new key for cheaper, but now he's giving me excuses about how someone else had bought the code for him and amazon doesn't do refunds as well as not providing me with the more recent receipt. I haven't replied since then as I'm still really upset about it.   \n\n\nSo AITA if I want to reimburse my friend with a new key code for a game he's interested in, instead of paying him back in full?  \n\n\n  \n\n\nP.S.-I'm sorry if my story is all over the place. I am not that great with grammar.",

      "description": "Throwaway because I'm curious and don't know if the couple uses reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the backstory: I own my home and in order to help with costs and savings I rent out the rooms in my home. I won't get too into details about this but recently I have been struggling financially for external reasons so having room mates has become a must. I have a three bedroom home, and typically only ever rent out one other room which is across the house. I live in a fairly nice upper-middle home in a quiet and safe neighborhood. I keep the place clean (I clean thoroughly once a week, I dislike messes) and all I really ask for in return is that payments are made on time and that you are kind to me and my fiancee. The rental agreement I provide is just a month-to-month agreement and it is fairly generous and lenient for the person renting the room. I do my best for background checks, personality checks, financial reviews, and etc. prior to accepting people in. The room costs typically $600 a month with a $350.00 security deposit which I return after inspection. This amount includes the monthly rent, internet, utilities, and pretty much everything minus their personal expenses. I do ask that they not let my two kittens outside (they're indoor cats) and that if they're going to use something (like plates or laundry detergent) that they just ask in advance - I'll likely say yes. For reference, the typical rent in my neighborhood for a room is about $1200, or $1800 for a one bedroom apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo due to recent financial struggles I had agreed to let a couple live with me. I figured I would give them one room with a discounted rate (Instead of $1200 for two people, it's just $800) and I would agree not to rent the second room while they are here (which means I'm earning less per month since not both rooms are rented). They did advise me they would have March as their last month as the girlfriend is pregnant and the baby would be due in late March. This was in November. I felt for them and wanted to help, and additionally I really needed the money at the time as my previous tenant had to leave on short notice (He was really nice though and we worked it out amicably, although at my financial burden).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInitially everything was fine but we started noticing many issues. They would drink and eat our food without asking. They would use stuff without asking. At one point early on we found one of my favorite cups was being used as a cup-holder for their toothbrushes under the sink in the guest bathroom. The girl (who is pregnant) is leaving cigarette butts outside my home and she also spends her time drinking on my patio and leaving her mess behind. They tamper with my thermostat and cause my electric bill to increase by about 60% (when I typically account for about a 40% increase with new tenants). Additionally, they started using my garage and extra room as storage despite being advised not to. I had to confront them on each issue and they pushed back either saying it wasn't them or they wouldn't do it anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow normally I'd be furious but I wanted to best assist them so I let them have these extra luxuries at no expense because it would be easier than arguing - and I also couldn't find new tenants to replace them despite my many efforts.\n\n  \nFast forward to today, the rent is due and they advise me they are leaving in two weeks and they only want to pay for half the month. Now our agreement in no uncertain terms says they need to give me a 30 days notice and they owe for the remaining thirty days. I attempt to be nice but before I can text a reply the boyfriend sends me a huge insulting text message saying \"We are leaving because you neglect your cats and they have fleas. We should've gotten a thirty day notice on the fleas and we can't live like this so we deserve to not pay you the full rent.\" Later on he agreed to pay the full amount and \"we will discuss prorating it later\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my kittens are everything to me. They're indoor cats. Me and my fiancee spoil them. Recently (as of about 15 days ago) we discovered a flea problem. Immediately we notified them, bug-bombed the house, brushed them, shampooed them, gave them anti-flea treatment and they came back again as of yesterday; so I intend to get in contact with an exterminator to see what options are available (as they may be in places I can't get to with conventional means).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis ended up being a longer post than I intended so I'll include a TL;DR at the bottom, but am I an asshole for demanding they pay the full rental amount as agreed by on our contract - and even more - I provided them official thirty day notice as of today to vacate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I accepted a pregnant couple into my home with a month-to-month agreement. They're trashy people and I've been nothing but kind while they drink and smoke on my patio together. Today they asked me to only pay a part of their rent and leave early, violating our monthly agreement which puts me in a rough financial spot.",

      "description": "To preface this, I’m in math class doing one of those group projects where everyone in the group gets the same sheet and works together to answer the problems. Then the teacher picks a random sheet from that group to grade and bases the entire group grade on that paper.\nSo obviously it makes the most sense to all get the same answers.\n\nThe groups were assigned.\n\nI am definitely not an A+ math student. By far. But I really do try and in this project I was trying to pull my weight. This group was 3 kids besides me who all knew what they were doing far more then me. I eventually get far behind them and start asking for help and then because our time to work on it is almost over, answers. I was genuinely trying really hard to keep up and was not trying to freeload. I just got behind and didn’t want to sacrifice the groups grades and I don’t think they would want to either. I felt bad and repeatedly apologized. \n\nThat should be the end of it right? Apparently not. I don’t follow this person (one of my group members) on Instagram and at this point am glad I don’t. I luckily have a brother who does. He tells me that her story has picture of a black background and some text reading something like “This fucking Grego-o kid, comes into our group and bullshits his way to get a good grade”. \n\nThis kid is semi-popular so their follower count is at about 2k (probably almost all kids from my school) and I’m pretty sure that means a lot of people are going to see it and at this point I’m pissed because I tried as hard as I could to keep up and wouldn’t have copied if I didn’t need to but got called out anyway even after apologizing. AITA if I confront them about this (in person) also knowing I’m not friends with them? Thanks in advance!",

      "description": " \n\nI’m posting this on a throw away account for obvious reasons. \n\nSo, I’m 19 and I moved across the country with one of my parents (parent #1) and my step-parent. I had an ok relationship with my parent who I don’t live near, lets call them parent #2 but it was a very stressful. My parents split was very messy and parent #2 alway tried to make it a pick parent #1 or me and was always pushing to spend every moment with them. I understand that they just have me and my sibling, but I also had to deal with the burden of constantly making me feel like I was guilty for any decision I made regarding time spent with parent #1 or parent #2. Parent #2 also argued that they didn’t have to support me if I didn’t see them enough and since the day I turned 18 even when I still saw #2 on an almost daily basis they did not support me financially. \n\nAfter moving I was basically pressured into visiting once after only 3 months even when I had a visit planned for about six months out. Well not parent #2 wants me to keep up a 3 month routine and honestly I don’t want to see #2 that often. #2 just always makes me feel like crap and pressures me into things I don’t want to do. Now don’t get me wrong I still like #2 but its just shitty to be pressured to do everything. They act like they give me options, but I know that the options aren’t really options. I’d be more than fine if #2 wanted to come visit me, but I’m tired of flying across country and taking off time (over a week each time) from work every 3 months. When I split my time almost 50/50 between my parents life was hell because I had to constantly listen to the bickering. It wasn't everyday, but it would got to the point of me having to leave the house a couple of times out of fear or anger. There were many good times during those years, but many taxing days as well.\n\nTo understand my situation a little better I’m a full time student and work 40 hours a week so I’m busy, but I like it and still want time to do my own things. I guess I might be selfish, but at this point I don’t know. I also don’t want to disagree with parent #2 because there parents have a college fund for me that will pay for a half of year, which is a lot of money for me. It almost feels like I just have that pressure of money looming over me. Plus I still love a lot of my family on that side, but its just tough because I don’t want to upset them by making parent #2 upset and they won’t see it my way, they never have but they don’t hold it over me.\n\nSo I ask, am I the asshole for not wanting to see #2 every 3 months? Also should I good see #2 or should I stand my ground?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could go way further in depth with the stories, but I don't want to be too specific.",

And promised I would help her to achieve this, I care about her after all, we spoke briefly and she referred to me as her best friend so yeah. \n\nIn the previous week's I didn't really get any contact from her and we stopped hanging out, I get that sure you need your space, but when Jane didn't have any one else to hang out with, or wanted something bought for her, she'd suddenly be there to hang out again? No effort outside of that. I spoke to her about this in a calm way to try and explain how it made me feel but it continued on regardless. \n\nJust before Christmas she messaged me regarding some stuff she wanted so i ordered Jane around $600 of PC hardware that she wanted, we shopped for this together and hung out for an hour or so for this, however once it was ordered and shipping date confirmed, I heard nothing again for around 3 days, just completely ghosted me. \n\nSo they were due to be delivered tomorrow and I cancelled them, I let Jane know that she wouldn't need to wait for the delivery and all of a sudden I was worth the time again for a message regarding me being in the wrong and to blame for her not speaking to me. \n\nAm I the asshole for feeling used and cancelling the parts? I care about her and said I'd help her out after all..",

It was about what if my friend is not a weeb and is a stan, a fan, or whatever. Then, I gave my point that it would be the same as if he is a weeb.\n\nMy point is that somebody might be interested in some topic if they actually deeply understand that topic. Like my friend, I think he might be (and he is) a weeb because he knows a lot about anime, like the characters, the series, etc. It is the same if someone is a fan of something. They must have knowledge of someone that they fan of, like their birthday, their real name, their songs, etc. It's because if someone has the interest of a topic, they will have the curiosity to learn the topic further because of how interesting it is. It is simple logic, I suppose.\n\nUnfortunately, my friend is having anger because of it, calling that if I were having a debate with that type of reasoning, then I will be boo'ed. Basically, he calls my point is utterly stupid. I tried to explain as clear as possible, but I think he doesn't understand what am I saying. He got to the point where he left a group chat that we and somebody joined.\n\nI feel bad for this because I seemed forced my point to him. A friendly argument suddenly going nuts because of me.

He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?",

      "description": "So we have a big lovable Dane mix who has been in our family about six months since rescuing her, shes a complete pansy when it comes to other dogs being aggressive, including my in-laws Chihuahua. In the mind of their upcoming visit, almost as a joke I asked my husband what he would do if the Chihuahua attacked our dog again like he did the last time they were here- and if Charlie defended herself, she acidentally ended up killing the tiny attacker- He said she would be immediately put down. He went on to say that any dog that could kill a smaller dog he wouldn't trust around our kids... And I was surprised how upset this made me. This is ridiculous as Charlie adores our children and has shown multiple times that all she does is run away or lay on her belly when dogs attack her, but it made me realize that I would completely defend her if she did bite someone or injure/kill their dog. Am I being completely irrational in favor of my dog, or is my husband completely overreacting?",

They used to stay together since 5th grade but last year of HS decided to switch mates. Now after the first semester they asked me if i could stay with one of their mates cuz they want to sit together again. I do not want to do that since i actually like sitting alone and it won't be the same especially cuz my mate is like a brother to me and it will be different if i sit with anyone else. Plus i don't really have anything in common with this girl and I don't want to sit with her, but I won't sit with anyone else either. It's not really personal, I just like sitting alone, but not having things in common is a minus.  \nSo am I the asshole for not letting them sit together ?",

I block her on all social media and don't talk to her the next day. I 'm talking to one of our mutual friends and he says she's upset lately. I would feel bad but like, That shit makes me mad.

It was just another contract, some more time serving the big red white and blue. I didn't really invite anyone, just had a few people out there to facilitate the proceedings. I've never been the kind to like big gatherings.\n\nWell, I come back after the ceremony and find my coworker has told my roommate, who I consider a pretty close friend. I hadn't invited him or his wife because I didn't think about it, and because again, I didn't consider it to be a big thing. Nonetheless, my roommate was pretty peeved- he felt excluded, and he told me as much. Apparently his wife was similarly upset. I kind of didn't talk to her about it, we all just kind of let it slide as if nothing took place. I really didn't mean for it to be taken that way.\n\nSo... am I the asshole?",

      "description": "tldr: I hired a cleaner for a certain number of hours, i lied about the size of the house because i only wanted him to clean the bottom floor, he cleaned it so quickly so there is time to work on the upstairs but he is angry that there are more bedrooms and bathrooms than listed, even tho ive told him he doesnt have to finish people's all only wjat he has time for.\n\nSo, I used an app to pay for a cleaner to come today, Its something me and my siblings do when we use our parents house when they travel (we are between the ages of 17 - 22 so we can pull together enough money for it) and when they are away, we have more freinds over than usual, might have a house party. They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n",

      "description": "Okay so backstory time, I’ve been friends with Person A for a long time, we go way back. But, he was a bit of a dick back in highschool, it wasn’t really his fault, I blame more the people he was hanging out with. After high school he moved out of the town and we lost touch. Recently he move backed and is a completely changed person.\n\n\n\nSo here’s where Person B comes in, we’ve only started being friends after high school, he’s usually pretty chill, but can get really impulsive and irrational when he’s mad. Here’s the kicker, I found out recently back in highschool, Person A played a real nasty prank on Person B. Now Person B was still legitimately upset about it, but had no clue that Person A was part of the prank.\n\n\n\nFast forward to last Saturday, I invited both of them to go drinking and the nights going fine, albeit a little awkward at first. Here’s where the problem happened, we ran into one of Person A’s old highschool friend, and he ends up spilling the beans about the prank done on Person B. Person B just gets furious and starts insulting Person A.\n\n\n\nI jump in to try and cool him off, since Person A has changed quite a lot since high school, but Person B isn’t having and of it, and tries to cold-clock right Person A in the face. I end up just tackling Person B to hold him down to try and cool him off. After he calmed down, I let him go and he curses us off, then leaves. He still hasn’t returned my texts, and he made it apparent that our friendship is over.\n\n\n\n\nSo who was the Asshole here?",

      "description": "My wife and I are mid 40s and have been married over a year.  She has this friend (J) that about 3 years ago, down in Mexico, got drunk and started talking bad about my wife (then my GF) in front of strangers the entire day and then at the end of the night, got into a physical altercation with my wife.  My wife called me at like 2:00am from Mexico, crying, told me what happened and said she was driving off in the rental car to get to the airport (she left J in the hotel room) and was coming home.  The entire way back to the States she kept calling me upset, etc.  J was also going through a divorce at the time because she got busted cheating on her husband with a coworker, who she also gave herpes to.  My wife has known J for 20 years.  J is also in her 40s.  \n\nAfter the Mexico thing happened, my wife told me she was going to cut J out of her life because she didn't need toxic people like that around her.  I thought this was a wise move.  My wife hasn't heard much from J over the past 3 years but has received the occasional reach out, \"I'm sorry\" type of text to which she replied politely to but never more than that.  My wife has said, when she chooses to shut a door, it stays shut.\n\nSo, a couple of days ago, my wife runs into J at a store and J starts crying and saying how sorry she was, etc.  My wife tell me this and I can only say that I don't like J but ultimately it was not really my thing, it was between her and J.\n\nMy wife got very defensive and said I wasn't supportive and that I only know bad stuff about J (which is true) and that we have all done stupid things like J did in Mexico.  I said yeah, maybe when I was like 21 or something, sure I may have gotten drunk and gotten rowdy but even then I don't remember cutting my friends down to make me look better and then fighting with them and I sure as hell don't remember doing anything like that in my 40s.\n\nI said from what I know of J she is unstable, selfish, toxic, mean, etc and I don't think she has a place in my life but if you want to give her a chance, that is up to you, just don't expect me to like her because I don't.\n\nThis turned into a major fight with my wife about how I should be supportive and how I don't really know J.  I told my wife, \"up until a few days ago, you thought the same way I did and only changed once you ran into J\".  \n\nI'm not sure what my wife wants from me.  I don't think many mid 40s women act like J did.  I don't want any drama or crazy around my wife or kids.  I can understand how J has good qualities as well but I just don't have a good vibe about her, even less so now that J is single and doing God knows what.\n\nNow, my wife thinks I'm an asshole and all I was really trying to do was be honest about how I felt.  I haven't changed my mind, I still don't like J and I think she is trouble but I will try and be supportive of my wife for my wife's sake.\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "So, I've known this girl Casey for about 8 months now. We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.",

      "description": "Sorry in advance for formatting, I’m on mobile. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nI have a friend who lives down the street. I met him when I was 13 and he was 15. We were extremely close and most of the things I enjoyed were because of him, (Basketball, Volleyball, Card Games, Some Online Games), but thats besides the point. A little before he turned 16 he got his first car (‘99 Honda Civic $1000) that was perfect except for how it looked. We often went places and I never “mocked” him for having a bad / old looking car because in my eyes it was perfectly fine for a car. \n\nFast forward by about 2yrs he’s 17 and I’m around \n1 1/2 months from my birthday. He worked hard and got his parents to agree to price match a new car for him. He put $1800 in for a ‘07 Mustang ($3100) and his parent matched him with the extra going towards the small bit of needed fixes. I was extremely happy for him and even joined him when he drove to go to repair places to get the standard new car fixes like oil changes. The only real problem with the car was a slightly bent hood, something you couldn’t notice from more than 10ft away. \n\nFast forward a month and now its 2 weeks before my 15th birthday and since I know my family didn’t want to pay much for my car I was expecting something basic similar to my friends first car. Since I have to drive 40 miles to and from school everyday when I get my license we has to get something with low miles and high mpg. While I was sitting in my room doing nothing my mom knocked on my door and told me to come outside. What was waiting there for me? A red ‘02 Camaro! ($3200, small paint problems and a few things needed replacing but no major problems). I was so happy and excited for my permit so I could drive but the first thing I did was text my friend saying I got my new car and to come over.\n\nI heard/saw his car coming up to my house but instead of stopping, he just drove right pass. It confused me a small bit so I asked my dad if he could drive me to his house with my new car to ask his opinion but when we go in front of his house we saw him get out of his car (with his brother and friend, both I know semi-well) and walk right past us into his house. I was kinda bummed knowing that he was mad but normally he gets over things after a little while so I let it be and texted him 1 week later about going to a volleyball open gym that we normally go to. These are the texts.\n\nMe: You going to volley?\nHim: Maybe why?\nMe: Bc I’m going and wanted to know if you’re driving\nHim: Well why don’t you drive? You’ve got a nice new car.\n\nThis was before I got my permit. \nThe rest of the conversation went similarly with him kinda saying things that made it sound like I’m a huge asshole and was getting mad about how my car was a little more expensive and that I didn’t work for it. Eventually I told him that when he got his car I was happy for him so now he should just grow up and be happy for me.\n\nThere was another point when he said that my parent’s buy everything for me which other the my first good pc (Christmas 2015 ~$1000) I have bought anything over $50 by myself. Ex. Oculus Rift, Xbox One, PS4, PS4 1TB, my current computer specs (~$1300), my shoes (totaling ~$260), my 3ds xl ($120) and pretty much anything over $50. The only times I get something is during my birthday/christmas which even then never go above $200. He get things given to him worth the same to more than I do. Ex 2 pairs of nice shoes after getting honor role on a report card.\n\nIf you couldn’t tell by that rant this is what really got\nme annoyed and stop texting him. I haven’t talked to him at all since (4 months) but whenever I think about it I get really annoyed. I understand where he’s coming from, he had to work but I didn’t, but he doesn’t have to treat me like everything is my fault. \n\nThis is the story but the question is, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My parents payed for my first car that was around the same price as my friend’s 2nd car that he price matched with his parents to get. ($3200 against $3100 split 2-ways). Now he’s mad at me.\n\n",

      "description": "I'm usually just a lurker in this sub, but this has been weighing on me for days. I know stories involving abuse are touchy here because it usually falls under the 'validation seeking' post category, but I swear I've thought this over. I'm never this divided when it comes to my mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: My mother was abusive so I stopped reacting to anything she did, but recently I've caught myself becoming more and more cruel towards her, to the point that when she said she just wanted to die, I asked her why she hadn't. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little background: my mother has been abusive as far back as I can remember (so, since I was 7 years old.) It went from degrading my physical appearance to attempting to kill me a few times. I'm not blind - I know what she did was horrible. I'll never forgive her for it. \n\nHowever, I've been acting like a real piece of shit the past couple days, or maybe even weeks. She's been trying to be nice ever since I ran away a month or so ago, I can tell, but apparently that just makes me more angry. She hasn't been too abusive in a few months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the actual story. Two days ago, I was in my room, getting nothing done as usual. My mother comes in, obviously wanting to talk about the meeting she'd had the day before with my maths teacher (about me missing way too many classes and my grades dropping.) She asked - in a sweet voice that made me want to punch her in the face (goes to show how weirdly I've been reacting these days) - why I'd been missing those classes, listing off potential reasons. I'd had a less than ideal day, so I just wanted to be left alone, and I got annoyed really easily. I snapped. \n\nUnfortunately she just cranked up the whiny tone. Started talking about how hard this was for her (which I get, honestly, but in that moment I wasn't hearing it), and eventually she said the magic words \"I want to die from how tired I am because of you.\" \n\nI was too mad at that point to watch my mouth so I just asked her \"why not do it, then\" in a complete deadpan. I wasn't looking at her so I'm not sure what her immediate reaction was, but when she next spoke I'm pretty sure I heard choking up. \n\nI felt nothing in that moment. That's what makes me so conflicted. I didn't even think in that moment, I let myself go and stooped to her level. Said the words she used to say to me. Afterwards, thinking it over, I felt bad - not for her, not really, but for having been that much of a shithead to anybody. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have two entirely different parts of me that are at odds right now. Half of me just wants to dismiss it - I want to tell myself that I'm not the asshole, that I'm justified because of what she did to me before. But the other half is reminding me that no matter what, it doesn't change the fact that I practically told someone to kill themselves. And she's been trying to do better, I'm just actively making it hard for her. That's definitely asshole material. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know. I need help in figuring this out. I don't care about the verdict, I just need to know so that I can try to change whatever I may need to change. Thank you :)",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me?",
      "description": "I know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. \n\nMy wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?",

      "description": "My partner and I got a puppy  7 years ago when we purchased a house with a suitable garden.\n\nI love dogs. This was my partners first ever pet and she adored it. Ever social media picture was of her and this puppy (you know the type of girl).\n\n7 years on, things have changed in our life. Children, pressured jobs, financial commitments etc. the dog doesn’t get as much attention as it used to.\n\nIt’s still a well looked after animal. Well fed, well groomed, in and out a suitable garden all day. But dog-walking has reduced in the last 5 months (with my new job) from 1 hour per day, to maybe 30mins every other day, and occasionally we return to poo in the house.\n\nMy partner has lost interest in him the most since having children, which is understandable. But the final straw came when it turns out that one of my child’s skin conditions is possibly linked to an allergy to dogs (pet hair dander I think it said on the test).\n\nMy partner says the dog has to go. I refused. My child’s skin complaint is currently under control and she shows no other symptoms of an allergy.\n\nI’m willing to rehome him for a short period to be 100% certain there will be an improvement on my daughters skin, I also want to pay for another thorough allergy test as I’m highly sceptical about the one provided (it was done two years ago when my child’s skin was severe - and we were told to ignore the allergies and focus on combatting the flare ups. But now the dermatologist is focussing on potential causes).\n\nI wasn’t at the latest consultation where pet allergies were discussed and I feel that this is just an excuse to re-home the dog. \n\nMy partner says that it’s a hard decision but the best thing for the dog and our children. She says I’m being selfish.\n\nI feel we made long term commitments when purchasing a puppy and we need to re-evaluate our lifestyle to ensure the dog gets his usual 1 hour walk per day, and limit his roaming of the house so that he doesn’t frequent the same areas as my allergic child (bedrooms etc.)\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Our ensuing argument blew out of control, and we were both most definitely said some ‘assholish’ things. I’ve since apologised but I’m still being branded as selfish and putting the dog before our children.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Welcome to the pettiest story you will read all day. \n\nSo my boyfriend (22M) and I (22F) live together and have been dating for almost 3 years. I’m just having a hard time seeing his side in an argument and was hoping I could get some input if I’m actually the asshole here. \n\nSo he ce home from class this afternoon while I was preparing slides for a class I teach in the evening. We say down together to catch up before I had to leave, and he started telling me an animated venting story. Part way through the story, he was getting really loud and animated, so I quietly made a “shh” sound to indicate that he should lower his volume (without disrupting the story). \n\nHe lost his shit. Long story short, he got angry wth me for shushing him. He said that he hates when I do this and that me wanting him to be quieter in the middle of the day (instead of at night) is really me wanting him to change the core of his personality. \n\nFor clarification, I love when he tells stories and gets animated! My issue is the volume. We live in a tiny studio apartment for one, and he’s a generally loud person. I have issues with loud sounds. When he talks loudly it makes it hard for me to engage in the conversation and it stresses me out (I’ve tried to explain this to him). I also had to leave almost immediately to go teach a class, another reason why I was stressed and wasn’t into him talking so loudly. \n\nAt the core of it, I feel like it wasn’t worth him getting so pissed about!! Am I the asshole for wanting him to talk in a quieter voice? If you think I’m the asshole here please candidly explain, I’m so lost as to why this is a big deal. ",

Tom's becoming pretty mean to my gf too, asks for money and basically decided to move out in like two months without telling her, putting her in the situation to find a new roommate with a pretty short notice. Even tho he is my friend too I'm kinda of fed up with that and yesterday, at a party, after a few drinks I started to hang out with his best friend. He's the classic dad-friend, always concerned about everything. We were chatting, he asked me how Tom was, and I couldn't contain myself. He's such an asshole to my gf, plus what he's doing to himself is crazy stupid and dangerous. I told his bf everything about the DRUGS and he was pretty shocked. He says he will talk to him, maybe even talk about something like rehab.\nThe day after, I feel like it wasn't my battle nor it wasn't my place to snitch on a friend with somebody that I know can only offer a very \"aggressive\" help, yet the idea that somebody will make him face his assholeness makes me crazy happy.

So she asks our friends, and my other friend (let’s call him Rob) starts joking that he can hook her up for 5 dollars. My friend offers 2 dollars and some candy, playing along, and rob is all like “nah you don’t get a whole bottle for that” and they keep going on this whole drug dealing thing over some advil. I walk up to throw something out, then when I’m walking over to my seat I say, “rob is definitely selling drugs.” And for some damn reason, right before I say it, everyone stops talking. So everyone heard it. It wasn’t even that loud. Anyways, another one of my friends at our table thinks it’s the funniest thing and said it was a bitchy move (that part I don’t mind) but Rob is extremely pissed off. Then the teacher says not to joke about it because she’s obligated to take it seriously and write rob up about it (she never does because she’s chill) but this gets rob even more pissed off at me.\n\nI’m willing to admit it wasn’t the most tasteful joke. But honestly I don’t think it’s something to get so bent out of shape over. Everyone knew I was joking, because we’re friends. The teacher wasn’t going to write anything up because she likes him. I’m just not sure what the issue is here , but then the friend who originally wanted the advil said it was rude? and I had no idea teachers were supposed to take this kind of thing seriously. \n\nTl;dr rob jokes about selling advil, I joke that he’s “definitely selling drugs,” everyone hears dumb joke and it almost gets my friend in trouble, he is totally pissed off at me\n\nThis is so dumb that I refuse to ask anyone irl lol. he keeps giving me angry looks and I’m dying to know if I’m actually the asshole in this one ",

Coming down to the end of 2018 we started having really big arguments and we both agreed to go to therapy, We have both been to therapy before the relationship began. She started seeing a new therapist cause her last one is too far from where she now lives. I am still seeing my old therapist. Therapy has been good for both of us and communication is better, Both therapists recommended couples sessions and we booked an appointment for a third therapist who has seen neither of us before ( for impartiality) We had the first couples session today and it was very productive. For ease let's call her therapist Bea, my therapist Tina, and the couples therapist is Sally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night my gf confessed to me that she looked through Bea's files during a previous session. She said she arrived early, but Bea was late and the office was unlocked so she went in to wait. She said she was surprised to find Bea's file cabinet open and unlocked and procedded to go thru Bea's patient files. She then shared the private info on some of the more messed up patients.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit I was MORTIFIED and made it known to her. She is not at all remorseful and blamed Bea for the poor security. I did not bring it up in the couples session today, but after talking about it with a friend (who was also mortified and really thinks i should say something) I am feeling more and more compelled to act. I also feel very guilty for thinking of betraying hertrust and kind of think i should just leave it be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA? Who should I tell? I've never met Bea but she and Sally (couples therapist) work at the same practice. Is it enough to just talk to TIna about it in my next session or should i talk to Bea directly? I'm supposed to have a one on one session with Sally and have thought about mentioning it there as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I’ve been dating my current girlfriend for about a year now and everything is going fine, we argue every now and again but that’s it. A few months ago I met this girl (who we’ll call Minty since that’s her nickname and I don’t want to use her real name) and we became good friends, she was very nice. Slowly I found myself becoming more and more interested in her romantically which made me feel extremely guilty since I was already in a relationship and still very attracted to my girlfriend. Minty is very affectionate both physically and verbally with her friends (by physically I mean she’s always keen for a hug and things like that). She’d always compliment people on little things and make sure they know they are important to her. Due to my feelings her little comments drove me crazy and weren’t helping at all and eventually I started matching her spirit and being very verbally affectionate back. She’s currently struggling with bipolar disorder so her feelings are easily played with and to top that off she’s just recently gotten out of a two year abusive relationship (mainly extreme verbal abuse) so I’m a little protective to say the least. \n\nAbout a week ago she got herself a girlfriend, I didn’t know the girl personally but some friends of mine told me she’s nice. I had this horrible feeling in my gut all day, at first I thought I was just being cautiously protective but after talking to my sister I’ve realised I’m very jealous. I feel absolutely terrible since it’s kinda like I’m cheating on my girlfriend in my head but mostly because my brain basically wants to keep this poor girl to myself without ever cutting ties with my gf. Am I a complete asshole for having these feelings?",

Anyway, recently I owe them a similar amount for food, they haven't brought it up, but I am obviously aware I didn't pay for mine. \nAITA for not paying them back, consciously.

      "description": "A year ago when I moved in, my roommate, who is also one of my best friends, was an absolute complete disgusting slob. Never cleaned up after himself, whole house smelled like mold and cigarettes, walls FILTHY with grime and nicotine. He looked and dressed in a way that made him look as though he did not live inside. He acted like a fool in public, yelling obscenities even on public transportation. At first, it was a minor inconvenience, but after time it started to wear on me. A month or so in, I started letting him know that I didn't want our friendship to be impacted by our roommate situation, and I could use help maintaining the apartment's cleanliness, which he essentially ignored until I had a breakdown about the communal areas being absolutely filthy to the point I couldn't bring anyone over without cleaning for several hours.  \n\n\nI have since been rewarding his good behavior with dab oil (we're in WA state, totally legal) and hot fresh meals, since I know he hates cooking. When he trashes a room and leaves it that way, I just ignore his mess and keep cleaning my own, while making food simply for myself. Once he's cleaned, I make a nice big communal meal for the both of us, almost always complete with fresh baked desserts. While he's in the shower, I drive to the dispensary for oil and dab out when he's done. I even slip his bus fare back into his change from food stores when he's not paying attention, if he hasn't been cursing and obnoxious on the bus. This has changed him immensely, and I have not once mentioned this sort of conditioning to him. He's never asked me about it either.  \n\n\nAm I an asshole for subtly using psychological tactics and essentially training my roommate to act and BE better? He's noted a vast improvement in his psychiatric health since I moved in, and I am loathe to tell him I've been training him to be a better roommate as it may come off as harsh.",

My apparent lack of emotional response deeply upset her and she proceeded to shout at me for clearly not caring about our dog nor her and that I never cared, and so on. My sister also complained that I should’ve at least faked emotion to make her feel more comfortable.

      "title": "AITA for not changing my life for my dad's anxiety?",
      "description": "So, some backstory first. This will be long, very long, I apologize. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nMy dad has always had terrible anxiety that he never bothered to treat for a variety of reasons. He is terrified of public transit, high winds, pit bulls, crowded spaces, so many things, and it's a very legitimate fear to him. Sometimes he seems to know his fears are irrational, but that doesn't stop them. This has shaped my childhood in many ways, for example I wasn't allowed to get my driver's license until I was 20 but also not allowed to ride my bike anywhere farther then a mile away, take the bus, or ride with any but a few friends of mine he trusted. Growing up with these restrictions and fears turned me into a bit of a nervous shut-in. At 22 I started to get very sick, we later found out I have multiple sclerosis. This ramped his anxiety up to a new level and also ensured I would be living at home with him for much longer. During this time my parents took care of everything I needed, even though I could barely move. Medical care cost them more then I can ever pay back and they don't even want me to pay them back. I am very grateful. \n\nMy boyfriend of the time understood I needed extensive care but was also going crazy living at my parents' home, so he invited me to live with him. My dad didn't allow it but I left anyway. After a few months he understood and accepted it. It helps that my then-boyfriend now husband is a wonderful person and my dad loves him.\n\nA few years later he had his first heart attack. This ramped his anxiety up again but also prompted him to finally accept treatment. Sadly, he stuck with the first medication he was given and it only works a little bit and he left his first counseling session in the middle and refuses to return. Still, his anxiety went down for a while and our relationship started to flourish. I even managed to have a few conversations with him about his overzealous restrictions. \n\nWhen I was 29 four major things happened: I got unexpectedly pregnant (surprise! You're not infertile!), something horrible that is a different story left my fiance and I effectively homeless, my dad had a second and much worse heart attack, followed by open heart surgery, and my MS went into remission. All of these things sent my dad's anxiety spiraling out of control. He can't sleep, he has lost way too much weight, he doesn't eat much, and he is well on his way to a third heart attack from anxiety alone! But he will not have the doctor look at his anxiety medication or return to counseling. \n\nMy husband and I frantically searched for a place we could afford to rent that we could move into right now and would allow our pets and actually found the perfect place... directly across the street from my parents' house. It won't be so bad, right? Plus, it's not like we could find another place like that on such short notice. We knew we were wrong when my parents cornered our new landlord and managed to convince him to give them our keys. Naturally, they made copies of every single one. We very excitedly prepared for our baby, and I started moving around and getting out more, realizing how hard life can be when you are unable to get out at all. We learned that I was capable of caring for a child with a few accommodations in our home but still not able to hold a regular job and I became a stay at home mom. It didn't take long before it was glaringly obvious I could not raise a healthy child shut in the house, so I learned how to use public transit. \n\nNow, I am 33 and married with a healthy, very active, and not remotely anxious four year old son and another son due in March. I am mostly blind and my MS has returned, but it's not as bad as it was. I am very familiar with the public transit system in our city, and it's not a bad one. My dad is retired and spends most of his time watching our house from his kitchen window. He calls me to ask where I am going and ask me not to go there every single time he sees me heading anywhere, even the grocery store he wants to come with. Everywhere non-essential he tells me not go. If he had his way, his grandson would never go to the park or public pool. He regularly goes through my mail and even more regularly lets himself in my house, where he proceeds to fiddle with my thermostat and simultaneously lecture me over a mess that usually doesn't even exist and also lecture me for \"pushing myself too far.\" My son thinks his grandfather is the best thing since ice cream and I don't want to separate him but he is starting to avoid some of his favorite activities, such as digging in the dirt, because his grandfather told him it is too dangerous and this is infuriating me and potentially harming my boy. \n\nFor a while I would compromise by staying home about half the time he asked me or asking him to drive us instead if it bothered him, but this only made my dad more upset and he started to do things such as hide my stroller or \"borrow\" my cane to make sure it was very hard for me to get anywhere. Keep in mind that I may now be a grown and married adult who takes care of myself and my own with an involved and loving husband, but the idea of telling my parents \"no\" terrifies me and I just can't bring myself to do things that will probably burn bridges with them, such as changing our locks or reporting my dad for tinkering with our mail. So now I just take the longer path out of our neighborhood, trying to stay in the blind spot I know my parents' kitchen window has, pretend my phone is broken and sometimes doesn't ring when he calls, and go wherever. I guarantee my son has benefited from seeing more places and getting out to play more often, and I have benefited as well. My dad however, gets nearly apoplectic. I have tried to talk about it, but he asks me to \"compromise\" each time for his sake, but there is never anything for me in his supposed compromise. I know this is making him nervous and paranoid and putting his heart at risk, but frankly he would be nervous and paranoid anyway. \n\nTL;DR: Life makes my dad nervous and he wants me to never do anything ever, he watches me to make sure I never do anything. I recently realized I am an adult and can ignore him so I do stuff anyway. Turns out I like doing stuff.\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for ignoring my dad's anxiety and not staying home with a rambunctious preschooler, even though it could possibly help him avoid a third heart attack?",

I'm awful at keeping up a chat because I usually give one-word answers, and that's because I'm either not interested in the topic or am deathly afraid of saying the wrong thing. I have a huge fear of screwing up when saying or doing something around others.\n\nAll of this makes me quiet, reserved, and atrocious at talking, thus making me not appealing to everyone else in the program. I see people giving me weird looks sometimes when I sit in the academics room while everyone else socializes. And by everyone else, I mean literally everyone else. They all know each other well, but I just can't make the effort to try and talk to them because I hate butting into conversations. That's because I'm terrified of people thinking that I'm annoying.\n\nBasically, I'm not social. I don't talk, I don't participate in discussions, and I definitely don't approach people on my own to try and make friends. It's all due to my overwhelming fear of others disliking me. And I know that people think lowly of me because I overheard two girls whispering about how 'weird' I was. That really got to me, and it still gets to me. But, since I'm too scared to try and change my image, I'm stuck being the weird quiet kid. I honestly feel like a coward, and like I'm putting others down and annoying them by not making any efforts to socialize.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I dont usually play live poker that much. I was just in a casino meeting someone for something business related, and was simply trying to have a few drinks and kill some time.\n\nWell as I start winning hands theres a guy sitting next to me who starts insulting me, at first kinda passive agrgressive then just blatant insults like im a mark for calling that hand or that im an idiot who has never played before. I banter back a bit but in general i just want to relax and not play the insult game. If i am bad why isnt he winning?\n\nMy date was also sitting next to me and was seeing him insult me which pissed me off more. Finally when stakes are getting raised the dealer asks everyone to chip in a higher denomination, but i accidentally throw in the wrong chip.\n\nThe guy turns to me, with the correct chip in his hand, and says \"You see this? Thats 50 dollars. Do you know how much 50 dollars is\"? And starts chuckling.\n\nPissed off, I leave the table as my date tells me hes not worth it. He says \"Oh look at this, another one bites the dust.\"\n\nLater on into the night I see him in the casino playing slots. I approach him while hes alone and say, \"If you ever speak to me like that again I'm gonna scoop your eye out of your head with that fucking poker chip\". He is taken aback and then apologizes and says he was just playing. \n\nI tell him \"You better learn how to fucking speak to people or you're going to get hurt.\" It never escalates to violence. He says he is sorry. I probably should have accepted the apology but I was still mad, the guy was disrespecting me all night.\n\nI told my date and she says I should have left it alone but I feel like people need to be respectful even if its a game.

      "description": "I´m 14 and a freshman at my school. I´m currently dating a junior named Alberto and his parents are both teachers at my school. Her mother, who I am going to call X, overprotects him a lot and is really immature. She always treat me as inferior and tells Alberto I am a bad influence for him, when I am actually a good and calmed student. She scolds me in almost every class, when I am not doing anything wrong and once made me leave last so I would be late for lunch. Alberto tells me she was like that too with his brother´s girlfriend, and treats the situation as funny. I was a little bothered but I could stand it. But today, she was telling the grades of all the class, and told that she wouldn´t tell it to you if you were behaving badly, although it is her obligation to do so. Well, she didn´t tell it to me (when I did nothing wrong) and implied that I got a bad grade. I was thinking about telling the headteacher how unfair she was behaving with me, and I know that if I did that, she would be punished and could even lose her job (my school is kinda weird). I really think X is being immature and that her behaviour is unprofessional, but I know that Alberto would be mad at me if I did that and I would ruin a job in which she have been for years. So Reddit, WIBTA if I told the headteacher about her behaviour?\n\n(Sorry for my bad English, it is not my first language)",

      "description": "So, here I am at a store, trying to buy something. Unfortunately, since the store seemingly is renovating, things are all over the place. Out of the corner of my eye I spot a customer service table, and decide, \"hey, let's ask where \\***\\ is\". I walk over and see the lady working there. She seems to be on her phone. \"Ahem, excuse me, but do you happen to know where \\***\\ is?\". She doesn't even look up. \n\nI thought she might not have heard me, so I tap the desk. She looks up and asks \"sorry, what?\". I repeat the question, and she hands me what looks to be a brochure and tells me to read it. \n\nNow keep in mind, this brochure was of the mall, not the store itself. The mall contained many different stores and even a dining area, so obviously this map and list wasn't going to help me. So I ask again, \"would you happen to know where \\***\\ is?\".\n\nShe looks up, visibility annoyed, and says, read the brochure. I tell her this is for the mall, she says \"just read it, you'll see what you want\".\n\nAt this point, I'm quite annoyed, and frankly, really not happy with her \"service\". I immediately call her out on it, and asked to see her manager. She immediately told me that I've been rude to her, which is utterly ridiculous. \n\nAt this point I just decide to leave, arguing with her doesn't get me anywhere, her manager doesn't show up, and we've caused a small scene. \n\nMy question is, did I act out of line? Was I just supposed to behave/respond in a better way?",

      "description": "First of all, I am 100% pro-choice. My best friend and I have been best friends since we were teens. A couple years ago, she found out she was pregnant, with a guy who was an abusive scumbag. She was excited and wanted the baby, but when she told him, he told her to get an abortion. She decided yeah, she should get an abortion. I tried to make sure it was HER decision and not his, since she'd been into it before she talked to him. She said stuff about not wanting to raise a child as a single parent (I'm a single mom, so that stung, but it's not my life) and planned on going through with it. Sadly, she ended up miscarrying. She was upset but, I think, somewhat relieved. Life went on. About a year later, she met another guy who was also Bad News, in and out of drug rehab and halfway houses, definitely not relationship material, but she jumped right in with him and quickly got pregnant. This time, she admitted she wanted to get pregnant, planned it, and wanted to keep the baby. She was even more excited, we were talking baby showers, she wanted me at the birth, we talked names, she was ordering personalized onesies to break the news to her parents. I was still in another state, but I was there for her every way I could be during those weeks. She went to the doctor and sent me an ultrasound photo, and I cried and fell even more in love with this little blob. But then... her Bad News guy had to go back to rehab. He was having a lot of mental health issues, including dissociative identity disorder, bipolar, and others. It became clear that he was not fully able to be in a relationship with her because of his issues with drugs and mental health. Once he went back to rehab and my friend realized she was alone, she decided she wanted to get an abortion. This time, I was shocked. She was excited, she loved the baby, she wanted the baby, she planned for this. She got me involved, excited, and in love with this baby then so suddenly changed her mind. We didn't talk much about it. She told me after she had the procedure, and I checked in to make sure she was okay. It's been about a year and we are still close friends but we don't talk about it. I know it's 100% the woman's choice, no matter what, but sometimes I still think about it and get unbearably sad. I never tell her I'm feeling this way but sometimes I'm just angry and sad and feel this is sense of loss, even though I really had no claim to this fetus. I would never shame her or say anything to her about it, and I am fully pro-choice, but this situation just makes me so sad. Am I the asshole for feeling like this?\n\nTL;DR my best friend got pregnant on purpose, got me involved with planning for the baby with her, sent ultrasound pics, then changed her mind once the baby daddy ghosted, and got an abortion. Am I the asshole for feeling sad and feeling a loss?",

We want to back up, but we can't as someone is behind us. The guy behind us then quickly pulls in front of us and takes the spot. The following debate ensued.\n\n\nDad: Hey, hey buddy! You can't do that!\n\nPt: You were sitting there for 5 minutes.\n\nDad: Dosn't matter, you saw me wanting to go into that space!\n\nPt: Go f*ck yoursel-\n\nDad: Hey! Hey, I've got my son in the car! \n\n(Keep in mind I'm a teenager who has heard my fair share of swearing)\n\nPt: Sorry man but this is my space.\n\nDad: You need to move your fricking car! You saw me want to pull into that space! I had my break lights on!\n\n(Pt gets out of car, keep in mind we are in the middle of a narrow lane people need to get in to park)\n\nDad also gets out of car. Im now alone in the car in a small lane that people need to get through.\n\nHundreds of curses and inault insue. To spare you the trouble I'll skip to the end.\n\nDad: You're a real a*shole\n\nPt: And your a great role model for your son!\n\nDad gets back in car and we go to a close parking spot. He gets out of the car again, this time so do I, thinking we are going into the store.\n\nPt and Dad argue again about who should get the spot, what happened, and who said the F word in front of me. \n\nFb: YOU SAID THE F WORD IN FRONT OF YOUR KID YOU HYPOCRITICAL B*TCH!!!\n\nDad: No, I said frick an-\n\nPt: You called me an a*shole\n\nDad: That was outside the car, away from my son!\n\nFb: That dosn't matter, he could still here it!!\n\nPt and Dad get in a third argument. This time my Dad says he will call the cops for harassment. Guys says he will just move the car, but my dad refuses saying he's only afraid of the cops because he has a warrent. My dad goes on his phone and pretends to call the cops.\n\nPt does call the cops.\n\nPt tells them my dad threatened him and how he was scared my dad would damage his property.\n\nMy dad is refuting all his points saying how he never threatened him (he didn't) and how because  he has a son, he won't damage property.\n\nNow my dad looks like a retired old man, almost like Michael De Santa from GTA 5 and he almost looks threatening.\n\nCop pulls up.\n\nCop: what seems to be the problem here?\n\nMy dad goes on and on about how he should have taken the spot and how he cursed in front of me. Then Pt tells his story and my dad is now denying saying that Pt had a warrent.\n\nCop: are you serious?! You called the cops because of a parking space?! We have things to do!\n\nCops leave and my dad mutters how Pt is a prick.\n\nTL;DR: Guy steels my dads parking spot, they curse at each other, Pt calls cops.\n\nSo I ask, IMDTA?",

      "description": "Okay important background information: My grandmother died in 2012. The executor of the will said that there was no money after final expenses. My mother, aunt and uncle hired a lawyer to force him to do accounting to prove that there was no more money. And surprise the executor cannot account for over $300,000 USD.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the rub, my parents asked for their share of the trust before my grandmother died to buy a house. So my mother won't be entitled any of the money anyways. My parents have already paid $3000 to get the accounting of the trust and now she wants to do a civil lawsuit to get the money back. However the best she could get is her lawyer fees taken of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother wants justice to be done but I feel like she just sinking her money into something and she never get it back. The executor has made it clear that he spent all the money and he has no major assets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be an asshole if I told my mom to cut her loses and let the people who have something to gain take it court?",

      "description": "My roommate who is a 27 year old guy has gotten on my very last nerve in regards to hygiene.\n\nLet's call him Fred. Fred will shave and leave a ton of hairs all around the sink. He will use my bathroom stuff and I'm a woman. He refuses to clean. He's never once cleaned the bathroom, living room, or any other place. He smells like BO and leaves weed and ash and roaches everywhere. Instead of taking the garbage out, he will stack trash and leave us to take care of it. \n\nThe last straw was when he got sick from what I'm pretty sure was norovirus (aka stomach flu). I was in the living room yesterday morning and he was on the couch.  He gets up, stumbles through the hallway and throws up all over the floor. I immediately think \"uhoh\". \n\nI tell him to try and stay away from the living room so we don't get sick. He doesn't listen and hangs out in the living room. He cleans his mess but left his trash outside near the front door in a plastic bag. I told him to leave my dog alone and not pet him. He didn't listen, so now I can't cuddle my dog. He's also not washing his hands. \n\nSo I'm in the bathroom with bleach, gloves and a mask desanitizing everything (which I get, because he wasn't in a condition to clean). I've done EVERYTHING I can to stay away from him. I am not eating in the house, not anything. I threw away my toothbrush just in case particles got on there while he was puking his guts out. \n\nI came back from class today and put on my mask. He irritatingly says I don't need it as if I am overreacting. He says it was \"food poisoning\" and to not worry. If he knew anything, norovirus can be food poisoning and that's incredibly contagious. He's getting irritated with me and tells me I act like his mom because I tell him to clean. If I get sick I am not going to let him live this down.  \n\nAnd I'll probably move out. I know norovirus is really contagious and even the most clean of people get it, but if I get sick from HIM I think I'll be too disgusted with him to look at him. Just imagining him stumbling into the hallway with heavy feet and puking all over the floor like a child makes me sick. If I get sick I know I'm going to really go off on him. \n\nAnd I mean yell. I won't be able to control it and I'm going to blow up. I need to know if this makes me an asshole. I can't take it anymore. I honestly want to just land a big fat punch right on his face because he is always trying to get in fights (he got into a fight with my friends once and broke his nose). \n\nTL;DR my disgusting roommate (probably) got norovirus, isn't sanitizing anything and is heightening the chances of get me sick and I want to go off on him so badly after this last straw. \n\n",

      "description": "So, gonna try and keep this short and concise. \n\nMy ex and I were together for two years. I truly believed we were deeply in love. It was by no means always harmonious, but we always thought our relationship was worth fighting for. I’m not a greedy bitch when it comes to money. I stayed with my parents and the first time I truly lived on my own was when I moved in with him a month ago.\n\nMy ex is absolutely awful with money. He spends it frivolously on eating out, alcohol, and before I encouraged him to get clean, drugs. But he is also a hard worker. When we got more serious, I started being a bit controlling and speaking up about his spending habits because he was always broke. Before we lived together, I helped him with rent on multiple occasions. I would have done anything for him, and if I had it, he had it. I admit towards the end I started being resentful because I felt like I was almost at time taking care of HIM when I wanted him, the guy, to take care of me...\n\nFast forward, our relationship ended abruptly and it got nasty. So much pent up anger and feelings reLeased. The only month I lived with him (first week of March), I paid my entire check from a new job I started. $900 (not a lot) of our $1200 rent. Unfortunately I was fired the very next day (no regrets, was being sexually harassed at work every day.) He paid the rest, but he didn’t have enough to pay half because he started working a new job after me. I moved out after we broke up and now I’m demanding he pay half of what I paid for the rent, $450, considering I’m in a shitty situation (No savings, but I did manage to get a job I haven’t started). At first, he said he would help, but he of course spent money on partying for ST. P. I asked him yesterday when he was going to pay me, he said he couldn’t give it to me in full because he has court. \n\nWhen I tell y’all I’m fucking livid!! I feel absolutely used. He has a great job now and I feel like he truly won’t pay me back because he has no self-awareness and truly doesn’t care. Part of me wants karma to play out and just leave it, the other part of me wants to hit that bitch up every day until he pays me back.\n\nSo AITA for demanding the rent money back? Or do I just look foolish and should let it go?",

      "description": "So, first time posting here. I 31F am in the midst of this argument with my ex, 32M. We dated for 2 years and his drinking became too much for me to handle so i moved out in May. We stayed friends. A few weeks ago we had sex because I missed hanging out with him and he had mentioned he wasnt drinking so much anymore, gave me some hope that we could try again.  But afterwards he told a girl we work with that we were having sex again. She in turn told at least 5 other people that I know of and suddenly everyone is asking me if we are dating. So, normally this wouldnt be a big deal, it's just gossip. But when we had sex the condom slipped off and I had to go get Plan B to ensure no preggers would happen. I also think he posted something publically about us having sex, in snapchat or something similar, because the day after i went to PP some rando on the internet posted an ad for prostitution services on my page. It's very catholic in my area, lots of prolifers who think women should be punished for having control over their reproductive organs. I assumed the prolifers found out and were trying to shame me for going to PP. After this happened i became deeply concerned that the local PP had shared my personal info, violating a HIPAA, and was going to report them. But when I started hearing people from work talking about me and my ex, my next assumption was that  it was my ex who had told. I confronted him and he admitted he had drunkenly told our mutual coworker. That was 2 days ago. Then yesterday he sends me a text saying it wasnt her, supposedly he was so drunk he doesnt remember. Obviously starting this relationship again before knowing more about his sobriety status is my fuckup. I accept that. But would i be the asshole for breaking things off with him specifically because he talks about our private lives openly? He says I'm the one who has broken his trust but I dont see how. ",

I try to explain to her that I also feel upset sometimes and mad at myself but I certainly don’t vocalize that because it wouldn’t help anything. So I’ve been asking her to refrain from saying she hates herself and listing off negative aspects.\n\nI genuinely have no clue if I’m in the wrong here because I have high functioning autism and can’t read people super well.

      "description": "Several years ago around 7pm (dusk), an old man arrives at my house. I am shirtless and in the middle of a TV show. He asks for my wife. He is somewhat familiar looking but I don’t know why. My wife comes to the door and immediately knows the old man, who is evidently a family friend who shes known going back to when she was a baby.  We welcome him in despite it being fairly late and unexpected. For a very brief time we are all friendly with each other until he notices a tattoo on my wife’s foot. He said that he didn’t know she had done that and that it’s a shame. \n\nI asked, “why is it a shame?”\nHe said, “because her foot was fine before, and that tattoos can be offensive to some people.”\nI asked, “okay who is this harmless tattoo offensive to exactly?” \nHe said, “well for starters it’s offensive to me.” \nI said, “okay it’s been a lovely visit but you’ve come after dark, I’m in the middle of a show (and shirtless), and you’ve said your offended by wife. Time to go, I’m sorry I’m asking you to leave.”\n   I awkwardly walk him out of the house.\n\nThree years pass. He is older and sick. My wife’s family connects with him at the hospital and come back and he mentioned ME of all people because apparently he has not been in communication with them because of the “falling out” and the episode at my house. I get the feeling that he is making me out to be an A-hole and the reason for him breaking it off with the whole family! AITA?",

      "description": "My friend has two kiddos, and a third on the way. She is texting and/or calling me on an almost daily basis to tell me how awful her boyfriend is. He says terrible things, screams in her face, storms out over the slightest thing, has threatened to just take custody of their unborn kiddo, the list goes on. She has called me, crying, more than once, to tell me she’s afraid to have this baby with him, and that the stress is causing her a lot of issues. She has essentially communicated to me that he sucks, and has sucked since long before she got pregnant (the entirety of their 2 year relationship, for the most part). \n\nI am *really* trying to support her. I always answer her calls, pick her up if I am at all able, watch her kiddos when she needs a break, offer space in my place for her to breathe, etc. I “lent” (I don’t expect it back, but she insisted on making it a loan) her $600 to get her car fixed, so she didn’t have to depend on this crappy guy to make sure she can get to work. \n\nI’ve kind of hit my breaking point. I have an infant myself, I’m a grad student, and I work. Every time she tells me about something else her boyfriend has done, I get AMPED, like I just want to storm the castle and get her out of there. This response is physically and emotionally exhausting. This morning, after another round of “He slept on the couch after screaming at me”, and my repeated suggestion for couples counselling and/or individual therapy, offers for her to come stay here with her kids, and just general sympathy, I told her I couldn’t keep doing this. I let her know I truly appreciate that she trusts me enough to come to me, that I love her, and want to do all I can to help her, but I need her to want the help. \n\nAITA for kind of shutting her down? I feel terrible about it. \n\nTl; dr: my friend has been in (what I believe to be) an emotionally abusive relationship for 2 years, denies my help consistently, and I finally told her I can’t handle just hearing how awful he is anymore.

      "description": "So, first let's lay down some backstory. We've dated for 2 years, in the first 6 months I'd say I got 2-3 bouquets or flowery gifts. It's not like I got used to it or anything, I just fuckin love flowers and think it's a relatively cheap way to show your appreciation. I dont want 18 premium Rose's. I simply want anything, and I work at a store with a floral station, so I see every arrangement from $3-150(financially, he shifts from really well off to scraping by like bi weekly, so obviously I'm not expecting flowers on a bad week.. but if you go on a $400 tool spree and cant find it in you to buy flowers for ur gf...). I also see guys buying beautiful flowers for their girlfriends all the time. \n    I've kind of mentioned it before, I've told him what my favorite flowers are, and when the flyer comes out I'll say something along the lines of \"oh look alsros are on sale this week!\"its been almost 2 years and still no flowers. Not for birthdays and not for the last valentines day we spent together. Also, my birthday just passed, and I HATE to sound ungrateful, but he just went to a store nearby that, admittedly we both liked, and the gifts are beautiful, but I can tell by the proximity and how random they are that it was an afterthought and he had NO plan to get me anything. He also bought me a bottle of gin that, not only had he showed distaine for in the past, but I'm super sensitive to alcohol and he knows that I only drink 1 thing, and it definitely isnt gin. With that, there was no card or nothing, just a pile of gifts in a grocery bag. \nSo here's the real question... I was gonna wait till the day after valentines day,, and if still no flowers, I'm going to buy myself a bouquet,  a nice one, that I like. AITA? it's not so much to guilt him as it is to remind him that i like flowers, and valentines day is a time when people buy their gf flowers. I just feel forgotten about,, meanwhile I'm waiting a month in advance for any gift giving holiday cause i cant wait to show him how much i appreciate him. We both come from relatively poor backgrounds, and its ingrained in me cost shouldnt be the drawing feature in a gift, it should show that you truely know and appreciate that person. I'm not doing this because I think I deserve flowers, I just think he forgets that romance is an important aspect of our relationship to me. AITA? ",

I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn’t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn’t eating.  She said she did, she didn’t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what’s the big deal, she didn’t take ALL the cheese off them.  It’s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it’s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn’t all that out of proportion.

I'm micromanaged, underpaid, overworked and exhausted.\n\nThe GM is an insane micromanager. She's stolen things off my desk, sticks her nose into EVERYTHING, and is not polite about anything. She has made us terrified to make mistakes and has pitted us (office team) against each other.\n\nAny time I try to share my frustrations with the owner (who is BFF with the GM)  I'm told I need to \"be more positive\". I know if I continue to work where I do RN I'm gonna have a full on mental breakdown. I'm in the industry I want to be in and have learned a LOT, but I'm feeling more and more depressed being here and I don't deserve to be treated the way I am. I'm a hard worker, I'm punctual and I'm a team player.\n\nSo I contacted my old boss and asked if they'd have me back. It was an emphatic yes. The pay is the same, but I was treated so much better and had a lot more flexibility. If I go back I know I'll feel like a valuable asset to the company. \n\nIm still just trying to help myself be okay with leaving my \"dream job\".

(Which is a problem because I'm buying product from them to do a wedding for a client at the end of the month) \n\nAm I an asshole if I don't give them 2 weeks notice? (I live in a right to work state so I'm not required by law to give them any notice) \n\nMy hopefull projected timeline would be to give them 1-2 days notice. I dont want any drama or hubbub around my leaving. There is someone who can cover my position when i leave. My biggest concern around leaving is that they'll try and fire me or it will turn into a nasty confrontation and I wont be able to fill that wedding order. \n\nTLDR: I hate my current job so much and I'm going back to my old one but I'm afraid if I give 2 weeks notice my current job will fire me or treat me worse and won't let me buy the flowers I pre-booked for a client wedding.

      "description": "My kids (6 &amp; 9) grandfather on their father’s side passed away March 1st. Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he’s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex’s family members will be there. It’s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had “already said goodbye to Pappy”. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy’s burial?

      "description": "This is for my friend (18F).\n\nContext:\nThe bf was supposed to meet my friend's family for a meal (the parents are trying to see if the boy is good for her) but he overslept and ended up missing the entire thing. He still came anyway and met them when they were on the way out. The parents then \"jokingly\" told him to treat the family to a meal 3 months later to make up for it (they meant it). It didn't have to be anything fancy, it could be dirt cheap, but he has to treat it. All he responded in that moment was that he didn't want to make false promises and that he was afraid that he'll oversleep again. It was a bad response.\n\nThe problem:\nHe was peeved that my friend didn't stand up for him in that moment of time as he felt that it was rude for the parents to do that in the first meeting, and that he didn't want to spend his mother's money for that. My friend explained to him that it wasn't about the meal, the parents just wanted to know him better and that they could share the cost together (her siblings can also help with the burden by not coming). Heck, just coffee for 2.50 in total for the parents as they talk over coffee will do.\n\nHe reply was that, HE DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND HIS MOTHER'S MONEY, EMPHASIS ON THE MOTHER. And by that, he meant his allowance. Yet he doesn't mind spending extra money on fast food daily when there are cheaper and healthier food options.\n\nPersonally I think the guy's a total loser but 1 person ain't much, what do y'all think?¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",

      "description": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nI’ve (17M) known my GF (17) for about a year and a half and ever since we first started hanging out her mom’s been pretty controlling about how late she’s out with me, frequently complaining about this. Ever since we started dating about 4 months ago, it’s only gotten worse. We frequently have movie marathons at my house but they almost always get cut short by her mom sending her a text like “Be home by 9” on Friday and Saturday nights, saying things like how my GF needs sleep, among other reasons that don’t really add up. My girlfriend obeys her mom without any argument, and I get her home at the specified time, no questions asked, but this has happened for so many dates in a row that I’ve started believing her mom just doesn’t want her spending time with me. \n\nI didn’t say anything until today after my girlfriend texts me saying she needs to cancel our next movie marathon that we planned days ago because her mom decided today that it’s going to be a family day, which was kinda the straw that broke the camel’s back, per say. I asked her if her mom didn’t like me, I got a kinda flakey answer, which make me go into a bit of a rant about how I felt that her mom didn’t trust me, was making up random things to cut our plans short or interfere with them entirely, and how I felt rather insulted by it. My girlfriend didn’t really say a whole lot other than her mom wouldn’t change so I would have to learn to deal with it and that I can’t take is so personally, at which point I apologized because I realized I was bothering her.\n\nThroughout some more conversation I apologized repeatedly, and my girlfriend said it was fine about 4 times until she finally said that she didn’t like me talking shit about her mother like that, that it really bothered her, and that her ranting about her mom is different because it’s her mom.\n\nWe’ve resolved the fight and it led to some very healthy discussion, but I’m still wondering AITA? On one hand I feel like the asshole for basically making my girlfriend choose between what she saw as shitting on her mom or arguing with me, but I don’t feel like I insulted her mom, only that I felt insulted that her mom doesn’t seem to trust or like me. So tell me reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR - GF’s mom consistently interferes with my plans with my GF. Today was the straw that broke the camels back, so I told GF I felt insulted by her mom’s lack of trust in me, GF saw this as shitting on her mom. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm going to try to be as honest as possible about the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Valentines night my fiance was away at a funeral for his best friend in Scotland (a good way away from where we currently live). I took myself to a local bar for a drink to cheer myself up (the guy who died was going to be his best man next year at our wedding, I couldn't go due to work commitments and was feeling shitty for all these reasons combined). It's a bar a close friend owns, and a wine tasting was happening. I went straight to sit at the bar with a couple of other regulars who know the situation with my fiance  and were sympathetic and didn't demand I talk about it too much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA guy I used to know quite well, but haven't seen for a number of months was apparently at the wine tasting (I didn't notice him and his boyfriend as I came in). On the way to the toilet he said hello, I said hello back and assumed he went to the toilet, he claims he stood behind me waiting for a conversation. I didn't see this, I wasn't really focused on him. I was quite grateful he'd left me to it (or so I assumed) as conversation with him can be quite intense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's since sent me messages saying how rude and awful I was to him on this night, and complaining that I didn't congratulate him on him being coupled up on Valentines day. I've held my ground saying I wasn't in a good place, and wasn't in a mood to talk. He's told me how selfish and disrespectful I was being because he wanted to talk to me, and that i had humiliated him by not speaking to him more over the course of the evening. I lost my patience and told him I didn't owe anyone my time and conversation, and that it was telling that he hadn't even bothered to consider if I was ok, ask where my fiance was or find out if something had happened. I asked him why everything had to be made about him and his pride,  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know i could have been more enthusiastic to see them both, but I wasn't in the mood and these two really do make it all about themselves whenever I'm around them. Given the situation I feel like I was justified to not really want to spend Time around them. Anyway - the texts since have called me an arsehole, a bitch etc - how correct is this guy?",

      "description": "So this past summer I (M 22) was looking to  buy a new car and upgrade from my first car I’ve had for about 7 years. To not go too far into detail about it, my dad got involved in my new car purchase and coerced me to go against my better judgement and buy this 2006 bmw that he found online for about the same price instead of the one I had picked out and was going to buy (2007 Volvo S60 R) which, might I add, was in perfect condition. When I looked at the bmw it seemed to be in decent condition apart from some obvious problem areas that I knew would need to be addressed (new wheels, appeared to be an oil leak, needed new driver side headlight) which also gave me a bad feeling in my gut. long story short I end up buying the bmw cause my dad went ahead and out some of my money in as a down payment for it (he likes to eat involved with things). \n\nOk so fast forward about 6 months and I have so far sunk about 2000$ into this car on necessary fixes that turned out to be big repairs (I’m still kicking myself in the ass for buying this money pit). One thing in particular that still hadn’t been fixed was the driver side headlight. The problem with it was that water had been able to leak into the headlight over years and years causing the clear plastic to be permanently cloudy and also messed up some electrical components which caused the adaptive headlight not to work (turns the lights left and right when going around corners and is a very intricate assembly so can’t be fixed with a simple bulb replacement). Since I don’t have a lot of money being a recent grad and am only working an entry level job, I can only make the repairs once I save enough money and the whole replacement OEM headlight assembly would cost about 5-600$. \n\nAlso for a side note I’m big on doing things correctly the first time and of course I’ll try to save money when I can but I will opt to spent the extra buck when something really counts and needs to be done right. \n\nSo a couple of weeks ago my dad gifted me a replacement headlight assembly so I could save the 500$ for something else. The other day I took the old one out and tried putting the new one in. First I hooked up all the plugs to make sure it worked but there was one plug that didn’t have a spot to connect to. I looked closer and realized that these were not the same kind of headlight. The main difference being that the replacement did not have the adaptive headlight assembly inside it and was just a regular bulb (the light from the replacement was yellow and much dimmer than the original passenger side light that was white light) On top of that, the holes for the screws didn’t line up right with the frame and required a little persuasion to fit. Also on the original there’s a separate arm piece that clips into one corner of the headlight and then is screwed into the frame. The replacement had the spot where the piece sits in but not the part where it clips into the headlight itself so it sits in the opening loosely. Without this arm attached, the headlight wiggled around. So now I’m thinking that the replacement is just a cheap knockoff. I told my dad about the light and that as much as I really appreciated his gift I can’t use it cause I’m worried about it coming loose or breaking (being as that it wouldn’t be completely mounted and the material felt very fragile) and he acknowledged. So I figured I’d just take it out and put the old one back in the next day as I was running out of daylight and didn’t feel like fiddling with it anymore (kind of a pain in the ass to get it in/out) \n\nThe next day I get up around 10 cause it’s a Saturday and It’s the only day I get to sleep in. When I go downstairs my dad tells me that he was able to get the headlight mounted correctly and that he fixed it. When I go out I see that the arm is attached to the frame on the spot on the light where’s it’s supposed to be. I look closer and I see a big crack in the side of the opening where the arm sits and super glue all around it (looked like he forced it in and it snapped). Then I see a big smear of superglue that dripped off the arm area onto the front of the headlight onto the clear plastic that had been partially wiped but looked like it was wiped off a bit too late and managed to dry. So now not only can I not return the replacement headlight because it’s damaged but I’m pretty much stuck with it. I told him that I appreciate him trying to help but as much as I tried to not get mad I got pretty upset at him doing things to my car without my knowledge. \n\nAITA for trying to give my dad back the gift and getting upset with him about him “fixing” the replacement and rendering it nonreturnable?",

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I were talking about something psychology related, and she told me about an experiment she learned about in one of her psych classes (she’s a psych major). The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like “that’s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been”\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn’t like that I’d used the word “obviously” because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn’t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn’t know it was that obvious, and it hadn’t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word “obviously” can be offensive, but I don’t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word “obviously” was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said “I don’t care.” She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don’t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe’s waiting for me to apologize, but I don’t think I should have to. I just don’t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn’t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I “tried to invalidate her feelings,” which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "For context, I'm 17 years old and still live with my mom and dad. Around a week ago by mom asked me what my shift schedule was for the week, I replied that I didn't know yet (because I had not checked, not because it wasn't out). She told me she wanted all of us (my entire family) to attend church with her that Sunday because it was a Christmas event, and they were providing dinner after. I never clearly told her no, I didn't see harm in going once because I stopped going to church with her regularly a couple months ago, it was fine as long as I wasn't working.\n\nSkip ahead a few days, and I did turn out to be working Sunday, but I was scheduled an hour after lunch. At this point, I decided I wasn't going because getting from the church to work would be too rushed, and I didn't want to be late for my shift. I told my mom what time I was working, but never told her no when she said \"you'll still be able to go\" because I knew that would ultimately end in an argument. \n\nWhen Sunday rolled around, my dad woke me up and I said I wasn't going because I'm working. He said okay and walked away. About a half hour later my mom knocked on my door telling me to get up because I'm going to church. I said no I'm working, it's going to be too rushed getting from the church and eating (there are assigned tables + line ups), and she yelled about it being \"family time\" and there was no reason for me to not go, and then said if I didn't go she would take the internet for two days. I said whatever and went back to bed.\n\nLater when I woke up and got ready for work, a couple minutes before I had to leave I was looking for the keys to drive and couldn't find them anywhere. I started to panic, and texted my sister because my mom and dad were not answering their phones. She said \"sounds like mom took the keys.\" And she did, and I had no way to get to work. I had to reluctantly call my manager explaining that I couldn't come into work because my mom took the keys, which he replied \"thanks for telling me\" and then said it's law (here) to call in at least two and a half hours before if you can't come in. I said I didn't know what to do, and then hung up. \n\nSo I ended up staying home, absolutely pissed off and upset that my mom took away my ability to go to work (I had already called in twice that week because I was sick). I decided to play games because if I'm not working why not, and when my mom came home she immediately took the internet. This wouldn't have bothered me so much if a) she hadn't already taken the car keys, and b) it takes away my ability to talk to my LDR boyfriend, as we can only talk via social media app (I don't have data), which she knows.\n\nI went up to her and said we needed to talk, in which turned into a screaming match between my parents and I. They said there was no reason I couldn't of went, and they only asked me for two hours of my time, in which I told them (also yelling) what I had said earlier about being rushed, and how it was unacceptable how my mom reacted. My mom told me to shut up and go to my room. I did, to calm down, and then about an hour later went back and apologized to her that I didn't go, and asked if we could talk again but like civil people. I then explained how I felt and why what she did upset me so much. When I finished she said \"I already told you everything I needed to\" and then got up and left. \n\nAITA for not going to church with her when it meant so much to her, and then getting so upset when she punished me?

His reasoning is that our friend does not have a ride to get home from his college (different from the one that I or my boyfriend goes to) and if they do the trip together my boyfriend would be able to give him a ride home and pick up the thing he needed all in one fell swoop. The three of us cannot go together because we have a two person car.\nI am pissed off that he even thought it would be okay to ask. I have expressed to him many times before that I have when people are flaky or when plans change in general. So like IN WHAT WORLD would I be okay if he takes a vacation that I suggested without me and with our friend. His argument is that he was just asking and he is fine if we stick to the original plan. I feel like the fact that he even considered ditching me is a dick move. However, he seems to not really get that me made me feel like I'm less of a priority to him than his friend. It might be relevant that the friend apparently has no other way home for spring break than catching a ride with my boyfriend, though I think he could take the train or get a rideshare. Is he the asshole for asking or am I the asshole/overreacting to his suggestion?",

      "description": "My SO and I live with a roommate (RM) who I've been friends with for 10+ years. For the most part we all get along well and respect each others privacy and space.\n\nAugust of last year we informed RM we are planning on buying a house no later than end of this lease (August 2019).I've been keeping RM in the loop with our home buying process on any potential homes. I asked if 60 days (notice we have to give apartment leasing company and term of rent that needs to be paid) was enough time for her to get a new place? She said yes- I also offered to put in the 60 day notice later, effectively buying her more time to search for a place as well.\n\nOn Tuesday, I told my RM I think we are about to go under contract on a potential home and that SO and I would pay for any termination fees and of course our portion of rent/utilities during the 60 days. Asked RM if she needed more than 60 days to find a place, she said no, she was planning on moving into a 1bd/1bth in the same apt. \n\nOn Thursday the home deal fell through and we are back on the market so I informed our RM that we were back on the search. She said that she was planning on going to the leasing office tomorrow to sign a contract for mid April for her own place. She asked to be let out of the lease and obligations here as she wants to just get the move over with. I discussed with SO and we agreed that we could cover her portion of rent starting May. I inform roommate we would cover her portion of rent beginning May, but that she would still be responsible for her portion of March &amp; April rent/utilities, to which she agreed.\n\nYesterday RM goes to the leasing office to sign her lease. I get back home from work and calculate out how much her April rent/utilities are and inform her for the power bill I would let her know once I got the bill. She responded back 'ok'. 15 min later, I get a text from RM who said she doesn't think its fair that she should have to pay rent for a month that she wont be here. She gets home &amp; she informed me that she signed a lease for mid March for her own place, because the leasing office offered her a \"better deal\". I asked her wasn't she planning on moving mid April, why did she sign for mid March? Her response was because of the better deal and she wanted to just get it over with. I told her I would need to discuss with SO and see if we could let cover her portion of rent for April. I point out to her that even if SO and I closed on the house, everyone would have had to pay the apt for the 60 days of rent (March &amp; April) for the apartment.\n\nAfter much discussion, SO &amp; I agree that it's unfair for us to become burdened with her portion of rent for April just because she wanted to move out earlier and signed a contract without informing us. I also point out that she had no intent of signing for March, it was April. I let RM know our decision and the conversation did not go over well.",

      "description": "I am a child of immigrants. I recently moved back home from college 7 months ago and I can't wait to be out. I've been on my own for 4 years; therefore, being back in their control is suffocating me. I just want to do my own thing and honestly, I don't have a good reason to why I want to move out, besides just because I want to. My sister recently rented a house 5 mins away from my parents and she has an extra room for me, so I figured that it would be good to move in with her. I get my freedom and my parents won't have to worry about me living by myself. I told them about it, and they were not happy. Here are their reasons: \n\n1. They've sacrificed their lives, everything for me to have my future here in the US. Now, that I've made something for myself (a job), the first thing I want is to abandon them. (The house is literally down the street)\n2. I've only gotten a part time job, I'm not stable enough to be on my own. (I can afford to move out though) \n3. My parents are only getting older, if I don't stay with them now, I won't have much time left once I have my own family \n4. Instead of paying rents for a stranger (the owner of my sister's house), I could've used that money to help them with their current house. \n5. Since they can't speak or read or write in English, I'm the one that's been helping them with all of their documents, letters, mails. They believe that if I move out, I won't be there to help them anymore. \n\nSo, the people of reddit, please tell me am I the asshole for wanting to move out? I understand that they gave me the opportunity to have a higher education, but do I owe them for the rest of my life? Should I just live with them until I get married (they believe that it's the legitimate way to move out) and then move out? ",

      "description": "So my MIL got a new boyfriend who she married soon after and this guy sort of sucks. He made an antisemitic joke on the day I met him and when H told his mom that those things can’t happen again the guy  ignored me from that point on and he never apologized. He also has this hobby of taking pictures of people and sending the pictures out with ridiculous photoshopped effects and fake backgrounds. \n\nSo fast forward to my wedding, H and I told them beforehand that we would prefer them not taking pics. So what happens on my wedding day? The guy competes with the photographer, shadows what she is doing, and remarks that they should compare pics to see who was better.  He then sends out the pics he took to everyone before the professional photo did and he photoshops the backgrounds and it looked like we got married at glamour shots in the mall. My dad gets pissed because he isn’t in the pics and said I look like an orphan. I tell them to please stop sending those pics because I would prefer the ones that I paid a professional to do. MIL gets offended.\n\nLater on MIL tells H and me that her now husband thinks we don’t like him. We are honest and say we’ll he made a Jew joke and then he takes pics when we said not to. She said everyone else was taking pics, which was true, but they were not intrusive, didn’t follow around the photog and didn’t send out pics like they were the real photographer.  \n\nMIL ended up crying.  AITA? Should I just inspect people to go around taking their own pics during a wedding? Is that just something that people do now a days?",

      "description": "So just for some background, I live in a house on a college campus with 6 people, 2 of whom are females. Late at night over the weekend i woke up to yelling downstairs and a text on my phone saying \"we need help downstairs\". So I woke up a little drunk from a couple hours ago and went down. In the living room there was an open door and a guy I had never seen yelling at my female roomate. Three of my other roomate were around yelling at him to leave.\n\nSo I didnt really know what to do but my beer corage told me to run up to him with a shove and go forehead to forehead and scream some things that have gotten me in trouble. Essentially I yelled something along the lines of \"Leave or take a shot because the second you do you will wake up at the [local] hospital. Look around, you know nobody can pull me off.\"\n\nNow people are just upset that I could lash out like that, and maybe I like the girl and was being irresponsible, or that some of the slurs I used were inappropriate. But for all I know the dude was abusing here, or followed her from a bar, or worse. I just wanted him out the door. All the yelling was just to get him out, I had no intention to hurt anyone.",

      "description": "Some context: I am not handicapped. However, the location (a gas station) is somewhere I go daily (and, that I used to work at a couple years ago), so I know that, despite it being a college town, there are quite a few regulars who are... quite old, and might need the spot. Also all conversations are as best as I can remember it. There was more interactions than just this, but for the most part it was repeating the same beats. Capitalized words are raised voices.  \n\n\nI am pulling into the gas station behind another car. The car ahead of me was turning, as the only spot left open by the doors was the handicapped parking space (he would go on to park at a pump, as did I. There were still 3 open when I walked inside). However, he was forced to slam on his brakes as a car zipped in front of him and into the handicapped parking space. It wasn't an illegal move, nor was she speeding through the parking lot... but it was definitely rude.  \n\n\nWhatever. Not a big deal.  \n\n\nI park at a pump and head inside. While I go in, I notice that the rude car didn't have a handicapped plate. I double checked that she had indeed pulled into the handicapped parking space before peeking into the car to see if there was a hanging handicapped sign on the rear-view mirror (my late grandma would use one when she went places with my mom) and also notice that the girl in the car seems to be a peppy young thing couldn't be older than 30, but was probably in her 20s (I'm a 28 yo man, and she looked young to me). I shake my head at this point, disappointed that someone was taking a spot at a semi-busy gas station for a handicapped person, when it seemed there was nothing wrong with her.   \n\n\nI figure it's none of my business and head inside. As I reach for the door, I see \"Deb\" the manager, heading out. I hold the door open for her. We exchanged pleasantries and she went on her way, stating that she was out for the night.  \n\n\nSo, once inside, while I was checking my pockets (I forget my card a lot, so I was making sure I actually had it before I got my purchases). At that point, I felt a pair of spindly arms wrap around me from behind, with painted fingers laced around my chest. The hugger (lets call her Kate, for simplicity) is holding their head against my back. I tense up and state loud enough for the entire store to hear:  \n\n\nME: \"I don't know who you are. Get the fuck off of me.\"  \n\n\nShe complies, stating something about how I should smile more. Because I look like I'm always pissed. (more context: I'm generally seen as a pretty happy guy. I talk jovially with the employees and customers alike. I also have a penchant for having full on conversations with people that I meet at this station). I respond:  \n\n\nME: \"Yeah, normally I get pretty pissed when morons steal handicapped parking spaces.\"  \nKATE: \"Are you a cop?\"  \nME: \"No. I'm just not an asshole.\"  \nKATE: \"So, do you see anyone who needs it, huh?\"  \nME: \"Nope. But that doesn't mean there wont-\"  \nKATE: \"Then whats the problem? There was nowhere else to park!\"  \nME: \"I can see THREE PARKINGS PLACES out ther-!\"  \nKATE: \"THERE'S NOWHERE TO PARK!\" \n\nME: \"THERE ARE PARKING SPACES, if you aren't a BITCH!\"  \n\n\nAt this point, the cashier (let's call her Meg) informs me that if I keep this up, I would be asked to leave. At this point, Kate has a shit-eating grin on her face.  \n\n\nObviously, I decide it's not worth being kicked out of a place where I'm known by a first name basis... so I shut my mouth. I get my items, but in the meantime, I hear Kate talking to Meg. She's clearly talking loud enough so I can hear it from where I'm at.  \n\n\nKATE: \"What do you think about all this?\"  \nMEG: \\*incomprehensible from where I was\\*  \nKATE: \"That guy's such a fucking ASSHOLE.\"  \n\n\nShe brushes past me, with a smug look on her face, after she pays (there was one person in line between us, at this time).  \n\n\nI figure this is all over. Fine. Whatever.  \n\n\nBut then, as I'm paying, I hear something from the doorway, turning to see that Kate was standing in the open door, letting in all the cold air as she berated me:  \n\n\nKATE: \"You fucking asshole!\"  \nKATE: \"I bet you got a tiny dick!\"  \nKATE: \"You fucking dickless asshole!\"  \n\n\nEtc...  \n\n\nI pay for my 52 oz soda and start towards the door. I start to walk towards my car, when I have an idea:  \n\n\nI can either go around the passenger side of her car, or the driver's side. I decide... Driver's side.  \n\n\nME: \"Excuse me, I need to get to my car.\"  \nKATE: \"What?\"  \nME: \"I'm want to get to my car. And there's no other path to get there.\"  \nKATE: \"What's your problem, asshole?\"  \nME: \"Nothing, just that I have to talk to a stupid cunt.\"  \nKATE: \"Oh, yeah, I'm a  cunt. A great big cunt.\"  \nKATE: \"I have a great big vagina that just spills out of my pants  \n*(at this point, Kate is making hand gestures, showing how big her vagina is, and how it flows from her jeans)*  \nME: \"It shows. It REALLY does!\"  \n\n\nI continue to brush past her to get to my car and she leans into me, spilling my soda over both of us, leaving about only half of the soda in the cup, with a crack down one side. At this point, Kate is stunned. She has no words. I continue walking to my car when I hear the guttural yelp of someone desperately throwing something. When the smell of carmel, cream and gas station coffee hits me, I realize that the entire back of my coat is covered in her disgusting half-coffee.  \n\n\nI turn on my heel, half of a soda still in my hands. I consider myself an expert on aiming drinks, mainly due to the fact that I end up with a lot of half-finished drinks, which I tend to toss in an arc, as opposed to making a big puddle. So, I took aim and returned fire, covering the front of her shirt in even more soda than had been spilled before.  \n\n\nSoaking wet (and wanting to prove to her that I'm a better person than her) I threw my empty cup away, got in my car, and tried to leave. She was already on my bumper, fumbling with her phone, trying to record me. I yell for her to get out of my way, as I'm trying to leave. I rev my engine, which makes her back off a little, then use the gap to zip past her and around the other side of the pumps and out the exit of the gas station.  \n\n\nI later learned that she had called the cops on me. That the cops had watched video of the altercation, but nothing else. It's been a week and I have yet to hear from the cops (my plate would have DEFINITELY been on camera, assuming they hadn't moved them since I worked there.), and I was informed by Deb, the manager from before, that none of the cops were told my name. And when I relayed the full story, Deb was trying hard to hold back a laugh.  \n\n\nI later learned that I had distressed Meg with the confrontation in the store, as she wasn't sure how to handle the situation. She was alone at the store, at the time, and both of us (apparently) were regulars. It had apparently caused her to break down a bit, as I was informed that after the incident, Meg was in tears.  \n\n\nSo, I ask: Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "I'm on mobile, I'll try to make it easy to read.\n\nA bit of background. Since my kid was born 3 years and a few months ago I have felt nothing but dread every time my husband tries to make a move on me. I went 2 of those years without being diagnosed with PPD, making taking care of my child a nightmare, let alone the little time I had for myself well...also a nightmare. i started getting treatment after a huge meltdown in November 2016. This resulted in me being diagnosed bipolar 2 and most recently borderline personality disorder. \n\nI'm extremely difficult to deal with and I will be forever grateful to my husband for being there for me. However, back when we were dating there was a period when we were living in different countries and signs of an unhealthy relationship started showing. I tried to break it off because I didn't believe in LDR, he would say he couldn't live without me, so he would guilt me into staying with him. I'm talking 2011. Sorry, I digress, but I feel it's meaningful. (We got married in 2012 btw).\n\n\nBack to the present. We had my parents over for a few months (this is not uncommon where I'm from) and them helping with the kid (great since I'm not that motherly even though I love the kid) made me feel great and gave me an awesome excuse not to have sex with my husband (not to mention our baby still sleeps with us), but when they left he started expecting us to get intimate again. I don't want him anymore. I love him as the father of my kid but I just...it doesn't work. He's controlling, expects to control my bank account. If I have any friends he expects me to see them home so he can see them (even if he does disappear a couple of days a week for hours and I don't inquire). If I'm on my phone he expects me to tell him who I'm talking to. I recently removed his fingerprint from my phone and he got all suspicious.\n\n\nI feel awful. I'm not working at the moment so he has all this power over me, which he enjoys. I don't know what to do. AITA for wanting to file for divorce ASAP and taking my kid to another country? There are other causes for my wanting to divorce him I can't mention here, per subreddit rules. Real shitty ones.",

      "description": "     I have a friend that's been kind of a shitty friend at times but I still love her. She's 20 f and is in college and has two jobs. Up until this point I've been trying to be supportive because I know she works a lot and I don't wanna upset her.\n\n    Recently though, I was told I might become a manager at the shitty fast food place I work at. She was livid and told me she was promised that due to previous manager experience. I really don't see the big deal in me becoming a manager before her since I have been here almost a year longer than her and I only work this job (currently trying g to get back into college, dropped out to go to hair school and hated it lol). I think she would be a good manager and she is a hard worker, but I believe I am too. \n\n    Since all that happened she has been making snide remarks to me about how much she works, or that she's happy to help people instead of telling them what to do, like I do (trying to improve on leadership skills) .I really considered not taking the position even though it would really help me financially because she made me believe it was wrong to go before her. And on her birthday night when I was taking her to bars she said \"I'm over it. You should take the manager position. You don't have anything else going for you. Honestly since they aren't gonna make me a manager I'll probably just quit. I just wouldn't be able to respect you. \"\n\n    Just today I said I'm tired and her response was \"oh my God you do know I go to work at like 3 and work until 9 right? And I opened how are you tired?\" Im to my breaking point with her. I try my best to not be a one upper and she clearly works more than me but I really enjoy my free time and just want a raise and a promotion so I can be more financially stable. \n\n  Am I the asshole for not wanting to be friend with her anymore? I know I don't work as much but I still put in 40+ hours a week and volunteer so I'm really tired. Or am I just a whiny bitch? \n\n",

      "description": "My wife got into a dispute with a client over unpaid services, the guy was a day late in payment. I called him to sort it out, he said he would pay the next day. I relayed this to my wife, and left the house to go to a dinner with some of my close friends.\n\nAs I'm out, she texts him that he's messing with the wrong woman. They get to a heated exchange via text. He calls her a prostitute, she calls him a muslim terrorist - nasty exchanges all around. My phone is blowing up about how pissed she, and the guy (who's likely drunk) is texting me how he doesn't want to pay because she's being rude, also calling her and me names as well. I'm out and trying to balance this situation while having a good time with my friends - I take the high road and ask him to be civil, that nobody works for free, and that he should do right by us. He responds he won't pay out of principle and that he would fuck me up in a fight. I ignore him.\n\nThe next morning, he pays me half of what is owned. My wife threatens to press charges and he pays the remaining amount. Afterwards, she attacks me saying I didn't do enough - that I'm a pussy because I didn't send him death threats and didn't go to his place to beat the fuck out of him, that I'm not risking jail time to defend her honor. I'm a big guy, I don't believe in resorting to violence and death threats unless I or someone I love is in real danger. I'm not starting wars over petty insults. The dude is a piece of shit but he's not worth it.\n\nAnyways, I've been getting the cold shoulder since, she's telling me her old fuckbuddies and friends are willing to come to this man's address and tear him apart - and that I'm not a man and she's going to leave me soon and that she'll never let this go.\n\nIt might be worth mentioning that she suffers from PMDD (think PMS on steroids x 10000), so for about 2 weeks of every month she'll get set off by anything and have a massive fucking outburst or fight (she once physically pushed and wanted to fist-fight a bouncer because he didn't like Mariah Carey).  Once it's over she ends up being her sweet self. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Now, based off of the title, you probably already think “Damn, this kid’s an asshole.” But here’s some context.\n\nThe week before Christmas, I received a $400 target gift card I won in a drawing.  I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, “You have to get something for me and (Sister’s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: “Oh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1’s name) and (Cousin 2’s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don’t just get something cheap.” She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don’t and won’t see often?)\n\nMe: “No thanks.” I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom’s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said “Maybe if you weren’t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn’t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!” (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I’m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI’m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n",

It’s to the point that my friends ask me why they haven’t really seen her since high school and I’m at an absolute loss for words about what to respond to them. \n\nShe also doesn’t really like going to the bar, which is fine and I don’t care too much. I like to, but I can go with my friends and it’s not a huge deal. My good friend invited me out for his birthday, and invited my gf. She said maybe (which I knew meant no already) and after much delaying she just said she’s too tired and doesn’t want to go. \n\nWell I got really upset about this. I’m at a point where it’s like, why do I go out of my way to spend time with your friends if you happen to go to a pregame with them, why do I go out of my way to walk around and do things that you ask if you don’t reciprocate the few times I want to do something? I told her that it’s unfair and she doesn’t have to drink but we are 22 years old and we can afford a night out on a weekend day without going to sleep at 10 because we’re tired.

I was always hesitant but him being my best friend I would usually get him the game or gift card he wanted. Two months into the school year he started talking to all of our other friends about how annoying I am and selfish. Even in the classes we had together he'd talk shit about me while I'm in ear shot, all the while still expecting me to buy him a gift card and games. Finally I had enough and said no and his response was, \"bro are you fucking serious? I thought we were friends\" and he stopped talking to me, later that week he told me he was only my friend because I bought him stuff. And after that me being 5 ft 9 and him being 5 ft 3, I'd pick on him during classes throw his stuff out of our locker and beat him up all the way up until 12th grade",

      "description": "Context: we have an extension to the house which is separate from the main building with 3 rooms 1 bathroom etc that our family uses to rent out to other people.\n\nLast Monday, a person (let's name him Ted) who has rented rooms before wanted to come back and rent them out again because he didn't feel safe in his previous area due to an ex stalking him (but never went to the police about it). I made it very clear to him that if Ted wanted to stay, he would have to pay the Bond + rent upfront before he could stay for even 1 night to which he happily agreed to but said he'd pay on Friday.\n\nThe next morning (Tuesday), I woke up to see something strange, which was Ted's car in the driveway, and to my surprise, he had already crashed a night in the area which disappointed me because I thought he wouldn't do anything like that. When I woke Ted up, his voice was muddled and unintelligible, he wasn't able to give a proper reason as to why he stayed the night, only saying \"i won't do this again, and I will make sure I'll pay by Friday\". He then asks when I head out to university on Friday which I said 11AM, and he replied with \"That'll be easy, I'll come by before then and pay up\". \n\nCome Friday morning, Ted never showed up, so I tried contacting him a few times before leaving for university, he got back to me around 12PM saying \"I was packing my stuff, and on a phone call with a possible employer, sorry about that, you have my word that I'll come by tomorrow before 12PM.\" \nIt was already at this point I was doubting my decision to let him stay if he can't uphold his word, so I decided to give him one more chance to see if he changed.\n\nSaturday morning, he didn't show up again, no signs of contacting me via call or text and at this point I really felt like I can't let him stay if he doesn't hold his word to do something as simple as showing up in the morning and pay the Bond + rent. So I tried calling him once in the afternoon, no response, and around 10 times in the evening to get a text saying \"I am in another call, will call you back\" and so I waited. Till around 1:30AM I waited for his call back to see why he didn't show up, only to not get a phone call.\n\nSunday morning (today), Ted still hasn't shown up and I have tried ringing him a few times to get a text saying \"Can't speak right now, will call you back later\". It was at this point I decided to make the decision to reply with \"I'll make this easier for you, leave. This has been unacceptable and you know that\". The reason why it's unacceptable is because this isn't the only time he's done something like this, he's done it before when he stayed before (like 9 months ago). He told me on Monday that he was a changed man and out of the few interactions over the week, I could tell he hasn't at all. \n\nAll he needed to do was to show up and pay the bond + rent, or inform me that something was going on but he never said anything other than \"call you later\".\n\nAm I the Asshole for doing what I did?",

      "description": "A while back, I got into some major shit with some “friends” I had. These “friends” were complete assholes, and they were sucky af. All they did was try to start drama which was super annoying and immature, and then they’d blame it on other people. \n\nThey’d also managed to slowly get me to start dropping my relationships with other friends, family, etc. Until I realized what was really going on.\n\nThey made me feel guilty for the shit they started, and acted like every single little thing I did was horribly wrong or offensive, and the things they’d stuck in my mind are still affecting me now.\n\nNot to mention, they were like 13 year old girls when it came to gossiping. They would do it CONSTANTLY, about their own friends. It was a hobby for them.\n\nWe had this huge fight and both sides were being total shitheads TBH. We were both in the wrong. Both sides insulted each other and were rude. \n\nHowever, I refuse to forgive them. To me, that would be like excusing all the shit they’d pulled on me in the past, and I don’t think they deserve my forgiveness, or even my respect. Forgiving people who act like that will just take advantage of that and keep doing it, knowing that you’ll forgive them every time.\n\nMy parents, however, say that you should love, respect, and forgive EVERYONE, even the people who’ve torn apart your life and hurt you intentionally, because that’s what Jesus tells us to do. They tell me that forgiving those assholes would be showing that I’m moving on, but that’s not the way I see forgiveness at all, and I’m sure as hell thats not how those shitheads see it either. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to forgive people who’ve really hurt me and mentally scarred me?

      "description": "Dated her for 4 months, back and forth, she has a lot of trust issues. Shes done alot to me, flaked on me, left me standing outside her door, lied to me, disrepected me by telling me about other guys she fell in love with whilst dating me, and Ive never said much. She often makes plans and then pretends as though there was no plans when she completely flakes, I never really get mad.\n\nWas going through bad withdrawls from an alcohol addiction, diffiult to sleep. First 2 nights she kept waking me up at 3am. 2nd night I said I desperately need sleep but was shaken awake. 3rd night I came home and literally passed out asleep, knowing she finished at 10pm and it was only 5.30 and thinking I would wake up in a few hours and see her.\n\nAwoke at 1.30am to a flurry of textings starting from nice, to mean, to being broken up. Ending with \"i wont listen to any more excuses this time\".\n\nAm I the Asshole here?\n\nFurther to this I told her I had fallen asleep and stopped contacting her, then went to hers to grab my stuff, expecting some kind of apology for that madness, but instead was made to listen to how I shouldve text her if I was feeling sick just to warn her that I may fall asleep? and then proceeded to bring up other times I have flaked, which was only once and I made her aware.\n\nMore recently she tried saying she never did anything wrong in the relationship. I tried to ask how its reasonable to break up with someone before even hearing why they didnt answer. I tried to say what If i was hit by a car I was going to wake up to those texts? and she just said thats ridiculous and laughed at me. I know its unlikely but you never know.\n\nMy best friend (or so I thought) always supported me by saying she was crazy and everyone hated her, then on a big night out I asked him to come back with me after and relax, was told he wasnt leaving till later. So i text and said when your on  way back come chill for a bit, no reply. I said if you go back to another one of my mates I can meet you guys there, these people that are supposed friends.\n\nNext day he tried to tell me how he and another guy went back to his and a few people went back with my EX. I asked who and he said he doesnt know. He then started telling me stories about the night and named people specifically who were at her house, him being one of them. About 7 people. I proceeded to say didnt you just tell me you didnt go there and didnt know who did, and then he changed the story and said he only went there for 10 minutes with the guy then left. I asked the EX the next day and she said he stayed all night.\n\nI text him and said hes an asshole for going back to my ex girlfriends and lying to me about it. I said even if you were sparing my feelings, in reality you shouldve come back with me if you are telling the truth when you constantly say what a horrible person she is and what shes done to me. I told him I cant really trust him.\n\nSo yeah this woman now has all of my friends, and I have no one really, and im pretty sure I didnt really do anything wrong.?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Then I get a knock at the door and it's the mother in law unannounced again. I'm really short with her and for once manage to turn her away. I ask my wife if she can have a word with her mum and she gets annoyed (maybe I should of just told the in-law myself?)\n\nBut anyways long story short I say we gotta do something about this and the wife gets really annoyed and says 'well it's only a game you were playing so you should speak to her'.\n\nWhether I was playing a game or not isn't really the point.

I've always encouraged her to get her cats fixed so they dont reproduce. I am heavily into animal rescue and currently have two foster cats. They drive me %100 crazy but at least their not at risk for euthanasia at the moment . My family friend literally has about 30 cats in her home stacked on cages that she fosters so they dont get euthanized. It's the city I live in , cats get euthanized pretty frequently due to lack of homes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF had confessed that her cat had a litter of kittens from another cat she has. I was pretty upset but I didnt say anything , assuming it was a one time thing.\n\nNope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer cat is pregnant. Again. I  come to find this is her 4th time  . One of her litters had 3 kittens. 2 of them died and one was neurologically disabled. The cat was given to a friend who then took the cat to a kill shelter. She claims the cat was pulled but who knows.  \n\nI was pretty upset at this and told her that it was irresponsible and that cats are euthanized all the time due to lack of homes and to please spay her. She said she didnt want to lose her cat in surgery... You see\n\nYears ago I encouraged her to get one of her cat neutered. She did and the cat passed away 9 days later.  She claims he also got mange from the neutering truck they went to . She said she doesnt want her cat to die so she lets the cat get knocked up repeatedly ???  She said the cat is now 7 and would need blood work to get spayed as well??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe kinda got into it for a while. She said she may neuter her male cat but she still lets her female cat go outside. She claims the female doesnt go far so she wont mate (uh...)  Anyways she lets her un-neutered males roam outside (in a city) and do who knows what. \n\nWe went at it for a while and things got really tense . We then changed the subject but honestly I dont even feel like I can be friends with her. I do so much rescue work and fostering but it all goes to shit when people do things like this . Whats the point of even fostering if she does things like this ? Her cat is going to give birth...AGAIN and she rather the cat keep breeding rather then get her spayed.\n\nShe even yelled saying people breed their cats and I wouldnt be bashing them and I told them I would.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShes really excited to be friends with me again and keeps trying to make more plans to hang out.\n\nAm I the asshole If I just......dont?",

When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area?

Before joining the team I was warned by three staff members (one more senior to me) about a colleage I would be working with (call her Jane). They both told me, in separate conversations, that Jane is extremely lazy and does not do any work. And just escalates all the work she gets. I did not know them that well so I took their warning about Jane with a grain of salt.\n\nOver the last 6 months Jane has not been doing her work which means a lot of it falls to me to complete and I was so stressed from it that I took 2 weeks of stress leave. Management is horrible so no point in approaching them (that is why the three staff members who warned me left the team).\n\nAfter coming back from leave I am settling into work this conversation happens:\n\n- Jane: I noticed that this job is under your name but hasn't been followed up\n- Me: ok (I go have a look and see that I am expecting information back before I can finish it)\n- Jane: well, these people are very busy and cannot get to everything, but with the information provided it can be completed\n- Me: that is not the normal process, we need the information to proceed\n- Jane: it can be completed though\n\nAnd this is where I lose it. I turn to face her and look her directly in the eye and say 'I don't care'. I turn around and continue my work. Aita for saying that?\n\nAfter doing that though she actually does more work. I get called in to talk to my manager though. I so end up apologising, but after that she has gone back to her old ways.",

Specifically when it comes to weed. \n\nI'm in college but still very much dependent on my parents and they have a 100% no cannabis rule which I just never have followed and for the most part things have worked out.\n\nThen came my gf, she comes from a much less strict family than I so these things are a lot easier for her, but she never takes any form of precaution around my family. Which has manifested into many close calls and near misses with them and their rule.\n\nLast night she left a bag sitting in the passenger seat in my car that she completely did not tell me about.  It's all fine until I go to take my sister somewhere this morning and opened my door to see that bag staring me in the face.\n\nI kind of lost it on her to which she says I'm being rude about this and she didn't mean to so I shouldn't be mad at her.\n\nSo, AITA for thinking she needs to respect my rules concerning my family more or does that responsibility fall entirely on me?",

      "description": " I'm a senior in college. It's been rocky for me, because my parents kicked me out after I'd turned 18 and finished high school-- to explain more in detail, I'd originally been planning on joining the military immediately after HS and had been recruited and training for nearly a year for boot, but things fell through once it was realized that I have serious issues with depression, ADHD, &amp; PTSD (these things can disqualify you from being able to serve). A few weeks after I graduated HS, things began to explode at my home. I was equal parts frustrated with myself for not having any idea what to do now/how to get my life on track, while also juggling what I now knew for a fact to be mental disorders, and also being upset with the psychologically&amp;physically abusive treatment my parents forced on me and my siblings. So I got literally kicked to the curb.\n\nA friend's parents took me in and got me started heading in the right direction. I applied to stuff, got accepted, and thanks to the FASFA my parents had filled out at a high school thing earlier in the year, I was able to afford to go through loans, scholarships, and jobs. My parents have re-done the FASFA for me yearly, but other than that we are not on speaking terms and they give me no financial support, period. I'm homeless outside of the school year and generally spend time with my long-time partner's family in summer/on holidays, helping to pay bills.\n\nMy parents ain't great. I have PTSD thanks to them, and my depression has been exacerbated, if not directly caused by their actions towards me and my siblings when I was young. It's also all but confirmed I have DID because of the long-term abuse too. But recently, my parents have began to make attempts to reach out to me, inquiring about my graduation so that they can come and telling me how upset all my siblings are that they haven't seen me in almost four years.\n\nI think they want to reconnect with me. But, I hate them since they abused me so badly for 18 years and fucked me up on such an unfixable level. I'm going to have to live with my issues for **the rest of my life** and I resent them for that. But we're related even if I wish we weren't and I'd be a lying if I said that people can't change. I don't know if I could ever forgive&amp;forget, but I don't know if it'd even be fair to deny them the opportunity to come to my college graduation, especially since I *couldn't* have done it without the FASFA loans I took out. \n\nWith all this said, I kinda want to give them a hard no and ban them from attending my graduation, even despite their requests. Instead, I really want to give my graduation tickets to my partner's family who has taken me in all those summers and holidays. ",

My husband had a major surgery last summer and our lives have revolved around working full time and keeping up with his PT and rehab \n\nTowards the end of last summer my mother up and left my dad for some other guy and moved a few states over. My brother (28 yo) also lived with my parents. My mom had been telling them she was paying rent but was actually pocketing the money so my dad and brother were evicted and have been staying in a temporary apartment while supposedly searching for a more permanent set up. \n\nThey’ve been slacking on finding a place to live and haven’t found anything as of yet and today my brother asked if they could come stay with me... moving in today. The house where they’ve been living has been sold and he thought he would have somewhere to go, but he doesn’t. I asked him if he could postpone because it’s my husband’s birthday today (which is extra special because we’re celebrating the fact he gets to even celebrate another birthday) and I need to talk to him about my dad and brother taking residence up with us. \n\nI don’t even want them here because my dad is an alcoholic and hardly works, he also tends to be a miserable prick since my mom left him - he needs to do a lot of shit to get his life together and I tend to be a hardass so I know we’re going to bump heads. My brother and I are pretty close but he has a terrible GF who I don’t want in my house, she also doesn’t work and I don’t want her here during business hours. \n\nThey’re both terrible with money which is part of the reason they’re in this situation so I want to ask them to give me a reasonable portion of money every pay period and half will cover living expenses and the other half will go into savings towards their new living situations. \n\nSorry this is rambling but I’m desperate for advice (and on mobile).

She is speaking with my manager and as I'm walking up to them I hear FC say, she is two days past her due date. I say my hellos, look at her belly and say, enthusiastically, \"wow, you're massive!\" Manager who is an outspoken bitch, says in a sarcastic way, \"wow, underwatercarpet, that was really rude!\" FC makes a face and says \"thanks...\" while laughing a bit. I stammer out, \"I didn't mean it like that!\", to which there was only uncomfortable laughter, so I laugh it off and walk away. FC does not say goodbye when she leaves. Manager comes up to me later and says \"remember that time you called FC fat?\" I honestly asked if that wasn't what you're supposed to say? I mean she does have a human inside her. Manager doesn't say much else and leaves me to ponder. I don't feel like a dick for saying it as I'm sure they understood what I meant, but I do think if my manager hadn't said anything I wouldn't be wondering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground context:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFC and I weren't super close, but seeing as we worked in close proximity, we had a friendly acquaintanceship. She was already 6 months along when she started at the company and was very vocal about being quite visibly and heavily pregnant at 6 months. Now, I'm not the type to play into people fishing for compliments, so I wouldn't say anything when she'd say things like \"can't wait to get skinny again\" or \"none of my clothes fit me anymore\" or \"I feel like a blimp\". Her personality was very lax and nothing bothered her, so her reaction was a bit odd from what I'd seen of her previously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm wondering, am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "I was raised by my stepdad and mom, they had two more kids together. I caught my stepdad cheating when I was 17 with dozens of people, told my mom, they tried to work it out for about 5 years but then split up.  \n\nDespite the fact that he cheated on my mom and has never paid child support, I still have a relationship with him. Until recently I was his power of attorney, I'm treated just like I was his firstborn child. He can be very manipulative and it's gotten worse in recent years, this has put a strain on our relationship but nothing like the strain created when he started dating his now fiancee.  \n\nLet me say that if she were pleasant, I would welcome this new person in my life. But she is not. She is constantly hostile and rude. She seems to not understand why I'm still in my stepdad's life (despite the fact that he started dating my mom when I was 2) and has looked for every possible opportunity to make me out to be the bad guy. She's a jerk to my younger siblings (his kids), but doesn't seem to try to drive them out like she does me. I'm 30 and only visit occasionally, it's not like I'm dependent on them by any means.  \n\nThis all came to a head recently because of yet another situation where I was totally alienated. I basically decided I was done trying.  \n\nHe reached out and said he felt I'd been distant. I kind of just told him everything I'd been thinking. I didn't name call or say anything unforgivable, but basically just said that the way she treats my brothers is terrible but that the way she treats me is substantially worse. He asked if we could discuss it in person and I said that was fine. We haven't spoken since then but I figured we would when he was ready.  \n\nToday I find out from my sibling that our dog is not doing well and might need to be put down. I'm absolutely crushed. They got him when I was in college but outside of my dogs he is my favorite dog on earth. If they have to put him down, they'll do it at their home (her house) and I'd really love to be there to say goodbye and to support my siblings. However I don't know if I'd be a huge asshole for showing up or asking if I can. I feel like I might be an equally big asshole for not showing up (\"you couldn't put that aside even for the dog?!\") so if I have to risk one I'd rather pick the one that lets me say goodbye to my best little buddy.  \n\nDo I wait and see if I’m invited? If I am, which is the the asshole move, attending or not attending? ",

      "description": "I’m 19, work three minimum wage jobs and attend college full time while maintaining good grades. My mom and I have never fully gotten along but lately it’s gotten so much worse. She’s one of those people who always has to have it worse than you and is always right. My dad just puts up with it to keep the peace and I did for a long time too until recently. I started going to therapy for my depression and my therapist said that when she starts to cause problems I should not be afraid to stick up for myself. I have a problem with letting people walk all over me and my therapist knows this.\n\nDespite all that I know my mom loves me but sometimes I think she does things just to keep me on a leash. I pay my own car bill but that’s it. My parents handle the insurance and my phone bill. I’ve offered to at least pick up my phone bill since it’s only about $30 a month and I’m trying to get my credit score up either way but she always says no and turns it into a fight about how I’m ungrateful and such.\n\n\nI’m not exactly a neat person. When I’m in a better mental state my bedroom tends to be neat but when I’m feeling depressed it kinda goes to shit. I’ve tried to keep it clean but my motivation to do so always just kinda vanishes after awhile. My parents HATE this. They will undermine everything I’ve ever accomplished if my room isn’t clean. For example, I just got a part time job teaching private voice and piano, something that is very difficult to do without a degree of some kind. I told my parents and they didn’t care at all because my laundry wasn’t done. They’ll also take any fight my mom and I have and spin it back on me because my room isn’t clean, even if it has nothing to do with that. For example, my mom one time saw me wearing a bikini, poked my stomach and said \n\n“Mmmm Pasta?”\n\nMind you I’m very self conscious about my weight and struggled with bulimia for awhile. I stormed out of the house and went crying to the beach only to get a text ten minutes later “Well maybe if your room was clean...”\n\nWell the other day I was fighting with my mom (again) because I said I was looking into apartments. I had told her I want to move in with a friend because I think not living together would help our relationship more and give me the space I need. She started crying and screaming about how I was “so ungrateful” and “not ready for the real world.” \n\nI’d had enough and that point and told her I wanted out because she has no idea how to treat anyone with any sort of respect, let alone her own daughter. I essentially just went off and she went to work crying. \n\nI feel bad, I do love her and all, but I’m so sick and tired of all the bs. I know I should keep my room clean but when I tried to explain why I don’t with all my mental health problems I was just called a “snowflake millennial” and told my disorders were fake. Meanwhile my mom sits there and preaches that she has BPD when she’s yet to be diagnosed.\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "So context is a bit important here. My toddler accidently knocked over a glass mug in the living room with his blanket and it shattered with tiny bits of glass everywhere. I quickly grabbed my toddler and started removing small bits of glass from his foot and comforting him as my gf started cleaning the mess. She picks up the blanket that was sitting in the glass and starts shaking it over the couch. I immediately said, \"What are you doing? You're going to get glass all over the couch!\" I didn't scream or yell, but I probably didn't say it very kindly due to the urgency of the situation. She believes she was doing nothing wrong and that I'm being an asshole. She thinks I should apologize. I told her that she was creating a dangerous situation by shaking glass on the couch and I'm not going to apologize for my reaction. Am I the asshole? I think my reaction was justified.",

      "description": "Pretty low stakes question but tbh, I'm asking because I'm well aware that my decision making skills are being coloured right now over some heart-break I'm going through.\n\nIn dealing with said heartbreak I've been using games in my down-time as time fillers to keep me from thinking etc. I've recently gotten into a game called \"Coin Master\" with mostly current and former colleagues. It is an interactive game where you spon a roulette to win 'money' to win money to build items to complete a village before you can move on to a next one. More integral to my issue is that you can roll for options to either steal money from friends or attack their villages. You in counterpoint can spin for shields to protect your village but if your shields are all broken your items' levels are lowered resetting progress.\n\nNow recently it seems like a former coworker is using this feature to target me. Twice now she's attacked me 5+ times consecutively basically resetting me to zero for the level. I was amused but perturbed the first time, really annoyed the second but I'm pissed off now because I just logged on and for the day she has attacked me over 20 times. Now yes for every successful attack she lands she earns quadruple plus money which is probably why she's using this strategy but it's so annoying and actually making me angry, probably irrationally so because my personal life is in the shits right now and I'm just trying to use this game as mindless entertainment/a distraction. \n\nI just sent her a message (it is 2 am here and my insomnia is in full swing so I had logged on to kill some time only to notice my village absolutely destroyed) and I sent her a message basically telling her to stop or I will delete her off Facebook because that is the only way to unlink her from my game.\n\nWe havent talked in years but I remember liking her enough that i enjoy getting the occasional life update from her on my feed the few times I actually log in but right now I just want to delete/block/the whole shebang but AITA for messaging her out of the blue with that and WIBTA to follow through?\n\nTl;dr: Former coworker I dont talk to anymore is ruining a game for me that I'm using as a distraction from personal life issues. AITA for giving her a one strike warning to stop or else I'll delete her off social media entirely to unlink her from my game?",

She we diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder about 10 years ago, after the birth of our child.\n\nShe hears voices and has mood disorders that prevent functioning beyond occasionally doing some light housework. There has been a decrease in mental function over time that makes any kind of enjoyable conversation basically impossible. Her memory and decision making abilities are suspect at best. She is not aware of the severity of this problem.  \n\nShe has not worked since her pregnancy and I have worked very hard to make enough money, raise our child, and help her have a good relationship with our child despite her issues.  \n\nShe is compliant with her medication and says she wants to help and do more but usually is too depressed to do much. When she is manic it is almost always counterproductive.  She has been in therapy and has been on many medications. It's hard for me to separate her patterns of actions and behavior from what her illnesses inflict.\n\nThis is not easy and has taken a toll on me emotionally over a long time. I am perpetually exhausted and lonely. I'm trying to figure out a way to not be married to her and not destroy her life in the process. I don't feel like I can do it forever.\n\nHer parents think this is her (our) problem and are not helpful. We have friends but over the years have become more isolated due to her condition. I'm kind of all she's got. \n\nThanks for any thoughts or ideas.\n\n",

Now I have absolutely nothing against FB and I would consider him one of my closest friends and FA feels the same way, we just don’t think he’d really enjoy it as he’s never listened to any of the bands songs, doesn’t like their music, and would hate the overall experience. I’m talking crowded places and mosh pits. I’ve known FB for years and he’s told me before how he doesn’t like that stuff. He would feel really awkward, we’d feel really awkward and probably miss out on doing mosh pits and stuff cos we can’t abandon him. We haven’t said a thing to him and don’t know how to go about letting him down. We see him real often and FA sees him for 3 hours every day at college.

      "description": " I (26/M) broke up with my girlfriend (24/F) in mid-November after 18 months of dating. \n\nIn mid-December she calls me to tell me she is pregnant and deciding to keep the child, even though we were both using birth control (she was on the pill and I was using condoms) and I told her I never want kids because it is not compatible with the career I want (I am a second year lawyer and eventually want to become a diplomat). \n\nI am not in the mood for it but I make the 6 hour (each way) drive out to her hometown to talk to her. \n\nShe tells me that she just can’t get an abortion and tells me that now we are going to be a family and that we need to get back together, that I need to cancel my trip to Colombia/Ecuador/Peru in May with my brother, and I need to move out here and raise the baby with her and her brother can get me a job selling cars at the dealership where he works.\n\nNo fucking way. \n\nI told her she can expect to receive whatever the legal required amount of child support is, but I am not getting back together with her. There is a reason I broke up with her – because I realised I was with her out of “habit” instead of love, that she was a little too into the money I was making as a lawyer, and I simply did not want to be in a relationship with her anymore. A baby doesn’t change that.  \n\nI tell her I am not moving out there. My family and friends live here in the capital and I don’t want to move from them, and her home town is in our country’s version of the Deep South and somewhere I don’t want to live, and there is no possibility for any kind of career and advancement there. I told her I am not going to be the father who gives her every Wednesday and every second weekend and school vacation periods “off”. I don’t want to play Daddy and Mommy with her.   \n\nI told her I am still going to South America because the trip is already paid for and I am not going to get anything back from cancelling it, except maybe half the airfares. And I *WANT* to fucking go. Why do I have to give that up because of her decision to have a baby? And child support is going to be a big financial burden to my life now that will affect my ability to travel in the future.  She is angry about that because “I will never travel”, and I said “that is on you for choosing to keep the baby”. \n\nReddit, I broke up with her for a reason. I made it clear I never wanted to play Mommy and Daddy with anyone. I will reluctantly meet my legal obligations in terms of child support but nothing more. \n\nFor the last month she has been telling anyone who will listen what an asshole and a deadbeat I am and it is really starting to annoy me. I am not a deadbeat because I don’t want to play house with you. Deadbeats are people who don’t pay child support. \n\nAMITA?  ",

      "description": "Some background info:\n\nMy house has a couple of bedrooms with one vent. Mine has two. It means I get extra/too-much heat and A/C at times. \n\nThe situation:\n\nMy dad walked in a few days ago and told me that I should cover one of my vents, because I had the window open for an hour to air out my room (nasty smell, probably from a shower and humidity) and he thought I was doing it because I was hot. I explicitly told him no, I won't do that. It's a bad idea (even if you don't include the fire risk) to cover it with cardboard, because it causes a reverse flow and damages the system in the long run by forcing it to work harder, and it would still result in the same amount of heat being redirected to one vent (best case scenario two-three of other rooms, but not with the way our house is laid out). I've called numerous AC/Heater repairmen, and asked them about this, because I wanted to do it way back. Almost every single one of them told me it was a bad idea. That, added with the bonus of me looking it up myself, dissuaded me from that idea. \n\nI came home the other day, and saw that, in fact, my dad had ignored my wishes, which was normal at this point in time, and did it anyway. I do live with him, and I am aware that he owns the house. That being said, I would assume that any rational human being would want to avoid being roasted alive by their own A/C system, so I took it down and reverted to my previous solution: just wearing more or less clothes based on how hot/cold I am when I go to sleep. Walking around in shorts and a T-shirt isn't bad at all, either. \n\nHe walked in today and exploded at me, for defying his authority and taking down a piece of cardboard held up by masking tape. I told him I slept in that room and I should have some opinion, but he said it was his house. I told him I would just sleep on the couch and he told me I could sleep on the street for all he cares. He then went and got a ladder and put it back up, telling me that I would see what would happen if I took it down again.\n\nEveryone on his side of the family (grandparents) agree with him, think that I shouldn't \"defy my father\" and call me a problem child for even arguing with him at all. They basically told me that if I didn't like what my dad was doing, I could move out with no support from anyone. My sisters think the man is crazy. I personally want to move out soon, but not before actually being able to.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This occurred on the fourth floor of my campus library. For reference, the first floor is classrooms, second floor is a talk friendly study place, third floor is a quiet study place, and fourth floor is the computer lab.\n\nIt is my understanding that there is an unspoken rule that unless you are working on a group project and need to talk with others to get your work done, the computer lab is also meant to be a quiet floor.\n\nI had been at my computer for a while doing some required reading when another student walks in playing music on his headphones loud enough that I could hear him from across the room (maybe 50 feet away). He sits down and proceeds to look at his phone, not logging in to the computer and not turning the volume down for maybe 5 minutes. At that point I got up, walked over to him, tapped him on the shoulder, and said “hey man, can you turn your music down? It’s hard for me to focus”. He looks at me without saying anything, and after a moment he turns his music down and I go back to my seat.\n\nFast forward 30 minutes or so he walks up to me and asks if I worked at the library. I told him I didn’t, and he responded “why did you ask me to turn my music down”. Being socially anxious, I nervously said something along the lines of I’m sorry if I offended you but it was really distracting. He kinda shook his head in disbelief and then walked out of the lab. AITA?\n\nSome more information that I didn’t know where to put in. \n - There were maybe four other people in the lab at the time including one campus employed student who was there to help with IT problems. Non of them said anything or seemed to notice any of this take place (as in it didn’t distract them).\n - The headphones he was using looked like the old generic apple headphones, which if anyone has used them knows that they become miniature speakers past half volume. His music wasn’t loud, but it was noticeable enough that I could hear the baseline and a bit of the melody.\n - I had headphones visibly on me (phone in pocket, headphones going through the shirt out of the neck) but I was not wearing them because my own music was distracting me from the reading.\n - There are some computers on the second floor, but they can’t be used to access canvas, a site many teachers use to post assignments and grades.",

Her thing with her new boy grows more serious and my feelings of jealousy and resentment grow. I realize maintaining any relationship with her is causing me more pain than happiness and tell her that I need a clean break.\n\nShe doesn't take the news very well and says she loves me and needs me in her life as her best friend. In turn, I reply that I don't know how to be \"just friends\" with her and she's only been causing me pain lately. The fight escalates until I decide to go cold turkey and stop responding. \n\nIt's been a week and since then she's sent me messages about how she loves me and values me as one of her best friends, and also messages about how I'm being selfish and can't make this decision for both of us. I haven't responded, but I feel like crap.\n\nNote: according to another friend of mine, she's using me for validation and attention although I don't think she's malicious like that.",

      "description": "I'm now 37 weeks and close to labor. I'm 24, 23 when I got pregnant. I'm very conflicted at the moment but the choice has already been made, and we will be raising this child. I just want to know if I did the right thing. Here's the back story: \n\n\n\nSome months before I got pregnant I got a call from the hospital after a routine PAP smear test. They found cancer cells and I was to visit them ASAP. This is all after a year of remission from my breast cancer. They told me I had to quit the birth control pill because the hormones could be influencing my cervix. I quit that day and had planned to get a coil in after my second period. \n\n\nA week later I got my first period. But the second period never came. I went to my GP and said \"doctor, I'm now 1 month over time for my period and I'm worried\". He said \"don't worry, it can take up to 6 months for your period to regulate again\". So I had no worries. He didn't recommend a pregnancy test. \n\n\nTwo months after this my SO tells me I'm getting fat and to get a test. Test comes back positive. I immediately call my GP. He tells me to come in for an ultrasound. He puts the apparatus on my belly and starts laughing, like full on laugh. He turns the screen my way and there on the screen I see my daughter for the first time. Her head, back, rib cage, legs, all are formed. This is no just conceived embryo. He tells me I'm at least 3 to 4 months in. So abortion is still possible but I must make the decision very quickly. I decide to keep it after discussing with SO.\n\n\nI'm very pro-choice, and if I was maybe 1 month a long instead of 3 the possibility of me aborting it would be 90%. But it was a person in my mind. \n\n\nOur situation is also not great for raising a child. Here's a list: \n\n\n- My SO is 21 years old (20 when I got pregnant), and still in college. He won't be done with school for another 4 years. \n\n- My SO is in huge debt because of parking/insurance tickets and all his finances go towards that (which is good, I want him to be debt free, but it needs to be considered).\n\n- We do not own a house or rent a place, we live with my father (who now also has to deal with this new born, he's 65 and recently retired). My father agreed to give us the upper floor of the house (3 large bed rooms) to create a nursery, a bedroom and a study room. \n\n- My income solely goes towards renovation of these rooms, the baby things we need and whatever is left is for our food and other expenses. I also save 10% and another 5% for little one when she's 18. My net income a month is between €2200 and €3000. \n\n- I'm currently on maternity leave but before this I was working as a consultant. I lost the project I was on because of maternity leave. My boss is looking for a new project for me to start after maternity leave. But it could mean we have to live on 70% of my income if he can't find anything in time. \n\n\n\n\nSo with all these points in mind am I the asshole for keeping her and wanting to raise her?",

I basically went through the motions until I moved out of the parents place at 18. I am 25 now and coming up on what will be my 3rd year of skipping the Christmas Mass. The first year was uneventful since I used an excuse. Last year though, it sparked all kinds of family drama including my sister calling me to tell me my mother was crying about me missing Christmas mass. I've heard rumblings of them talking about me saying it's just a phase, which I think is a bit condescending. I understand their POV, since they have been taught if you don't beleive in the \"One true God\" that you burn for eternity, which can be rough to think about for a loved one. All that said, Catholic mass bothers the hell out of me and I would only sit quietly stewing disdainful thoughts for an hour. When I'm there I feel like I'm lying to myself and everyone around me.\n\nAITA for not just going through the motions to make my family happier?",

To make a long story short, she told me there was a guy that found me cute and wanted to talk to me on snapchat. After a couple of days i came to the realization it was just her as she had tried to create fake texts as evidence (the name was the same but the bitmoji was very different and so was the snapchat username), the guy was always too busy to meet, they had the exact same voice and me and the guy shared many many similarities that are highly unlikely (both do ballet, both watch exactly the same shows, both have diabetes type 1, etc) the evidence kept stacking up but the nail in the coffin was her going onto the account and accidently messaging a friend saying \"hey. oops im logged in on the wrong account\" from the account that was talking to me. I tried to confront her but she would leave for hours at a time and come up with excuses like \"my phone fell into the toilet (she was texting me on snapchat???)\" and would come up with another lie. I told all my friends about this out of fustration at a. betrayal of trust (I didnt share anything especially sensitive but if it had kept going i dont know how much i would've said), b. raising my hopes unnecessarily and c. lying to me. One of my friends asked her why she did it and she messaged me a long tirade telling me i didnt need to take vengeance for it, etc. In general she's now trying to victimize herself and telling me that it's only between me and her and that I had no right to tell other peopke . Am i the asshole for telling my friends that she catfished me (i also told them because they'd seen my texts with the \"guy\" before i realised it was a catfish so I also kinda felt the need to clear that up) ",

I acted like an idiot because I had a hard time moving on, she said some pretty awful shit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash-forward two weeks ago: we start talking again. To my surprise she’s being nice. She said that she regrets the things she said (hoping that I’d die, not caring about me, regretting our time together). She wants to work things out together this time. She says that she still cares and has a soft-spot for me. For around 1.5 week we talked like nothing happened and to my surprise, we really had a good time catching up. I wasn’t expecting us to become friends again, but I did expect us to end things in a normal way this time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast thursday, out of nowhere, she texts me that “after tomorrow, I want to break contact and never speak to eachother again.” and she immediately deleted me on all social media. I really didn’t see that one coming and  didn't understand any of it. When I asked for an explanation, she wouldn’t give me one. She expected me to promise to never speak to her again, I said I couldn’t make such a promise so she called me ‘a fucking weak person’, we ended up having a discussion about how things were going and we haven’t talked since last saturday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for expecting an explanation, for not making such a promise and for not directly listening to her when she said that she wants to break all contact again?

      "description": "I'm 16, my parents are divorced, and I have a license and a car. How our holidays work is we switch off every year, but my dad doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving (on the grounds that he hates most of the food, but we still sorta get together with my grandmother) so I spend every Thanksgiving with my mother.\n\nI've been a vegetarian for a majority of my life, mainly because I hate meat and so I cut it out of my diet completely. It's been about 10 years since I've eaten anything with meat in it on purpose. This is relevant to the story because I don't feel like my dietary preferences are respected during Thanksgiving. Almost everything has meat in it. I'm left with mashed potatoes and bread, and I really don't like the texture of mashed potatoes either so I'm stuck with bread. I've tried to discuss with my mother, but she doesn't really respect my diet either, and her family thinks it's just a phase. On top of that, her family is extremely Catholic. That alone doesn't bother me, but I'm gay, and they're very homophobic. They don't know I'm gay yet, but it still gets really uncomfortable.\n\nMy friend Logan, who is vegan invited me to his house for Thanksgiving. His family likes me and they are respectful of his veganism, so there's a lot of vegen food there. There's fake meat (which I don't like either) but they also just have normal food that happens not to contain meat or meat substitutes. Naturally, this was appealing and I told my mom that I'd prefer to go to Logan's house for Thanksgiving because I feel my diet is better respected there.\n\nShe told me the usual, that I was a kid and not supposed to make those kinds of choices, that there is still food I can eat (but as mentioned before, she means mashed potatos and bread), and that I should cherish and spend time with my family. I want to enjoy Thanksgiving, but I just don't feel like I'm respected or being listened to at all. She wanted to make me go with, but I just drove to Logan's house anyways. The food was great, and I felt genuinely welcomed. His family didn't really mind that I was there.\n\nIm currently typing this from my dad's house, as I ended up feeling guilty and didn't want to face my mother again. I know I shouldn't have just left, but I just felt really frustrated.\n\nI just want to know if I'm the asshole. Should I have just listened to my mother and dealt with it for another year? Or were my actions reasonable?",

      "description": "So I just discovered this subreddit and thought I would ask this question because its one that I have been wondering about and my family isn't really objective because they will simply take my side. I had this friend in high school that I would constantly go to parties with and play video games with and we had a similar sense of humour but I really didn't like him for a number of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He would always need money. He would want me to buy him food, he would need me to buy him cigarettes (I hate smoking so this really pissed me off) and he would also want me to give him money so he could buy weed. It got to the point where he owed me at least 200 dollars. Remember, this is high school, money is scarce and every amount of it I had, my parents are asking what I did with it. It pissed me off that I would be decent enough to give him some of the money my parents would allow me to have to spend on things I wanted and he would never pay me back and joke about how he never would like it wasn't a serious issue for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He would take advantages of privileges my parents would afford me and ruin them. An example is that my dad would let me use his car every so often but it cam under the condition that I treat the car with respect and this friend would constantly insist on smoking cigarettes in the car and would light up without asking first. I got in trouble multiple times because of this and had car privileges revoked. He would also say we should just smoke weed in the car and then drive back to one of our places like driving under the influence wasn't a big deal. What if a bunch of intoxicated 16-17 year olds get pulled over by the police while high out of our minds. My license would get taken away and he didn't seem to care. Just do it! Whats the big deal??? And he would act like I was being a bitch about these things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He wanted to smoke weed every day. I am someone who has a bit of an addiction problem with weed. If I smoke it every day, my grades tank, I start putting on serious amounts of fat, and generally become a less functioning person but he insists on smoking it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically what I did was continue the friendship until graduation and then when I didn't need to see him again, I cut all contact and never spoke to him again. He would continue texting me for a few weeks after that wondering what was going on but I didn't respond. I just ghosted him hard and I feel bad about it sometimes. But I've barely smoked week since and lost 40 pounds and put on a bit of muscle. My grades in University were actually similar to those in high school which is unheard of. I'm just a better person and many of the goals in my life couldn't be achieved while catering to the type of lifestyle he insisted on if we were to continue hanging out. I don't really have any friends from high school though because they decided to stick with him rather than me. My relationships with my parents has improved drastically though and I've made better friends since. Maybe I should have handled breaking off the friendship differently. I don't know. I do know that he was not good for me. Am I the ass hole?",

      "description": "TLDR at bottom. I used to work at both Pizza Hut and Papa John's and can barely stomach their food anymore, so whenever I get pizza delivery it's Domino's 99% of the time. When I order, I always order several of the extra cups or sauce. I don't expect it for free, I'll gladly pay for it if I can get the dinner i want. I use a lot of sauce on my food and also keep extras in the cabinet for home cooking and when they forget my sauce. I'm not gonna be an asshole and make them drive back to the store and back to me all for 1 garlic sauce for no extra tip, but after a while I get tired or having my order wrong.\n\nThe problem is, over 50% of the time they miss one or more of the extra sauces I paid for. Even after I ask the delivery person if they got all the sauces, they will still be missing or wrong. It got the point to where I've called the store and talked to the manager, he assures me it won't happen again and it does. So I started telling the drivers the next time they forget my sauce they won't be getting a tip. Now I used to be a driver too, so I know sometimes you forget things or the person on cut table didn't put the sauce in the box like they said they did. So I started putting in the driver instructions that I won't tip them if they forget my sauce. Nothing else I say or do seems to help. So last night, it happened. I ordered 11 extra sauces. I ask the driver when he gets there if he got all my sauce, he hands me a bag. Normally that's where I tip them but after getting it wrong so many times, I have to check. So I open it and check them, not only is the total count short by 2, missing 1 of the marinara cups and the only cup of icing for the dessert, all 4 cups that were supposed to be mango habanero were instead ranch that I ordered zero of. So out of 11 sauces I ordered and paid for, I only got 5 of them correct. \n\nBeing an ex driver myself, I didn't want it to come to this. But it had gone too far. I handed him back the ranch that I didn't order and told him I won't be tipping because the sauces were wrong yet again and that next time if they wanted a tip, my order should be correct.\n\nTLDR. I always order and pay for extra sauce with pizza, they have gotten my order wrong so many times I won't tip anymore if even 1 item is wrong or missing. Am I The Asshole?\n",

We have tons of things in common and we’re inseparable. I was never opposed to having more friends but that never really happened. Her and I message each other after school (not constantly) but we don’t really bring it up in real life.\n\nOnto the rest of it. Recently someone else just kind of forced their way into our friendship. It’s not that I dislike them for that, but their overall vibe and personality is what makes me dislike them. Sometimes it’s fine, the day goes on nicely, no problem. Other times not so much. We don’t argue or fight but I still get put off by everything.\n\nI’ve dealt with it so far and I won’t have to see her again at the end of the year, so it’s cool, I’ll just put up with it and then it’ll all be over.\n\nUntil recently she started bugging me for a phone number to message me when we’re not together in real life. I usually joke about it a bit and it naturally moves into another topic, but I know I can’t avoid it forever. I honestly can’t tell if I’m the A-hole here or not. So, tell me, Reddit.

      "description": "Growing up, my parents always took care of me, materially. I had a safe home, well fed, toys I wanted, etc. But they have always been emotionally distant, my dad especially. I know he had a tough childhood and his father was abusive. He worked a well paying but extremely physically demanding job, and even as a kid I understood that and realized that was why he didn’t really spend ~~much~~ any of his time off with me. I’ve always been a little closer with my mom. I could at least confide in her some and and we spent some time together doing things here and there. But we never could talk about anything too deep. She gets offended so easily. I always felt they have never really been all that interested in what I’m doing or what I’m in to. They were always like, do whatever you want, just don’t get into trouble. \n\nI always longed for some kind of approval from them. I excelled in school, won awards for my art, I now own my own business, nothing seems to interest or impress them. They are super religious and I am not, btw. Their religion is the most important thing in their lives.\n\nAfter I moved out, and for many years, I would always go visit them about weekly, but for the past couple years, I have just stopped. Except for birthdays and holidays, I don’t visit anymore. I just don’t want to. It feels like work. We have nothing in common. Talk is so superficial, and short, and they just turn back to the tv after a few minutes of visiting. I just feel like a lonely kid again and I always leave kinda bummed. I don’t even call anymore. They never call or visit me either. (They never did, it was always expected that I would call/visit them.)\n\nI honestly feel happier now, with this distance.\n\nStill, I feel a little guilty. Do I expect too much from them? Am I an entitled snowflake? My mom has asked a few times why I don’t come by anymore, and I just say I’m too busy. I don’t know how to tell her how I really feel. She has said I need to visit, to show respect, for they raised me, and they love me and want to see me, but I just don’t feel it. So, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "So I’ve had this friend for many years but we’ve never met in person. Earlier this year, my boyfriend and I decided to move out of state (finally gonna have our own place!). Although we talked theoretically about visiting, my friend and I never actually made any plans. Then, out of the blue, she sent me screenshots of tickets out to my city! \nTurns out, she was planning on staying for a whole entire week. However, she didn’t consult me on this at all and already told her parents that she’d be staying with me (I live with my big family, it’s really difficult to accommodate somebody since there’s already so many of us). So here I am, already trying to plan an out of state move, and now I have to entertain her. She insists on certain experiences that I just CAN’T afford right now (and I told her that). On top of that, after going out and spending money on one of those said experiences (in which my new meds fucked me up and I felt sick but she wanted to keep adventuring), I was absolutely exhausted and wanted nothing more that to relax in my own bed and play my own games. But when I said this, she flat out told me that I COULDN’T play because she was going to play instead. Also, I went out for a bit to gather some stuff from storage and she went through all the stuff in my room and decided what of my stuff to keep and what to toss/give away (I did not ask her to do this). She even tossed some of my tax documents. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy I got to meet her and we did have fun times, but this is also seriously stressing me out because I really wanted to spend this time organizing, packing, and spending time with my family. I had no idea she’d be coming until it was too late. So here I am, trying to decompress so I can talk to her about it. But AITA for being a bit frustrated about all this? \nTLDR; an internet friend came to visit without consulting me but I’m short on money and in the middle of trying to move. She insists on expensive, time consuming tourist experiences while I just want to spend time saying goodbye to my family and friends. She doesn’t respect my personal space.

Anyways, my father passed away since I was 17 and since then, my mother signed me off as independent and took me off her health insurance. She told me everything last minute. \nShe hasn’t exactly been there for me growing up either. When I turned 18, she told me to live on my own and she will find a place for just her and my brother. Growing up since then, I’ve been on my own financially. She’s barely helped me grow up into the person I am, asked me for money all the time and she’s never helped me get my license. I used to ask her to help me practice to get my license and she’d say no. I also asked for help financially on driving classes but she refused to help. Since then, I accomplished everything else on my own. I used to be jealous of people my age back then who would graduate earlier than I did. Couldn’t really afford school because I couldn’t afford to be in debt. \n\nBefore moving into a different house, she asked me for my SSN so I can become head of the household and take care of the bills. Mind you, I was 18 at the time and wouldn’t be able to afford anything, and I’m sure my credit score will be ruined. But she would cover it up saying that it won’t affect me if the house is under my name. Later I found out she asked me for my SSN because she filed for bankruptcy. Of course at the time I said no because I did my research on what could happen if the house was put under my name. \n\nA couple of days ago, she texted me for my SSN. I asked her for what reason. She said “I don’t need a reason just need your SSN” and I said “Nope, I need a reason for this. “ we haven’t talked since. Am I the asshole? \n\nSince I moved, we also barely talked. ",

      "description": "Ok so this happened several months ago. To preface, I was not having a good day. A bunch of things had gone wrong that day and I was running fairly late for an appointment with my therapist. I was not in a good mood. \n\nI was riding on the  subway when two guys walk into my train car. One of them seemed fine but the other was holding a bottle of vodka and couldn't stand up straight. It was pretty obvious this guy was very drunk. He became annoying very quickly as he started ranting about nonsense to his friend. Although he hasn't harassing anyone he was just generally being rude and annoying and combined with all the other shit that had gone down that day, I was pissed off. I took my phone out and I wrote a message in one of my discord groups complaining about my situation. \n\nI then somewhat jokingly wrote in reference to the drunk guy \"what a degenerate\". Now I know that the word degenerate can have some rough connotations, so I just wanted to clarify that I didn't mean it in the way a nazi would use it, more of like the live in your mom's basement, NEET, piss in jars, sort of degeneracy. Anyways my friend in the discord chat basically called me out and said I was being unnecessarily cruel and an asshole. I was more surprised than anything because this is a guy is someone who usually doesn't care about what you say; you could spout every racial slur and swear word in the book and he wouldn't care. I pointed this out and said he was being hypocritical, because he had made fun of me for getting offended by language in the past. He argued that this was different because I was specifically targeting an individual. \n\nIn the end I apologized and he expressed sympathy as well. The drunk guy got off the train a few stops later, and everything was put behind us. However I keep remembering this incident for some reason and I just wanted to see if others agreed with my friend?",

I, still in the playful mindset, did the door lock thing ( lock the door when they touch the handle) so the older one (11) of them decided they'll walk. I thought they were joking but watched them walk. I drove up to them and let them play the handle again, they walked away laughing. I drove again and got out the car, I was kind of done by then because I start feeling sick. I asked if they were going to get in and they said no and walked off again. They had cross a busy street to get to the other side to the neighborhood, I doubted the younger one(8) could do it but couldn't do much about it. I tried parking near the light but couldn't so parked at the elementary school further away. My mom drove pass and I told her they were walking and she blew up on me saying that I wanted people to go to jail.  Let me note that even kindergartners walk home because are neighborhood has two elementary schools and a middle school. She drove to pick them and I drove behind her, she got them and did the whole pointy angry finger thing. When I got home she acted like nothing happen but later I heard she plans to take the car away so I have to find a way to get to uni after spring break.\n\nThe story the kids are telling everyone is that I refused to drive them and they were forced to walk home which isnt possible considering they were laughing and joking the whole time. My mom doesn't want to hear my side and now i'm stuck. ",

      "description": "So my tablet broke for absolutely no reason. Just stopped turning on. I only got it in 2017. It doesn't charge anymore. It's essentially one big brick. My parents said it was my fault and they won't get me a new one until my birthday in October. Like hell I'm waiting till then just to get a replacement. I told them to bring over half of my PS4 games to CeX (it's a place where you can sell games). I couldn't go myself because you have to be 18 to sell stuff there. Anyways I wanted to get an iPad Mini 2. It's not that great but I just needed a tablet replacement. My tablet was the key thing I used to study and had all my notes. The iPad Mini 2 was about 150 on eBay. Anyways my parents sold the games and I got more than 150. Happy days. They told me they would put the money in my account and I bought the iPad in the morning. The iPad has been shipped and I should he getting it tomorrow\n\nBut the thing is when I got home for school they told me they used the money for insurance and they would put the money in my account next month. I was shocked. I don't even know how I was able to buy the iPad without the money in my account but I just checked my account and know it says direct debit unpaid of 150. I think I have debt in my account now and I told them and they said it was my fault for buying it. How is it my fault? I sold my games to replace it and they used the money for it and now there is a debt on my account",

      "description": "Hi everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently got called out on my private instagram account for trying to harm other seniors at my school by posting my college results. I created the account around late February as a way of helping me remember the last few months of my high school career. I intended to post only my life updates, and it just so happens that college decisions happen to be a part of my high school career.  \n\n\nEarlier this week, I was accepted to my dream school, like the one I was longing to go to ever since I was 5. I shared my excitement in a post. Most of my friends were super happy for me, which is what a normal person would expect. However, there's one person who basically says that my posts serve only berate other students and essentially pour salt on people's wounds. I explained to them that what I'm doing isn't any different than sharing with your friends in person where you got in / where you're going to go. I also told them that if I wanted to cause damage to others, I would have just posted in on my main account. I just want to know, AITA for posting my college decisions on my private account, an account where people that are close to me choose to follow?",

      "description": "I’m genuinely unsure if ITA in this situation. Hubby and I have been planning a trip to the US and Canada. The plan we had been talking about for the past year is that we would travel in the US for 5 weeks and then I would go home while he travels Canada for 3 weeks alone.\n\nWell he’s been doing so itinerary work and showed it to me yesterday and asked for my expectations of how many days we would be in LA. I said ‘my understanding from what we discussed previously was that you wanted a relaxed holiday, but what you have here is really full on’. That upset him a lot, he yelled at me and said I was just criticising all his hard work without letting him take me through it, and that i have no empathy for him.\n\nToday we were talking about it again and he said ‘I’ve compromised so much on this trip for you. If it were up to me we wouldn’t even bother doing the US. Because of this, I now can only be in Canada for a week.’ Well this was news to me because he had never said that, I had no idea! I told him he never mentioned that and that he really should go to Canada because he’s been wanting to go since he was 15 and it was important to him so important to me, I don’t want him doing the trip to the US for me if it means he misses out on something. And he blew up at me, he said ‘no I want to do this, I just want you to recognise how I’m giving up and compromising so much to do this with you.’ \n\nI feel like I’m being a wretched person for not being more thankful my husband wants to spend time with me, as I would have thought that’s a given if he’s choosing to do it? If not he can absolutely go to Canada if he feels like he’s giving up so much. AITA?",

      "description": "Well, \"losing it\" might be a bit harsh on myself, but I'm feeling a bit torn on this.\n\nI have a friend who has been involved with a cult that has been stalking him in the US. He fled to Mexico to pick himself up and I've been sending long messages of encouragement, suggesting books and ways to get him back on recovery for about 2 months now, since he's been saying he's felt suicidal. He's broke, so I sent him £150 to look after himself, even though I've been out of work for over 6 months and not exactly in a great place myself.\n\nHe was doing well until the cult started sending him messages again, and he said he's feeling suicidal again and hasn't tried cutting off contact with people hard enough so they don't reach him. He said he's going to cut contact off with me as well as a result, and if I want my money back, I just have to let him know. \n\nTo me this felt like a dick move, as I felt he's putting the decision on me to take the money back and leave him worse off, and to cut off contact with me just seemed ridiculous, as he's saying I'm the only person to pull through for him. I just can't grasp how that, and the loaning money (which I'd never see back again anyway, I knew) means cutting me off would be good for either of us.\n\nI get he's in a dark and paranoid place, but still. \n\nI sent him a reply saying he's going to sleep on it and feel like a dumbass for that message. He read it and didn't reply, so I asked him if he'd given up on the amateur dramatics. \n\nHe's now blocked me and kept the money. I never expected it back, and either way I want him to have it because he clearly needs it... But I don't know if I'm a dick for the messages I sent and not being a bit more understanding (I kind of exhausted myself on listening to him complain up until he decided to cut me off) or if he's just being really dishonorable here?\n\nI was suicidal 2 years ago and nobody was there for me, so I decided I'd try and be there for somebody else, but I never foresaw someone making it so hard.\n\nAm I the dickhead here? I even feel bad for thinking if someone is going to do something like that, they shouldn't put the pressure on the other person to decide what to do with the money, and if you're going to block and cut someone off like that, you shouldn't run off with their cash?\n\nI'm really confused whether I'm the asshole here? I think I am because of my expectations I might be projecting on him? ",

They are always kissing and touching and being cute but its ALL THE TIME. I know its not technically PDA bc its in our apt. but I feel like I'm third wheeling where I live. They only spend time with each other and the people they live with including me. They are so sucked into each other constantly that sometimes I'll be saying something but they ignore it bc they're whispering in their baby voices to each other.

      "description": "This girl from my high school (we’ll call her N) has been consistently posting pictures of art she says is hers for several years now. N also frequently posts about her “animation internship with Disney” and how awesome it is, We have a lot of mutual contacts, including old mentors, teachers, friends... and they all post supportive comments quite frequently. \n\nA couple years ago, I did a little digging and reverse image searched her stuff and found that almost all of it was not original. She just blatantly ripped it off the web.  When I discovered this, I made a burner account and messaged her my proof and told her to stop lying to everyone. I stopped short of threatening her but I told her the truth may come out eventually if she keeps this up. \n\nN proceeded to block the account and post that someone has been stealing HER work and she is looking into legal options. After this, I just dropped it and left it alone. \n\nFast-forward to now, N’s online following has grown and her followers really eat up her success, her art, and her (obviously) fake stories that tug on people’s emotions. She still continues to post plagiarized work but she’s gotten better at hiding it but I just found more proof on recent stuff she has shared. \n\nI am tempted to message the respected people in our circle and “expose” her because it’s not right that they are being manipulated and lied to. I work in the creative industry and it really grinds my gears to see people blatantly do this. \n\nAt the same time, she is clearly obsessed and/or delusional and I’m wondering if I should just leave her be considering there is a mental issue at play. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nAny feedback is appreciated!\n\n\n",

      "description": "so just a little background: i had a \"friend\" (L) who would constantly talk about me and how i shouldn't voice my opinions.\n\nwhenever i post things, it is suddenly always \"about her\" and she thinks i've said nasty things about her when i never did. well the other night a fb page posted about gordon ramsay and his son and this woman commented about how she was so pleased and happy for them. she also mentioned her son who had the exact same name that passed away. multiple people commented saying she was \"pissing on their parade.\" i responded with \"she's not, y'all are just insensitive and rude as hell.\" \n\nand of course someone (A) on my fb feed saw it and screenshotted it and decided he HAD to make a post about it. he deleted the post but said that sometimes people shouldnt voice their opinion and that im \"hearing this, but obviously not listening.\" i ended up complaining to my boyfriend about the post. i never mentioned L or A hating on me for my opinions but apparently L thinks i did. she texted during 8th period yesterday and this is how the convo went: \n\nL: \"So. I hate on you for your opinions now? Okay. I’m sorry A said that. I had nothing to do with it. But you could’ve kept my name out of it. Please don’t ask me for a ride anymore.\"\n\nMe: \"i didnt say that?? where did you get that\"\n\nL: \"Someone told me exactly what you said this morning. Thanks for that.\"\n\nMe: \"what are you talking about\"\n\nL: \"You said something about people hating on your opinions, cough cough L and A.\"\n\nMe: \"who told you that?? i never mentioned your name.\"\n\nL: \"Ok.\"\n\nMe: \"oh but course you're gonna believe them. because you think im out to get you right?\"\n\nL: \"Yeah I believe them. Sorry. I’m done. I can’t handle this anymore.\"\n\nMe: \"i never fucking mentioned your name. but ok. we've known each other for years. i dont know why you would believe someone else over me. literally all i mentioned to alex (my boyfriend) was that A made a post and i was upset (which i have every right to be) and i never said anything about you or him hating on me for my opinions.\"\n\nshe looked at the messages, but never answered. someone is lying to her about me because they either hate me or are trying to get her fired up.

      "title": "WIBTA if I cancelled my trip home for the holidays?",
      "description": " \n\nTL;DR at bottom.\n\nProbably one of many similar posts - I know it's never possible to give full details, but I'll try. My family suffers from a range of mental challenges/conditions/illnesses: ADHD, Aspergers, depression, substance abuse, gender identity, anxiety. Although miraculously none of the uglier symptoms present themselves around friends or guests, they all come out in the wash during family holidays. This year, the parents rented a cottage in the middle of nowhere, so we will all be stuck together with no place to go.\n\nThis Thanksgiving has been a foretaste of what I fear will happen come Christmas. In just the last two days, I've been through enough mental illness crap to make me not want to come for Christmas. One sister had a two-hour violent meltdown over playing MineCraft (she's 11) that resulted in my father having to restrain her about six times. The other has ignored the houseguest from Japan she brought home from college (who, unfortunately, has had to witness all this going on), and freaked out during a board game: there was some confusion over a move that did not involve her: my family tends to get loud and talk over each other and that triggered her anxiety which resulted in her throwing a fit and her game pieces and storming out of the house. Just today I was yelled at for 'always looking for an argument': my mother announced her intention to shut off the internet for several hours to install a new router and I observed that I (and the Japanese exchange student) were working on online classwork. I'm typing this expecting the internet to shut off at any moment - I retreated to a closed room to avoid further conflict over the issue.\n\nI have tried to adopt the perspective that my role is to be a peacemaker as much as possible (e.g, acquiescing to simple demands, being a kind host to this poor Japanese girl and just talking to her). However, this Thanksgiving has made me feel that I am horrible in that role. I will admit that their behavior does not always bring out the best in me - I do not take well to my sister hitting and kicking my parents or the dog, for example. I am fully aware that some of this behavior is beyond my family's control; however, it is frustrating to see it under control around friends/guests, but receive the full brunt of it over political discussions, or even stupid things like games. Part of the reason I'm considering cancelling my Christmas ticket is so I won't end up becoming one of several assholes over Christmas.\n\nI fully anticipate that between the various diagnoses and differences on politics and religion that there will be several shitshows come Christmas. However, this holiday is the one time of year my entire family gets together. We will also have a bit of extended family joining us, too. If I don't show, it will be noticed and talked about, and break my parents' and grandparents' hearts. I've also had to pay nearly $1000 for Christmas travel, which I will only get about $600 back in the form of travel vouchers if I cancel. I have no idea what the alternative would be, as I don't have another family to 'adopt' me for the holidays (e.g., SO).\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA for skipping family Christmas to avoid conflict aggravated by mental illness, knowing that it will hurt my family deeply if I don't come?",

      "description": "I am a str8 guy in my early 30's, and let me just start by saying that I support the LGBT community and believe in equality. That's why the following situation kind of surprised me. Using a throwaway account because I'm not super proud of myself.\n\nSo before I continue, I need to tell you that I've always felt insecure about my looks, and my average height and average build - or even below average growing up. I've always had interest in sports and all things considered \"masculine\" but I've often been left out of matches, sporting events, bachelor parties etc because I've always tried fitting in with the more masculine tough guys, and although they've always been formally nice to me, I don't think anyone has ever seen me as their peer. I've learnt to accept it, but it's always been a mild frustration for me.\n\nSo about two and a half months ago I joined a new firm, and everyone has been pretty welcoming, inviting me over for a drink after work etc, but I've started noticing the same pattern. Guys playing sports over the weekend don't invite me, or don't take my comments about sports, or relationships etc seriously... Again the big guys have their own circle where I don't feel like I fit in. But there is this one guy who's been very friendly, helpful and overall did everything he could to help me adjust to the new environment. Now, this guy is about my age, maybe a few years older, everyone at the office likes him, he's a great worker, and physically he's very imposing, tall, good looking, well built... everything I've always wanted to be, and more than anyone I've known he's shown interest in my opinions about sports, politics, relationships etc, and he's invited me to matches, sporting events and such. I know it's childish, but this really made me feel like I was finally accepted into the \"boys club\" after feeling left out for most of my life, because I didn't look right, or wasn't tall enough, confident enough, or whatever it is that someone did or did not see in me.\n\nSo a few days ago we went for a beer after work, a couple of us colleagues, and after everyone else went home, my new friend and I talked about women and relationships for a while, and it turns out he's gay. I've never had a close gay friend, only a few good acquaintances I share with my girlfriend, and like I said earlier, I've always supported and respected the LGBT community. But I have to admit that I was kind of disappointed that this guy is gay, because I've always wanted to have at least one friend like him, who would share my interests and who would accept me as I am, but I always assumed it would be a str8 guy. Am I the asshole for being disappointed here, or am I just overthinking this?",

      "description": "Just had a fight with my SO because of what I told our daughter about \"legit violence\". Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?",

There are too many details to wrap up in this one post, but basically they are very religious people, and do not approve of most of my choices. At home when I am around them, I have to become a different person and essentially lead a double life, which I find to be very taxing.\n\nAfter I graduate college and find a stable job I plan to cut them off, disconnecting any and every means of contact, essentially ghosting myself from them.\n\nI’ve talked to both my brother and a few of my close friends about this and they all tell me that I’m wrong for wanting to do so. They say that I’m selfish for leaving because my parents have provided for me my entire life (financially, food, housing, etc.) and are now financing my entire college degree so that I don’t have to take out loans. On top of that, my brother told me I would be tearing the family apart by leaving.\n\nIt’s just that I hate my parents so much for being so abusive all throughout my life. Being around them just fills me with rage and makes my skin crawl. I don’t know if maybe I’m right, or maybe I’m just fucked up.\n\nDo you guys think I’m the asshole for wanting to leave?

      "description": "Posting from a throwaway. \n\nRight now I'm in college at a large western university. I have to park in a lot that is notorious for accidents. The stop to exit is at the bottom of a big hill coming around a blind corner and there is at least one rear end accident a month because people go too fast down hill and can't see that there's a car stopped there. \nThis is exactly what happened to me yesterday. I was waiting to exit onto the road and was absolutely slammed into which pretty much totaled my car. Thank god there's no injuries, I got very very lucky. \n\nSo here's where it gets weird and where I may very much be an asshole. When I got out there was this absolutely stunningly gorgeous girl looking over the damage and crying her eyes out and saying how incredibly sorry she was. I THOUGHT she was saying that she was distracted and had made a huge mistake and therefore assumed she was the driver. I told her that it was ok and that we'd let insurance cover it and maybe it wasn't that bad and that she really had nothing to be sorry for since accidents happen to all of us. We talked for maybe 2 minutes and I was in such shock that I had no idea what I said, she is now claiming that I said that I wouldn't call the police or even turn it into my insurance. I MAY have said that, but I don't think that I did...but honestly I was shaking so bad that I don't know what exactly I said. \n\nAfter I got done chatting with her another girl started to get out of the drivers seat. I was completely confused because like I said I assumed the girl I'd been talking to had been the driver but it turns out I was wrong. To put it mildly, the actual driver was not nearly as \"cute\" as the other driver was the first thing that I noticed. She was so obese that she was essentially stuck in the car and her friend went around to help her. And instead of crying or being sorry like the girl I thought was driving had been, the actual driver got out of the car and started screaming bloody murder at me about what an asshole I was to have been stopped there, how it was totally my fault, etc. I was so pissed I instantly called the campus police to have them come do a police report. \nBut because I had allegedly \"forgiven\" the girl I thought was driving, both of them started calling me everything from asshole to nice guy because they assumed I was willing to let the \"pretty\" girl slide on the accident. I honestly don't think I ever said that but I do admit I was much nicer to her which was partly based on her looks in total honesty, but so much more based on her attitude and not blaming me. the police found the driver at fault but even the officer gave me a dirty look when she found out what I allegedly said to the \"pretty\" girl.\n\nAm I the asshole for treating these girls differently and being much more congenial to the pretty girl than the way I'm going after the girl who actually caused the accident?",

      "description": "I know this girl from my school called Stacey. She and I are both 15. About 98% of the girls at my school are feminists and they believe in sexual liberty including myself, and her. She has an Instagram account, and I'd always see her post of wanting to have sex or jokes/pictures lifted off Tumblr about sex. Recently, she even posted a picture of her friend, Adi, and captioned each picture with shit like 'dickilious' and 'don't worry, I have those in my mouth all the time'. Another time, she posted a selfie and captioned it with 'I need a dick in me, right now!' \n\nShe once posted a picture of a girl wearing panties that read 'dinner's on me'. Another time she started making those bottom text memes, and all of them were hella provocative, with one saying 'get into bed and remove your clothes, now!'\n\nI'm all about being free with your sexuality, and talking about sex, but keep in mind she's 15. It feels inappropriate watching her post this stuff. But I also don't know whether me telling her not to would come off as wrong, because it is her profile and her posts, not mine. If I really am uncomfortable, I should just unfollow her, right? \n\nBut at the same time, I feel like it is wrong for someone her age to post stuff that says she needs a dick in her.\n\nI don't want to take any stupid actions that would make her angry and me seem overbearing.\n\nSo, WIBTA?",

      "description": "So backstory, my ex broke up with me a few days ago. It was not mutual at all and I am devastated.  Personally I was really blind sighted by this, as I thought our relationship was going great and then he just out of nowhere said he had been praying about it and realized that God thought we should break up. I also prayed about our relationship (we’re both fairly religious) and I felt like God was happy with our relationship. Anyway, he told me he’s willing to talk about it in a few days, but he needs time. So I’m thankful for that. \n\nHe’s asked for his stuff back: his hoodie, some pairs of socks, this necklace he gave me for Valentine’s Day, a stuffed animal he gave me for Valentine’s Day, and his apartment keys. And he’s asked that I grab my stuff: my acoustic guitar, a Phantom of the Opera mug, and some clothes I left at his place. I’m going there tomorrow while he’s in class because I can’t really bear to see him yet. \n\nBut for some reason I feel compelled to spray his hoodie with my perfume. Right now it smells like him (and my tears but that’s because I’ve been a mess and I miss him a lot). I don’t know why I want to do it. It feels manipulative. What do you guys think? Is it an asshole thing to do? ",

      "description": "Okay, right off the bat; I'm the asshole in the context of this, but I'm looking for forgiveness from her and I'm wondering if *that* would be an asshole move.\n\nSo about a year ago I broke up with my first serious girlfriend (we were together a year and a half). It was most definitely not a clean breakup, and it all went down in flames. In one of our last arguments (over text), she told me that while we were talking about getting back together she had already hooked up with this one other guy. After that, she gave my number to him and he started trolling my social media and insulting me, my family, and my friends while alluding that my ex told him a bunch of secrets I told her when we were together, and started rattling off on some sensitive things.\n\nThis pissed me off, and in retaliation I told him he should stop wasting his time talking to me and go fuck my ex, because she's \"easy\" and immediately sent him a bunch of explicit images of her she had sent me. They weren't nudes, as she was fully clothed, but they were provocative pictures of her in her underwear and making semi-sexual poses. This is something I know would immensely embarrass her and they both blocked me after that.\n\nMonths later, I have a new SO and my ex tries to get in touch with her. She says that she's been going to therapy and her therapist supposedly told her to get in touch with me or someone close to me in order to get closure, but she then does this by bad-mouthing me. My current SO tells her to fuck off and then tells me about it. I felt pissed for a while, but then I started feeling sorry for her and that I genuinely do want to give closure, not just for her but for myself too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I tried to? I feel as though I was the asshole already, but would it be wrong to try and fulfill her wish of getting closure? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My recent ex and I have a complicated history. We have known each other for approximately 25 years. We started dating a year and a half ago. We were both abused, and we have a lot in common, including PTSD. We both hate asking for help because if an abuser helps you it means you owe them something. So, I made a lot of excuses for him.\n\nAbout 6 months ago he got fired and went into a deep depression. I have been drowning financially but supported him and he was unemployed the entire 6 months. I asked him to get help and he refused. It got to the point where I would be homeless if I didn't kick him out and start over in a new, smaller/cheaper place. \n\nSo I did. But we continued to see each other. He's been resentful and emotionally abusive on and off. He stayed the night and then started moving stuff in and we got in a fight because he doesn't respect my boundaries and I said he can't live here until he starts helping and gets his shit together.\n\nI am at the end of my rope. I broke it off.\n\nThis happened yesterday. Tonight he came here begging me to stay the night because he \"has nowhere else to go,\" and would be fucked without his storage key. None of this is true. He lost the key a few days ago. It isn't here. Also he yelled at me and called me names earlier today and OH HE DOES HAVE PLACES TO GO. Now I'm not saying it's ideal, but he has plenty of loving friends who would help him. But he's a stubborn ass and I promise he's going to sleep in the street tonight out of spite and obstinance, and try to get me to let him in tomorrow.\n\nHe's got a really sweet friend who offered for him to stay with her and her fiance and I know he hasn't told them what's going on out of shame. Should I call her and let her know? \n\nPlease keep this in mind: I love this man. He's a jackass, but the both of us have survived trauma worse than most people and poverty. If we weren't stubborn, we'd be dead already. And frankly I'm not mad. I feel awful. I am sad. \n\nAm I the asshole, or would I be if I called his friend and asked her to try and get through to him? \n\nSorry for jumbled explanation. I'm a little emotional still. He just left. ",

      "description": "Today my girlfriend who I'm in an LDR with (I'm in another country for work) admitted she had a weird fetish. Upon asking about it she said she liked to think of me and her as the people in porn she watched. No big deal there, they're actors or anonymous couples. She then continued to explain she also likes to visit sites like Omegle or ChatRoulette and pretend to be other people and talk to other people. Word for word she said \"it gets me horny, idk\". She explained that it's basically like porn, she's just using it to get off and since she's just having sexual talks with strangers and pretending to be someone else it's not bad. She also explained it's only at times I'm unavailable and that she \"thinks of me when she's talking to them\". I told her no, she shouldn't continue to do that, and that the difference is that she is interacting with another person, and whether she's pretending to be a different person or not she's still sexting someone else to get off. \n\nMy issue is that if she needs someone to sext or whatever she can just wait for me to get home from work and message or call me, and I explained this and how it amounts to emotional cheating, but she seemed kind of dejected by the whole thing. I also explained that I'm not super hurt or mad over it because I can see how she came to the conclusion that it's okay, but it's too weird and seems to easily escalatable for me to be comfortable with.\n\nSo my question is, am I the asshole for not approving of my GF's weird fetish when it's online, distanced from her actual self, and is with people she is incredibly unlikely to meet, with no video or other real info exchange.

      "description": "I know that this may seem like some angsty teen (f15) thing but this is actually really bothering me. My parents are divorced and I live with my mom and her boyfriend of about 6 years. Him and I used to be pretty close until he started becoming really manipulative towards my mom, then towards my sister and I. Let’s just say my sister and I aren’t drinking his shitty grape flavored bootleg kool-aid. That causes quite a bit of friction between us all. For example, this weekend I was at my dads house (only me, my sister (f19) is still out of town), which is usually a hard time for my mom and her boyfriend because they are not on good terms with my father, so generally when I get home from my fathers house my moms boyfriend is pretty irritable at times, other times he’s pretty cool. Today I came home and I was wearing a cropped shirt (which I am not allowed to wear, but my mom will allow it if I am wearing pants that are high waisted or a shirt under - basically if my stomach isn’t showing). I had just gotten out of the car and my stomach was showing a little bit because my pants had fallen down a little; before I could pull my pants back up or even say hi to him the first thing he says to me is him getting on to me about my shirt, and I mean he’s pretty aggravated about my shirt. I might be a brat for this but it upset me a little, so I said “well it’s nice to see you too.” with a bit of an attitude. He got pretty mad. He proceeded to tell me how I don’t respect myself because I dress like a whore and that he didn’t care if everyone else in the world does it, I can’t. I get where he’s coming from and all, but he couldn’t have said hi to me first or at least approached it better? He’s never been a father before he met my mom and doesn’t really understand how fragile a teen girls self confidence is, my mom said something to him about it, but then he told her that she’s making him out to be the bad guy because she doesn’t want to parent me. This happens quite often, but only when he is feeling stressed/insecure, which he just got bad news on Friday at a doctors appointment (he has type two diabetes and is in denial about it). I know he’s just trying deflect some embarrassment onto me, but Im getting pretty tired of it and beg my mom to leave him all the time. She says that he is her soulmate and that she would be miserable without him, but by staying with him she’s slowly losing her daughters. I persistently tell her that but it just angers her even more, ever since she’s met him she’s completely changed as a person. She’s I love with him and I know that she hasn’t had that in a very long time, so I feel like a bad person for resenting someone she views so highly. Im probably just going to move out after my senior year and only visit them once a year or so. I feel happier when I’m not around them and I think they’re happier without me. Am I in the wrong for resenting my mother and her boyfriend so much or do I actually have a good point?",

      "title": "AITA if I would never sign any birth certificate or pay pregnancy-related medical costs without a paternity test?",
      "description": "This is inspired by [this fairly popular post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a3q3r1/aita_for_being_angry_with_my_fianc%C3%A9_for_wanting_a/). I do find it unfortunate that, in that post, the fiancé only mentioned this after the pregnancy. Regardless, a couple of years ago, an ex-girlfriend of mine told me she was pregnant (two days after our breakup, ostensibly by me). I told her that whether to keep the child was her choice, but that if she wanted me to support this child and/or any of the medical costs of the pregnancy that there would have to be a paternity test, and that if she wanted to do it after birth I would pay her back half the medical costs then. She got furious at this, and it turned out later that the whole thing was a fabricated attempt (literally using a pregnant friend's urine) to manipulate me into getting back together. (She had BPD, long and fairly hellish story there, hence breaking up with her to begin with, though I hope she's doing better now.)\n\nSince then, though, I've been pretty conscientious about being up front about this. Any time things have gotten serious with a girl, when we have that conversation about wanting kids or not (I very much want kids), I make sure to mention that I would never, regardless of any amount of \"trust,\" put my name on a birth certificate without knowing for a fact the kid is mine. Even for a second, third, etc. kid with the same partner. Pretty much no ladies have had a problem with this.\n\nThe responses to that post, however, seem to be full of people asserting that the fiancé should just trust her and not take into account the massive financial, legal and time sink that can go into raising a child that isn't yours. People said he acted out of, for instance \"irrational fear.\" Given the average $233k cost (not including time and energy) to raise a child, and the $500 (max) cost of a paternity test, simple math tells us that if there's a 0.2% (500/233,000) chance of infidelity, it makes sense to get a test. And I mean, while everyone should trust their partner... why would you not make such a *tiny* investment to be safe?",

      "description": "So i've been dating this Ukrainian girl named Diana  for a week now and i really really really like her. She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?",

She then went to sit down and out son (3 y/o) was in the way and she raised her voice at him, I told her \"He's a 3 year old boy, Jane\" and she didn't respond but dropped the attitude towards him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few minutes she started to get frustrated again(at no one) and started growling and that's when I kind of went a little aggressive and told her that she should just like me cook and she responded with \"You'd probably fuck it up\", I responded with \"It's fucking Quesadilla, Jane; Not exactly rocket science\" she then said \"I want to do this, John\" I replied with a frustrated tone \"Seriously, you're 6 months pregnant, stressed out and clearly need a fucking break. It's tortillas, all I have to do is throw what you have already made on a tortilla, sprinkle some cheese on it, throw another tortilla on top and put it in the over for like 5-10 minutes, PLEASE sit the fuck down.\" at this point she was crying and I felt like an asshole and just shut up and let her make the Quesadillas while she was crying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I'm probably not going to do a follow up because this isn't a big deal as far as our relationship goes and I just feel guilty and want to know if I did do something wrong or not.",

      "description": "My brother and I were raised by our grandparents and turned out very normal I guess. My parents raised my sister and they had very different conflicting parenting styles (they are now divorced which seemed to stem from my sister's problems) which essentially resulted in her never getting diciplined for anything ever. The results have been a 7th grader who has about 2 full blown temper tantrums per day, bullies her peers, ignores (literially pretends she doesn't hear) anything she disagrees with, is completely self centered and doesn't try to hide it, and is very materialistic. No one in my family wants to be around her, even my parents. \n\nSome examples of her behavior: she tried to stab me twice growing up, my brother once, and my mom once. She kicks my cat to get to me. She will ask my mom to buy her things everywhere she goes and when my mom says no she will have full blown tempertantrums in the middle of the store. She says that she hates everyone behind their back (my dad's girlfriend, my mom, my boyfriend, my brother) just for attention. She looks under the tree at christmas and sees that she has one less present than the rest of us and then throws a fit because of it, etc. My mom started drinking heavily at least in part because of her, and my dad was borderline emotionally abusive to me to take out his frustration for over three years. \n\nToday we celebrated christmas at my mom's house, and a large chunk was tainted because of her behavior. My boyfriend, brother, and I are all back home from school for the break and wanted to spend time with my mom but she turned it very negative. It's my mom's first christmas after a divorce and she has no one to spend it with, and my sister didn't even care about how selfish she was being. Once we got home I was sitting on the couch with my boyfriend being sad because of how it turned out, and my dad saw me and wanted to get me to talk about it. We talked for a second, just mentioned that my sister was rough today and it kinda sucked. What he said boiled down to \"she just wants to be included and I know it's hard to include her but it's important to understand\" which is true, (I'm not trying to call my dad out for this) that is the reason for her outbursts, but at the same time when she has such bad behavioral issues it feels impossible to be around her at all. This is an assholeish thing to say but honestly I wish I wasn't related to her at all. \n\nI guess the core \"am I the asshole\" is I am away at college all year, and I have the option to spend breaks with my boyfriend's family. I love my family (excluding my sister), but every time I come back I feel awful because I truly can't stand to be around her. I don't want to talk to her. I don't want to text her back when she texts (and I haven't been), I don't want to try to be friendly, I don't want to be the \"good big sister\" anymore. I tried that for years and all it got me was anxiety, abuse, and loss of friendships from people not wanting to be around her. I don't want to be her sister at all. Don't want her to visit me, don't want her to come to my graduation, don't want her to be in my wedding if I get married, don't want her to be around my kids if I have them. I want to tell my parents that I am distancing myself because of her, but my dad has always said that family has to come first, and he stopped talking to his own mother for a while because she didn't invite my sister to a family dinner. My plan is a bit more serious. I would only visit for short periods of time and stay where she isn't. I would also not communicate in answers more than \"yes and no\" with her unless it would disrupt someone else in my family. AITA for trying to get away?",

      "description": "Earlier this year, I was the 'new guy' at my job. It's a working man's job and could easily be considered a prime example of the place where you would find \"locker room talk\". The guys tend to give each other nicknames and call each other different things, often light-hearted, without any bad intention. We all really seem to appreciate each other there and if there's a problem for some reason, it's public.\n\nWhen I was pretty new to the job, my co-workers found out pretty early on I was largely an introverted person. I think this has changed a bit, but this make me stand out a lot in the group. \n\nAt one point, my co-workers were calling me the \"school shooter\" for reasons I could only discern as me being introverted. I'm well past high school age and I didn't even stay in college, and I'd never had the intentions to be a shooter. It was certainly a weird nickname for them to give me, but I never did find the reason behind it.\n\nOne day, we were outside in front of customers, and my co-workers were ragging on me as they sometimes do. They were calling me the \"school shooter\" in front of complete strangers. I really didn't like that, and I already didn't like the nickname at all.\n\nAfter we got back inside to our 'office' I began telling the guys how I felt about the nickname and I told them, not asked, to stop calling me that. A couple were a bit taken back, with one of them just leaving the room entirely. In my mind, I think I was justifiably mad about the nickname and the incident. After all, who wants to be called a school shooter?! It just seems so horrible in my mind.\n\nAm I the asshole for ruining my co-workers fun? Or am I justified for trying to defend myself and make sure I wasn't associated with something horrible?",

It’s also just happening at the wrong time too as with everything going on with her is zapping everything up so she doesn’t feel ready for dating or anything like that right now so she doesn’t feel she can cope and that she’s sure that somewhere down the line that if she’s past her issues and that we’re both single then she’d love to try again” am I the asshole for just walking away as I wanted a relationship and wouldn’t be happy as just friends?\n\nTLDR: Got friendzoned am I the asshole for just walking away despite her saying she might try again in future when things are better?\n",

      "description": "OKAY so obligatory yes I'm on mobile and yes the title sounds bad. \n\nContext is I met a new friend online less than a week ago, and she lives near my town and said she wanted to meet IRL and she was going to come to my town with a friend, if I wanted to meet up (this was I think the day after we first connected). I don't usually do stuff like that cause it makes me nervous but she seemed cool and like someone I'd get along with, and the conversations we had while messaging were interesting and I'm trying to make new friends so! I said sure.\n\nWe got coffee the next day and basically she kind of just talked AT me for two hours, it was a little overwhelming cause I'd ask about her art and she would end up telling me about something really personal from her childhood, etc. She's a good story teller so it was interesting but she didn't really ask me questions or engage in stuff I said except to start talking more. It ended, it was fine, we went our own ways and she left town that night. \n\nThen the next day, today, she said some cryptic stuff about wanting to see me again if she 'was still around'. I thought she was a cool person, but wasn't realllyyyy planning on trying to hang again, but I felt like I needed to make sure she was okay. Basically she told me she was planning on committing suicide, I talked her out of it for awhile, now she's going to go maybe check herself in to some inpatient situation cause she's really in a bad spot, so that's cool! Crisis averted.\n\nSo now, she is saying 'if she makes it' she wants to hang out with me again and that I seem like I'm 'really worth knowing' (red flag! /s) and I don't want to like, lead her on by saying that I want that too, and then disappoint her later when I don't follow up or anything, but also she's in a fragile brain space so I don't think I should just say no thanks, I feel like either way I'm kind of the asshole? I just feel like she's really intense already for how little we know each other, and I don't think it would be a sustainable or healthy friendship for me to pursue. I think she feels more of a connection than I do, probably cause she told me her whole life story over coffee yesterday. I think I'm going to just try to be as supportive as I can but not really make myself that available to hang and kinda let it fizzle away..\n\nSorry for the novel, but AITA?",

      "description": "Backstory on my times dealing with Christians (actual Christians, not regular theists): Last school year tried dating a Christian, it didn't work and he didn't like me being atheist and we broke up. We were way better and connected more as friends, however he didn't \"agree\" with homosexuality and we got in a couple arguments about it, but it was one if the straw that broke the back to that friendship. \n\nMy best friend/cousin is a Christian and never expressed any type of disinterested in me being bi or any type of disliking towards gay people\n\nNow here we go: I met this Christian boy through my high school band program. He's homeschooled, a grade higher than me, and I only see him in band and after school Thursday rehearsals first period in the morning. I had no problems with him and we've even had peaceful biblical discussions and talked about his grandma being a Jehovah's Witness, and it was kinda nice being around him. \n\nSo two days ago (8 periods at my school so A and B days) in the morning were waiting in the band teacher to come open the doors. While outside I start joking around, and he doesn't really get my sarcasm/jokes so I tell him not to take it seriously and throw it back at me. After he said OK the conversation went like this:\n\nMe: OK. Now let's agree you're a racist, sexist, homophobe.\nHim: *laughs* You know, I was almost jumped last year for saying I don't agree with homosexuality.\nMe: *laughs in case it's a joke* You're just kidding, right?\nHim: No I don't actually agree with it.\nMe: What? Why?\nHim: I believe it's wrong because the Bible says it's wrong. (exact words, no this isn't a movie script)\nMe: *walks away without a word*\n\nI -kinda shamefully- immediately blocked and deleted his number, along with blocking him on Instagram and making him unfollow me. So today I refuse to do our usual talking in the morning, and after school as we were finishing putting up stands and chairs he walks up to me (don't remember exact words except the last thing he said so he's a close version of what happened):\n\nHim: Are you OK?\nMe: *slightly aggravated tone that pretty much carried out throughout the conversation* I'm fine\nHim: *concerned* illiteratetrash if there's a problem you can tell me\nMe: so you're really gonna pretend like you didn't say that homophobic thing earlier?\nHim: Listen, I'm not homophobic, OK? I just don't necessarily agree with it. \nM: I'm not doing this again. I've dealt with Christians that thought like that, no, I just can't do this again.\nH: But I'm not homophobic. I have gay friends, and I love my gay friends, I just don't agree with it. \nM: That's the thing you don't like it\nH: It's not like I hate people but I'm not gonna pretend like what they're doing is alright. (exact words, I swear this isn't a soap opera)\nM: I'm not doing this to myself. I'm bisexual I'm not gonna deal with someone who thinks like that. No. \n\nI leave for my bus a few minutes after that. Now that I'm reflecting on it about a few hours later I feel bad. I told my sister and she laughed at it saying \"Sounds familiar. You reeeaaalllyyy know how to pick them, huh?\" referring to my last bf\n\nAm I the asshole for not forgiving?",

      "description": "I’m a fourth year college student, male, I have two roommates, both male. I have been living with my first roommate, whole I’ll call Bill, for about two years. The third roommate is new and doesn’t factor into the story too much. One of my roommates has been talking about wanting to get a cat. \n\nAbout a year or so Bill wanted to foster cats. I did not want to. I love animals, but I’m a fairy busy college student and I did not really want to responsibility of taking care of pets at the moment, and I also didn’t really want cat hair all over the apartment. (The furniture in the living room is all mine.) \nHe said he would take the full responsibility of taking care of them, I eventually relented. \nI ended up almost always cleaning litter box and feeding them, which he promised I would never have to do. Our house and furniture were covered in hair from the cats, which to some people may not be a big deal, but I am not used to having pet hair everywhere and it really bothers me. My mother gave me a very nice, expensive couch for the apartment, and the cats would scratch the shit out of it. His dumbass friend would always come over, they’d get high, and they’d hike the cats between their legs like footballs. It terrified them but they were convinced “the cats like it, dude.” He also had a hamster, which he would forget to feed for literally weeks on end, and never paid any attention to, that ended up dying. \n\nEspecially over the past year, I’ve been having a lot of issues with him and his behavior. I’m not sure if elaboration is necessary but I can edit and add if people want more context to our relationship. Every month or so it seems, he’ll do something that puts me off and makes me really question my friendship with him, but I just end up letting things slide. \n\nHe told me maybe a month or so ago he wanted to get a cat. I said no. He was insistent, but I put my foot down, and explained to him why I don’t want a cat and why he isn’t fit to own one. He said he’d just get one behind my back, but he was laughing so I assumed he was joking. \n\nYesterday he texts me a picture of the cat he had gotten. I was angry, I considered a huge backstab. He told me \n“I never said I wouldn’t get a cat.”\n“I can just keep it locked in my room, you’ll never have to see it.” (Which I don’t believe, but if I did, I feel like it’s not right to keep a cat locked in a single room.) \n\nI tried to explain how getting a pet is a group decision everyone in the house needs to agree on, but he does not get it. He never ended up coming home from the shelter with the cat, but he’s been sulking like a child and giving me the cold shoulder. Which is his normal behavior when he’s mad. \nDoes he have any right to be angry with me? And did I overstep boundaries by forbidding he get the cat? \n\n\nSorry for this long ass post. ",

      "description": "Okay so this is pretty mundane compared to some things I've seen on here, but here goes:\n\nI like to get my hair cut at a barber shop in town that has gotten super popular and is ALWAYS busy. It has a sort of punk/rockabilly theme and atmosphere to it that I really enjoy. Their haircuts are also great and relatively quick.\n\nThe one problem is the insane wait times because they're walk-in only. Whenever I've gone, besides my last three visits, I've had to wait for about 40min to even get into a chair. Not wanting to give up a barber that I really like, I resolved that I would just show up immediately when they opened. The past two times I've gone this has worked perfectly. This time around, it seemed that I might not be guaranteed a chair right upon arriving. I got there like five minutes before open and there were at least four other parked cars with dudes just waiting and watching the door for when they flipped the \"Closed\" sign to \"Open.\" I see a guy get out of his car and begin waiting by the door, so I immediately get out and do the same. They open the doors and the guy ahead of me is hanging up his coat and I see that my favorite barber is working today, so I bolt for her chair while the other guy is still hanging up his coat. I don't think much of it, because there's still another chair open for him, and the two of us--the first two in line--will get to have our hair cut first.\n\nBut then I sit down and get situated and from my mirror I can see that guy that had been ahead of me sitting in the waiting area, looking PISSED. Someone else must have done exactly what I did and bolted past him and secured a chair while he hung up his coat. So I have to wonder, AITA for zooming to my barber's chair and not waiting for him to get situated, possibly giving someone else the idea to do the same thing?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend when I am upset, when doing so jeopardises her happiness",
      "description": "My girlfriend and I met at university, and have been dating for two months, and have been having a hard time over the Christmas Holiday. We live about 7 hours away from one another, and will not see each other for about a month, which is okay; she adores her family and I don't want to intrude on her Christmas holiday. The issue here is that I do not adore my family, and I find living with them burdensome and stressful.\n\nFor context, my Mother has dementia, but has always been stubborn and narcissistic, and whilst my Father adores her he has no clue how to handle her, and she emotionally abuses him to tears. My Father himself does not know how to handle my Mother, and often gets angry and starts to shout at her. I haven't seen them in about 3 months and they've both gotten worse, meaning that living here over Christmas was a massive shock to me.\n\nAs a result of this, I have spent the majority of my holiday either in my room all day, or ouside the house. My girlfriend knows this. If she asks me how my day has been, I answer honestly, and say that today has been boring / tough / upsetting, and of she asks I elaborate on whatever arguement happened that day. \n\nI think because of this we end up texting way more than we should be, we run out of things to talk about. Furthermore, as we are texting than talking face to face, we can't convey exactly what we feel when we say something, meaning I think she is under the impression that I am constantly upset while i'm here, then that is only really confined to when I'm having to deal with my parents.\n\nLast night, my thoughts are verified. She is upset that I've spent my day in my room, saying \"Just so you know, in this house spending time just in your room isnt something people do much\". I reply with \"Yeah, and in this house, enjoying time with other people isnt something you do much\". From here, we both take a moment and then say that we have stuff to think about. We no we're both upset, I feel I was rude and thoughtless in what I said. I reply later on, apologising for the comment, that it were unnecessary.\n\nShe replies afterwards- she says that that's not why she is upset. She is upset that she hasn't enjoyed this holiday like she normally would, and its because she knows that I'm not enjoying my holiday. She hates the thought that she dislikes me telling her about my problems, and she says that what she feels is callous, and mean, and she says she is sorry for it. I understand, since coming home the amount of times I needed to talk to her because I was upset was almost daily.\n\nShe goes quiet for about half an hour before returning. She's argued with her mum, which is rare. She is extremely upset, and feels she can't talk it to me because she feels she has let me down. She says that she's thought about it, and she needs some time to think, and that she would not message me for a while.\nI want to be there for her, if she has argued with her mum. Their arguement eclipses ours in importance. Yet, she obviously doesn't want to talk to me right now, she needs someone else, like her best friend.\n\nI'm conflicted on what to do regarding the rest of this holiday and the relationship as a whole. I feel like I have been a completely different person over the holiday, and she's been made fully aware of that fact because we message for hours on end. I know that this current issue will be swiftly resolved when I go back to university on January 5th, and meet her (and her family, for the first time) on January 12th. Nevertheless, I know what we have both handled this horribly, and I don't know how to approach the subject of my family with her from now on.\n\nShould I have to tread carefully about the topics I talk about when I'm in a relationship, when we've already agreed to speak our mind and say when we're upset? Am I the asshole for putting this pressure on her over her holiday, when I know what she is with her family? Are there any red flags here things I need to think about or watch out for? How could we approach talking about things we're struggling with without putting pressure on one another?\n\n(Sorry for any mistakes, I'm on mobile)",

      "description": "So a little backstory... I am half-Taiwanese and so I am in China often. I was there a month ago for Christmas, visiting family, and I decide to go watch a movie by myself. Hollywood movies there are in English, but subtitled in Chinese, and I take seat in the movie theater.\n\nTwo seats down from me is this Chinese grandmother, at least 65 years old (possibly older) and next to her away from me are what I believe to be her two teenage grandchildren. The movie starts and this woman STARTS NARRATING EVERY SINGLE THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE MOVIE... I'm fluent in Mandarin Chinese so I understand everything she said, although I'm sure it's just as irritating otherwise. So for the whole time, it was like this...\n\n(In Mandarin Chinese)\n\n\"Oh, she's climbing the cliff\"\n\n*2 second pause*\n\n\"Oh, she's singing\"\n\n*2 second pause*\n\n\"Oh, she's splashing the water\"\n\n.... and on and on and on, and it did NOT stop at all. Because it's an old lady, I tried to ignore it. But after an hour of this nonstop, I reached my breaking point, turned to face her, and said somewhat angrily (in Mandarin Chinese)\n\n\"Excuse me, I'm trying to watch the movie, could you please shut your mouth?!\"\n\nImmediately she goes silent and no longer talks and I start feeling mortified. I could've worded it so much better and gentler but it just slipped out the way it did. I just finished watching the movie and left.\n\nDon't kill me, but from my experience as a half-White and half-Asian person, being quiet in a movie theater is more of an etiquette in the West compared to China, so maybe I'm mad at someone for cultural differences they can't really control? Also, I wondered if maybe her grandkids needed the narration (out of perhaps, blindness maybe), but they seemed completely able bodied so it might just have been a personality quirk. \n\nI dont know, I've been wondering about that since. AITA?",

What doesn't normally happen is a cute female make a conversation with me... which is what happened today. As I was stocking my area on a Saturday (very busy day) she clearly saw me an walked up an started making conversation about how busy the store was, and as I went to move my bread cart, she got super nervous grabbed my cart near where my hand was an told me I didnt need to move it for her. I gave a quick smile, an told her I need to stock over in another part of the isle. She let go very quickly, and got very visibly red in the face. I then (in an attempt to calm her down) told her that I'm typically in everyone's way, I appreciated her being thoughtful an went back to working. She then said something to me, which I didnt hear because I have one headphone in at all times listening to music. An then she turned left an walked out the isle. About 30 seconds later, she came from the opposite end of the isle and told me to have a great day/weekend. I smiled whilst not even looking at her, and said \"uh huh or sure\", she stood there for a couple seconds and then left. Two things before I ask if I'm the asshole in this situation.... \n\nFirst, she didnt buy any buns or bread and just left the isle.\n\nSecond, I was listening to \"baby shark\" because my friend texted me before I went into my shift saying \"DODODODODDO\" An thats what I was listening to for most of the interaction. Pretty sure at one point I sang it out loud.... \n\nSo am I the Asshole for not noticing she was trying to be forward/flirting with me? ",

      "description": "So today while I was at work my girlfriend texted me that she was going to try out yoga at our college’s gym with her friends. She then said, “Also when I get home you should check me for lice apparently there’s an outbreak at the gym.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reminded her that we have a special event coming up this weekend and we’re also flying out for a wedding in about 2 weeks. It would really suck to have those be canceled because we got lice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe responded that it’s not her fault that the ONE day she decided to go to the gym there happens to be lice there. Apparently the lice are only in the upstairs part of the gym, and that her two friends are still going. She said they’d leave if it looked shady.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy response was, “I know you want to start doing yoga and being active, but lice can take over a house and it can take weeks to get rid of them. Does it really hurt for the three of you to go another day or to a different place?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe replied that she thinks it’s just being hyped up as a joke around campus, and that they wouldn’t have the gym open if it wasn’t cleaned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe started to go back and forth. I was asking why it was important to do yoga today, and why not just go any other time in the week. I reminded her that if she brought lice back to the house it could spread to everyone else, and that we can’t exactly fly across the country with lice on our heads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe argued that she wants to go today. That if there’s a warning on the door or anything then she won’t go and since they didn’t close the gym it can’t be that serious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I’m starting to wonder why this is even an argument. How can I possibly be the bad guy for saying don’t go into a building that has a lice outbreak?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, she says that I’m essentially calling her stupid, that, “obviously I’m not going to go there if there’s like a tent over it and warning signs.” She feels that I don’t trust her and must think she’s stupid if I think she’d risk infecting her family with lice just to go to yoga. She called me dramatic and said that I’m being controlling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the last thing I ever want to be in our relationship is controlling - she should never worry about me telling her where she can go or what she can do. But I think we should be able to disagree with each other’s decisions without being classified as “controlling.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think with the information I was given I was not out of line to question her decisions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, please let me know if I’m a controlling asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend wants to go to a gym with an outbreak of lice to try yoga with her friends. We have big events planned for the next two weeks and told her it wasn’t a good idea. She called me controlling.",

      "description": "Sorry for formatting and a hard read, its my first post. Trying to stay as unbiased as possible.\n\nA few nights ago, my wife and I heard a cat meowing at the back of our house. We opened the door and a super friendly stray cat came up to us and wanted to be pet. We were cautious but gave it attention. It was declawed and extremely skinny so we figured it had been a house cat in the past. The next day it was still outside our house, so I went and bought some cat food and we posted the cat on our neighborhood facebook page. No luck finding the owner. Then I decided to ask my neighbors if it was their cat, and they said that he had been missing for 2 weeks but they didn't want to bring him in the house yet because they didn't want to give fleas to their other pets. This sounded okay at first but now it sounds weird, especially since the cat was declawed and malnourished. It has no way to fend for itself outside, and it is cold here at night, around 30 degrees F. They also have a responsibilty to care for that cat since they are the owners, right? Anyways, I didn't see the cat for a day so I thought they took him back in. But he turned back up today, meowing at my back door. I went and tried to tell my neighbor but they wouldn't answer the door. I tried again an hour later and the cat followed me to their door, so I picked the cat up to give it to them. They finally answer the door after I wait for a few minutes, and the cat starts freaking out when he  sees the owner and clawing me up. The owner grabs the cats back skin, not even the scruff, and kinda tosses him in the house saying he doesnt know what hes going to do. It was a really weird experience, and it made me think that the owners were abusive. AITA for bringing a possibly abused cat back to the owners? AITA for rushing the owners to take in their obviously indoor cat?",

I politely refused and made sure she understood that I drive a new 2017 WRX STi and my bumpers are more than likely made out of plastic and I'd rather not bend, scratch, or otherwise damage it. She sees me out there washing it every couple weeks she knows I take good care of it. She came back with she just needs a nudge and I just refused, but I did offer to come out and help push by hand no problem. She declined that and just said okaaay in a condescending way and walked off and hasn't quite been on the same friendly level since. \n\nIt's probably worth noting that this happened about a year ago and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I'm in Virginia where it rarely snows and there's no reason her damn camry with summer tires should have left the driveway in a foot of snow and ice in the first place.",

      "description": "I’ve brought this up with some friends and I have gotten some conflicting answers so I’m wondering if IATA. \n\nA little background information, I am 26(f) and have been married for just about a year to a fantastic woman named, Haley. I love my partner more than anything in the entire world and I could not picture my life without her. Haley and I have been together for about 4 years. When I was much younger I dated a woman named, Marie. Marie and I met and instantly clicked and what I thought was us getting on like a house on fire quickly became one of the most intense and darkest relationships of my life. It was abusive on both sides and not healthy at all. I believe it’s safe to say it was highly toxic and codependent but the draw was magnetic to say the least. Once Marie and I ended things we didn’t talk for several years, up until about 2 years ago, when she reached out seemingly out of the blue. I had been to therapy and worked out a lot of my issues (many of which revolved around my sexuality) and she had to. While catching up we both made amends for what had happened and seemed to move on with our lives. \n\nHaley knows all of this and was supportive in me getting closure on what was a terrible time in my life. I even showed Haley every message as it came in. At the end of the conversation with Marie Haley said she felt that it was great I got closure but asked me to sever the relationship permanently. I agreed. \n\nOnto the present: Marie has reached out again maybe about 3 months ago and we have talked every day since. Sometimes it’s about small trivial things and other times it’s about tougher emotional things. Marie was recently there for me about a death in the family- this was a family member she was particularly close to when we were together. At first I told Haley about the conversation and she brushed it off as sort of a do what you want but don’t tell me thing but I could tell it made her uncomfortable. I don’t want to stop talking to Marie and I really consider her to be one of my closest friends at this point, at the same time I don’t want to hurt the trusting and loving relationship I have with my wife. I know it’s somewhat selfish but am I completely in the wrong for wanting to talk to someone who I care about in a completely platonic way?\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for continuing to talk to my ex? ",

He was telling me that he will slit my throat, rape my dead body and ignite it after that.\n\n\nSo I told the teacher, because that didnt sound like a joke, and we werent friends either. She told me that she will handle it. But she didnt. She swept it under a rug and didnt tell anyone.\n\n\nSo I told this to my parents and they didnt believe me and told me that I am an Evil scrooge for not wanting to give her money.\n\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to give money to a person that ignored death threats addressed towards me?

I asked is it for you personally, students at our school or the department. Had it been the first two I would have helped no problem but if I'm helping a not open source/personal project ...aka if my work is benefiting an organization, uh pay me. He is over worked and underqualified and needs my help since he gets no support from our school (the employer).  \n\n\nOne of my close friends got a job at our University building systems for our department to facilitate learning/classes. He has been working on one project for a year now and has been struggling, mainly due to the department changing the goal, his underqualification for the massive task, lack of support, and being overworked.  \n\n\nThe other day I was talking with him and he brought up something he wanted try to get the project done. I talked with him for a little bit (30 mins) about what he was trying to do and if it would work.  \n\n\nHe asked if I could help him implement the solution to the problem, and/or talk with me further.  \n\n\nI asked is this for the department, or was this a personal project? He knows I don't like our department and said \"uh it's mostly a personal project\". I'm not super dumb, this was for the department and I said, \"I'll help guide you in the right direction but if this is benefiting someone else, pay me, not to be mean but my time is worth something.\" This was to a friend. One that is struggling.  \n\n\nPart of this is that he thinks I'm only asking to be paid because I don't like the head of the department (which guilty as charged). Am I right in asking to be paid if this project will help the school? He said that this project will provide a platform for learning to all the students, which he is right about, the results of the project would help a lot of students, so I am unsure if I'm being selfish.  \n\n\nAnd as soon as I dropped the bomb of \"pay me for this\" he said \"if you ever needed help at your job I'd help you.\" Which, yeah, that's true. I did say if I asked you for help I'd pay you in some way.  \n\n\nThere was someone else in the room and they said \"just pay for lunch\" which I said \"sure!\"   \n\n\nAm I an ass?  \n\n\nIn the end I said that I would help guide him in the right direction, and that I was was tired and a bit grumpy. But never said that I would fully \"hands on keyboard\" help him. ",

      "description": "First off, I cheated on my wife. For that, I am the asshole.  The marriage was good (6 years), nothing major beyond normal quibbles. Just me being stupid and wanting to have some fun.  \n\nImmediate aftermath was looking alright. We were doing counseling (I have my own, and we have a separate couples counselor). My counselor gave me some tools, like a time out system, that really helped us get through the initial arguments and actually come to some peaceful resolutions. Things were looking great.  \n\nBut now, after about two months, things seem to be unraveling. Our fights are getting worse, and the timeout system doesn't seem to be helping. Before, our arguments were on concrete topics and easy to solve. Now, they feel like whack-a-mole: a bunch of rapid succession complaints that I can barely keep up with without wanting to storm out. I actually pushed her aside one time and I'm worried I might do worse. Not that I have anger issues, she's the only one I get mad at. \n\nMost of the fights evolve into me getting frustrated, because I'm weird and don't know how to express my feelings, or don't feel like they are being understood. This leads to her getting angry because \"[i] have no reason to be frustrated\". Then it's on the downward spiral to a shouting match. \n\nAgain, I know I'm the asshole for cheating. I know she's pained from my actions. And I still want to support her for the immediate future. But am I a jerk for wanting to end it?  And it's not because I want to end it to be with the other woman, because she's in another country anyway. ",

      "description": "My partner of 7 years feels that I don't do enough cooking/washing. I feel the opposite. I work fulltime and cover 100% of our bills as well as providing a small amount of pocket money for them (personally I consider all our assets/income to belong to us equally but they didn't feel comfortable pooling all our money into a joint account). Dates and such things are split. During school terms they work two six hour shifts a week. On those nights I get home about an hour before them and will usually cook. Cooking and dishes on the weekend are split or done by me. They do most of the laundry and vacuuming (I still do some but maybe 1/5th as much). I do the 'heavy' cleaning jobs they don't want to do (wiping down the bathroom, cleaning the toilet, clearing drains etc).\n\nSince it is easier for me to carry, grocery shopping is either done by me on my way home or together on the weekends. If we need one or two ingredients on a night my partner works they will sometimes grab it but never any full shopping loads because it becomes too much to carry.\n\nAnything technical or clerical is done by me. Household repairs, organising our rent, banking, doctors appointments, government documents, taxes, computers etc. I have a phobia of sorts to talking on the phone but I do most of our phone calls because my partner will put it off indefinitely. In their defence, English is their second language so they are nervous to talk in English (their English is absolutely fine though, they have lived in an English speaking country since their last year of High School and completed Uni in English).\n\nA year and a half ago when I was still looking for full-time work I used to do more of the chores so it was closer to a 50-50 split. I can sympathise with them but since I am working fulltime and cover all of our bills I feel that it is reasonable that I would now be doing less chores during the week. Does this make me a misogynist arsehole?",

      "description": "My relationship with my dad has never been that great. He’s always kind of made my life miserable by demeaning me and making me feel as if I’ve never made him proud. He only seems to notice my mistakes and always brutally points them out but he never notices my accomplishments. In the 18 years I’ve spent living with him he’s never congratulated me on anything or told me he’s proud of me and he’s always telling me he may die before I ever impress him. My dad has been putting me through a very tough conditioning regimen for soccer before the season starts. He expects me to go to the gym 7 days a week. Now I understand that this not asking too much but he wants me to go for at least two hours regardless of if I have homework or something I need to do. I usually have to end up staying up late to finish my homework because of this. While the training is annoying the main reason I don’t want him involved is because he’ll take credit if I end up doing well just because he forced me to go to the gym. I told him that soccer is something very dear to me and that since he’s never shown me love I don’t want him to be involved in anyway. I don’t want him helping me train and I don’t want him at the games. I think he probably thinks that I’m too much of a fuck up to do well without his help but my mom says he only wants me to succeed and that he wants me to do well so I should just give him a chance. Am I an asshole for denying him this chance?",

I didn't tell my manager because he was on the other side of the building and I figured that I could get more work done if I just stayed at my location instead of wasting time to walk over and let him know.\n\nToday I got called in by my manager today and he said that I should have let him know that I would be working extra hours. We have a labor card and on it I basically put down that I worked 5 straight hours without a break. I found out that there is a labor law that requires companies to give a 15 minute break and a 30 minute break for employees that work 7+ hours. I did not take the 30 minute break because I had lost track of time and opted not to take it. I remember him mentioning something like this but it slipped my mind. It was my mistake and I didn't think that it would blow up like it has. He let me know that there is a company wide process of trying to correct my mistake and that they could be potentially sued in labor court. He told me that he could potentially lose his job because people are going to think that he didn't give me the 30 minute break.

      "title": "AITA for telling my gf I could see her later while I was at a bbq with friends, after she spent a week out of town?",
      "description": "This happened this weekend. My gf works at an accounting firm aa an accountant and sometimes has to work out of town for varied periods of time. This past week was one of those times, she has worked out of town for 2 weeks although she did pop in the previous weekend so we could attend a friend's wedding and have dinner/beers with the rest of my friends group who are usually out of town (they live all over now).\n\nFast forward to this weekend, I was invited Thursday night to this bbq that was happening at a new friend's house on Saturday afternoon. A little bit of backstory here, I was one for the few friends that stuck around in my hometown after high school (I'm 27) and I haven't gotten around to making new friends to hang out with so I appreciate any opportunity to make more. While this is happening, my gf let's me know she's coming in on Saturday, I tell her I can't pick her up since I was working that Saturday and she says it's fine, her dad can get her home and immediately after that, I invite her to said bbq because I was sensing this was gonna cause me issues and she just said she would consider but didn't think so.\n\nThen, on Saturday, my friend was getting ready for the cookout and told me to be there by around 3 PM. I go and then my gf texts me, asking what am I doing and around what time are we gonna see each other, I tell her I am at the bbq and if we could meet at 8 PM. No answer after my texts and I call her, she says she thinks she always loses to my friends (like I said, I don't have any) and that she was really excited to see me after being a whole week away, going off about how we barely got to see each other the previous weekend because we had to attend the wedding and  then go to dinner with my friends and how she feels if it came between her and my friends, I would've gone with then and if she hadn't gone to the dinner get together she wouldn't have seen me at all as I would've gone to dinner anyway (which is true, I never get to see this friend group so I take advantage of any opportunity).\n\nSo, while on the call (this took place around 5 pm), I try and defend myself, \"it's not true\", \"we can see each other in a bit, like I said, 8 pm\" but she was having none of it and repeating how she always loses to my friends, then says she has to go and we hang up. For what it's worth, we don't see each other for the rest of the day and after texting her a bit to angry responses and her telling me the day was off and we could see each other some other time, so I decide to salvage the day, stay and get wasted l, though that didn't stop me texting her.\n\nThe next day, I try and talk to her and she's making one word responses, so I notice she's punishing me, I insist and we meet up at the time she said. I get there, we go to the mall, get a coffee, I walk with her as she pays her bills, she's still mad but it's a start.\n\nAfter that, we get to her house, I say hi to her family and we talk. In short, she thinks I could do so much more, that she's not a priority to me, that my friends, or my recent acquaintances at that party, would obviously blow it off for their respective wives and gfs. I try to tell her that they're not in the same position and not desperate to get new friends like I am but I recognize it's a flimsy defense and I drop it, only telling her that I was super sorry. A little bit later, I go gone and she tells me again over WhatsApp, then blocks me. This has worried me a great deal so I feel forced to ask about another POV.\n\nSo, in short, AITA? Could I have done better? Is it just a TIFU? I feel I'm not completely in the wrong but I have no idea.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I’ve been friends with a girl, let’s call her Kate, for three years now. We’re in high school, and have been considered Best Friends™️ for the entire time we’ve known each other. This year, however, was different. \n\nNot only did she begin to literally ignore my existence, she would get mad at me when I was in a bad mood. I’ll admit, I get snappy when I’m angry or sad, but from knowing me all this time she knew that none of it was directed at her. Regardless, when I’d snap at her and immediately apologise, she didn’t care and would storm off. She started doing drugs and fucking around with her boyfriend constantly,  and it got to the point where she didn’t care about anything else. Kate’s life was entirely drugs and sex and rock n’ roll. Once she said “if I don’t have my Juul I’m gonna have a sucky day,” and snapped at me that she “NEEDS her Juul to be happy,” to which I replied “that’s not good, Kate that means you’re getting addicted to nicotine. Fucking stop” and then ALL OF HER NEW FRIENDS ganged up on me, saying it was obvious I’d never Juuled before and making me feel terrible about myself. \n\nThrough those _Extracurricular Activities_ she became friends with a bunch of people I didn’t have anything in common with. I’d still go sit with her and made an effort, even though I felt uncomfortable the entire time. It came to the point where she began to ignore me completely, like I said earlier. I’d say “hey Kate I’m going to class now,” and she wouldn’t even acknowledge I was there. So I left. Then I stopped saying anything at all. \n\nI started hanging out with my other friends, and I stopped talking to Kate all the time. People would always ask me why I was friends with her if she made me feel so awful. I never knew how to answer. \n\nHer boyfriend, another friend, and I all planned for months a surprise birthday party for Kate, which—minus a few minor bumps in plans— went well. There was cake, presents, and all the typical bday things. We did it because her mom is a bitch and never let her have a birthday party before. However, when we were out doing the thing we planned, she did nothing but complain and snap at people and sit in the corner whispering with her boyfriend. \n\nWe were also in a club together. It was Debate Club, and you had to pay dues to be in it. We were presenting a bill to be debated—one that I did literally all the work for— and her only job was to do the opening speech. That was it, a minute long synopsis of our bill. So I’m walking to the room Debate Club is in, I can see the door a few feet ahead of me, and I get a phone call from Kate saying she doesn’t have her club dues. “Should I go? I don’t think I should go.” Finally, even though I was going to do horribly without her, I said she shouldn’t come. I was just so done with how unreliable she was. She said thanks and hung up while I was mid-sentence. So I went in, tried to give the opening speech completely unprepared, and I did horribly (as expected). It was the worst public speech I’d ever given, which sucked because I’m normally extremely good at that. I burst into tears on stage and ran off. I literally couldn’t do it anymore. Two days later, I hear she’s talking shit about me behind my back, telling people (MY FRIENDS) that I told her to “get the hell out of Debate” and calling her an “unreliable bitch” and all that jazz. \n\nSo I texted her. “How dare you. How fucking dare you do all this shit  to me. You’ve been so mean and made me feel so mad about myself when all I’ve done is care about you.” And in the texts, I did say things that I don’t regret but we’re pretty damn mean— “all you do is smoke, fuck, and feel bad for yourself” “you step on other people’s balls to make yours feel bigger” “manipulative” “unreliable” etc. Then I blocked her number and that was that. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hi, first time poster here. So for context I’m in high school. The girl and myself are both 17. \n\nTL:DR at the bottom \n\n\nFor starters, we’ve know each other since we got to High School. It was always a chill thing, never super close. \nTwo years ago, she had a on/off thing with my best friend in a grade up. They were always never certain on anything. That changed when he moved across country. I was closer to her then, but still just acquainted. \n\nLast year however, her and I started to talk a lot more. She was always super spotty with texting back, but she said she was really busy and I went along. Summer break hit and as I tried to make plans, she’d leave me on read/opened constantly. I began to think of it personally. \n\nWe stopped contact until the start of 1st semester this year. We had a class together, right after lunch. I like to get to my classes a bit early on the first day, scope out who’s sitting where and make sure I can sit near someone I know. Where I ended up sitting, there was an open space right beside me. She walks in right before class started, sits down beside me and just starts talking to me like nothing at all. \n\nOver the course of the semester, we were close again. She again was still super spotty with responding to me. When my best friend came back for a week, she changed completely however. She was immediately responding to me, asking to hangout, etc. I took it with good graces, thinking she was trying harder. It was like that for a couple weeks, then she dropped off again.\nRight before winter break, we went on a trial-date of sorts and it went really well. I mentioned how I have a discount at a high-end restaurant because of some connections, so we went there. \nWinter Break hit, and she said she was travelling. I didn’t bother trying to talk to her as she said she’d have very little Wifi and such.\n\nShe comes back and we hangout a few times. She was always glued to her phone, never really paying any attention. I felt really bad about myself, thinking I did something wrong. \nWith 1st semester exams coming up, we didn’t talk as much due to studying. I was ok with that, still thinking I had done something wrong. Exams came and passed. We have no semester 2 classes together and she stopped responding to me completely. \n\nFinally a couple days ago she texted me asking if we go back to the restaurant for another date. I responded, with no reply for hours. Finally I texted my best friend to message her and see if she was just ignoring me. She replied to him immediately. I had had enough at that point and snapped at her, saying she only talked to me if she needed something. She swore me off, saying that I should know she rarely checks her phone and told me to never even look at her again. \n\nAITA or did I over-react?\n\nTL:DR, girl I know from school was very spotty with me. We had a kinda thing but she’d only respond consistently every so often. I called her out and cut her out of my life. AITA?",

      "description": "To give a bit of backstory, my ex and I had been dating since freshman year. We are both 18 now and about to graduate. A few months back she got a job at a department store and met a guy who would text her nonstop at all hours. I never gave it much thought until she got angry and defensive after I asked for her phone password while she was driving to change the song on Spotify. I asked her if it had anything to do with this guy from work, and got the \"you shouldn't worry about him\" talk in return. \n\n\n\n\nFast forward to this past weekend, I drove us down to San Diego just to hang out, which is give or take 2 hours away from our area. Everything had been going great all day, and we were waiting to order in a Denny's when she got all serious and dropped the absolute shocker of a lifetime. That guy wasn't just a friend, but she was *going to* cut him off after feeling super duper guilty, poor her. Iwas obviously still hurt, but mostly I was just pissed, so I stormed off, got in my car, and left her there.\n\n\n\n\nI pulled over a few miles away and she was blowing up my phone, apologizing, cussing me out, etc. In the middle of it all she did manage to tell me I had to come back and get her. I started to feel really guilty. She had her phone and wallet and all, but at this point with traffic, it would be around 3 hours before anyone would make it out to her. I didn't even know if her mom or sister were at work or not and able to go get her.  I gave thought to turning back, but eventually angrily texted her back to make her co-worker come get her.\n\n\n\n\nAnyways I still feel pretty shitty about the whole thing, in the moment I just couldn't fathom being in a car with her for hours listening to excuses. I've asked a few friends about this and have gotten really mixed responses about if I was in the wrong here. So Reddit, I trust you all more than any doctor or news site already, what's the verdict here?",

      "description": "Okay genuine question that requires some context: \n\nMy supervisor and I are quite good friends. However there are reoccurring instances where I find myself disagreeing with what has occurred. \n\nFor example, my supervisor has been leaving work during busy days to deal with personal issues that occurs. This was fine as a one-time thing, even a second-time thing,  however this began to occur repeatedly. It meant I had to cover their work and mine. I addressed this eventually after bottling my frustrations for so long and the situation somewhat resolved.\n\nI have now noticed that each time I work with my supervisor, his mates come over and strike up a conversation with him. Now I’m normally pretty chill about all that, I don’t mind a good yarn. However these can last for a long time...I’m talking like 30-45 minutes. This occurs one or twice during the day. \n\nToday his mates approached him and talked with him for about two hours - with him doing a task here and there if he needs to (e.g. me being out back and a client appears).  This obviously frustrated me as I’m picking up that workload again while they chat.\n\nI disclosed this with my supervisor who immediately began defending himself, stating that he wouldn’t apologise for that and argued that it doesn’t occur regularly...which it does. This led to a shutdown in the conversation as I didn’t want to engage with someone who was on the defensive, and therefore not willing to take on opposing perspectives.\n\nI later engaged with him and said I didn’t like the conversation and we talked briefly...but he still stood by his point and said he wouldn’t apologise for it. \n\nWe’re doing okay now but AITA for criticising him?

Since we have a young child and no family here, we have to attend counseling during work hours and take time off. It’s normally not a big deal, but I’ve been working super hard to try to get a promotion. As a result, I’ve recently been offered a four month trial, where I will get the promotion permanently if things go well. Due to this, I asked husband if we could take a break from counseling for a few weeks so I’m not seen as a slacker for immediately taking time off. He is extremely upset and told me that I wasn’t prioritizing him or the marriage. In the end, to avoid another big fight, I caved and agreed to take time off. My fingers are crossed that it will not affect anything.\n\nFrom my perspective, i just wanted to have a better first impression to help my chances of making it permanent. The promotion will help our financial situation (I am more of the breadwinner due to a much higher salary) and relieve some of the stress. What do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole?",

I have promised myself then when I do become a mother I will never raise my child like how I was raised.\n\nFast forward to having the 3rd member of our family...my pregnancy was smooth, no complications and I didnt really hate being pregnant. What traumatized me was post birth, recovery and basically the next 2.5yrs of the child's upbringing. Probably TMI but I had significant tearing, hemorrhoids, couldnt breastfeed, sleep deprived for 2yrs, my husband could not tolerate the sleep deptivation so he took it out on me and basically no support from either family which made me feel really lonely. This along with my childhood I guess had led me to being diagnosed with clinical severe depression and anxiety which I have been battling by the scrape of my teeth (some days I just dont want to live on this Earth).\n\nAll of that has led me deciding to not having any more children as I dont want to deal with all that trauma again, whereas my husband wants otherwise. Essentially I will be the main caregiver (unless he grows a vagina and a pair of boobs to keep it alive). I told him what I've mentioned here but he's adamant it'll be different the next round because that's what everyone's been telling him and it'll be good for our 3 y.o. to have a sibling.\n\nAITA here or should I compromise????",

      "description": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons. This is a long story so I will have to give a lot of background...\n\nI (M21) have been with my girlfriend (F20) for over 2 years now and we have been long distance (LDR) for 1.5 years in college. It was a great relationship at first but things have really gone downhill since then. I believe it's been her mom.\n\nHer mom has always been suuuuper involved in our relationship. Like, she knew right away when we had sex for the first time, knows every single date we go on, and knows every argument we've been in. That last one is the main point of this post.\n\nMy girlfriend tells her mom everything. I find the \"my mom is my best friend\" thing a bit much but I can live with that. But it's gotten to the point of telling her to not give me attention, ignore me, not ask me what's wrong, and saying stuff like schools first and things of that sort. I know that's her mom telling her to say that stuff because she wasn't like this before.\n\nWe haven't had sex in a long time because she thinks that's all I want, when it never used to be like that. Her mom also says she \"just wants her to be happy\" but that's a way for her to want to know everything and tell her what to do. Her mom thinks she's right about everything and I hate that attitude. \n\nIt has gotten to the point where I can't express my emotions because then it comes out as me \"not being confident\" or \"having trust issues\" when all I want is more communication in our LDR and more affection. Her mom is completely controlling her emotions and her life and it's taking a huge toll on me. I don't feel like I can keep this relationship going. \n\n**My girlfriend has specifically said she SENDS her mom texts before she sends them to me for APPROVAL. Is it just me or is this weird?! I'm close with my parents but would never ever do that.\n\nFor the record, I am not needy or clingy. All I ask her for is a 15 minute phone call every 2-3 days when we're away and that's apparently too much even though we barely communicate over text. I know her mom is telling her to say \"schools first\" because she's used that BS line on me before. So manipulative and controlling.\n\nShould a mom have that big of an influence on her daughter's relationship, even though she's in her twenties? I think this is a case of extreme helicopter parenting but I want to hear everyone's opinion.\n\n*I'm missing a lot of details but this is the rough summary*\n\nAITA for wanting to break up with my girlfriend because her mom is making me feel like I'm suffocating in this relationship??

I’ve known this girl for awhile, 3 years, and about 6 months ago, we became romantically interested in one another.\nBut she recently got out of a bad relationship, and said she wasn’t ready to jump into another one. Which I respected. She said she wanted to explore her options a little first as well. Which I also respected.\nAbout 3 months in, things were going great. She told me she was interested in this other girl who was nearby and it was the reason we technically weren’t dating. She also promised that’d she’d be all mine and soon. \nWell she started getting a little distant, talked to me less, which granted she’s busy with school and I am with work. But it became less and less and she seemed disinterested in even talking to me.\nI asked her if she still wanted me and she finally said that things were going really well for her and that girl and that she wanted to see where it went.\nIt’s been 6 months. And this was getting frustrated, so I finally told her she needs to choose between the two of us, because I’ve had my heart played with for too long. I want a relationship, not these games.\nShe replied that she already gave me her answer about seeing where things went and to take it or leave it.\nSo I left, and told her I’m done with it. ",

      "title": "AITA For Losing Interest In My Ex Fiance After She Cheated?",
      "description": "I'll try to make this as quick as possible. Me and my ex fiance had a good relationship going for about three years before she decided to pop the question. I was excited and I said yes immediately and was looking forward to our future together. \n\nAbout 2 months later I notice that she's becoming increasingly stressed for seemingly no reason. I worry a lot about her because she has been diagnosed bipolar in the past and though she was pretty much fine in the last 2 years I was worried it was resurfacing. She was also having a lot of trouble with some of the people I considered my friends at the time who were pushing her away and trying to create space between me and her which was driving her crazy (as they were supposed to be her friends as well). \n\nI was obviously sympathetic to her as I cared about her a lot and wanted to make sure my girlfriend now-fiance was doing okay. So I tried to help her out, encouraged her to meet people and make friends as I figured that would be healthy for her. I suggested therapy and possibly medication as it appeared the Bipolar symptoms were re-surfacing but she refused that for a time as she didn't want to go back on meds.\n\nA little more time goes on, it's now apparent that bi-polar is really kicking in and she began telling me things like \"I don't know if I can even feel love right now\". During this time she has become increasingly close to one our co-workers (we all worked in the same place.) At first to me it's fine, I think it's good for her to have her own friends. As time goes on they spend increasing amounts of time together while spending a less than average amount of time with me. After a bit I outright ask if there is any feelings or anything I should be worried about there and she denies it completely insisting that it's nothing.\n\nPass a little more time, he comes into work with a hickey on his neck and I pretty much knew something was up. My friends (unknowingly to me) invite this guy to a party, get him drunk and ask about the hickey horrified to figure out that it was from my Fiance at the time. They let me know, I let her know I know, and then interestingly she breaks it off with both me and the other guy (though they are still friends) and comes to me to apologize.\n\nThis is where it gets complicated. She came to me apologizing and crying about what had happened. How it was the worst mistake in her life and she regrets everything that she did. She tells me she doesn't know what to do without me in her life and she doesn't want to lose me. And honestly, I think she was sincere, and I don't think she would do this again.\n\nHowever that was about 6 months ago. Since then me and her have been in a sort limbo. After about a month I began telling her that I do care about her and want whats best for her and things could be worked out with a lot of talking and time. She was telling me she doesn't know what she wants  or whats healthy for her, or if she was even in the right mental state to make a decision like that. She told me that I might have to be okay with just being friends with her and not necessarily expect a relationship. Over time being told this over and over again, though I offered her support and advised her to see professional help I began drifting away from her slowly.\n\nTwo weeks ago, after not having seen much of any progress at all being made, I told her I was ready to move on. It was hard because we both still cared about each other but it seemed apparent that  nothing was about to change. I left that day, and then she turned around the next morning now confident that she wanted to try to patch things up with me.\n\nTo me it's just feels like it's been a little too long and too late.\n\nTLDR: Fiance cheated, she apologized, I told her we could patch things up then 6 months later when she was ready I had moved on.\n\nAm I the asshole for saying we could patch things up then switching when she was ready?

      "description": " A couple years ago, I came out to a friend of mine (we'll call her A). At the time I came out to her we weren't super close, but she kind of forced me to come out and she ended up being super supportive. Flash forward a year I come out to a mutual friend of ours (we'll call him B), and he confessed to me that A had told him a while ago, about a week after I'd come out to her. Now, I'm not super confrontational, but I was upset so I called A to talk to her about what B told me and immediately denied it, saying she would never hurt me or betray my trust like that, then she states he must have figured it out himself because I don't look very straight. She was adamant that B was lying, but when I pointed out B didn't have any reason to lie and she started crying, \"how can you not believe me?\" I got really uncomfortable so I offered to talk to her about this a different time when she'd calmed down but she seemed even more offended by this saying she didn't need me to coddle her feelings. Okay, that's fine, but as the conversation progressed she got so emotional I ended up hanging up. I called her the day after to talk about it, and she was determined that B had lied, and that she was upset that I didn't believe her. She said it so forcefully I started to believe her but after pondering it for a bit I decided I wasn't entirely sure if I did believe her and that's where the tables turned. She started screaming about how we were \"basically best friends\" and \"how can you believe him over me?\" In the end I backed down and said I believed her even though I didn't. Flash forward a couple months and a classmate of mine tells me that A had outed me to them about a week after A outed me to B. At this point I'm flabbergasted, A wasn't even friends with this person, I barely knew this person, why the fuck did they know that I was gay before I was even out? That's when I decided to cut A out of my life. There were other really shitty things she'd done to me but that was my breaking point. I told her I had no interest in being friends anymore, this did not end well and she basically told me to fuck off. Now about a year and a half later I'd been at an event with a couple friends and my girlfriend. A ended up being there. I avoided her for the entire the night, but I wasn't obvious about it. A on the other hand, make a big scene when talking to my friends, hoping to catch me at some point. At one point she talked to my girlfriend for over 30 minutes and I just avoided them both for that period. The day after, a couple friends told me that A was really upset that she didn't get to see me and that I didn't say hi. My girlfriend said that I was being rude and immature by going so out of my way to avoid A, but I genuinely had no interest in ever talking to her again once I found out what kind of person she was, but a couple of other people seem to agree what I did was petty.

      "title": "AITA for limiting my roommate's time with his partner in our apartment when I'm home?",
      "description": "I apologize that this is *extremely* long.\n\nSo he's not my roommate any more. He moved out last week.\n\nHe was and is a great friend, and we'd known each other for years. We were pretty tight and he knows probably more scarring secrets about me than any other person on the planet. He came from an abusive home life where was homeschooled, had information like his SS card and birth certificate hidden and withheld, his dad held him emotionally captive, and his step mom was verbally and physically abusive. Prior to moving in with me, he stayed in the adjacent house belonging to his dead grandmother, with no plumbing or electric. He's from way up north.\n\nA few years into our friendship we resolved that when I got my own apartment in my current town, the stars aligned; it wasn't instant, but I moved him down here, much further south. I helped him get his paperwork in order to get the documents necessary for job hunting.\n\nDisclaimer: I've never lived with a roommate outside of family and one year of college. It does not suit me, I do not like it, and I appreciate my privacy. I've not been in a relationship for more than a decade. I'm 27 now. He knows all of this.\n\nI moved him in anyway, out of a brotherhood and deep friendship. We'd never actually met face to face, so I cautiously added him as an additional occupant rather than another party to the lease. This protected me, but it also gave him the benefit of ignoring rent aside from just paying it to me.\n\nWhen he moved he didn't have a job; it took four months. I paid for those first four months, rent and food and utilities for the both of us. I also helped him get his job, just a mere ten minute walk away (he can't drive). I'm not trying to get points. I'd never ask for repayment, but I feel it's important for the ensuing events.\n\nWe agreed he would simply pay half rent, no utilities, and could help with the groceries later. In exchange he did the lion's share of the chores and cooked (something no one wants me to do). Rent went up $25 and I just didn't bother making adjustments. Utilities only amounted to about $150 all told, so I ate the costs.\n\nChores: He washed the dishes because without him there wouldn't be a mess to wash, and he was paying less for exactly this purpose. When he moved in there was a flea problem as well as a roach problem, so he was also vacuuming every day. As the fleas got under control, he vacuumed once or twice a week, and then stopped entirely. The roaches also got under control, and then he got lax about doing the dishes and leaving trash in his room (both things I explicitly discussed with him long before he moved in). We did the laundry as needed, and I take care of all cat related chores and costs (I have two).\n\nAll was fine until he started seeing this girl. He'd started getting lax already, but when they started talking it really went downhill. He grew increasingly distant and would chat with me briefly and then lock himself in his room for hours talking to her every night. Before I said something about the volume he never even shut his door.\n\nFirst she constantly wanted me to text her as well, and chat, and we'd all be friends. That's just not my personality, nothing against her. Then I'd be going out the door to work and she'd be meeting me at the door to come in. Then she'd be there when I got home. This happened a couple of times before I set some boundaries. I said some stuff about not wanting her to be here all the time. I have a tone problem I've been told. One day they weren't here so I texted to see if they were coming home with a lighthearted joke about being able to strip down and do whatever if they weren't, which apparently made her uncomfortable (even though I didn't text her) because I'd been so cold leading up to all of this. Then they got here and my roommate made her stand outside in 30 degree weather under the assumption I didn't want her inside at all, which I clarified was not the case. He came to get her things, but when I told him they could come the fuck inside because of course, it's freezing, they went into his room, shut the door, and stayed there for 4 or 5 hours until about 1AM. I worked the next day, and it's a small apartment.\n\nSo I clarified my rules.\n\nThey were simple rules, maybe a bit strict. Basically it was just \"be mindful of my schedule, don't have her here for ages if I'm going to be home, and don't have sex on the cats (a real rule I added to express what I thought was the levity of the situation...and also I didn't want to clean splooge off of my cats)\". These were never respected to any real degree. She just ended up being here one specific day a week (a work day for me, so I got to come home to it) until about 1AM each time. I never said anything about it directly, but my frustration probably showed.\n\n*Then* things got a little more tense, about a month later. I was sick one day, and he made dinner shortly after I woke up in the evening. The evening before was her usual evening, and they were together the whole time locked in his room until the usual time. While I was preparing to eat, unshowered and looking a mess, he lightly and happily added that she was also on her way over because she wanted some of his tortellini. Well I lost my cool, snapped, and told him that it was inconsiderate and I was going to go take a shower. He didn't understand *why* I thought it was inconsiderate, and neither did I. He told me I didn't have to get ready or anything just because she was coming over. I disagreed. I later realized the reason I was upset was because he never even thought to ask; he just invited her. He doesn't need my permission, but that had just been our relationship up to that point. The jury was still out on whether I thought any of that was fair.\n\nAnyway I sulked in my room, and didn't speak to anyone (pretty much no different than any other time they were here except I wasn't sulking). Finally he opens the door and tells me she wants to talk. I don't want to talk, and tell him as much. He repeats his statement, I say \"[Roommate], I don't want to talk to [GF] right now\". I need time to think through my emotions, or I say things I don't mean or haven't processed fully. A few seconds later she barges into my hallway adjacent to his room and starts going off about how I have a problem and we're going to discuss it. I just continued sitting at the computer, looking away from her and doing my thing while she rambled on, getting frustrated. Occasionally I'd reiterate that I didn't want to talk right now. Didn't matter.\n\nEventually she gets me to crack and I spout off a laundry list of problems I have, largest of them being the slacking off of chores (in private I also explained to my roommate that when I'm here I'd rather they be playing Smash Bros. together in the living room than locked in his room fucking, or taking showers together). As I listed off my problems she'd give me a sassy \"mhm?\" and repeated this about 7 or 8 times. Finally I stopped complaining and simply said that \"her sassy 'mhm's?' weren't doing her any favors and the longer she went on the less I wanted her here at all\". That ended the conversation, and later she apparently cried. I was fully prepared to not speak to my roommate until after my pre-planned vacation, but he was amenable the next night, and we talked it out. He also talked it out with her, and it didn't go as smoothly behind closed doors. Full disclosure, I 100% eavesdropped on the conversation against my better judgement.\n\nAll I asked him to do was watch my cats while I was gone for the week. They were free to stay here and do whatever. I also found this an appropriate time to raise his rent from $400 to $500. I didn't do this solely as a punishment, though; I did it in exchange for doing *all* the chores. I would clean, wash dishes, and deal with the miscellany on top of what I already did. He told me he thought he should *only* pay half. So I calculated it for him.\n\nThings went on pretty much the same after I got back, except I never saw his GF again. Period. It went back to talking on the phone, except this time much earlier, and for much longer. He pretty much stopped cooking or doing anything outside of his room. Then he told me he was moving out, last week. He had applied for a job and had an interview; if he got it he was going to move out. I didn't realize the urgency in all this when he said it. I literally did not see him again after he told me he had the job. He stayed over at her place for several days, did a few more interviews...and then I got an email from my property manager saying he'd removed himself from the lease. An hour later he texted me and told me he wanted to give a proper goodbye but \"needed to get early rates on the apartment\" as if he couldn't move his stuff after signing the lease, and had moved all of his stuff out; he can't drive, so he just wasn't going to go to his last few shifts for his old job. The only job he's ever had. He had to pay the security deposit so he had to split his payments. He'd already paid me half earlier in the month before he mentioned anything, and then paid $150 with the breakup text he sent me. Conveniently he only paid $400 the one month he'd been asked to pay more. And like that he was gone. He asked me to hold his mail.\n\nWe exchanged some words after this all settled in, and, well, frankly ESH for the texts. Basically I just wanted more time; he'd needed a month if he was on the lease! That's after the fact, though. It hurts having to suddenly make up for $400 a month I didn't have to worry about, and it hurts that he basically did all of this behind my back. Mostly I just feel betrayed, but I'm not sure how at fault I am for the way this has all played out. My parents, friends, and coworkers are of course biased and they don't want to read 10,000 character",

      "description": "TL;DR: Told two coworkers to stop chatting within earshot of their team members, got told off for “public shaming.” AITA?\n\nFor context, my work environment is VERY busy and fast-paced. People work towards very stressful deadlines, and if you’re contributing as you should, there is almost zero downtime. This day, I had a very intense workload, as did the 5-person team I supervise. We were all stressed.\n\nEnter two coworkers, I’ll call them Rima and Lucy. Both are women in their mid-20s. I am not their supervisor, but was well-within earshot of them, as we have one of those terrible open office spaces. Their supervisor was leaving in two weeks and very much checked-out. \n\nRima (who has put in her notice) and Lucy, are  junior, hourly employees who have been chatting nonstop for about an hour. I know it’s not work related based on some words I pick up. For several minutes, I wait for their supervisor or another senior employee on their team to intervene, but none of them do. Most of the managers at my company are young, and many of them are very non-confrontational. I’m getting increasingly frustrated.\n\nI use the internal chat system to message a senior staff member in their row who ignores me. At one point, I go to the kitchen to get a snack, and another junior employee on their team complains to me that he can’t do his work because of the talking. \n\nAt that point, I go up to them in their row and say: “guys, the chatting has to stop. This is a common working environment.” They have guilty looks on their faces and stop talking, and I go back to my work. I told them off within earshot of their row, but with a normal speaking voice. Ie. Not excessively loudly. \n\nThe next day, I find out that Rima complained to the department manager, feeling like she was disrespected because she was “publicly shamed.” The manager tells me off about it, and tells me I should have brought them into another room and talked to them privately. I apologize for creating a situation my manager had to deal with, but told her I was on fundamental disagreement with her point of view.  \n\nMy opinion is that the burden of expectations should be on staff to act professionally, not for managers to disrupt their work flow to walk on eggshells around disrespectful employees. Besides, pulling them into a separate room would have been just as conspicuous given the office layout. \n\nI was certain I was in the right but when I vented about it privately to a friend of mine in the office also told me I was in the wrong. His opinion also bothers me, as he told me that I should have “used the opportunity to act as a female mentor to young women instead of berate them.” I find this attitude to be paternalistic (shouldn’t women my age be expected to be as professional as everyone else?), and puts an extra expectation of emotional labor on me, who already has a team to manage. I also have an odd sense that there is a gender dimension to this as I frequently tell the male members of the tech team to lower their voices when they’re talking about memes, but nobody has ever taken issue with that. \n\nAITA? \n\n\n",

      "description": "I  am a night-shift employee at a fairly small gas station and convenience  store in a VERY small town (Less than 500 people small.) This gas station usually plays host to a group of older men in the mornings who like to come play cribbage and drink coffee that the management gives them for free.\n\nOne  particular man, who for the rest of the post will be referred to as M,  has never worked for our location, nor any other location in our chain. However, He constantly speaks to myself and the other younger  members of our staff as though he is our supervisor. When he isn't doing  this, he is simply making rude or snide comments about us either  directly to us or to the others in his group.\n\nSimply put, M comes in every day, and after he's done with cribbage, fills our coolers if something is low. He has to go back into what would normally be employee only areas to do this most of the time, and is very nasty to the rest of the staff about it.\n\nWith  all the context out of the way, I go in to work one day to find that the general manager had  to come in to cover the morning shift.  We switch tills, and while the GM is  going back to take midday count of her till and our slot machine payout  funds, M comes up to me and tells me, word for word, \"Now I went around  and filled up all those coolers, and they'd BETTER look like that when I  come in in the morning.\"\n\nFrustrated, I  go to the GM and essentially  said that I'm sick of M speaking to me like he's my boss, and that he  shouldn't really be doing anything that he does around here in the first  place, even if it can be helpful sometimes. My boss, likely frustrated  already considering she shouldn't have had to be there that day, told me  that she was thrust into that shift, and that they were swamped in the  morning, so he was just helping her out. I told him what he had said to  me and she told me, quote, \"It's not always about you. And sometimes  people on the night shift, not you, but people on the night shift leave  the coolers empty. Ron's just being helpful so you'll just have to learn  to ignore him.\" I decided not to press further after that, frustrated.\n\nWithin this statement,  there's the implication that I, as practically the only night shift  worker we have, do not fill the coolers properly at night. I fill the  coolers to the point where they look full every night before I leave,  but if there are three or more bottle in a row, or the cans/bottles are  large and bulky like Arizona tea cans or tall 38 oz cans, I typically  leave them. I also don't fill the rows completely, because as stated  above, pushing the bottles/cans all the way to the back results in them  falling behind the shelves entirely, or makes the more top heavy bottles  fall over and out of the coolers when they're meant to slide down.\n\nSo  Long Story short, I think M should be asked not to return to the store. AITA?",

      "description": "Hey all, little backstory. I'm in my 3rd semester of college, and my friend is a senior in high school. A few months or so ago, I'm scrolling through social media when I see they post that they're at a party. They're being very loud, and they're jumping up and down to music, something that is totally out of character for them. They were always the quiet type, especially when I saw them at school around other people.\n\nI send them a text saying \"Looks like fun haha\", a couple hours later they reply with gibberish. I ask what they said and they just reply \"I'm so drunk\", and a picture of alcohol on a table. All I reply is \"that's probably not the smartest thing you could have done.\" \n\nThe next morning they ask what I meant. I just said that them getting drunk, especially at their age (16), isn't the smartest thing you could do. Automatically they got defensive, saying they had a good time and that they were with friends. They said that the alcohol let them unwind and have a good time.\n\nI reply saying that it's good they had a good time, but alcohol shouldn't be the reason you had fun, and that they did something that they wouldn't do normally while sober. We basically went back and forth for an hour or so, them justifying it because they had fun, and me just saying it wasn't a smart thing.\n\nMultiple times throughout the argument, they'd say \"can we just ignore this\", but then they would try to get the last word in, usually along the lines of \"I'm still going to drink I don't care what you say,\" to which I'd respond to and start the argument again. It then evolved to them telling me that I was taking the easy way through life by going to college. Eventually, I had enough, and said that we should apologize to each other, and they said they had nothing to apologize for. I left it at that, and it's been months since we last spoke.\n\nI never, throughout that entire conversation, say \"you should not, or can not drink.\" All I said was \"it wasn't a smart thing to do\". It was simply just advice. I don't care if people drink, but it was just a mixture of their age as well as how they acted that worried me. They were with friends and they didn't drive home, and they assured me that they'd only drink around people they knew.\n\nWas I out of line? I felt it wasn't really my business, and I sort of knew this person was stubborn, so telling them anything would probably not be effective anyways. I knew they weren't going to say \"You know, you're right\", but I figured it wouldn't hurt to just say something. ",

His friend and his girlfriend want to come with us and stay in the same place those nights too and I'm against it.\n\nI don't want them to mostly because I don't like his friend and he's always trying to start petty arguments with me and I just want to enjoy my time. I also feel like Valentine's day should be just for us. \n\nThe thing is that this is has been brought up and asked about 3 times now and everytime I've said I'd rather them not come. So today, my boyfriend brought it up again and I got mad about it. I got mad because I've said no twice already. He then got mad back and was like \"whatever I guess we'll do whatever YOU WANT.\" So after that I was kinda like \"you know what? I really don't care if they come at this point. Let them, I. Do. Not. Care.\" Which didn't help of course but I really didn't even care. He kept asking and even after he know how I felt, he just kept asking so I felt worn down and just gave in.\n\nI wanna add that I've been asking him for ideas on anything he would want to do but I just really didn't wanna be around his friend during Valentine's day. So is it still me making it all about what I want to do and being an asshole about it?\n\nSo AITA? Is this something I should have just said yes to in the beginning? ",

Most of my grade, as well as my friend don't share the same concerns as I do, many of them have been drinking for years. I have a couple friend's  who also don't drink, but this one friend in particular has been influenced by those in my grade (and out of curiosity) to try drinking, and intends to at an upcoming party (she's never been to one, nor have I). Since i'm not going to the party, I've told her to not drink and voiced my concerns (technically it's illegal since the drinking age here is 18) but she's already invested in it. Today I was more persistent and again pressured her not to do it, I admit I may have come off as a bit pushy since I was irritated due to some other people mocking me for not drinking. Anyway we started arguing about it and a couple of my other friend joined the conversation and took her side, which was even more frustrating. We ended the argument both pissed and upset with each other. I'm at the point where I don't think I should care anymore. I am genuinely worried about her but I don't think theres anything I can do.

First I thought that I should leave, but I decided to be a better person and forget about her.  We were in the same room for 7 hours, and I didn't care about her at all! I had such a good time. Until she asks where my boyfriend is. I told her that he was home. Then she asks why we blocked her. And I said that I didn't want to talk to her, and that she knew why.   \nI turned around and was about to talk to my friend. But she kept on saying that she had no idea what she did, and that she hadn't done anything...  \nI told her that I knew because I've seen their messages and I've seen what she wrote to him. Then she goes on saying that she would never do that because she had a boyfriend.   \nSo I got mad.. Because she lied and because she was saying all of this infront of all the people. So I said that she was a ''fucking cunt''. And stormed out of the party and went home. \n\nThen today I get a message from her on facebook. Where she wrote that I was childish and an asshole. I just texted back and said that it was two years ago and how I couldn't understand why she would bring it up infront of everyone.   \n\n\nI am anxious about the situation because I am a really shy person..

If it hadn't been for my best friend who picked me up last second it would have ended bad. Now I move to a new apartment and want to stop all communication with her.\n\nMore info: I struggle with depression for a very long time, I am 25 now an have spend ~2,5 years in institutsions and ~2 years in state financed rehab to help me find work (I am from Germany and glad we have so advanced help here). I had some really bad episodes and 2 (thank god) failed suicide attempts. But i try my best to not dwell in my sickness and become a usefull member of society and repay all the help. I was beaten by my mother and dad I  have forgiven them what had happened, knowing they didn't knew better and I don't want live in anger the rest of my life. In recent years I was not an easy son. I began occasionally smoking weed, and taking some other drugs (I stopped everything except sometimes weed). Sometimes I am moody and get annoyed quick. \nI have gotten in fights with my mother before and she told me multiple times I should finaly go and end it, and that I was her biggest mistake and I am an disappointment. She had a horrible father and really bad childhood (she is also struggling mentally and I think she is on her way to becoming an alcoholic) \n\nI would have no problem seizing all communication with her if it wasn't for my dad. We had our problems too but in the last few years he tried hard to turn things around, he accepted his guild for beating me and apologized (my mom never did this). He supports when ever necessary and sets things in motion with his excellent connections in our community. He is a family man and family is the most important thing to him. I know it will break his heart seeing his core family break apart.\n\nSo will I be the ashole? ",

      "description": "Sounds bad, but hear me out. I (19M) am in an LDR with a girl (17f) from India. I have yet to notice any problems with our relationship, and she has never once even mildly irritated me until now. She's currently taking her year end exams, I won't pretend I'm entirely clear on how the education system works where she is but it's somewhat equivalent to American high school finals. She's relying on these scores to get into med school, which she considers the only option as far as her future goes. She has been studying day and night for these exams for months, and while she's rightfully nervous, some of the stuff she's been saying is just rubbing me the wrong way. She took the first test yesterday, her math exam, and has been crying ever since she got home from it, saying she's going to feel guilty for the rest of her life. Due to her own calculations, she got a 95% on this test, giving herself some room for error she's settling with a 91%. she hasn't received any results and I'm not sure how she determined this on her own just from taking it and analyzing how hard it was but she says shes positive shes in the lower A range and its tearing her apart. Now I know cultural differences are a factor in this, as I'm from the US and probably the laziest/most laid back part of it at that, beachside in Florida. Also, probably more prominent is family differences, a lot of pressure is put on her from her parents, and her mom projects on her, telling her how much she still regrets the scores she got on those tests. I know it's probably coming from my own insecurity as I was a teenage runaway and never finished high school, dropping out at age 17 and doing random odd jobs/freelancing for a living, which I am still doing. It just gets under my skin a bit when she got an A on her math final and is hysterical about it not being an A+, saying her entire life could possibly be ruined. Now, I've not said a word about this bothering me, and I dont intend to, ive been giving her the greatest support I can, but I feel a little guilty for mentally undermining her struggles. AITA for feeling like she's being kind of dramatic? It's not like she scored poorly, or even knows what she truly scored yet.",

He was really secretive and wouldn’t tell me who it was.\n\nThat same friend who told the guy to confess told me it was really obvious who his crush was and was surprised I didn’t get it. \n\nEventually though from all the teasing from me and the way everyone acted around me and him, I got the message. And I was nervous because I didn’t reciprocate those feelings.\n\nBut then time came and he wanted to talk to me by the school halls during lunch and he wanted to talk with me by the window. I become confused but do it anyways, only to find him confessing to me.\n\nPanicking because I, again, didn’t like him that way, I go ahead and say “I’m flattered, thanks” and smiled. It was really awkward and I broke the silence and asked “So what do you want me to say” and he just says it’s fine and offers me an Oreo but I say I’m on a diet because he confessed a day before prom.\n\nI got reprimanded by another friend for not giving him a chance and not liking him back. I argued that I can’t force feelings that aren’t there and that at least I didn’t lead him on or anything. We both agreed to disagree and ended it at that.\n\nDays later of everyone forcing me to dance with him during half my prom night even if I was unhappy, people teasing me with him and flirting with me for him, I thought it was repulsive but I did nothing. \n\nNow I can’t even talk normally to him as a friend because he either tries to flirt with me or guilt trips me for what I said and repeats it in our conversations and it’s annoying. \n\nI no longer feel like wanting to hang around with him because of that but I can’t help but forget we had a good friendship before this and I feel bad wanting to ignore it over this.\n\nHonestly, the guilt tripping is kind of working and I keep wondering lately if I should have just toughened up and pretended to like him back. And my actual crush told me that he overheard I rejected the guy who confessed to me. I didn’t think it’d spread like wildfire that way. \n\nSo far only two people who I have talked about how I felt agreed with me and the rest have pretty much subtly or downright described me as an asshole for this. I’m really unsure at this point, but nearly everyone thinks I’m an asshole so :/\n",

      "description": "When searching for an officiant for our wedding, I skipped over the cheapest one because he said that due to religious beliefs, he doesn’t perform same sex marriages. My fiancé and I are not the same sex. We are man and woman, but I am strongly pro-equality. I couldn’t see someone handling the most important day of my life knowing they don’t feel the same way about marriage as I do. So I went with a more expensive option and the officiant I hired has the same beliefs as my fiancé and I.\n\nMy sister says it was rude of me to skip the cheapest option since other people are footing most of our wedding bill and that it was more important to be considerate of them. She says, I’m not gay so why does it matter?\n\nI feel strongly about this but my sister made me wonder if I should have swallowed my pride and just taken the cheaper route for the sake of those who are helping pay.",

We have been good friends since 3rd grade. So I have some respect for her since she is a long time friend. But recently I have a change of mind. The reason for this is because she is very violent.\n\nI was shipping two of my friends for no reason and I told both of them. One of them was chill about it but the other really wasn't and was kinda mad. I don't know why but I started to poke fun at the friend like occasionally saying the ship (I know dick move.)  That when in digital art my long time friend heard about the ship and was not happy. She was also mad that I was on hacker typer and singing Africa by toto. She said if I didn't stop she would choke me I thought of it as an empty threat and continued.\n\n She then proceeded to put her hand around my neck and choke me it hurt slightly not really that hard. But I was just astonished at this that she would do that. I didn't tell the teacher I don't know why but I was mad. I didn't tell her anything but I am still mad this happened a week ago. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to cut ties with her.",

      "description": "So some backstory here. A few days ago, my BIL got arrested for some involvement with drugs. I'm not going to get into all the details, but it's been especially hard on our family given that my MIL is a police officer in the same municipality and our nephew was present. We had heard some rumors, but it's his first time around with this kind of thing, and it was still a shock to us. Everyone is on an emotional rollercoaster right now, myself included. \n\nWord spread pretty fast about what happened. Most people have either avoided the subject completely unless I bring it up, or offered their support and that was the end of it. Then comes this friend, we'll call her Sam for the sake of the story. Sam and I have only known each other for maybe 6 months.\n\nSam starts out by texting me, asking how I'm doing. I tell her I'm doing alright, thank her for the concern. She starts pushing the subject further, asking for more details. I tell her that I'm not really in the mood to discuss the situation. She didn't take the hint. She kept pushing further and further, so I was just very short with her. I didn't say anything rude. She starts asking if she upset me. I told her no, I just don't want to talk. However, I'm starting to get pretty upset. She keeps apologizing for possibly upsetting me, and then starts turning the conversation to her own family problems, and trying to compare them to my situation. By this point, I've had it, so I just quit answering her before I got to the point that I did say something rude. She's texted me several times over the last day or so now, but I still haven't answered her. This kind of behavior freaks me out a bit, especially since I've only known her for a few months. I'm also not a very open and social person. Everyone that's ever been around me knows this.\n\nPart of me feels like an asshole for ignoring her. However, I feel like I gave her enough indication that I didn't want to talk about it. AITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "My fiance and I have been together for 7 years now and have an almost 6 year old son together.\n\nAlmost 3 years ago now we had broken up for about a month. During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.",

      "description": "Throwaway because people know my username. Also Im on mobile so sorry for any errors. \n\nFor starters, Im a girl in highschool so Im still living with my parents. We have an attic which we keep a bunch of random stuff in. \n\nOccasionally Ill need something from the attic, and I end finding a bunch of other old stuff. About a year ago I found an old tin with my pokemon cards in it.  They were all curled and dusty from age so they were all worthless. After finding them though, I started to get back into collecting them. \n\nI dont have that huge of a collection now but I do have a few nice cards that Ive pulled that I keep in binders in my attic. (My parents didnt really know I was collecting again before the incidents)\n\nSome days of the week my elementary school aged cousin comes to our house after school to wait for his mom to get off work (shes a nurse). My parents went through the attic to find any of my old art supplies they could find for him to keep himself busy.\n\nThen though, they started pulling out my binders of cards to show and probably give him. I got kind of lucky and walked downstairs immediately after he opened the first binder to look and I just said something along the lines of “Just remember, please only look at them and don’t take any”. And he said okay and that was that. It was just me and him in the room. \n\nAbout a week later my mom knocked on my door and asked if my cousin could have my cards. I said he can look at them but I really dont want to give them to him. We bickered so we just made a deal that I would give him a couple of them. We went through them together and I gave him some cards that I had duplicates of that he wanted, and I actually probably gave him about 60 different cards. So you know, a decent amount to an elementary schooler. Again, all was fine. This happened in the early summer of 2018. \n\nAlso, I told my mom later why I didnt want to give them away. \n\nLast week, my cousin came and knocked on my door and asked if he could have my cards or if “I still liked them”. I apologized and said that I did still like them, and he said okay. I learned later that he came down the stairs dissapointed. Ever since then my family seem to be annoyed with me.  I asked my mom about it and she said that nobody could understand why I wouldnt just give the cards to him, and I explained to her that I had spent money I earned at my job on many of the cards and I actually use (trade / sell / play) them, and they probably would just sit on his shelf. \n\n\nTLDR; my elementary age cousin wants Pokémon cards that I bought and my family is annoyed at me because I dont want to give them to him. \n\n\nSo AITA? I understand he is only a kid and also part of my family, and I honestly do feel kind of guilty by not giving them to him.  But I bought them with my own money. I was never mean about it to him or anyone. ",

A week or two ago I was at hers hanging out and she got a call from her friend who asked if she was doing anything today, to which she said no, and if she wanted to come out, which she said she’d ask. Taking in mind no mention of me to her friend and no offer of invitation so I felt like wtf and asked her if she wanted to go see them (when I had travelled over 2 hours to see her and we had a fun thing planned (at her house)). And she said ‘yeah kinda’ so I was like wtf and got my stuff and left with trying to act okay and not mad because I felt so shocked.\nAnyway that still kind of bugged me and then just now I messaged her this long sad message which I wanted emotional support on and then sent her a message a few minutes later because on this group chat she got added to with my friends who she’s just met and spoken to once she was @tted I made a joking comment about it. Anyway I check back and no reply to me but there was an instant reply to my friend who she barely knows and she never uses discord, that’s the only chat she has on it so not like she clicked on it for convenience so idk why she chose to reply some person she barely knows over me first, especially when I was wanting support but I’m just hurt and got annoyed at her.

She left last night from my moms which is near my place, and when she did my mom told her she is not going to pick her up, so make sure she can get a ride back because it seems like her friends didn't seem to want to pick her up anyway, so she probably wont have a ride back, and my sister said they definitely would give her one. Well they didn't and she called my mom, who of course said no, so she then called me, asked me, which I told her I didnt want to drive that far because my u joint in my truck is bad, and I really dont want to risk it.  I told her I'd think about it and she said angrily fine, I called her back and said if she can get them to give her a ride half way back I would come get her, she got mad and said that her friend wouldn't do that then hung up, I feel like a dick because my inner big brother says go get her, but my adult says dont risk your vehicle and she was the one who decide to go three hours away instead of spending time with family who has actively tried to spend time with her",

      "description": "Hi all! New here! This situation has been bothering me because I do not know if it was the right decision or not. TL;DR at the end\n\nFirst, my son, who is 16, got a part time job over this last summer. He raised enough so he can get the family gifts for Christmas and a ps4 for himself. I couldn't buy him one since all my money goes to my parents for personal and financial reasons. We both live with my parents and it's not out of being super poor, but it's comfortable and my parents are very chill.\n\nI work basically a 9 to 5 job, but backwards. 9 to 5... Night shift. So it's hard not to be very not aligned with my family in terms of being awake.\n\nRecently, my son has been doing... Below average in school. I, being a single father, worry about this. My parents spoil my son a bit too much to not care about his grades. They usually throw the \"you should focus more\" line to my son which just goes right by him.\n\nOne day, before work, I see what my son is up to and... It's his PS4. He is on it. I haven't noticed much of him playing it until I saw his report card right after mid terms and Christmas break happened. When I saw him I told him that he needs to study more and that the ps4 is making him do less work in school. He tells me not to worry. Me, being stressed a bit before work, snap a little. His grades haven't been doing too well and that I wanted to see his grades on the spot (they have the grades online and I trust him to show me when I ask). But, he hesitated a bit. He said he may have low grades because he still needs to turn some stuff in.\n\nI'm a bit angry at this point. I know I shouldn't have but it didn't change the fact he had low grades. He finally showed me and there was an F! A big ol F in Chemistry. It's a hard class I know but, an F! A lot went through my head. Why haven't I been notified by the teacher he's doing this bad?? How come he hasn't asked for help? I always tell him to ask me for anything. Then I asked myself. Is it because he's playing games all the time???\n\nI told him that he needed to give me that PS4 on e spot. We argued a bit. He paid for the ps4 but I paid for his school. I had to head off to work and didn't finish the argument, but the next day while he was at school I took the ps4.\n\nHe was angry at me for the first time in his life. Saying that he worked hard for that ps4. I told him about his grades and he said he needed to turn stuff in still. I told him he shouldn't be late in the first place. \n\nThis was only about a week ago. And he still has an F in Chemistry\n\nI told my parents I did this and they said I needed to go easier on him but I disagree.\n\nI told my son I'd give it back once he gets his grades up. But he DID pay for this ps4. It's his. And I took it.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR my son had a summer job, paid for his own PS4, but I took it away recently because his grades haven't been doing well at all (Failing a class).",

      "description": "AITA: Soooo, this is going to be long, but worth it.\nMy uncle came to Italy (where I live with my parents, both are from Morocco) two months ago, and he has been living with us ever since.\nHe came here with a sketchy employment contract (which states that he is working on a farm in Veneto), while he really has been living in another region with us. Since he moved in, i haven’t talked to my dad and i have been arguing with my mom every.single.day. It has been a nightmare.\nThe problem is that this big, fat, 34 year old, thinks (just like every other north african migrant, except for people from Lybia and Egypt) that Italy is the place to be, when it is NOT; my parents paid for his tuition in Morocco, and he did not finish studying for his college degree. Then they bought him a scooter to help him get a job, (again, he was still in Morocco) and he didn’t find one and had to sell it; they paid for his marriage (he also had a daughter), while he lived in our house in Marrakech for all of his adult life without paying us a single euro for the rent, or the bills.\nHe has always been completely dependent on my parents, and this thing always drove me insane, because i cannot forget what my dad went through when he came to Italy as an immigrant 30 years ago... he slept in the woods, on trains, he didn’t eat for days on end, he was robbed, he was discriminated, he had to go through some Tough shit, and here is this shrek-looking giant baby that comes to italy with an easy jet flight (paid by my parents), and thinks he can conquer the world by watching the tv and eating all day long.\nAnd what bugs me the most is that both of my parents dont think there is something wrong with them spending money on his future (and not mine, wtf, we are not rich), or with him not helping with the chores (even though he doesnt work and is at home doing nothing all day long).\nWell, do you guys think i am the asshole for not talking to my uncle and my dad (we had a terrible fight about this situation) and for deciding to eat alone in my room until he leaves our home?\n(I am an 18 year old girl, next year i will be studying either medicine or biology, university life is expensive, and my parents wont be able to afford sustaining my studies, our family and his family forever)\nFun fact: since he has moved in, i’ve never even saw him. I shower when he is sleeping or outside, and i cook when he is another room or out, lol. I have no idea how i am managing all of this shit, but it is driving me insane, INSANE\nSorry for the text block, i just enjoyed reddit and i don’t know how to edit.",

      "description": "[Link for the term \"Whipped\" I'm using.](https://www.italki.com/question/180678) TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my best friend, let's call him Sam (18m) and his girlfriend, who we'll call Ashley (17m) have been dating for over a year and a half now. It's clear as day that no one likes Ashley. She is very rude, to not only Sam, but to me, our other friends we all hang out with, and just everyone around her. She is a total bitch IMO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere Sam goes, she's there. When we decide to have a \"Guys\" night, she tags along. When she does, she's nothing but selfish, rude and talking constant shit while always touching and totally showing PDA. The PDA is the worst part. Sam is always paying for her food, meals, giving her rides to school then work. For context, Sam isn't the most...Fortunate man in the world. He's not poor, but nowhere near rich. He's about almost at low class citizen area. SHE comes from a very rich family. Has a million dollar house, lives in the best city, has cars from a Tesla Model X, to a Mercedes S-Class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said, he's totally submissive to her and does whatever she wants. Sam is giving it his all for Ashley and she is literally just saying, \"Meh. Pay for my food.\" Sam is currently balancing 2 jobs and high school while Ashley doesn't even have one. The relationship is totally lopsided and it's clear as day that Sam is whipped. There was a time where Ashley slept in the same bed as one of her cousin's friends at her house. And she claimed nothing happened. And of course, Sam believed her and laughed it off. He's even bought her a $200 necklace she has never worn before. Which was about 2 paychecks for him. She bought him a hat. He wears the shit out of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't even tell her parents until there 1 year anniversary, which was sketchy as hell in my opinion. He will go out literally every weekend to her house at 1am to go spend the night at her house to avoid her parents. Keep in mind they live about 30 minutes away. And he is always going over to her house. She's been to his house once and that was a few months ago. Sam moved about a month later and she hasn't even seen it yet. She is a terrible girlfriend and it's clear as day she is whipped, so WIBTA if I tell him he's whipped? Providing all the information and proof that says so. Or should I just keep my mouth shut and let him find out the hard way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, Best friend is clearly whipped due to the influx of things he does for his girl, pays for every meal, drives out to her house every weekend which is a 30 min drive away, buys her expensive jewelry, she's a freeloader and yet she's extremely rich. He is pretty low class. She has been suspected of even cheating (which she probably has.) Our whole group hates her and thinks the same of her. Should I tell him he's whipped or just let him find out the hard way?",

      "description": "Story is roughly a year old. It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.",

      "description": "My sister is kind of a slut and has cheated on at least 3 of her BFs that i know of. Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.",

      "description": "For context, I've known my friend for 8+ years, and stay at his grandmother's place when we both have to work, to make it easier on all of us. Recently, while my friend was at work and I was hanging out in his room, his grandmother came in and started going through his drawers. She kept muttering to herself and whispering, \"This is where he usually hides it.\" When I asked her what she needed, she said, \"I just need some money for a while.\" \n\nNow, she never actually told me what that money was for and had stolen money from my friend in past occasions, so once she left the room I messaged him to tell him. He was understandably pissed, and called out his grandmother. She tried to play innocent and act like she did nothing wrong, as she tries to do. She started acting extremely passive aggressive towards me, to the point where she came in when my friend was gone and told me that he would be \"In big trouble\" because I was here without him. Only found out today she needed the money for bills, but had she not been acting the way she did it wouldn't have been an issue.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "I apologize in advance for formatting. I’m on Mobile so I can’t imagine it’s going to be great. \n\nSo I had a friend in college, he seemed pretty nice and we did a couple theatre shows together, we were in the LGBTQIA club on campus together (I am bi and he’s gay), and we swam in a lot of the same circles.\n\nHe posted a meme on Facebook that insinuated that bisexuality’s mere existence confirms the gender binary. I gently explained to him (rather politely, to be fair) that pansexuality falls under the bi umbrella so the point doesn’t really stand. He let his straight friends troll me for hours. I shouldn’t have let it get under my skin, but it did and I told them to fuck off and eat my ass.\n\nNow, normally I’m pretty good at civil discussion, but it was clear they were trying to troll me and I didn’t want to take the bait and debate some people who weren’t trying to listen or care. They just wanted me to get more upset and they called into question my sexuality, and my dignity, amongst other things.\n\nI PM’d him, a little miffed and told him that his stupid meme was causing a lot of harm and asked him why he kept it up. He told me “I found it entertaining” and ignored me after that. \n\nAfter hours of harassment and threats from his straight friends, and a non-response from him, I decided to throw this long-time friendship out the window and block him on all socials.\n\nFriends, AITA here? Should I have tried harder to talk it out with him and educate these douchebags, or was it not worth my energy to fight for someone who doesn’t care.",

I had just a few drinks + was a bit high when I struck up a conversation with this guy. It is important to note that I am a white female and he was black.\n\nWe introduce ourselves and explain our costumes then i ask him where he's from and all that.\n\nMe: so what's your story, man?\n\nHim: story?\n\nMe: yeah like where are you from, how many siblings do you have and that whole thing?\n\nHim: I'm from _town an hour from here_\n\nMe: cool, so do you go to school around here?\n\nHim: what, do you think i dont go to school?\n\nMe, a bit tipsy, literally just repeated myself\n\nHim: why dont you think I go to school here??\n\nNow he's starting to get a bit worked up and i'm self aware enough to know that im too drunk to continue this conversation gracefully so I literally just nod my head and walk back to my friends.\n\nI immediately wondered if he thought that _I_ thought that he was uneducated and that maybe it was race related. I grew up in a pretty conservative area and sometimes I still learn the hard way that some of the things i say without thinking are insensitive. But asking if a young adult is going to school, is that really politically incorrect, even if he is a minority? \n\nTurns out we go to the same college btw. My friend who was there had seen him around. \n\nSorry i know this post is a bit political. Just let me know your thoughts, reddit.\n\n",

      "description": "A little bit of backstory on this. A few months ago I was asked to edit a video for a project my friend was doing. It had been assigned for almost a month at that point, and the due date was literally a day away. Normally I'd love to help, but at that time I was busy with homework of my own, and I generally didn't want to replan my schedule. Now I told him that I really didn't want to, and to ask others if they could do it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while of him asking, I agreed to do it, but on the condition that his group would pay me for the editing work, much like if they had hired an editor. I receive the files later that day, and I begin to work. Now keep in mind, this project was due the next day, I had a physical limitation of 14 hours to finish IF I stayed up all night. After a lot of complications, I finally get it done with the help of another friend, and I call this guy's group to give it to them. I ask my co editor if he wanted anything, but he just said he was fine and went to bed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point it was almost 3 in the morning, and I had been working on the edit for a total of 5 hours or so. I tell them the thing's finished and ask for $50. They refuse and argue about why the price is so high. I didn't really think this was that high of a price, as I had spend many hours on it, and delayed my own homework to rush it out on time. After some more arguing, I just wanted everything to be over. I had school the next day and the most I was gonna get then was 5 hours of sleep. In the end I just told them to take the video, but if they could pay me that'd be really nice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few months to my birthday. This was still a while ago, and I hadn't gotten any of the money from any of the people. I didn't want to make a big deal out of my birthday, I just changed my mood message and mentioned it if anyone asked. Generally for other people's birthdays, if I didn't know them well enough for a personal gift, I'd just give them $10 worth of gift cards in something like steam or amazon. Some of my friends knew I played this game alot, and gifted me some skins and premium currency. I was pretty content with how things turned out. The friend I edited for didn't get my anything but I wasn't really caught up on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day at school, I see him at one of my classes. He sort of pulls me to the side and hands me a $10 bill. When I asked him what it was for he replied that he was paying back the money he owed me for the editing (there were 5 people in that group, they split the cost evenly, I still hadn't gotten the other $40). I feel like it would've almost been better if he didn't get me anything at all. Paying me for a job I did as a birthday gift just kind of feels wrong, and I don't really want to get him a gift again this year for his birthday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being an asshole for thinking this way?",

After moving house I met a girl who is the only girl I've ever had feelings for, after knowing her for a month I had a huge crush on her and asked my friends for advice. At the end of school I broke up with her this time for good, i wouldn't have to see her at all anymore, she being her took the breakup as us being \"on a break\"\nAfter two weeks I confessed to the girl I had a crush on who I'd become friends with in the last month and knew all about my ex girlfriends manipulation and abuse and she told me she felt the same way. I've been so happy with her since for the first time in years, we've been together for almost a year now. After a few weeks of dating when my ex found out she went ballistic, she told all our old friends and sent me a lengthy message about how heartbroken she was, all our friends but three sided with her and couldn't believe I'd moved on after four years in just a few weeks. She treat me terribly but I can't help feeling guilty for how fast I moved on it made me feel like such an ass especially after all my old friends had said their piece, one said how she treated me doesn't justify getting into a new relationship that fast after four whole years. My girlfriend has assured me it's just more of her manipulation but if so I have to admit its worked. AITA??",

I felt bad because the customer spent a decent sum so I obliged. Everything is delivered and all is well. \nFast forward a month later, the customer calls and says his father passed suddenly shortly after they got the furniture, and that they didn’t think to tell us that they have a coffee table similar to the free one we gave them. He asks that we take back the one we gave him and deliver a different one. Problem is, we usually don’t give away free furniture in the first place, and having to go wrap it up, bring it back, and deliver a new one is expensive, not to mention that we cannot sell his table as a new item.

      "description": "A few days ago, my girlfriend and I were talking about the whole \"your life partner should be your best friend thing\", which is a statement I disagree on. For me, a best friend a girlfriend/significant other are 2 very different things. I can fully believe and trust both my best friend and my girlfriend, but there are some things I would talk to my best friend about, but not my SO, and the other way around.\n\nThe last few days she's really been in a bad mood because she considered me her best friend, but I don't consider her mine, because as said above, I consider the two to be very different things. I consider my girlfriend the person in my life I'm closest to, by far, closer than my best friend, but again, they are two different things in my opinion. And by principle, I don't lie when asked a question, even if it's a stereotypical leading question.\n\nAITA the asshole for telling my girlfriend she's not my best friend?",

      "description": "TL;DR: partner stopped doing laundry and cleaning despite being a cleaner and I am debating bringing it up to her to start doing it again or move on my own\n\nPlease read the context of this before saying I’m an asshole. I’m not sexist, I just want her to do it because she’s good at it, that’s all. No point me doing it when I can’t do it as well as her!\nThis is a throwaway because my partner knows my reddit username after I showed them an r/aww post.\nAnyway, this is kind of an ongoing issue I (21M) have with my (23F) girlfriend. \n\n\nThe issue is this, we both work full-time (I work more though with 40+ whilst SO only has 35) so the house I moved in with her 7 months ago (A cozy flat we rent) can sometimes get reaaaally messy. I work as a shift manager whilst my SO works as a cleaner for a small business. Since she works as a cleaner, I mainly assumed that SHE would do most, if not all of the cleaning. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not sexist! It’s just because she’s good at it, not because she’s a woman.\n\n\nAnyway, a couple of weeks ago, the house starts getting worse, as though she has stopped cleaning. Normally, my partner will put my work clothes through the wash and dry, iron and fold them on my dresser so that I can just get up at 8am to leave for work easily. The first time it happened, my clothes were left on the floor, unwashed and not ironed. I was pissed, but I put them on and went to work (th whole time I felt self conscious and embarrassed). I felt humiliated so I came home and waited for her to finish work. We argued and she said she was sick of having to do all of the cleaning and washing. I tell her it’s been like this since we moved in and that she was being an asshole about it, especially by randomly not washing my clothes, making me feel shitty the whole day. It ended with her crying and bolting the bathroom door shut. I had to stay up for a few hours to calm her down.\n\n\nEver since, I’ve had to start cleaning shit up and im beginning to get mad that she won’t tidy shit up anymore. She’s GOOD at it, and even earned a raise for how well clients were rating her service. It pissed me off that she expected me to now do all my own laundry and wash my plate after she cooked. I’ve never been good at it, and my mom always scolded the fact I could never clean up as well as her.\n\n\nI posted this finally because I’m debating bringing this up with her. It’s inconsiderate of her to leave everything to me after I’ve been at work all day. I may even mention that if she carries on, I will move back to my moms house so that I can be relaxed after a really long day at work.i don’t think that I’m an asshole and my mom agreed she should be doing more than she is right now.\n\nAITA??\n",

      "description": "Some context:\n\nMy dad and I have always gotten along pretty well. But there are times when he'll just start spreading misinformation to members of my family, or he'll be completely wrong about things that are easily googled when talking to his coworkers.\n\nFor example, if my sister is working on stuff for school like math homework for example, he'll start doing the problem with her and halfway through he'll make an error or explain something to her that's not correct and then blame the textbook and say things like \"well if that's what the textbook says then the textbook is wrong,\" or \"well if they're teaching you that in school then your teachers are not doing their jobs.\" It's really frustrating to me because even when I'm polite about it and I tell him \"hey, that's what the teachers are teaching her in school, the textbooks aren't wrong and you're starting to confuse her\" and I go to help my sister he gets upset with me and starts saying things like \"well you're always right\" or \"forgive me for being so damn stupid.\" \n\nHe also tends to make up statistics to make him sound like he knows what he's talking about and it makes me worry about him hanging out with his coworkers (whom are half his age) and just being dead wrong about some things. I love my father to death and the last thing that I want to happen to him is to be made fun of or thought stupid by his coworkers.\n\n Part of me things that I might be coming off as condescending when I correct him, but I never do it in public or in front of people (apart from my sister or my mother) because I don't want to embarrass him or make him feel like he's dumb. Keep in mind that my dad is a genius when it comes to extrusion and factory work, he' been with the same company for years and he's really good at his job.\n\nI'd like to point out that I am by no means a superbly intelligent person myself, and my goal isn't to demean or belittle my dad.\n\nIf it turns out that I have been an asshole I definitely want to apologize to him, and probably will anyway.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: My dad corrects my sister on her homework and is misinforming her so I correct him and he gets upset with me and says that he's always wrong and that he must be such an idiot (in a condescending tone). Am I the asshole for correcting my dad?\n\nThanks.",

      "description": "So my roommate has been pretty lazy in terms of doing her dishes, cleaning up scraps she leaves around the kitchen, and leaving laundry in the machine for days allowing the machine to get a funky smell with wet clothes sitting in there. She seems to have a problem with following through with these things. \n\nI was frustrated at her, talked to my other roommate about it. Then my other roommate, who agreed with me wanting to set house rules to not let this continue, told her that I had been talking about her to him. AITA for “talking behind her back”? I think it is fair for me to ask my other roommate if any of the dishes were his before telling her or wanting to set up a meeting. I think I was a bit more frustrated and showed that to him, since I did let it build up a little bit instead of telling her right away. Except I didn’t want to have the conversation over text and she always seemed to be busy and running to hang out with her bf or ex or whatever. I think it’s okay to except someone who works from home to be able to do their dishes before they pile up to double the sinks depth! \n\nAnyway, she ended up texting me asking why I am mad at her and unfortunately the conversation happened over text. Lots of drama later, Ended with her saying she understands but then that she is upset with me because I don’t reciprocate things she does for me around the house. We are friends, and she has been making my dinner some nights a week— just for me since she has already eaten and I didn’t necessarily need her to prep any food for me. I don’t have much else to reciprocate and it felt kind of weird that she was doing that and expecting something out of me. \n\nShe also thinks I’m rude for asking her this straight up instead of just hinting at it or making a joke about it like “clean up the dishes would ya?” To keep it light hearted or whatever. I love joking around but not when it comes to house rules, I’m not your mom and I don’t want to have to fill that role. \n\nAITA for not offering to make her food after working all day and just wanting to relax and have some peace and quiet? I don’t want this to end bad between us, honestly. And just want to live in peace in a clean home. ",

      "description": "\nThrowaway as I don’t want my girlfriend to see this post.\n\nJust a bit of background info: my girlfriend works in HR and I work in IT for the same company, however because we work in two different branches we only really get to see each other before/after our shift as our lunch breaks are scheduled at different times. Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we’re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a “surprise” she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn’t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn’t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples’ leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn’t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She’s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I’m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?",

      "description": "I made an account to specifically ask this because I am unsure if I was an asshole last night .\n\nOkay, so yesterday while I was at work , the first guy I ever had sex with texted me that he was in my city . I had messaged him earlier this year saying that he could visit me the week of the the 24th , but it seems like he came to Nyc early . This is my finals week and my job has lots of intense days so I’ve been putting in lots of work both inside and outside of the classroom. When I got his text I responded that we could meet up for a few hours as I have work to do. He agreed and met me at my apt at 7:30pm.\n\nThe context was clear : we both were interested in having sex with each other . It had been 4+ years since we’ve seen each other but we’ve been in contact every now and then we would be in contact hence why I told him he could visit me the week of the 24th.\n\nSo we hang out a bit , have sex and cuddle for a little. I start putting my clothes on so that I could get some work done . I ask him what his next move was and he told me he was just going to stay with me. I was shocked because I had not planned for him to stay over and very much wanted my space to study in peace for my finals and just be in my own space alone. The Sex was great but I love alone time and I was very much craving that after he fucked the shit out of me. I expressed this to him and he responded, “I won’t get in your way, I’m just going to be chillin here “\nMe: “no, but that is in my way. I wasn’t expecting you to sleep over because you didn’t tell me you were”\n\nHim : “well, I don’t have anywhere else to go”\n\nMe: “I thought your frat brothers were in the city ? If you needed to sleep over why didn’t you tell me in advance ? I would have arranged for us to meet at another time when I didn’t have so much work to do. I was about to cook for myself , take a shower, study and do my own thing”\n\nHim: “I didn’t expect to be here this late , and now that I am , I was just going to stay here. I won’t be in your way “\n\nMe: “yes, but I was not expecting you to stay here ...I’m waking up early and am working late ...”\n  \nHim: “I can also wake up early , have no where else to go”\n\nSo I let him stay over but I was very annoyed . I stayed up extra late and left all the lights on in my room in hopes that he would eventually figure it out and leave. I listened to class recordings and tried so hard to be a nuance because I very much wanted to be alone. I cooked for myself and did not offer him any food , as I had not gone shopping because, again, I was not expecting him . It’s bad enough that I have roommates that I feel crowd my space , but now this guy was literally all up in my space . \n\nI was finally ready to go to bed. He’s 6’2” ex football player so he’s taking up most of my full size bed . When I get in, he tries to cuddle with me but I actually don’t like cuddling . I had my alarm go off at 5am to get him out early so I could at least enjoy some sleep alone in my bed . When the alarm went off I told him it was time for him to go. He responded , “I’ll leave when you leave “  but that’s not what I wanted ! I wanted him out of my bed . I tell him I have yoga at 6 and want to get ready. He says ok , gets ready and head out.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to be by myself after coitus? For trying to put him out even when he expressed he had no where else to go? What do you all think ?",

      "description": "Ok! So I have been struggling with feeling like the asshole here. I (27F) have been in a loving polyamorous relationship with my partner (30M) for a couple years. Recently I met a new person (30M), let's call him Wallace, and quickly became quite infatuated with him. We went on several fun dates and chatted daily about our interests, kinks, life goals, the whole shebang. I was feeling really comfortable and safe with Wallace and after some negotiating we agreed to a sleepover at his place and to have our first sexy times (woohoo!). \n\nHowever, that's where my excitement ended.. When I got to his place I found it to be dark, dirty, empty walls and gross furniture, mattress on the floor, etc. It looked like a college apartment. Then, he introduced me to his dog, a rescue dog who is extremely nervous. I'm not blaming the dog at all, but from the second I walked in the door she wouldn't stop barking at me, and she is a big dog, also acting like she was nipping at my hands. I couldn't even go to the bathroom without her barking continuously outside the door. I was getting uncomfortable at this point, but we retired to his room and I thought, \"Ok! Rough start, but let's have a good fun sexy time!\" I wanted to be in the moment and enjoy getting to explore this person's body for the first time, but that dog barked literally every second we were having sex. The whole time non-stop. We make dinner, to dog barking at me. We went on a walk, the dog barked at me, we came back and started to wind down to go to bed but the dog wouldn't sleep unless it was in the room with us and she kept coming up to me in the night and just staring at me and if I moved she'd start barking and growling. I felt paralyzed. I realized at about 4 am that I was having a panic attack because I felt trapped, I couldn't move or leave without the dog barking more and I was exhausted and stressed. I stayed just frozen in panic for hours. eventually Wallace moved, looked over and realizing I was awake asked if I was ok. I felt like the interaction unfroze me suddenly and I just stammered I had to leave, that I had a nice time with him but that I had to go immediately and I quickly got up and gathered my things and left. \n\nSince that incident, I just don't find Wallace attractive to me. It was like a lightswitch and I've never had that happen before. Am I the asshole for just flat out losing interest in him because of this? I feel like I built of so much hope and interest in our future and now that is all just gone on my end. I communicated with him that I was no longer interested, and he's really hurt and blindsided but honestly so am I? I really liked him and the feeling is just.... gone suddenly. \n\nTLDR; I was happy and excited about a new relationship with someone, but I lost interest after seeing how he lived and after his dog wouldn't stop barking at me.",

      "description": "Two months ago I had to move home to finish my PhD. I had been studying in Germany and my funding ran out, which meant I lost my residence permit, so I moved home to write my thesis and find a job.  I had a number of postdoc application in the system at that time so hopes were high I would have something lined up for when I’m done and staying at my mums would be a temporary thing. I had been (and still am) battling with my mental health and I hoped being at home would be a positive step in that battle, too.  \n\nThe postdocs fell through and my mental health is only a little better, so my thesis is taking longer than I’d hoped too. On top of all that my partner breaks up with me a month ago because he can no longer see a future with me. So I’ve lost my independence, my career future, and my romantic future in the last two months. \n\nToday my mother tells me she’s thinking of selling her house and moving to a semi-rural city approx. 2 hours from the university I’m affiliated with and the major city where most of my job opportunities are.  I don’t drive, and continuing living with her will mean spending ~$600 a month on transit.  Remember, I’m broke and unemployed.  \n\nI got upset and as we talked was clear in saying I wasn’t mad at her and she should do what is best for her and her husband (and I believe that).  But when she pushed me to explain why I was so emotional about the idea I admitted it felt like the final reliable thing in my life was being taken away.  Now she’s upset and angry and says she won’t move.  I feel like the asshole, but I also feel like it’s an asshole thing to do to decide to move two months after taking your daughter in, no?",

      "title": "AITA for being upset my parents gave my wedding fund to my sister after I told them I would probably elope?",
      "description": "So me and my BF started dated around the same time as my sister and her BF fast forward a year and a half, and my sister gets engaged. I think 1.5 years is too soon to get married, but her BF is military and my sister hangs out with a more church-y crowd, so that's normal, I guess. \n\nMy sister's entire life seems to have evolved around her wedding. Since we were kids she's been picking out colors, venues, themes, watching God knows how many episodes of Say Yes to the Dress and Four Weddings etc.. It's a super big deal for her. She wants to have the Pinterest Perfect wedding of her dreams. Not my cup of tea, but I can see how it would be important for other people.\n\nWhile I've always had fun with the idea of a wedding, in the end I'm very anti-social, I'd rather use the money for an awesome honeymoon or a down payment, and I don't think it's worth the hassle. Since my sister's engagement my mom has teasingly asked me about a wedding in my future. I expressed to her that I didn't expect it in the near future, and that me and BF have agreed that eloping is probably the way to go, as the money, for us, is better spent elsewhere.\n\nA few days later my sister excitedly texts me to tell me the amount my parents had pledged toward the wedding. She was excited because in person they told her it would only be a few thousand, but that day sat down with her and gave her a new number... twice the amount they initially told her. \n\nI was suspicious so I asked my mom about it to which she merely shrugged her shoulders and made some grunting noises. Obviously this left me somewhat upset. Throughout my childhood my parents have implied that they had money set aside for weddings for both of us. And I don't want to imply that I need or deserve that money, but it's only fair that my sister and I get a fair amount. \n\nJust because my sister wants a blow-out wedding and I don't doesn't mean that all their resources should now go towards her. In a way, I guess this is an extension of feeling neglected as a child because my sister would always demand attention and gifts from my parents while I was content to be left alone most of the time. I didn't need or want attention, but that they never thought to give it upset me.\n\nNow, to clarify - and this might muddy the waters a bit - my BF and his family are what you'd politely call 'VERY comfortable' in terms of financial situation. My BF has a substantial trust fund, but I myself make a very modest income (as in, if I wasn't living rent-free with my BF I would probably be on the streets). But that shouldn't matter because who knows? What if I don't end up marrying him? Would I still have no wedding fund because they assumed I would be set for life financially?\n\nMy sister meanwhile, is pushing six figures of income (and we don't live in a high COL area) and her fiance's income isn't anything to sneeze at either considering the military pays for most of his expenses. They both spend pretty frivolously (like 1k a month on beauty kind of frivolous and multiple international trips a year), but with some belt tightening they could easily save up enough for a great wedding. My sister alone currently makes more than my parents ever made combined, which is a point of frustration they have both expressed in having to fund this wedding. But weddings are a pretty big deal in my mom's culture, and really it will serve as a family reunion/way to show off for her as many of our relatives from out of the country will be flying in for it. So I can see why in her mind it made sense to 'redirect' the funds set aside for me.\n\nStill, AITA for thinking I deserve 'my cut' of wedding money even if I don't plan to have a 'wedding' per se?",

He responded with, “That’s why I’m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend”. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren’t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, “Don’t talk shit then”. He’s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don’t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I’m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven’t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time.

      "description": "Hello friendly Redditers,\n\nI really need your help. So the following is Happening and my brain is still not working enough to figure this out by myself.\n\nSo I am on a journey in Thailand right now with my still-bf. Yesterday I got really really sick (maybe food poisoning) and I felt terrible. The whole World was spinning, my stomach fighting itself, my legs were cramping and there was not enough air for my desperate lungs. At first my boyfriend tried his best to help me. Did hold my hair while I kissed the toilet and gave me something to Drink. He is really afraid of me getting pregnant and insisted on me taking my birth control pill while still vomiting. So I of course threw asap up end sent it on a journey through the toilet System. At this Moment I was just shaking and was almost not able to get back to bed. Two hours later (I finally Was able to sleep and escape my pain!), he woke me up and told me to take my pill again, because He read, tagt this is the thing to do. And here is the Part where I really fucked up: I forgot to take an extra blister! So there is no way I can take another one, it is 1 am and we are in the middle of nowhere without a pharmacy. And He got mad, so so mad at me. And I can totally understand that but I am still shaking in agony and throwing up again (so I really doubt that I would be able to even keep the second pill). And He is screaming at me and insulting me and taking away the pillow He gave me, so I can sit up a little (way better for my stupid still Wrestling tummy) and pushing me out of the way (not so great for my stupid stomach). I tried to calm him down (I am at the end of my zyclus and we did not have Sex very often and the only time where something could have happened is two days ago and He did not even Come into me - I know that that is not a safe method, that's why I am taking birth control pills, but just to calm him down a little and I am still feeling sooooooo Bad). I started crying cause it was all to much and begged him to just be a little nicer to me and help me and maybe hug me, because I really could not bare it any longer. He did nothing of that. I spend the whole night shaking and wishing to Die, while He ignored me and sometimes even pushed me, when I came too close to him.\n\nAnd here we are, the day after sitting in front of the only pharmacy and waiting for it too open. The pharmacist told us Over the phone that there is no reason to be concerned, that I just can take the pill after, but she will not open till 11 am (we are sitting here since 7:30). I can totally (totally totally) understand why He is so angry but I feel like He left me alone when I really needed him and I do not know at that moment, how I will ever be able to forgive him. ",

After we finished a match, he brought a cheese platter down (like wtf) to snack on and I said I didn't like cheese. For some reason he got kinda mad about it and asked what I meant. I just explained that I didn't like cheese, the taste of it I guess.  \n\n\nThis developed into a full-on argument where he was accusing me of lying just to embarrass him and disrespecting him by not eating the snacks he made (it was a cheese platter wtf who does that?) and after an intense screaming match I left his house and texted him later in the afternoon saying I never want to go to his house again and that we're not friends anymore.

      "description": "Throwaway, because both people involved know my reddit name.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together 8 years this past Christmas, and have been living together for the past six. Of those six years, my boyfriend's best friend (FR) has also been living in the same house, for almost four years. We have gone on 2-3 weekend trips a year for the past four years with FR, sharing a hotel room. While its kinda awkward because its just two beds and a bathroom, we've done it to save money so we can do other entertainment things on our weekend trip.\n\nThis year, my boyfriend (i think to believe) is planning on proposing to me later in the year, towards winter I'd assume to save money. BF and i were wanting to on a trip alone just the two of us this year, and after a day of searching fun things to do on a weekend trip, i just asked if we can go to the beach for a couple days for a long weekend, just to relax together. He mentioned bringing FR to the beach since he works long hours and deserves a break, this way it would be cheaper and we can go the whole week to the beach instead of three nights. I agreed, under the circumstance that we get a hotel room with two seperate bedrooms. We found a decently priced condo on the beach, two levels. One bedroom had two queen beds and the other had one kind bed. Because we are dating and FR doesnt date anyone, naturally we took the king bedroom (also its the master bedroom and has beach views and its on the second level loft of the condo and I'M SO EXCITED, as a side note).\n\nI told FR we found a condo, he'd have his own balconly overlooking the bay, his own bathroom and his own bedroom. He seemed annoyed that there were two beds.I should also mention that whenever we DO share a condo room with FR, he snores. Not little snores, but its extremely loud to the point where BF and i cant get sleep.\n\nOur two friends are also getting married in august. BF, FR, and i were invited...wedding is five hours away on a saturday, so I figured we can drive down together on friday and leave on sunday so we dont have to worry about rushing the day of\n\nI mentioned to BF that the hotel that is blocked off has cheaper rates, so we can get our own room so FR has his own. I told FR that yes, it would be more expensive than just sharing a room with us, but this way he has his own bathroom and i can do my makeup and hair. He seemed ok with it, but still sligthtly annoyed that i didnt want to get a hotel room with him. At a romantic rustic cabin hotel. On the night of the wedding...while with my boyfriend of 8 years and while we include him on everything else, even if we are going out to supper as a date night andi see FR is alone at home, i'll see if he wants to go).\n\nFR seemed kinda salty that we were getting our own hotel room, but also I do want sleep the night before and night of the wedding.\n\nAITA for wanting seperate hotel rooms during the weekend of our friend's wedding?",

(Not the point of the story) Tho one of the times my father was bringing his girlfriend and me to hang out with his parents my fathers girlfriend was talking trash about one of my aunts on facebook while shes right infront of them. My aunt decides to get and say if you want to talk trash about someone at least do it to there face. This was during Easter. So they begin to fight on facebook. My father decides to go to my grandmother and tell her to stop my aunt. She said she didnt want to get involved. Now to the reason why I am so angry at him. You see my father decides to cut all ties to my grandmother and father and the whole family on his side my mother was the one that kept me in contact with them. So my grandmother was hit with a bad case of cancer and I my mom and everyone that could that wasnt his current friends were asking him to go talk to her. Or at least go to her funeral. He did neither. He then was taken out of the will of my grandfather who died not to long after and he didnt even get invited to the funeral....Its been a two months now from that event...and I just cant stop wondering.",

      "description": "Need some context before actual question. So 2 years ago my girlfriend (both 18 at the time) grand father passed away. Her mother called her step brother to tell him, who lives in Mexico about how he has passed away. Since it was rough for my gf I stayed over for a week to help her grief and support, but her uncle that she only saw once when she was around 5 years old kinda imposes himself to sleep at my girlfriends moms house for a week (lived in small 2 bedroom appartement). Me and gf are both students and broke  and had to buy own groceries since her mom did not buy us food and we had to cook for ourselves. This guy arrives and is so cheap he is ready to sleep a thin blanket in the living room floor instead of renting out cheap motel. No one including step mom really wanted this guy over but she felt obliged since he insisted on helping to organize the funural. Hes been here for at least 2 days if my memory is correct and hasnt bought himself any food, mother in law does not buy us and just buys herself frozen micro wave meals since shes to lazy to cook herself. One day after we did the groceries, he was out. Im making shepards pie. When he arrived he doesnt even ask us but expects us to give him some shepards pie but the leftovers was for our lunch the next day while we were at school and we paid for it. Later on he bought himself bananas (he finally bought himself a few things to eat at like day 4 of the week) and states they are his bananas. And he still ate some of our food which we made clear to him he could not have since hes a grown 50 year old man who should be able to buy himself some food and not need 2 18 year olds buy it for him but he made me feel kinda like an asshole so AITA?

      "description": "(Posting this for a good friend whose family knows his Reddit name. I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI’m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she’s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.” We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe’s taken from my account without my okay before. I’ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn’t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying “IT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?",

Ive told her that this annoys me because i have some self image issues from being younger and not liking how skinny and weak i was so i started to workout. As i said this continued for over a year and one day i had a particularly bad day and snapped she had said\" HAHA I bet you drop weights that are only an 1/8th of a kilogram\" she actually says this so i said back \" i might fo that but at least i dont weigh 80\". She stops annoying me and i think this is done. Later on she gets her friend to message me calling me an asshole for what i said and that i should apologize i say no and explain why she then says\" well she has self image issues too\" but the girls i called fat isnt even fat i just said it because it made sense with what she said. I am still aparrently the asshole to these two and probably their friends and i dont see why i am. Seriously am i the ass\n\nTLDR: Girl picks on me for a year and when i retort suddenly i am the ass for one little thing",

      "description": "Some back story, were both 20 an have recently started being friends again. We used to be best friends but he started dating this terrible girl with a ton of issues who caused nothing but drama so I decided I didn’t want to be around then any more. But I’m the only one in our friend group who ever gets anyone together, so since I didn’t hang out with him anymore he started to say that I was exiling him and making him depressed. I simply just didn’t want to be around him, he could have hung out with our friend without me right?\n\nAnyways, around February friend and his girlfriend break up, she messages me that I’m a fat piece of shit and I’m at fault for my friends depression, she then messages my girlfriend that she wanted to curb stomp her head in. \n\nAround last month said friend and I start hanging out again, I figured since his girlfriend was out of the picture things would be different, or back to the way they were, before he was with her, and they were. He soon asked if he could have a birthday party at my house later in the month, which was a little weird but not a huge deal because my mom is the only one who’s cool with that stuff. Things were going well, he even got a job at the same place as me. \n\nDay of party, I wake up, not really into the mood to party, on top of that my 3 year old niece was over which added to me not wanting to party, but I made a commitment to my friend and I was going to keep it. So I start cleaning up and going to pick up some friends. The friend who the party is for calls me and says he’s getting some snacks and says “oh by the way it’s cool if your girlfriend comes” and I was like ya I know it’s cool it’s my house, then he says “ also my girlfriend (the one who he was supposedly broken up with) might show up” and I told him I wasn’t ok with that because of the things she said and the threats she made, he then starts telling me I’m a bitch and immature for not wanting her there. Then he says “fuck you I’ll have it at her house” I said good you probably should have had there in the first place. BUT everyone was already on the way to my house, they arrived and I explained the situations and even said I’d drive them to her house if they wanted, but no one did. Friend then says I’m a piece of shit for splitting up the party and taking his friends away. Everyone else in our friend group just dosent want to be a part of it, am I in the wrong? \n",

      "description": "I'm on mobile so I can't be arsed to type a long message. I'll keep it short and add details later if you guys need it.\n\n I'm 25 years old male and my gf is 26 years old and we have an open relationship, so there is no cheating involved in this case. Here's the the situation: I have a one-night stand with someone and I make it clear that this is purely a one-night stand with no purpose of seeing each other ever again and they want the same thing. Everybody just wants sex and everyone is on the same page here. BUT I'm not telling the other person that I'm in a relationship. Since it's just a one-time thing and everybody is getting what they want, I don't see the problem here. If I wanted a FWB thing or something more or if I led someone on then they obviously would have the right to know about my gf.\n\nBut some friends told me that in their opinion the other person \"always has the right to know\" about my girlfriend, even if it's a ONS. And it's assholish to not inform them. My GF always informs others about her open relationship even with a ONS, and that's perfectly fine. She also thinks it would be polite if I did the same, although she doesn't think I'm an asshole like her friends say. But AITA if I don't do the same?\n\nI swear this isn't a validation post if someone thinks that, I'm seriously curious since I didn't see the problem and others called me an asshole.",

It started by “OP is copying me”  or “She can go suck my dick” to things like making fun of me on her social media like telling me to screw off or conveniently crossing my name off of a post so you could still see that it was me she was talking about. \n     It really hurt me, because of how much I admired her and that I always though it was just friendly competition. I began to talk bad about her to my friends and force myself to be the bigger fan. It was one whole mess. \n    So am I the asshole for taking the celebrity she liked and then fighting fire with fire or is she for introducing me and then ruining my whole year?

      "description": "So a little backstory, my grandma (mom’s mom) has always lived with my parents and myself since I could remember. She’s now gotten to the age of needing additional help in her life. My parents were hesitant at first but decided it was best for for all of us to hire a lady through hospice care. This lady stays with my grandma 24/7. Lastly I want to mention this hospice care is costing my grandma and family A LOT of money. Final piece of background info this is our second care lady because my mom and grandma did not like the first one. \n\nSo my mom has been complaining A LOT lately about not having “family time” anymore. She feels that part of her privacy is gone because there’s always a “stranger” living with us. Yesterday she told her the care lady who smokes cigarettes that she has to smoke off her property. She told the lady that my dad is “allergic to smoke”, he isn’t. \n\nThe day before she told the lady she can no longer eat dinner with us when my mom originally invited her to eat at the table with us the first day she arrived. My mom complains that the lady talks too much at the table and it doesn’t allow every to speak about their day. \n\nSo today my mom was just going on to me about how she doesn’t like someone living with us blah blah blah and I told her to stop. I told her I was sick of hearing her complaining about someone who is trying to make her life easier and my grandma’s final years painless. I ended with telling her, it is what it is and I’m done with any conversation that has to do with my mom complaining about this women. My dad was there when I said it and agreed with me that my mom has been complaining a lot. \n\nSince then, my mom just shut down and hasn’t said anything since. I think what I said was a little too much but I feel like it needed to be said. \n\nTL;DR: Mom has been complaining a lot about a hospice lady who lives with us and I told her to stop complaining and I didn’t want to hear anymore of it. \n\n",

I started working for myself last year and because of that we of course had to adjust finances. As of right now we have delinquent Bill's. As a Surprise for my birthday my partner thought a trip  Philadelphia 5 days and  a trip to a museum I had been wanting to visit in Washington would be a great surpriseand she also wanted to attend her sister 40th and the city is where her family lives.  She told me about the surprise a week before we had to leave. When she told me I made sure to be clear that I loved her idea of the trip and to be fair i never outright said that i didn't want to go. I instead before the trip dropped hints like,should we cancel, can we come back early,etc. She told me the tickets were nonrefundable \n Before we left she found out the museum was closed due to government shutdown. So the purpose of the trip is a no go. I really didn't want to come on the trip because I was on point to take care of some due Bill's and I feel like it wasn't a great time to come on a trip regardless if it was for my birthday. I feel like we could've celebrated my birthday at a different time or way.Like dinner or something that I need for the business. I suggested that tho I appreciate the thought, I loved the gesture that it would have been better to ask me if I wanted a trip out of state,because its tax season for the business and I need to work. In response my partner stated that she's hurt because everytime she trys to surprise me it's never right and then preceded to make it about how she thinks I am never satisfied. I told her how I really feel not to hurt her or make her feel bad. I just don't know why she thought it was a great idea now. I really feel like this trip was more about her sisters birthday and I feel trapped in a situation that I didn't ask for and made to feel bad because I feel it wasn't the right time for a trip anywhere. AITA for wanting to be told before she purchased nonrefundable tickets?",

      "description": "My boyfriend lives with me. His mom, step dad, and brother(25) lived together near us but this week they moved to a new town. \n\nI spent the whole week helping them pack, move, and paying for meals and incidentals even though I'm very broke myself. But it's okay- they're broke too and they're family. I'll do a lot for family without mentioning it. \n\nHalfway though all of this I'm *told* (not asked) that the adult brother is staying at our house for the next 2 weeks (laughable- it'll be a month or more, I'm sure) because he's yet to apply for a job transfer, search for new work in the new town, or even put in his two weeks notice here. He's the only one in that household who works so they can't afford him not working for a few weeks. The parents didn't tell him to transfer or job search either. Neither of these three adults thought about a job ahead of time. They all dropped the ball. \n\nSo I suddenly find out that my heavy daily drinking (none of them will admit he's an alcoholic), chain smoking, non-driving future BIL is living with us. \n\nI already have two small children. I don't have a ton of money for groceries. His parents take all of his money for the household so he doesn't have money for his cigarettes and booze, so he steals ours or we end up buying him some (he's a monster without it). It all falls on my boyfriend and I but I can't say no because they're family and he has \"nowhere else to go\". My boyfriend is used to this because he's taken care of his brother in some way his whole life. Plus they have opposite work schedules so they aren't seeing each other much. \n\nI have a variety of personal physical and mental health issues, including PTSD, so having my own private area is essential to me. \n\nI explained my feelings to my boyfriend and he understands where I'm coming from, but thinks I'm being an asshole for expressing my discomfort with the whole situation instead of powering through it. \n\nI WILL power through the situation, but I feel like a stranger in my and my children's own home because of this all. And my kids don't need to be around heavy drinking. I've kept them and myself confined to my room other than meal times. One of my kids is sleeping on the floor so BIL can have his own room. \n\nThere are other friends he could stay with but then he couldn't wake us up still hammered at 5am for a ride to work (which is within walking distance from my house). \n\nI should mention I previously stopped letting this brother stay over because he always brought drugs into the house, trashed everything, and kept us up all night. But he's not doing that anymore. \n\nAm I the asshole for wishing he could stay somewhere else and trying to express the mental and financial burden this is causing me? I know he's family but I'm so busy and tired.",

      "description": "I'm living in an apartment complex with multiple floors for at least 10 years by now. Since then I have received numerous packages from all kind of online shops. Usually I have to enter the following information for my package to be delivered correctly (living in Germany):   \n\n\nName  \nStreet Name &amp; Number  \nZip Code  &amp; City / Town Name  \n\n\nYou can determine on which floor anyone lives from the outside by the bell system, so when deliveries arrive at this address they can basically see the floor level where they need to bring the package to when you ring the bell.   \nThis never was an issue and I always have received my packages until today, where the delivery guy told me I must (!) enter my floor level with my address as well somewhere, else he is unable to deliver my package. He was very rude about it and treated it like I made a major mistake while ordering my stuff. He left with threatening me that he would just \"throw out my stuff\" the next time if I don't add my floor level to my address.   \n\n\nMy perspective on this is as follows:  If a floor level is an absolute requirement for delivery, this should be a mandatory data field when using this delivery service. But it isn't: If you order from smaller online shops, there sometimes isn't even an entry field for that, or at least you would need to \"abuse\" one of the other fields like \"company name\".   \nIf this is a problem during delivery because it takes them too much time to read off the recipients floor level off the doorbell, then that is an issue that they should tackle internally within the delivery company, but not by blaming the customer for not making an additional non-mandatory entry in the address.  \nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "WIBTA for making public a 2 year old video of a man screaming vile slurs &amp; threats at my family and I?",
      "description": "Some background: 2 years ago, while running late and in a bad mood, I made some regrettable decisions on the road. I tailgated a car for some time, honked at it, and blew past it, inadvertently cutting him off and forcing him to brake. I admit I made very poor choices; I’ve learned from them and matured as a driver since. \n\nThe man (a very big, early 40’s guy) at the next red light, got out of his car, stormed up to my window, and went ballistic. He spat on me, screamed a series of **extremely** vile racial slurs, death threats (including graphic references to lynching/hanging) and obscenities at me and **my two small daughters** for a full 2 minutes (impeding traffic for some of this time). He screamed **so** unbelievably loud, got freakishly red, the veins started popping out of his head; I was honestly expecting him to have a stroke or burst a vessel. But worst of all, my kids and I feared he might hurt or even kill us.\n\nThe incident terrified me, but scarred my daughters. They cried and cried, had nightmares about the encounter for a long time afterwards, and I had to have some very long discussions with them that I really wished I would not have to have until they were much, much older. The incident sickened and enraged me like nothing I have ever experienced. I just so happened to catch it all on my dashcam; I turned the cam towards him the moment he started in (as evidence if he were to assault me), and saved the footage on my computer just in case I ever had another run in and needed evidence.\n\nCut to two years later. I’m at an upscale brewery/restaurant with some buddies, look over at the bar area, and who do I see behind the counter, dressed in a nice suit and managing the bar? **The raging driver.** Still bitter, I made eye contact with him, and he froze like a statue and went white with shock when he saw &amp; recognized me. Throughout that dinner, I continued to torment him with a series of sly little grins. When I left to take a bathroom break, he approached me.\n\nHe apologized to me profusely. He claimed he’s severely bipolar and that that was one of his manic outbreaks; he assured me he is not in any way racist or violent, and that if he could do anything to take back his words, he would. He claims to have since gotten his life together; having gone to therapy, gotten medicated, ended his drug abuse habits, etc, and promises me that he is a very changed man. I responded by telling him I still have that video of him raging, can destroy his life and career with a single click, and promptly walked away.\n\nI’m very seriously considering sending the video to his manager, AND even posting the video publicly on social media. Now I know the guy’s name and more info about him, and that he works (and might live) in my close vicinity, I realize it could really make a splash. AITA for wanting to take some revenge on this guy who viciously terrorized my children and I?",

      "description": " \n\nFirstly, my (20m) girlfriend (19f) and I have been very very happily dating for just over 5 months now. We are each other's emotional support through everything and we do everything together. Very recently, my phone broke down and I do not have the financial means to obtain a new one at the moment, so she being the saint that she is let me borrow her old phone that she kept around. When it has WiFi I can use things like snapchat and instagram just so I can contact her.\n\nIn using her old phone, all of her old apps and pictures (including her tinder) are available to me. She did not explicitly state anything about me not going through all of it when we weren't together, so I figure she just assumed I would, but I honestly have not whatsoever. I respect her boundaries and privacy, and figure most of the stuff I would find in there happened before we ever even met and I would not be happy with what I saw, so why even bother.\n\nThe problem here arrives when I received a notification about a day after I received her phone to use. I got a notification from instagram, but as her account. At this point I had not used the app yet, so her account was still signed in. However, when I opened the app to see what was up, it prompted me to log in - I could not use her account, yet I was still getting notifications from it. It was at this point that I was going to sign in with my own credentials so as to not get her notifications, but what I actually did I am slightly ashamed of. I read the notification and saw that it was not from anybody she normally talks to, or anybody that I know. It was from a man our age that goes to our university, and the contents of the messages made me not want to sign out. I became extremely anxious because his messages went something like this:\n\n\\- \"Hey\" (11pm the night before I saw)\n\n\\- \"Good morning Beautiful\" (the first notification I saw in the morning)\n\n\\- \"Were you at so-and-so's concert last night? I think I saw you\" (I took her to a nearby musician's concert for a celebration, I bought her tickets and just the two of us went)\n\n\\- \"What are you doing later?\"\n\nNow I cannot see her messages that she is responding to him because since I am receiving her notifications, I am only getting his messages. I do know that she was responding though based on the fact that he liked one of her messages that she sent to him. I also know that after the last message he sent there was no other contact. She does not have him on any other form of social media, so instagram notifications would let me know if anything else happened. I do not know what she said, if anything, to the last message.\n\nSo I suppose this is the question - AITA for not signing out of her account upon seeing those types of messages? Should I confront her about this, or let it slide for now as he seems to have stopped talking to her?",

      "description": "I just found out my partner’s 17 year old son has a profile on my Netflix account. This means that my partner shared my password with him. To be clear I have no problem with him being on our Netflix but this password is something that I use on multiple different sites. If he had told me beforehand then I would have just changed the password to something unique only for Netflix before he shared it.\n\nHis response was (I texted him while he was at work) that he hopes I know that his son would not do anything with my password except watch Netflix. That’s only half of the point, I feel as though he betrayed my confidence and secondly I’m not confident in that. His son’s mom has even called my partner before about accusations that his son stole from his own sister! So not exactly the most trustworthy of people as I pointed out to him. And what if he shares my info with more people?\n\nI’m mad, frustrated and tired. It feels as though every time we’re coming together as a team he does something to show that he doesn’t respect me. A couple of years ago I had lent him my credit card temporarily and he paid his mothers dentist bill with it. I only found out when I was looking at the statement, he explained he hadn’t told me because he know I wouldn’t agree to it as his mother and I are not on speaking terms (long story).\n\nI’m not sure if I’m overreacting because to be honest his son isn’t my most favorite person right now and I’m not really sure what damage he could do with it. But it just feels as though my trust in my partner has been violated, I trusted him with a password that he knows I use in multiple different places. Now I feel like I’m going to have to change them all. \n\nThe more time that passes I’m starting to think I’m overreacting and I know that’s what I’m going to be told by my partner.

      "description": "Listen, I know this sounds a bit exaggerated or whatever you'd call an entitled bitches attitude but please hear me out. \n\nThis kind of behaviour on his side caused us to not see each other for 4 months and atm I feel like that was supposed to stay like that because nothing really changed besides the first weeks (after long fight). \nSo, I got a boyfriend and he can be a sweetheart but he can stay weeks without calling me or writing me. He never asks how my day is or bs that partners should ask each other. Our message conversations is me writing like 5 messages and him answering every few days. \n\nThis annoys me. Like said, this lack of interest has been a huge problem in the past because I raged so much at one point from being so sad and frustrated because of him, that he completely \"shut down\" and ignored me for months. \n \nI'm really trying to write as neutral as possible but I'm fuming right now and I'm on the verge of tears. \n\nHe criticizes every step I take and every sentence I say, every opinion I got etc. He doesn't like my makeup and always says \"I don't need to use that much \" (just for the record, it's not much but I like Smokey eyes when i feel like it, not every day), he doesnt like some pieces of my clothing (he feels so entitled that he actually ACTUALLY ripped some leggings he didnt like, tbh they were ugly but so freaking comfortable) and is just overall frustrating. Even when it comes to sex and I dare to ask for more he says I'm only interested in sex and I use it as a thing to prove myself and my worth ( which is somehow true but everyone uses it on some emotional level to feel worthy, right? Tell me if I'm wrong !) .\n\nHe can be kinder and nicer to me but he just has better stuff to do and I'm really mad but I know I'm not entitled to anyone's time. I just feel like it would be nice if he would try just a little more to be here for me. \n\nI don't expect from him to write me non stop but a text maybe once a day would be nice and just enough. And go out with me from time to time. \nEverytime I wanna go out I have to ask because he never does.\n\nAny way, right now I'm just a sad, frustrated mess and I don't know if I can think straight anymore, I'm tearing up and if I'm overreacting, if I am the asshole and I'm just crazy please let me know but I don't think I can do this Any more and I'm on the verge of exploding and going reee on him. \nI really love him and I don't want our relationship to fall apart but I feel like I'm falling apart. I dont know what to do. ",

      "description": "\nLong tldr at the end\n\nMy girlfriend of over 3 years has had many health problems while we've been dating and about a month or two ago she was hospitalized for them. I have always took care of her, probably a little too much, but her health was just getting worse and worse. It has been putting a large strain on our relationship. We are both university students and on the day in question we had made plans to hang out after class. That day goes by and I dont hear from her and so I keep trying to get in touch with her to see if she's ok and if we are still hanging out. She later calls me and says \"so I'm in the hospital...\" turns out her mom had picked her up as it was too much for her and takes her to the hospital. Immediately I want to drop everything and go see her and I tell her as such. She then proceeds to say no and that she hopefully wont be there more than a day and is just staying overnight and not to come. I really wasn't comfortable with this but she asked me to give her some space so I did. She leaves the hospital and I visit her at home as soon as she tells me she's home. A few days later she's back in the hospital this time for a few days. Again I ask if I should come down to her and she tells me no. Again I stay up at school and as soon as she is out of the hospital and back home I drive down to see her and make sure she's ok. Flashforward to the other day when all of a sudden she asks me, why didn't you visit me at the hospital? I was honestly shocked and pretty offended that she asked me that and I told her as much. She was the one who adamantly told me not to go to the hospital and now she is saying that this is a red flag in our relationship that I didnt visit. I'm pretty hurt as i wanted to drop everything to go to the hospital but she was the one who said not to. Now she is mad at me for listening to her.\n\nI'm actually pretty hurt by this as I do a lot for her and put her needs before mine a lot of the time. Hurt so much so I'm considering ending the relationship as I feel her illness has pushed our relationship too far and this is just the last straw. I just feel so insulted and hurt.\n\nTldr: girlfriend was in the hospital for a few days a month ago and told me not to visit her there and now she is upset I listened to her and didn't go. She is calling it a red flag in our relationship.",

      "description": "Mom had me as a teen and I was adopted by dad at 1 year old, didn't find out he was not my bio dad until after their divorce at 12. My dad sort of exited my life. He is a \"nice\" guy and when I see him hes hugs all over me and talks kindly, then I wont hear from him again for months. That is the manipulation. Its hard to recognize because of how nice he is. He never raised a hand or his voice to me growing up. Very mild tempered. He has held a grudge against me from when I was 11 years old. The day I told him I wanted to live with my grandma because he was depressed and would not give me any attention. Ever since I have heard from him very rarely. His balls are basically in his wife's pocket. Its his third wife and he wont risk losing another one, he does whatever she says. Im a single mom of two kids, 3 and 5. They rarely see him, he doesn't call them. When they used to visit my grandma he would drive by there and see them for 10 minutes. He would act like hes grandpa of the year. He didnt want them at his house...which was fine I knew they were babies and difficult to handle. After years of never asking for a favor, I told him I was invited on an amazing trip and it would be something for me to do on my own, and have a break. I am trying to plan for my kids to be taken care of for 8 days and giving everyone 2 months notice. I live 6 hours from family so I thought everyone would be looking forward to seeing the kids.  I asked my dad if he would like to have them for 2 nights over the weekend. He lives on a farm and I know they would love seeing the animals. He says he has to ask his wife and comes back with \"I want to see them but I cant spend my 2 nights off watching kids. It isn't fair to me or wife. They should be your priority and you cant just leave them for this amount of time. Watching them for a couple hours is one thing but the whole weekend is another. This isn't a break, its extreme\". I never ask him for anything. Its not the trip, I can take or leave the trip, its him making it seem like its such an annoying request. He said that he cant maintain a relationship with them because I live too far away. I said people live a distance from their grand kids all the time and make it a priority to talk to them. I am driving the kids there and picking them up. I ask for childcare maybe twice a year from my mom for 2 nights. AITA for cutting him off for good from our lives? Maybe I am being entitled and dont realize it. I know they are my responsibility and no one elses. I never thought asking for family help would feel so much like begging. You would think they would want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWant to mention he is holding a mini grudge against me for leaving my husband. I was emotionally and mentally abused and cheated on, but he blames me for tearing apart the kids family. He is projecting his past pain from my mom leaving him and the divorce hurting my brother and I onto me, and thinks I could have stayed for the kids sake.",

      "title": "AITA for trying to keep a super close eye on depressed suicidal step-daughter?",
      "description": "So I'm married with a couple of step-kids that live with their mom and I. The older kid is doing great, but the younger (14) has gotten involved in some pretty bad things in the past year, including some illegal activity, as well as self-harm including cutting. Additionally, on two different occasions last year, including as recently as November, she purposely overdosed on medication but (thank heavens) regretted it afterwards and let us know so we could get her to the hospital. We now keep all blades and medications locked up and out of reach. We have of course been getting her the best help we can afford for her, including solid counseling and psychiatry evaluation. Her psychiatrist believe that she is likely bi-polar.\n\nAfter the second attempt, I noticed the patterns that start to emerge from her when she's likely to cause harm to herself. She exhibits heavy depression, wears extra layers of makeup (and much darker makeup as well), refuses to talk about what's bothering her when asked, usually denying that anything's wrong, pushes everyone away, and attempts to withdraw into the bathroom or her bedroom for a long period of time. This also seems to occur more often around times that should be celebrated, like holidays and family birthdays. So, twice since November I've noticed things getting dark and heavy with her, and decided to go on suicide watch. I'm probably not the most skilled at this, I've never had previous exposure with suicidal people or had any training or anything of the sort. Also, there seem to be a lack of information online of what to do in these situations (other than the stuff we're already doing). So as far as I can tell, I should make sure that I or someone else should be able to see her at all times, including if she's in her room, the bathroom, etc. I know we've done our best to limit her access to self-harm tools, but I believe she's also smart enough to hide some stashes of things throughout our (unfortunately) cluttered house so she can self-harm if she wants. So when I've gone on suicide watch these two times, I allow her to still go anywhere she wants. I do make sure that I or some other family member (especially if she's going to the bathroom) has an eye on her at all times. This makes my step-daughter angry to no end, yelling, screaming about how she has no privacy.\n\nLast night was the second time and was particularly bad. She was trying very hard to lock herself off in her room. I started by trying to encourage her to come out and be with the family, letting her know we really wanted her company. She insisted that she was going to do laundry in her room. I told her that's fine, but I would need to be in there with her. She freaked out and kept trying to argue with me about it. She asked if her aunt (who was over at the time) could watch her instead, and I told her that's fine, but I would need to speak with the aunt first to give her some instructions (such as make sure you keep an eye on her even if she's in the bathroom, etc). Step-daughter would not go for this, freaked out more.\n\nWife came downstairs and tried to help. She tried to negotiate with step-daughter, saying she could just leave the door halfway open and that would be good enough and we would be down the hall and come check on her from time to time. Step-daughter would not budge insisting that she had every right to have her door fully closed and be all alone. I didn't agree with my wife on this because I feel like she only needs a few moments to find a tool and do self harm, but I kept quiet and let her try. Step-daughter wouldn't agree to any of wife's terms anyways.\n\nEventually I stepped in front of her bedroom door so she couldn't attempt to shut it on me and lock us out, and then she ran out of her room bawling and up the stairs. I tried following behind her and my wife grabbed my hand and told me \"don't\". I yanked my hand away and I followed step-daughter up the stairs. Step-daughter got to the top of the stairs, turned around and bolted back downstairs to her room, with me following all the way. She slammed the bedroom door shut but I got it open before she could lock it and held it open. She then started hitting me with her fists while bawling. At this point my wife grabbed her and held her and her aunt stepped in to help provide some comfort, and I left.\n\nI'm trying to do the right thing here. I want to be safe and am not interested in violating her privacy or restricting her in any way other than when she's most vulnerable to self-harm. But my other step-daughter, mother-in-law, and wife all had some negative feedback for me. Mother-in-law and other step-daughter say I was scary chasing after step-daughter the way I did. Wife believes step-daughter should have been allowed to run up the stairs alone and been given some room to grieve in complete privacy. I disagree because I believe she would have locked herself in the upstairs bathroom or another room and potentially found a way to hurt or kill herself in there. I suspect wife thinks that my suicide watch is overly controlling and is in fact having the wrong effect, in other words that I'm driving her to more likely self-harm. I don't know if she's right or not.\n\nI feel like I'm in crazy town. I feel like I'm the only one on board with doing what's necessary to keep her safe when she's at the low end of her cycle. If I'm the asshole, or even if I'm not, I want to know what I can do better because I very much do want my step-daughter to be safe. Would definitely love to hear from some professionals or other people experienced with these sort of situations.\n\nSo tell me, Reddit. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Okay, so I know this sounds bad but hear me out as I'm really uncomfortable about what just happened a few minutes ago.\n\nCurrently I live an extended stay hotel (between housing situations for a job). The hotel is very nice and has house cleaning every day. Laundry is  on the Tennants, so they provide quarter operated laundry downstairs.\n\nSince I'm still here for another two weeks, I got about $5-$10 (not sure of the exact amount, started with $10) worth of quarters and put them on my dresser.\n\nAfter work today, I returned home to a clean room. However, I also needed to do laundry. I went to the dresser to find that the quarters were no longer there. There was however a note saying \"thank you for the tip! I'm very greatful!\". I was a little shook as those quarters weren't intended as tip...\n\nI took the note and went downstairs because I wasn't sure what to do. The following conversation took place:\n\nMe: \"hey, so this is a little awkward because this person was so nice about it, but I had some quarters on my dresser for laundry and they aren't there anymore...\"\n\nFront desk (FD): \"oh, we're so sorry about that! (They really are nice people) how much was there?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not sure of the exact amount, but it was between $5-$10\"\n\nFD: \"oh, well here's $10 of quarters to make up for it\"\n\nMe: \"... Oh, uh, thank you?\"\n\nThese people were too nice that I didn't really know how to respond except to accept the quarters. As I did, I realized that I might be an asshole by accepting it. Until...\n\nFD: \"Is that the note they left?\"\n\nMe: \"uhhh... Yeah, but I don't want to give you this if it'll get someone in trouble... Now that I think about it, it isn't that big of a deal...\" (The cleaning person signed their name on the note)\n\nFD: \"oh, it's fine, they won't be in trouble\"\n\nSo I just handed it over. The end.\n\nAs I walked back to my room, I kept thinking 'what the fuck was even the point of that? That person is definitely gonna get in trouble... Fuck, am I an asshole?'\n\nI bounced it off my friends and they said I should've just let them have it. But it was honestly like I was on autopilot because I had money taken from me without consent. My gf looked it up and said that tipping is customary. However, you usually leave a note saying that it was intended as tip.\n\nI know that cleaning services people get paid shit (worked in the industry, so I'm pretty aware) and they need those tips... I'm at a loss. So Reddit. Judge me. AITA?\n",

      "description": "So a little back story. I moved. And in my past place I had this best friend. Let’s call him Bean. So I used to have a little crush on Bean. But I got over it and we eventually bonded over memes and jokes. Bean was super nice and cool and chill. We were best friends for AB two years until I moved. He promised we would definetly keep in touch! And I was like cool! Well we did keep in touch for a while. Like ab a couple months. And we would FaceTime. Well I would keep factiming him weekly like we were doing. But he wasn’t answering. I thought nothing at first bc he was Busy and school was starting up again. But then weeks of no answer turned into months. Come to the present now and it’s ab 4 months after Bean stopped talking with me. Well yesterday I texted him the following message:\nNOTE: I took some things out since it’s personal\n\nWhy don’t we talk anymore?\nIt’s suppppeerrr weird hitting u up out of the blue. But like I was looking at my yearbook from last year and I was like. Omg we used to be good friends and whatever. And then I thought ab how we lost connection and that made me really sad. But I feel like it’s my fault bc I never try to talk anymore. But no offense it’s kinda your fault too. You never respond. And I know that sounds creepy. But like. You gotta understand that sometimes I feel like nobody cares . Only two people do. BLANK and BLANK It’s like kinda weird since we were such good friends. And sometimes I’ll think what ever happened. We used to hang out during school a lot. Now you won’t even answer my calls or anything. When I look back I feel really sad. But then I feel angry. And it’s weird to feel angry at my friends. I’m used to being angry at my siblings but it’s different. I’m angry because it’s heartbreaking that my best friend won’t even talk with me anymore. And I’m sad because I know I lost a friendship that meant a lot to me. If you know me you know I’m dramatic and weird. But i don’t think you know that no matter what i try and put so much effort into my friendships. If you don’t want to talk to me anymore that’s fine. Because I get that long distance friendships don’t work out because nobody ever really talks anymore. But I ik that ur a cool dude. So bye lol sorry if this is random or whatever. Bye. \n\nHe didn’t respond. But he read it\n\nSo my question is. AITA for getting mad like this. ",

      "description": "My 70 year old grandmother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease over ten years ago. She has been in a nursing home for seven years now (my parents and I live abroad and couldn't take her in). My mom (her daughter) visits her anytime she can but my brother and I have stopped visiting her five years ago.\n\nThe reason being that the last couple of times we saw her she didn't recognise either of us, had no recollection of having grandkids, and (it's part of the disease) she was quite aggressive/weird with us. I stopped seeing her at the age of 17 because I felt like it wasn't the grandmother I knew anymore. She had forgotten who I was but I didn't want to *strain* the memory I have of her.\n\nOur parents always said they understood and respected our choice, especially since her condition has only gotten worse with time. She can't get of bed and only recognises my mom now. \n\nHowever, today my dad was looking through photos on his phone and showed me a picture of my grandmother in her nursing home bed and said *\"you guys are really not nice for not wanting to see her anymore.\"*\n\nIt might be considered unethical reasoning but I feel like our grandmother has been gone for a while but her body is still here... And I don't want my last memory of her to be of someone who doesn't recognise me and that I don't either. \n\nAre my brother and I the assholes for not going anymore?",

      "description": "So, I need to give some background. \nI have a 4 year old son. \nHis dad and I were married until he was 3. His dad left me suddenly for another woman. They now live together and have a baby of their own. While we were together, his dad worked nights and I worked days as neither of us wanted to put our son in daycare and wanted to be around him as much as possible. It worked out well for us. \nNow we split custody 50/50. For one, because I still think he’s a good dad and want him involved with our son, obviously. \nAnd for two, because I have to work a lot more now to be able to afford living on my own and supporting myself and my son while paying rent/car/bills. My ex and I have similar incomes so neither of us pay child support, though he recently got a new job and makes significantly more than I do, I believe. \n\nAnyway, him and his girlfriend are pushing for our son to be in preschool, which I agree would be good for him. \nHowever, I’m doing this by myself while working full time and going to school full time. Not only do I not have the time to work with preschool schedules (middle of the day Tues&amp;Thurs) which are the same days I have class, but I also don’t want to sacrifice the time I have with my son right now. (Not to say preschool isn’t important I just already miss him due to the 50/50 schedule, work, and college)\nI completely acknowledge those might be selfish reasons, but I seriously don’t know how I would bring/pick him up to preschool while I’m working... I work an hour away. My family helps watch him while I work but I bring him to them, as my parents don’t drive. So they couldn’t help me with this. \n\nMy thoughts are he will be in kindergarten this fall already. I will be done with school then. My schedule will be a lot more open, I should be able to work less as I’ll be making more, and can better work with the school schedule. \nI’ve spoken to his dad about my concerns/issues, and he says I’m being a bad parent and how could I not want our son in preschool? I just don’t know how I would do it...\n\nSo AITA?",

I understand being required to let her know where I am and for how long, but that's not the same as permission.\n\nThe way my mother views permission is her having the ability to control my life however she wants. I know this because she's tried to manipulate me my entire life (ranging from siding with her to getting information out of people who wouldn't normally give said info to her).\n\nBecause of this, and because I'm 18 and my father is 'freed' from my mother's curse of child support, I feel as though I shouldn't be required to ask for permission to visit my father.\n\nAm I wrong?

      "description": "My wife, my son (1yr), and I are going home for Christmas for three nights. One night at her mothers one at my fathers then at my own mothers. Now her mother was fairly abusive and manipulative to her, she would hit her every so often and they had a very aggressive relationship with a lot of screaming at each other and her mother making her cry. She was even kicked out and had to live with my dad after the baby was born. They (wife’s family) do drugs at her house, the house is smelly and often times has animal feces or urine on the floor. I don’t feel comfortable staying the night their especially not with our son, she insist that we have to stay there for a night and she does love her mother since it’s all she has back home. I get it but I get anxiety just thinking about it. How can I convince her to at least let me and the baby not stay the night, I’m fine with just visiting. I am in the military and don’t want to be around drugs, or the type of people her mother has around. My family is clean and they drink but that’s about it we all have a good relationship with them so that’s not an issue staying their for either of us, but she still wants to stay one night at her mothers.

      "description": "Okay, so let's set the scene a bit. I have been with my boyfriend since March 13th, 2015. That means this will be the 5th year we've celebrated our birthdays as couples. He's October 28th, I'm November 26th. I always plan the fun stuff for his birthday, and my birthday... Always falls flat. \n\nLike this most recent birthday, he turned 19. I planned a nice day together, we went to one of his favorite restaurants, I paid, all that jazz. It was a low-key day, but it was nice. \n\nThis year, I'm turning 20. My birthday is on a school day so I'm busy all day, and a month ago I told him to pick the day before or the day after. I'd spend the other day with my family.\n\nIt's a week before and he hasn't even chosen a day. I asked him this morning and he said he hadn't asked for either day off, which he has had plenty of time to do. \n\nThis lets me know he has no plans for the day. He'll do what he always does, and tell me \"it's your day, we'll do whatever you want\" so he won't have to plan anything or make any actual decisions. \n\nAn I am asshole for expensing something more? I'm not asking for a trip to France, but him just planning dinner and a movie or something would be more than enough. I don't need presents, I don't need anything fancy. Just a plan, that he's thought out, something to show me he's put some thought into my birthday. McDonald's and a nice note written on the back of a receipt and I'm happy really. \n\nI just want him to try.",

      "description": "First off I know she can be friends with anyone she wants. Now onto this long story.\n\nSo my best friend and I were close friends with this other girl. In the summer of 2017 she got a new neighbor a grade ahead of us. Let's call him C. We all met C and he joined our friend group and at the end of the summer he and our close friend started dating. I never really liked C he gave me a bad vibe but I hung out with him because all my other friends did. \n\nA couple months later they broke up. And hated eachother and couldnt be around eachother.\n\n During the break up we weren't friends with C's now ex. Around December we became friends with her again. \n\nIn January it was revealed that I didnt trust C and he said we couldnt be friends which I was okay with. He was still friends with my best friend. A couple weeks later he decided he couldn't be friends with my best friend because she was friends with his ex. He told her this over text in a dramatic \"I just cant...\" shit and it broke her heart.  A couple weeks later he texted us and begged for our forgiveness which I immediately declined due to him hurting my best friend so badly. She gladly exepted even though I suggested he shouldn't. A month later him and his ex threw allegations at eachother and both of them made her choose a side.\n A couple days later he pulled the same shit as last time and ended it over text with the same dramatic shit pretending he was the victim. Again my best friend was heartbroken. Now to this day it still affects her because she never got closure. We are thinking of seeking closer from him to help her out because she misses him. \n\nNow she does confront him I would be there with her for emotional support and try to keep herself from forgiving him. Even though she asked me to I know her and she is gonna get extremely mad at me for trying and no matter what I will be there for her. But if I do prevent her from becoming friends with her would I be an asshole because she loves and misses him?\n\n",

      "description": "This hasn’t been discussed with my best friend just yet (if someone could suggest a “Will I Be An Asshole If” that would be great) but here it goes. And I guess it’s possible IATA if I’m already thinking it.\n\nTL;DR- Constantly clingy friend has been smothering me. Contemplated telling her to stop it. While brainstorming points and considering factors on how to break this news in the most frank but sensitive way, clingy friend calls immediately to tell me she’s pregnant. Keeps saying things over and over again how I need to be there, guide her, and without context.\n\nFull version:\n\nMy best friend has been awfully clingy lately. So much I’ve gone out of my way to do favors for her, do whatever she wants, etc. She is grateful for the time spent and sometimes makes up for it by buying a gift as a token of appreciation but I’m usually wiped out before she asks for favors the next day. She’ll often point out how much I do for her too or tell others how I’d practically die for her. It’s strange..\n\nMy best friend will call me sometimes in the middle of the work week and ask if I have plans over the weekend. I love the advanced notice instead of springing news on me within 30 min. Before something’s happening; but because I feel smothered as it is I’m either trying to find an excuse to get out of a pre-invite, be stupidly honest and say nothing to where then she excitedly makes a schedule for US, or I tell her we actually do have plans with family or friends.\nBut it never fails.. the weekend rolls around and my phone will ding me at least three times a day “What are you up to now?” “Is your family gone?” “Are you home now from the movies?” “Can I come over and show my husband your new guest room?” “Okay then but can you come over instead perhaps, like, immediately?”\nMy husband is starting to find this behavior annoying and he shakes his head in disappointment at me if I can’t bare to firmly say, ‘No’ because I’m nervous to hurt her feelings or have a big blow up over it as we have had before 6 years ago.... calling me a bad friend because I never go out of my way to invite her over or do stuff. I just hope things are different now.\n\nAfter some Reddit advice and consideration, I start to brainstorm how to tell my friend I need space. That I love her, and will always be, but I feel sick. And sometimes my feelings are important and I need time alone to recharge, including the stressful texts. I try to ease my mind and settle down by doing some laundry when my phone blows up again. She’s calling.\n\nI answer it and think she’s hurt because she’s frantic and crying. Instead, she’s just announced she is pregnant. I’m honestly a little floored but still congratulate her and tell her it’s okay to cry and have mixed emotions as it’s a big thing. Before she can hang up to go tell her husband as he’s walking in the door, she cuts me off, “PROMISE ME YOULL BE THERE.” I answer “Sure.” Not really know what the heck that means. She says it again, “No, I’m serious. I need to know if you’re fully invested in this because I can’t do this alone. Promise me you’ll be there and stick through this, on my side—gotta go!” And hangs up.\n\nWhat does that even mean?...\n\nShe texts me five minutes later, “Come over right now?”\n\nI say no. I can’t. (A lie, although I am doing my bedding and it’s 7pm, I haven’t had dinner yet)\n\nShe texts me back, “What can I eat?”\n\nI respond, “Y’know... Considering your pregnant now you’re really going to have to do some research on x , y , z and know for yourself what you may like, the baby won’t. Stay away from the most commonly known bad food for pregnancies (caffeine, liquor, fish with high mercury, etc).”\n\nShe’s texted me back an hour later, “You swear you’ll help me right? Im panicking. I need you.”\n\nBut help with what?!? I’m not a professional, a doctor, an OBGYN, a nutritionist, a trainer, I’m not her husband, her mom, her doula, nor will I pay money to buy things as I have my own finances to worry about and I have to save up. (She’s seen things at stores and randomly asks me to buy them for her, even before pregnancy).  It’s not like I don’t have a choice as I’m not the one who’s pregnant and it’s not my kid/responsibility.\n\nSo reddit, before this goes down possibly horribly because I don’t know how she’ll react, AITA for not wanting to be there 100% of the time she’s pregnant or needs my help—or whatever it is she means? I have a life too.\n(I’m sure in our discussion I will ask her to specify her needs and what I can and cannot do for her.)\nI can assure you I will tell her I still love her.. and remain good friends.. but I can’t hold her hand the whole way. I don’t have kids and don’t want any still for a few more years. I am the last of my girl friends to ever conceive and I’ve been useful and helpful in ways but not there all the time.",

      "description": "Two days ago was my mother's funeral. My (28M) sister (27F) and brother (23M) did not go.\n\nMy sister and her husband are 350lb each. They make more money in benefits per month than I do at my career job. Something to the tune of $4,000 a month they receive and they squander it every month. They live only 30 minutes away and asked me to bring them. I told them I couldn't, there's not enough room with my wife, myself, my daughter, and two people who would take up the backseat on their own in my dinky sedan. I told them they have more than enough money (provided they didn't blow this month's benefits) to get transport. They refused and said they would not go if I didn't bring them. I didn't.\n\nMy brother lives 3 hours a way. He's pretty destitute going from couch to couch with his girlfriend. He has never held a job but is too \"prideful\" for benefits. He relies on the generosity of others for the most part, although his girlfriend works part-time in fast food. He originally asked me to come get him but instead I offered to front him the $120 train ticket. This was last week, and a day before the funeral he said he needed it for his cellphone bill and to send him another $120. I didn't.\n\nSo neither went. I was the only child who went, alongside cousins, aunts and uncles, etc. At the end of it, a group of my aunts pulled me aside and said I was a complete jerk for not ensuring my siblings were there, as if I'm fully responsible for them being here.\n\nAITA in this scenario? Technically I could have dropped my wife and kid off and then picked up my sister and her husband, and technically I could have sent my brother more money to come. I didn't, though.",

      "description": "Okay so I was having a really tough day at school. Nothing wrong in particular, but just really bad. It was almost the end of school and this girl I will call her b because I don’t want to use her real name, was on my phone taking pictures. B never asked and I don’t like people being on my phone, it’s rude and intruding. I see her, run and slap the back of her head hard (I know I shouldn’t have, but I didn’t think before i after and it was my fault for making her mad I will admit). She gets mad and starts yelling at me “you’re lucky I like you” and then proceeds to push me into the ground. This was all in front of the teacher and she was going to write a report on it. I don’t know which one did worse, but I’m currently crying while reading this just because I don’t wanna bottle up emotions and I always tell myself to never let people get to me, but it is and I don’t know if I should feel sorry or feel bad. Help please. ",

      "description": "Backstory is that I’ve known friend (we’ll call her “JANE”) for 2 years. During the second year of friendship Jane met “JOHN” whom she got pregnant to, got engaged too and now they are getting married next week. We ended up having babies about a month apart which brought us back to chatting and being friends.\n\nThe old Jane (1+ yrs ago) used to ask me to do things for her CONSTANTLY. Basically at the time the friendship was her using me to look after he animals all the time at her home she was “renovating”, while she was off in another town with John, going to parties etc. I stopped all contact with her and basically ended the friendship. She reached out to me 3 months ago after seeing I had given birth to my son just a month after she had given birth to her own. I was happy to give it another go, thinking things might be different since shes become a mother.\n\nOk so...\n\nJane about three days before her Hens party invited me when to tag along. She had organized go karting, drinks and dinner. I said I might be able to go depending on my 3 month old son. \n\nJane said she was just going to drink and still breastfeed her 4 month old and that “if you’re ok to drive then you’re ok to feed”. \n\nThe day before said Hens, she asked me if I was coming and I said no. I truthfully said my son was cluster feeding and that I was unable to pump enough milk to go out and drink/to be away from him for hours.\n\nJane bombarded me with messages saying the following;\n\n- come out but don’t drink\n- i’ll give you some of my breastmilk\n- just bring him along\n- just at least call in then (venue is an hour away from me)\n\nI was so overwhelmed that I said I would pump and see how I got on and MIGHT call in but that I also might not. \n\nNeedless to say I didn’t get on very well with pumping and decided to stay home. I didn’t feel safe taking my baby out to a pub/club and being around heavily intoxicated people, so I didn’t want to “just call in” either. Secondly I just feel that my partying days have passed and I’m not into getting wasted anymore. \n\nSo day of hens party I got sidetracked when family came to visit, house work, grocery shopping, baby stuff etc that when she messaged me the place they were going to for drinks and dinner, I didn’t end up messaging her back. \n\nToday was the day after the hens party and I woke up, saw the message again and thought oh i will ask her out to lunch at this nice place to make up for me not going and that it would be more suitable as i can bring baby and she can bring her baby too.\n\nJane asked me to call and then she rang and she proceeded to say she doesn’t think the friendships working out, why didn’t I respond or turn up, doesn’t think we should be friends anymore etc etc. I explained that my baby’s needs come first and I couldn’t go and that I had said that to her and she still insisted I turn up, etc but she ended up just hanging up mid phone call and blocking me on all social media (her partner also blocked me too).",

      "description": "Throwaway because, well... you know.\n\nTL;DR Below\n\nI typed this out a couple of times because I felt the context was really important, but it gets way too big... so feel free to INFO if you feel like this isn't detailed enough.\n\nMe(T)22 and my Ex(D)20 were together for about 4 years.\n\nBefore D and I got together she was in a very emotionally, and physically abusive, and sexually coercive relationship with a Guy we'll call M. It took about a year's worth of love and therapy, at the end of which we got together, to get her out of the deep depression she was in after he dumped her.\n\nWhen started Dating, M suddenly took interest in D again, he continuously pestered her to be friends with him (which I was adamantly against. Might sound controlling of me, but after learning the kinds of things he did to D and other girls I just couldn't allow him to be near her). After 2 years of this D agreed to be friends with him - D's therapist WHO KNEW THE THINGS HE DID advised that D befriend him as a means of \"letting go\" of the past and forgiving him.\n\nI voiced my objections to this the moment I found out, but eventually accepted it because it was what D felt she wanted. \n\nOver the course of the next 2 years, D would get increasingly flirty vibes from M(late night Texts, long hugs, surprise kisses on the cheek, etc), and even though I wanted and should have told him off (or beat the shit out of him) - D would tell me not to, and that I should trust her transparency about it and just ignore him - so I went along with it. That was until I found out M was getting way too flirty with D and was driving her down and away from her life goals that she had been working so hard towards - after and incident where M confessed he still loved D and kissed her when she was in no position to resist (I was not there at the time, but her friends were and did nothing to help her), we talked about how D needed to stop interacting with M - She surprisingly agreed to that, and was realizing how toxic M was to her and her future. \n\nA month or so later I found out that they were still hanging out and doing things that might not have been cheating, but were definitely not good for our relationship and her mental health.\n\nI confronted D about lying to me, and told her that she needs to stop seeing him or its over between us - to which, and I quote, she said \"I can't decide which one of you I love more\"... I told her things were over between us the moment I heard that.\n\nSince then I've been getting texts from her friends calling me an asshole and saying how much they always hated me. I also learned that D has been hanging out with M to cope with apparently the worst thing to ever happen to her, which was me... I honestly feel like I made the right choice, but I'm starting to question myself.... so AITA?\n\nTL;DR - I dumped my now ex because she continued hanging out with her friend who was her extremely abusive Ex, even after she promised she wouldn't.",

Lately her attitude with everything has just been awful. We both work and go to school, everyday she complains about how her life is bullshit and everything sucks in her life and will cry. I get it though, life is hard at our age but I tell her all the time “it’ll get better, we are just young, we have to finish school first, it’s just a stupid part time retail job it’s gonna suck”. Usually I’m ok with it even though it happens 90% she comes home from work or school and talks about how her life is bullshit. Last night though i feel like is the last straw. We live in a lower level of my GFs moms house ( we have a kitchen, living room, two bedroom and we can also block off the upstairs with door if we really wanted too. It’s exactly like an apartment). My GF, her brother, and I wanted to get drunk and have a good time, but I bought us vodka and she got upset that I didn’t buy wine. She went on her rant about how her life is “bullshit, life sucks, why did it have to happen to me”. She went upstairs and complained to her mother and her mother went out and got wine for her. After a bit of drinking she went in the showered and cried. When I went in to talk to her she just told me to get out. I don’t think I said anything to her. Last I remember we were all drinking and watching tv, but I could be wrong and made her cry I don’t remember. I want to tell her that I don’t want to be with someone who has such a negative attitude and acts like s child when something doesn’t go her way. WAITA if I said that to her?",

      "description": " I have a rare autoimmune kidney disease that recently progressed to the point of end stage renal failure. I'm in the process of getting evaluated for a transplant, and my first appointment with the transplant centre is next week. After this, any potential donors can come forward and offer to be tested for a living donor transplant. The plan right now is for just my parents to be tested.\n\n  One of my friends is adamant that she wants to be tested to see if she's a match, and if she is a match she wants to be the one to give me a kidney. She's an extremely stubborn and driven individual and has very firmly made her mind up on this. We also know already that we're a blood type match, so there is a solid chance that she would be a potential donor. \n\n  The thing is, I don't like the idea of her donating for a couple of reasons. First off, the condition I have has a high rate of reoccurrance in transplants, so theres a strong chance (between 30 and 50%) that my body will wreck a new kidney and I'll be back in renal failure in a couple of years at best, so she could just be wasting her kidney on me. Secondly, it's a really invasive procedure with a long recovery time, and I know she wants to go travelling and explore the world, and I don't want to be the thing that holds her back from that. \n\n  A couple of my friends and family don't see things from my side and think I'm either being too stubborn to accept help, or too pessimistic about my outlook if I do get a transplant, and think I should let my friend get tested. We've also argued a couple of times over the situation and she thinks I'm being unreasonable. \n\nI get final say over who is allowed get tested, so WIBTA if I refused to allow my friend to get tested?

I’ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is “intolerant” of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they’re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I’ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow “developed” these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don’t want to try. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "The apartment I rent takes checks still (weird right). The manager usually takes the money out of the bank 1.5-2 weeks after it is due on the first of the month. This was always a nice buffer, in the beginning. We've had our difficulties and struggles to make enough money through changing jobs. I was unemployed for eight months while studying for a new career path and needed a lot of help from my parents. My roommate helped me here and there by buying food, and holding enough money on two occasions until the money was about to come out since my parents weren't always ready to give me rent money (I felt awful asking for money, so I waited usually).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this rough time, I scored a very high paying job and spent the next few months catching up as fast as I could. Everything I owed to anyone was paid back. My roommate hated the job he had, and I offered to help out as he switched jobs. That's when the shit started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe became very quiet about money in general, and made it extremely weird asking for money for bills, saying shit like \"just because you make more money doesn't mean I'm ready to pay for things\". I helped him with rent month after month, and added up everything I helped with on a spreadsheet. I knew he was struggling and I wanted to be helpful, but also wanted accountability on his part. Each month, the first would come and go and he wouldn't say a word, no rent money, nothing. I'd have to keep an extra $500 of my money sitting in my account so the checks would go through, and some months I'd have to ask where rent was and he would suddenly come up with excuses why he could only pay a portion. Up and up the money he owed me stacked. Utilities? He didn't bother asking what it was, and didn't pay until I asked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne morning when I woke up to $10 in my bank account, I lost it. He was working, so I texted him a long message about how I expected rent NOW, and how I didn't understand how he never has money even though I'm fully aware of how much money he makes. He pulled the \"but I helped you when you needed it\" card, like I owed him for it. I shot back with how I paid everything back, and I didn't use help more than a handful of times. Overall I felt justified because month after month I was covering his rent, and not always getting it back in full, or at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince this happened, he showed me all his bills and income, and I turned the tables by making him use his account. I subtract utilities from the rent I pay him and it's working well so far. But sometimes I wonder if I was making an ass of myself bitching him out when he was still struggling.",

      "description": "  \n\nI (26F) have been with my now ex-bf (22M) for 2 years. Everything was fine until 3 weeks ago when I got a FB message from a girl that was screenshots of their conversation. He created a fake Insta account messaging her telling her how gorgeous she is, etc. Note, this is not the first time this happened. So I confront him, he denies it, I have proof, he lies, I tell him he has to leave, he does. A few days pass and we talk about what happened; he said he had been suppressing stuff that made him unhappy. Well, this is the SAME reason he reached out to a girl the first time. At this point, I am SO mad that he would throw away our relationship over simply not coming to me and communicating “Hey, my feelings are hurt over X, Y and Z.” and then we can talk, fix it and be happy again. I am willing to work through this and make us work again. He says he needs his time.\n\nWe met up after a 1.5 weeks, he says the same thing; he needs more time to figure himself out. So I ask him upfront, are there any other girls in the picture? He tells me straight up, no. He isn’t interested, doesn’t want anything to do with girls, just wants to be alone and figure himself out. He asks me for another week of time and asks me to wait for him. I oblige. Monday rolls around, he texts me wanting to get back together. He makes plans to pack up his stuff (he’s been staying at a friend’s who’s lease is up March 1st) and come home today.\n\nDuring our time apart, through mutual friends, I saw him drunk at a club. So I tell him I need to know if anything happened. He said yes, he had a one night stand. I am devastated. We had been apart for less than 2 weeks when he hooked up with a girl during the extra week that HE requested while asking me to wait for him. At this point, I am broken and furious. I tell him he can’t come back and I don’t want to work things out. He tells me he’s moving back in anyway. I ask him to move in with his parents which would be free and he refuses. He says he can’t afford two rents for his own place and he refuses to pay for a place that he can’t live in. I am crushed; all I want is to move forward with my life and be able to get over him but I can’t do that when I have to see him every day for the next 6 months. I’m on student loans so I can’t afford the rent alone. So here he is, he cheats on me, asks me to wait for him, goes and has a one night stand, and then still gets to come back home? He gets to have his cake and eat it too. I feel like I’m being manipulated and controlled in his forcing me to live with him after all of this. So tonight I want to revisit the idea of him moving back in with his parents. Maybe I can talk to the complex about moving into a smaller apartment so the rent is less for us both. So AITA for asking him to move back in with his parents and still pay his half of the rent because this is his fuck up and he is legally obligated to pay?",

      "description": "\nMy ex-friend (H) had fuck buddy who used to be her boyfriend (about 1 month of being together). She introduced me to the fuck buddy (K). K and I eventually start dating, after I check with her multiple times if she’s okay with us dating (e.g. are you okay with me dating K? Are you sure you’re okay with this) etc etc.  I end up dating K for more than a year. \n\nWhile I’m dating K, she makes a couple of blog posts and Instagram posts talking about how upset she is that K did not treat her the way he treated me (which tbh behind closed doors was pretty shitty). I eventually drop her as a friend after she makes crappy comments about me on her instagram (I’m blocked but my sister is not and my sister shows me the posts). \n\nI found out that K has been cheating on me with her for 2 months, even offering to meet her on Valentine’s Day over me. I, being a gullible stupid girl with rose tinted lenses, decide I want to work on the relationship. This lasts 3 months. 3 months of me doing the pick me dance and doing whatever he wants just so that he would want to stay with me. Eventually I talk to my parents about it and build up the courage to leave him. (Key point to note: he was basically living in my house with my family (Asian country) but still had his own family home to return to). I break up with him over a call and pack his stuff and deliver it to his parents house. \n\n6 months later, I’m out on a date with my new boyfriend at a restaurant and spot him with the girl he cheated on me with pointing at me and laughing. I go up to them as my boyfriend and I are leaving and comment that “I hope you’re happy with each other”. AITA?",

There are four total lanes of traffic and I am in the right lane. \n\nTo my left, extending about 10' behind me is empty space, with high speed traffic barreling down to pass me if we continue moving down the road. All of a sudden out of nowhere, a pedestrian dressed in all black frantically throws their hand out in front of my car. \n\nThey are approximately 10' in front of me and I am moving about 40 mph. My first thought is FUCK... if I slow down for this dude and he jogs across the road he is going to get hit by the truck behind me.\n\nGuy in black by this time has stepped into the road, frantically waving his hand at me in exaggerated gestures. I am slowed to about 20 and was going to try to drive by him, but he is already in the road, so I short stop it. \n\nThe guy locks eyes with me and waves his hand about 15 more times just in front of my car. He doesn't notice truck zoom by at about 50 or the line of traffic now flowing around me because they think I am in an accident. \n\nHe looks at the traffic stream, back at me. Flips me off and walks away. \n\nYes. Totally, always obey traffic... but I wish I had video of this because he would have been smoked for sure.",

      "description": "Hi there. I’m on mobile so sorry if the formatting is weird. \n\nI’ll start with some backstory. Five months ago, I was dealing with constant jaw pain and numbness in parts of my face. After seeing doctors and dentists, I finally landed at an oral surgeon’s office who took an X-ray and found my wisdom teeth were technically impacted but actively growing at the wrong angle. The reason I was experiencing numbness is because the my teeth are pressing down on a nerve, and surgery will be necessary to prevent possible permanent damage. I scheduled my surgery to land specifically on spring break for my school. Pretty much all of my professors this semester take off points for missing class, so missing an entire week was entirely out of the question for something I’m paying $21K for. This was in December.\n\nI asked my boyfriend immediately afterwards if he would be able to watch me for my surgery. He’s ending trade school so we planned ahead to make sure he would be free during the time I went for my surgery. Everything fit perfectly and we confirmed this was the plan. \n\nThis all changed about three weeks ago, when he got a call from a possible employer who was demanding that he start training on the same day of my surgery. My boyfriend asked if he could delay until the day after and explained the situation, but the employer basically brushed him off and said “she knows it’s a job right?” \n\nThat annoyed me immensely, seeing as this surgery is necessary and I’m not allowed to be by myself, but whatever. We had a heated discussion about it and I told him that if he can’t do it to let me know NOW so I can arrange a “baby sitter” as soon as possible. He kinda went back and forth on it and then decided that he doesn’t want to work with this specific company and that he’ll bring me for my surgery. Okay, cool, I can relax. \n\nToday(less than a week before my surgery), he tells me he can’t take me to my surgery. We get into a huge argument and he says he wants to go to the interview so that it can be on his resume for future employers to look at it. I’m pissed because I can’t find anybody to take me, everyone I know is busy. The paperwork specifically says I’m not allowed to leave the center by myself because I’ll be under the influence; someone has to check me out, so I can’t even get an Uber. He says I should consider his employment, but I don’t think any future employer is going to care that he got a job interview and trained for one day then quit. In fact, I think this shows a lack of commitment. \n\nI feel super guilty because I don’t want to say he can’t go to his interview but now I have to ask a friend to take the day off last minute. AITA for being angry? ",

She has had a past relationship that lasted about 8 months with a guy who forced her to do sexual things she didn't want to do, like showing her breasts, etc. \n\nSo me and my GF have had a serious relationship now for about a year and a half. We haven't had sex yet, we're both virgins. I really want to but she says she's not ready yet and I tell her that's ok and we will of course wait for both to get ready, it's our first time after all. She generally isn't interested in all things sex at all. She very rarely gets horny, but it happens, it used to happen a lot more at the start of the relationahip though. But she does really enjoy our moments when they are happening, but tells me she feels kind lf bad oe ashamed afterwards and she doesn't know why. The farthest we have gone sexually is dry grinding on each other while making out. We have never seen each other completely naked or touched each others private parts.\n\nI've begun feeling a little frustrated sometimes when we go weeks without doing anything, meanwhile I see everyone else our age having sex daily and doing all kinds of things. I have asked her if she has thought about trying to masturbate, maybe the feeling will awake her sexual desires. But she said she just isn't interested in it. I've said to her that a good relationship needs a good sexual relationship aswell, but I don't think shes taking me seriously.\n\nI'm thinking of asking her again to please try it sometime, that it might work and make our relationship get a healthy sexual side to it for once. AITA for wanting this?\n\nI'm thinking some of this has to do with her terrible experiences with her past boyfriend, and her parents telling her she can't have sex until she's \"grown up\". But she's 18, she has grown up all right.",

      "description": "This friend + I had talked just a few weeks before how her coping mechanism is to pull away from people and isolate herself. She doesn't reply to me for months when she's going through hard times and completely closes herself off. I don't want to pry or invade her space but I always kind of bop my head in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo she had an abortion. She told me she spent 2 whole days at her dads house after and was feeling good, many friends were checking up on her. Conversation was super short after that, one word replies. So later in the day I told her something like \"My dogs been sick for 4 months it's freaking me out :/\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was so pissed about that. Thinking I was comparing my dog to her abortion. Honest to god I was just trying to change the subject and keep up conversation. (And my dog has cost me over $2k the past 4 months because of his health so it has just been on my mind). Was my comment in poor taste? It feels like a grey area?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI DID apologize a ton to her and basically told her all that I wrote here. Am I in the wrong?",

      "description": "Okay, so this was a while back. I was out with a pal for a night on the town in a city in Central Europe and we were having a beer in sort of a bar/lounge/restaurant type space. We saw and approached two attractive women in their late 20's, one it turns out was an actress on a TV show (not famous, but whatever) and the other an artist. \n\nWe all had a flirty, fun convo with them for maybe 10-15 minutes. After everyone finished their respective drinks I asked them if they wanted to continue on together and join us for a cocktail at a place a few minutes away. They happily agreed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe new place was quite crowded and it was hard to find a table to sit at. Once we find one, I have to head back to the bar to get drinks as there is no table service. I take everyone's order and pay for a round of cocktails, since its a pay as you guy type of system, and walk the tray of libations back to the table.\n\nAfter a few minutes of chatting,  both ladies casually mention that they have boyfriends that they live with. As any person knows, this sort of info is disappointing to hear after you've invested time into someone you are interested in, but life goes on. We continue conversing about this and that and the mood is generally pretty good, although the convo is losing a bit of luster as time goes on.\n\nI was just finishing my drink and they were about 3/4 through theirs, and they announce that they are going to go for a cigarette in a minute. I suggest that they order the next round on their way out from the bar to the street so the bartender can make the drinks while they smoke, and save everyone a few minutes of waiting. They look at each other and think it's a joke for some reason, and give a sassy, tongue in cheek answer of \"if you want a drink, you know how to do it.\"\n\nI smile, and ask again, \"yeah, but seriously, I'd love to get another one of these. It's your round, after all, and you are going right by the bartender.\" They seem dumbfounded by this and again look at each other like I'm crazy for asking.\n\n\"No, that's not how it works,\" they say again sort of devilishly smiling. \"Nice try though!\" They head out for their cigarette. My buddy also announces he has to pee, and heads off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I feel a bit like I've been taken advantage of. Call me crazy, but when I'm with friends, we will all take turns buying rounds. I'm happy to buy a gal a drink as part of the little ritual, but these two always had boyfriends. So they weren't going into it as part of the ritual, it was always a platonic type of situation for them in their minds. So why would they be exempt from buying a round after having one bought for them?  \n  \n\nThis is the AITA moment of truth. When they are outside I grab both their drinks and finish them. It's a rash decision, and one that obviously flaunts all norms of social courtesy, but in my mind it's acceptable and fitting. They broke the social code of offering to reciprocate, and in a fairly rude and dismissive manner. They seemed to have a level of entitlement that I didn't appreciate. And I had no interest in seeing them again. So fuck it, I'm going to drink the drinks I paid for.\n\nWhen they come back in and see that their glasses are only comprised of ice and a straw, the reaction is one of anger and disgust. They ask why I would do that and I tell them that I bought the drinks and they had no interest in buying the next round, so take it for what it is. A few choice words are thrown my way and they grab their stuff and hastily leave. \n\nMy buddy, just back from the toilet, watches all this unfold and has no idea what has happened. When I explain to him he thinks it's all crazy, but laughs, and we continue on.   \n\n\nSo yeah, I think there is some asshole behavior on my part, but it only came out as a response to what I saw as assholish behavior. AI*T*A?   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "TW for animal injury and mentions of death.\n\nFor context: my sister and her husband (BIL) live with my parents. I moved out before they moved in, and right now I'm back home from college for spring break.\n\nMy BIL brought his dog with him when he moved in with my sister two years ago. Both he and the dog came from an abusive household and she was definitely the worse for wear. She had open wounds from other animals and was extremely anxious about just about everything. She seemed to be recovering for awhile, but her cuts got infected despite treatment, and earlier this year she started on several rounds of intense antibiotics. We've spent thousands of dollars on tests and treatments at this point. Nothing has worked so far, and at present she is stuck in a Cone of Shame with the injuries from two years ago still open and she's lost so much weight she's basically a skeleton. None of the vets have really given a prognosis, but at this point it's hard to imagine her recovering.\n\nI adore this dog. She's incredibly sweet and loving despite everything she's been through, and she's always happy for someone to snuggle her. I'm an animal lover and would be typically happy to oblige, but... I'm also incredibly squeamish and can't handle gore of any type, ESPECIALLY on animals. Looking at her back makes me gag. Like I said, these are two-year-old infected injuries. They're not pretty. We've tried covering them up with doggy t-shirts, but that just ended with blood- and pus-soaked shirts and a minor rash from the friction of the cloth.\n\nLike most dogs, BILs is always on the hunt for soft places to sit, and my bed has become one of her favorites. I sleep with my door closed so I typically move all of the animals out before going to bed, so as to avoid accidents and whatnot. By now I've resorted to having my mom move her away to one of the sofas, sister and BILs room, or anywhere else soft before I go to sleep. I feel like such a jerk for taking her away from where she wants to be when she probably doesn't have long left and should just be petted for hours on end and let sleep wherever the hell she wants. But at the same time, I don't want to worry about kicking her or rolling on top of her in my sleep, or to wake up to find that her cuts are bleeding or oozing again, that she's had a bathroom accident, or worst case scenario, that she's died. I personally didn't sign on for the responsibility of having any dog, much less one this sick, and I don't really think it's fair to myself to force myself to deal with it head-on. But I still feel like the worst person in the world because she deserves any small pleasure she can get at this point and I'm taking that away just so I can starfish when I sleep.\n\nNo one has called me an asshole for this, but man, I feel like one.\n\nSo, AITA for kicking a sick animal out of a soft place?",

He refuses to eat anything outside of American staples like: steak, eggs, pancakes, bacon, burgers, fries, basic sandwiches, etc... And I get everyone has preferences, I really do. EXCEPT this grown ass man refuses to try anything else. He has never had pizza, he has never had any sort of pasta dish, let alone any \"eccentric cuisines\" as he likes to call them. Not even bland boxed macaroni. I thought maybe it was a weird family thing, but apparently his parents are as dumbfounded as I am. He has never even tried anything you can't find at a local Dennys. And no, he is not lying. Apparently it just doesn't appeal to him.\n\nAs you can imagine, this has made choosing restaurants for dates hard. I can't even get him into Mediterranean food, let alone anything \"exotic\" like Indian food, or authentic Chinese food. We live in a city too, so we have so many options but we keep going to steak restaurants are burger joints and it is getting old very fast and I keep getting annoyed that I have to compromise with him - just because we both like steak doesn't mean I want to eat it every week.\n\nI've really started to push, beg, bribe him into trying new foods with me, to going to restaurants I like, but he keeps getting mad that I am trying to \"change\" him, and that I keep making him do things he doesn't want to do. Its pretty early in the relationship, and we have a great time outside of this one sticky issue. So am I being the asshole here with trying to push him out of his comfort zone?

      "description": "Throwaway. Second try.\n\nBackground: Friend and I met in highschool and were drinking buddies in our early 20's. In the ten years since then we've kept in regular contact, but out lives have gone in drastically different directions. I have always been interested in music and songwriting and have been writing songs as a hobby since I was very young. I went to college and then obtained an advanced degree in musicology. I currently work in the music industry, although not as a musician or songwriter.\n\nMy friend is just kind of doing the same stuff he did when we were young. Can't hold down a job and sits around drinking and watching sports all day. We don't see each other often, but we do talk and I don't really feel like we have much in common anymore. I am not into sports and that's really all he ever wants to talk about. The friendship at this point is based more on our history than any shared interests. A few years ago, I had a death in the family that was very traumatic and this friend completely supported me and talked me through a very dark time.\n\nNow that I am finally settled into my career, I have more time to devote to my personal passions and am ready to channel my energy into some creative projects of my own. I mentioned this in conversation with my friend. In a later conversation, my friend announces he has a great idea and thinks we should collaborate and write music together and try to get it published. I felt really uncomfortable with the idea and just tried to change the subject, but he's brought it up in subsequent conversations and seems to be really excited about the prospect. He's already dreamed up our success as a songwriting duo and has thought about how good I would be it. This friend is not even into music and I feel kind of insulted. I tried to escape the conversation by saying that it's something I would like to pursue on my own, but that was a lie.\n\nI do want to collaborate with someone else I know and have even started a tentative project. This person also has a degree in music and although I've never worked with him in a professional capacity, I know from our personal dealings that he is reliable, hard working, and very creative.\n\nI feel my old friend will feel betrayed if he finds out I am working with someone else, and may even feel like I stole HIS idea. He was there for me when I really needed it, but I don't think it's a good idea to try to mix \"business\" with friends in this particular case. I still feel torn though like I should humor him and maybe try to collaborate on something with him just for fun, but I am honestly not interested in diverting any time or effort into something my heart is not in. I am also afraid it might kill our friendship completely due to our very different habits and work ethic. Am I an asshole?",

She said not to worry about it because the charge was reversed (because the trial wasn’t over, Hulu messed up).\n\nThe bigger fight started when she brought up getting an oil change for my car. Backstory on the car: I got an old car for my birthday from my grandparents that ran fine with my grandparents but basically as soon as I had it in my possession started to die. I could no longer afford to fix it so I started to think about getting a different car, because I was pregnant and would need it. I had no credit so I didn’t know where to start looking. My mom convinced me to sell my car and use that money to put towards a brand new car. My husband (boyfriend at the time) told me this was a bad idea, I should get a used car. My mom said, “you can’t finance used cars.” I believed her for some dumb reason. At the dealership I was told I can’t get the car in my name with no credit and I was ready to walk away but the sales guy and my mom convinced me to co sign. The conditions from my mom was that I let her see my daughter whenever she asked (which turned into every single day). So I let it happen.\n\nMy mom proceeded to threaten to take this car away a lot, but the hard truth was if she took it away, it would be harder for her to see my daughter (cause I would have to go north with my husband where he worked). She backed off every time. This time with the oil change, she demanded that we take it to the dealership to get it changed. It costs like $40, but I didn’t have to pay this the first oil change cause it was free. My husband (who I pushed my mom into because I was just done talking to her) told her we couldn’t  afford it and we would take it anywhere else for the oil change (we were in the process of moving as this was happening). She didn’t like that answer and proceeded to insult my husband and call him a bad father. His response was “your behavior makes it pretty hard for us to want you around our daughter.” I agreed with this response because she was being over the top. Her next message to me was “to lawyer up” because my husband just threatened to take my daughter away from her. She then called me and said CPS was on the way and the whole time at our apartment as she is taking the car and a dining table (she gave it as a gift cause she was throwing it away) she is screaming that CPS was coming and they would definitely take my daughter away from me because “just look at how you are dressed, you think you look like a fit mom?”\n\nI told this whole long story to give you guys an idea of how my mom is. She holds gifts over my head and will gladly take them away if I don’t give her what she feels I owe her.\n\nAITA for not wanting her to give Christmas gifts to my daughter?\n\nTL;DR my mom is highly manipulative and holds gifts over my head and takes them away when she isn’t happy. AITA for refusing any future gifts?",

      "description": "Before you start pointing fingers because of the title, I need to clarify some things first.\n\nI’ve been dating my boyfriend for almost two years now. From the start of our relationship, we agreed that either of us can have sex with someone else as long as we’re informed about it beforehand. We both agree that there is a distinct difference between a romantic relationship and a sexual one, and so long as we together are the only ones in a romantic relationship, we don’t care what the opposite person does with their body.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago where my boyfriend tells me “I think I cheated on you”, and when I asked why he thought that, he said “You know Jake? Yeah, so he and I had sex last week” (not his real name, obviously).\n\nI honestly thought how he worded that was really funny, and I told him I wasn’t mad as long as he told me beforehand next time. He agreed, and we’re completely fine.\n\nToday, I went to my coworker ‘Nikki’ to tell her about the funny encounter (we tell each other a lot of things like this, so it’s not exactly weird). She was confused until I reminded her that we’re in an open relationship, and then agreed that it was pretty amusing.\n\nMy assistant manager, who we’ll call ‘Anna’, was not so amused after overhearing this conversation. She told me to break up with my boyfriend, and when I said that it was okay and explained the open relationship, she told me that he was an asshole for cheating and that I was an asshole for thinking that it was funny.\n\nObviously, I know I’m not an asshole for finding the encounter humorous, but I’m starting to feel like an asshole for bringing it up in the first place. I feel so bad for making anyone think that my boyfriend was a bad person.\n\n\nTl;dr Am I the asshole for painting my boyfriend out as a cheater to my coworker, and should I have kept it to myself?",

      "description": "Ok, so let me explain. I'm (20M) working as an apprentice in what I think is a high pressure environment and am able to take annual leave etc. Recently I've been working more than my 37+ hour week (not forced) and have just been feeling very burnt out. It happens. The past couple days I have been messaging my boss asking to take leave that day, apologising for the short notice. My boss has been fine with it.\n\nHere's the problem; I'm still living at home with my mum and brothers, and my mum comes in and asks \"are you not going to work again?\" to which I reply \"no, I didn't sleep properly and just feel burnt out\". She then proceeds to mention how she doesn't sleep but she still goes to work because \"she has to\". I turn around and fire back \" I'm not calling in sick, I'm taking my permitted leave. Are you saying I'm not allowed to take leave?\". She then leaves the room.\n\nHere's where the problem gets more complicated. Things at home mean that my dad's out of the picture and my mum works and looks after my younger brothers. I pay rent and help out when I'm around, and it's safe to say she is busy. I then feel like because I am off that I can't relax because she \"is\" working and doing stuff. It seems stupid I know but ultimately I don't want my mum to struggle and will help if she needs it. We've had these arguments before where she says that she still works when she doesn't feel like it etc. and she gets very annoyed when I take leave. But my leave is for me to do what I want with right? Just because I'm using my leave to sit around and relax my brain and body, doesn't mean I then need to help out more?\n\nShort story: Im taking leave (holiday) from work because I'm burnt out. My mum has a poke at me taking leave because I want to relax when she continues to do her work. I feel like this almost guilt trips me into not being able to relax so I get mad at her. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not appreciating my husband enough?",
      "description": "I am 30, my husband is 34. We have our first baby. I've been now on maternity leave for more than six months (which is standard in my country) and I work 10 hours/week from home, my husband works full-time.\n\nOur baby is not sleeping through the night yet - he is waking up every 60-90 minutes for feeding. We are bottle-feeding him.\n\nI am quite frustrated by the fact that it's always me bottle-feeding him at night &amp; I'm always the one who gets up with him in the morning. \n\nI understand that I'm the one getting less sleep when my husband goes to work. We have a guest room and my husband occasionally sleeps there to get enough sleep. We both work in IT and he has always needed more sleep to be able to work than I did.  But it's the same during the weekends and it was the same even when we went for 2-week holidays - my husband refused to feed our baby at night at all &amp; he only got up with him once and bragged the whole day about how tired he is.\n\nI'm also a bit frustrated by the fact that during the weekends or evening when we are both at home, I'm still the one who is doing most work with the baby and around the house - it seems to me that it never happens that I relax, while my husband is taking care of the house or of the baby. The opposite (I'm doing stuff and he is relaxing) is happening all the time. \n\nWe talked about that I feel he is not thanking me enough for being sleep-deprived and letting him relax. E.g. he almost never thanks me in the morning when he sleeps in the guest room. We also talked about the fact that he feels I'm not appreciating him enough for working full-time and providing for the family &amp; I don't thank him enough when he helps me with the kid. He complained that I often say that his help is not much compared with what I'm doing. I must say that he has a point in this, but it comes from my frustrations described above.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, I was sick and had a bad cough. Everytime I coughed, our baby woke up and started to cry. My husband agreed that I can sleep in the guest room. First time since our baby was at home, I slept for 9 hours straight.\n\nI thanked my husband in the morning. He told me it was very difficult for him. In the evening I approached and I told him \"Thank you so much for taking care of our boy during the night.\" He seemed very happy that I thanked him. After that I told \"Now you can appreciate more what I do every night\". He looked at me as if I hurt him badly. He told me he though I'm finally thanking him and appreciating him, but I just talked about the fact how good I am.\n\nHe said it will be difficult for him to overcome how I hurt him.\n\n3 weeks later, and yesterday he told me he still can't believe me I'm being honest when I thank him for something, and that what I said 3 weeks ago hurt him very much.\n\nTL;DR: Husband never takes care of the baby during the night or in the morning. When he did for the first time when I was sick, I thanked him and said \"Now you can appreciate more what I do every night\".",

      "description": "I've been with my girlfriend for three years, living together with her for two. We're currently maintaining a great relationship and I am probably going to marry this woman. But there's one thing that bothers me, and that's the fact that she really doesn't like it (gets upset) when I play video games. \n\nWe have alternating and crazy schedules so she usually opens and I work in the afternoon or close if I'm not at class. I generally try to schedule my game time around her schedule while she is either at work or asleep so that it doesn't bother her, and so I also get to hang out with her while she is awake. And when I say game time, it's not like 40 hours a week of gaming. I average 3-4 hours on nights that I get to play, which is generally every other night and excluding weekends. I explicitly reserve weekends for us to be together. So like, 10-12 hours a week. Some crazy nights I will pull a 7 hour night from 8pm-3am, but that is very rare. \n\nPersonally, I need my space to wind down. I work pretty much full time and I'm also a full time college student. I also try to go to the gym 4-5 times a week. I don't feel like in a serious relationship living together that you need to spend every second of down time with your SO, but that is just my opinion. \n\nI think what upsets her is that she really doesnt have any friends to hang out with or hobbies, so when I'm not home she's generally just watching Netflix, tidying up, or napping. I've invited her to learn how to play video games with me and even slapped together my old build so that she could try it out, but she hasn't even given it a shot.\n\nBut even though I try to not do my gaming when she is at home/awake, she still gets upset. She feels like I am just waiting for her to go to bed now so that I can play video games, which isn't the case. If I were to be gaming when she came home from work and something trivial wasn't done (a few dishes in the sink, laundry not put away, etc.) she would get upset that I chose to play video games instead of completing those tasks. That's fair, but on the flipside of that, I regularly come home to tasks not being completed while she is watching Netflix. I sort of feel like there are double standards that only really come out when it has to do with me gaming.\n\nSo the golden question, am I the asshole for wanting some alone time to play video games with friends? I don't feel like my gaming is getting in the way of our relationship. Personally I think that right now she is upset that we don't get to see each other as much as she wants to because of our wacky schedules, and is using video games as the reason for it. But if I am in the wrong here, I would definitely like to know about it so I can change.",

      "description": "So first off, I'm using the word ex, but we never defined a relationship. It started out as friend with benefits and then the lines kind of blurred but we never took the next step. We had an amazing run in the beginning, but in the end there was a lot friction, hurt feelings, I noticed my personality changing in a way I didn't like at all (e.g. I started snapping at minor things while compromising on things that I shouldn't have) and when I couldn't take it anymore I told him we shouldn't see eachother anymore. I later reached out again to tell him that once our emotions have cooled down, I was open to try and work things out, to see if we could get our friendship back at least (I'm aware of how naive that sounds, but we honestly used to be great together and I wasn't ready to completely give up on that at that point in time). \nThat was about ten months ago. A couple weeks back he messaged me and we caught up on eachother's lives a bit. I gave him about a week of just chit chat to get accustomed to eachother again and things actually went pretty good until I told him that I'd like to actually talk about what went wrong last time, because I don't see this going anywhere unless we learn from our mistakes back then. He pretty much immediately shot me down, telling me that he's happy that I'm doing well but messaging me was a mistake and we shouldn't continue.\nTo get to the point of this AITA: he works at a really cool place that I never went to during the past ten months, out  of respect for his 'territory'. However during the time after he contacted me again, when we were exchanging pleasant chit chat, I made plans to got to an event there with some friends and last night we went there and had a great time. I didn't expect to actually see much of him, he doesn't work in the service area but more behind the scenes, but we did come across eachother a couple of time during which he either ignored me or honestly didn't notice me (I doubt that though, not noticing four people that you know just a couple of feet away from you seems a bit implausible to me). So if I judge the situation correctly, my presence did make him uncomfortable. And even after all that happened between us, part of me really wouldn't like him to come into work every day dreading to be confronted with memories and feelings he'd rather not deal with (by seeing me, I'm not planning any kind of active confrontations). Another part of me thinks that he needs to get his head out of his ass and actually deal with his issues. Regardless, I would really like to go to more events at that location, simply because it's honestly that amazing and unique.\n\nAITA if I decide to hang out at my ex's workplace more often?",

      "description": "Obligatory apologies for formatting, I am on mobile. \n\nSo this decision happened only minutes ago, but first a little back story. When I decided to switch universities last year and move back in with my parents I was giving up a very well paying, stable job as an au pair/tutor. I hadn’t lived at home for about 4 years and in that time my mother and father made the decision to start fostering a 13 year old I will call Alice. I love Alice, I never had a girly kinda sister around since I had a very manly lesbian sister and my twin brother. She’s hard working, sweet and caring, and none of this is directed towards her. \nTo make up for me not having a stable income anymore my parents decided to hire me as an au pair to Alice. \nMy hours are essentially 07:00-07:30 Monday till Friday, 14:00-16:00 Monday till Thursday and 14:00-20:00 on a Friday (She has choir in a town 40 minutes away and we get home late every Friday). This in between studying full time, and working another side job. \nThey pay me R3400 a month (about $244) which is supposed to include my fuel. I drive about 22km (about 14 miles) every day dropping and fetching her from school. Au Pairs in my country generally charge R50-75 an hour ($3.50-7.50) and R3/km ($0.20). \n\nNow that all of that is over let me start from about 15 minutes ago when I told my parents that I wanted to stay at my boyfriends house this weekend, starting on Thursday as I currently have off from school and he is house sitting this entire weekend, so he has no way of visiting me. My mother freaked saying that who would look after Alice on Friday, as she is also on break and therefor doesn’t have school on Friday either. I stood there flabbergasted as my mom berated me about how if I was her client back in the old town I would not treat her like this and that I should look after Alice this Friday. I walked out of the room absolutely furious that she would speak to me like that. If she wanted me to look after Alice she could have asked nicely and I would have said yes and gone through to my boyfriend Friday afternoon instead. \n\nShe brought in business a o I decided to handle this as cleanly and business-like as possible. After some serious calculations I figured out that my parents were not only underpaying me (R35 an hour/$2.50) but also grossly misusing me. So I’ve decided to propose I charge them what they should be paying me, including overtime for looking after my sister this entire week. Since I only work from 14:00, that would include an extra 6 hours of work everyday that they need to pay me for, and I would discuss a new monthly rate that I should be rightfully paid. I am separating business from family and if they want to look for a cheaper option they can try but they will not find it, as I would be charging them the bottom rate for an au pair here. \n\nSo my question is, AITA for doing this to my parents? \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So a long time ago this girl, Haley, slid into my Instagram DMs and told me we should hang out. I saw some red flags when I met her, but decided to ignore them. (She was constantly making up extravagant stories of her past and was really rude to her parents that she still lived with.) I was at a really vulnerable part in my life and decided to stay her friend because she was an escape from my shitty life. \n\nAnyways, I introduce her to my friends since she was new to the area. After Haley got close to them she turned them all on me. She constantly fed them lies until they didn’t like me anymore.\n\nI cut Haley out of my life immediately and figured it was good that she helped me figure out who my fake friends were. She showed up at my house unannounced a couple times begging me to be her friend again but I always had my sister answer the door because I thought I’d punch her if I answered. \n\nI was a lonely mess after all of this, convinced that everyone hated me. Haley really hurt me. I did some soul searching that year while I was alone. I realized I was so full of hate towards her that it was only bringing me down and I needed to forgive her for my own mental health. \n\nI messaged her saying that there was no hard feelings and I hoped she was doing okay. She insisted that we hang out and told me she did some soul searching too and she changed. Me being lonely, I said yes. \n\nWhen I met Haley’s boyfriend, Zack,  I realized I already knew him from middle school. Zack and I got along really well, better than Haley and I did and we became closer friends. He constantly confided in me that he wanted to break up with Haley every day. And Haley told me the same thing about Zack. They had a seriously fucked up relationship where they were constantly screaming at each other. \n\nAnyways they had an extra ticket to this music festival and begged me to go. Haley told me that she didn’t wanna go alone with Zack cause she’d be annoyed the whole time and Zack told me the same thing about Haley.  I figured a free ticket is a free ticket and I went. \n\nAfter the concert we were all really drunk. We went back to the hotel room and Haley insisted that we have a threesome. We were all down and went for it. Although Zack was really hot, I wasn’t that into Haley so I was really uncomfortable then Haley got uncomfortable too because her boyfriend was kinda just fucking me in front of her. She told him to stop, they starting having sex again, I felt weird and left the hotel room. \n\nZack came and found me after about 30 minutes and we walked to the parking garage. Anyways we had sex. \n\nI feel like Haley deserved what she got and I wouldn’t have had sex with Zack if they didn’t insist on having a threesome in the first place. I never planned on having sex with Zack before that moment. \n\nZack and I decided to keep that night a secret. After a week I felt guilty and told Haley. She didn’t believe me, stole my vape I left at her house and a bunch of my clothes. \n\nIt’s a year later and I still get texts from people telling me that Haley said I had sex with their boyfriend even though I didn’t. People from my home town think I have sex with anyone I meet and that I have STDs because of the rumors she’s made up about me. \n\nSo am I the asshole for having sex with Zack? ",

      "description": "Just over a year ago my sister broke up with her boyfriend and moved her and her son to an apartment. During the move, her only tv got some damage to it so I offered to give her mine because I was planning on getting a bigger one soon anyway. We swapped so I could put her broken one (crack in the screen but still works) in my basement for yoga videos. \n\nThen about 6 months ago she got back together with her boyfriend and thus uses his large screen tv in their living room and they have other TVs in each bedroom (I think mine is in my nephews room). \n\nNow my husband would like our tv back simply because it’s ours and she doesn’t need it anymore being she has multiple TVs in her home. Also I’m pregnant and kind of would like to put my tv in my bedroom to watch while I’m resting with baby, etc. \n\nWill I be an asshole to take back something given to a person when they were in need, but are not really in need now?

      "description": "**The backstory.**\n\nI am dealing with an ex-wife of 10 years who has a history of mental illness/issues. I have also proven on several occasions that she has lied on a variety of things. She will say that her car has broken down so she can't take our child to school, only for it to work so she can go to a job interview later that day (with my child). She has told me that one of our friends was in a car accident and that I needed to watch our child so that she could visit her; only to see that friend post on Facebook 30 minutes later. She has told the government that I left both her and my child (it was a mutual separation) so that she would be bumped up on the list to get government assistance. She has also admitted to lying about some serious allegations about other ex-husbands because she was mad at them. So overall, everything she says I have to take with a grain of salt.\n\nNow, roughly a few weeks ago, I suggested keeping him on some of her days until she gets her life a bit more adjusted. This would have reduced her from 14 days to 6 days a month (every other weekend). Her response was to threaten to take me to court. She wasn't going to let me boss her around anymore and she will ensure that she has a relationship with her kid (which implied I was trying to prevent that). I actually 100% want them to have a relationship, which is why I follow the visitation schedule rigorously.\n\nOn top of that, I am engaged to someone who really doesn't like her continuous involvement in our lives. We are completely independent from my ex and almost never rely on her for any assistance; yet every month or so we are approached to accommodate her for whatever reason that I'm never sure is true. In a lot of cases, we end up accommodating; but I am trying to stop that because it's very fair to say that my ex shouldn't have so much direct involvement in our lives - especially if she is lying to us.\n\nOur visitation setup is that while I actually have primary custody, we personally have a 50/50 setup right now. When I consulted a divorce lawyer roughly two years ago, he told me that because this 50/50 setup has been the norm for years, she could take me to court, accuse me of being unfair and the judge could side with her. I have since started capturing documentation incase I ever do go back to court.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The situation**.\n\nToday I got a text from my ex saying her drinking problem is getting out of hand and she wants me to take him for a week while she attends AA to get her problem handled. He is supposed to visit her tonight and has made no reference to her drinking problems until this morning.\n\nHer text implied she has not started it yet, despite having all week to do so. She has had the past three days and will have the next three days free to attend. I also believe AA is not a one-week-and-done situation and is an ongoing process, meaning she will need to schedule her meetings on nights where she does not have our child, anyways.\n\nHer family has expressed to me that they do think she has a drinking problem, but because of her history of lying, I'm not convinced that today's claim is legit and is actually being used as a reason to get out of parenting tonight.\n\nTo add to this, my fiance's father is an alcoholic. So if this turns out to be a false claim, that is *really* going to rub her the wrong way. All things considered, I've found it best to err on the side of being skeptical.\n\nSo, hopefully I've been able to articulate that this is a complex situation. I don't want to dismiss a potential serious claim; but I also don't want to enable more lying using serious claims like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Will I be the asshole?**\n\nI am planning on telling her that this is a serious issue that will take longer than a week. Therefore, I suggest she keep seeing him and maintaining their relationship while visiting AA on her off-nights and keeping her drinking in-check on her nights with my child. Otherwise, I will be willing to go back to my proposed visitation schedule from a few weeks ago from here on out and not just for a few weeks. ",

      "title": "AITA for being angry at my flatmate's girlfriend?",
      "description": "I'm a student and I live with 5 others in my flat, one of which being the guy in question. He is seeing a girl and she often comes down to stay with him. No problem with that in itself.\n\nMy flatmate is a great friend of mine - we spend a lot of time together, cook together, share shopping, etc, and I love this arrangement and I know he does either. \n\nThe issue is that this girl has been staying for an increasingly ridiculous amount of time. The first couple of times she has stayed for reasonable amounts of time that I have no issue with, such as long weekends. However, the last couple of times she came down she stayed for 5 days, which though I wasn't too happy about I let slide as it wasn't too different to her usual 3 or 4, but the next time she stayed for a total of 10 days/9 nights. \n\nI was livid, and ended up feeling forced out of my own flat for the majority of that time. Most of the reason I was pissed off was that she was eating my food, drinking my drink etc, without offering a penny towards me, or even a simple thanks! Personally I would offer money or at least bring a bottle of wine as a thank you, at the very least say thanks, if I was even staying at someones for the night let alone the next 10 days.\n\nIt doesn't help that we don't really get on either; she is jealous of the relationship that my flatmate and I have, and even though there is nothing romantic about it at all, she seems to try her best to keep us apart the whole time she is at our flat. I wouldn't say I was jealous of her but her presence does irk me; I'm a creature of habit and her being there fully disrupts my meal routine as my flatmate and I can't cook for each other as normal. However, I stress that this last point wouldn't bother me if she wasn't so rude to me in my own home. \n\nAnyway, he didn't tell me about her coming until the day before she did, when I told him that she wasn't welcome for that long in our flat, especially not without asking me or any of my other flatmates about it. An extra person in our already small flat was a lot to handle, and it meant that we had to have predrinks in our bedrooms/eat in our bedrooms as we didn't feel comfortable being a 3rd party to them. He basically told me it was none of my business.\n\nProblem is, I couldn't just let it go - I'm a student so I'm not exactly wealthy, I certainly didn't want to fund somebody else. My flatmate promised me we'd work out something regarding money for the food she'd eaten. \n\nAfter the 10 days elapsed, it transpired neither of them were planning on giving me any money. He said they'd done the groceries, but they had only bought at most around 10 pounds worth of veg, most of which they'd eaten. He told me this was fair and couldn't do any more as he was low on cash. My argument is if neither of them could afford the extra money, she shouldn't have come for 10 days.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "OK, so my partner and I moved to a nice little street last Summer and we have decent enough neighbours. However, our tiny little back garden has become a dumping ground for the kids footballs and toys (as well as rubbish). Initially it was one football that would get blown into the back and it'd sit there until the kids came back to get it. This wasn't an issue for us at first.\n\nOver time though, we have ended up with a collection of 6 footballs in our back. I've spoken to the parents about it because I've walked out of my back door a few times and fell over a ball. Right in front of my back door is a 5 foot brick wall and I almost cracked my head against it one night from tripping on a ball. Again, this has been brought up with the parents and the response is generally the same: \"kids, eh?\". \n\nOn top of the kids toys, I'm also removing other peoples rubbish from our back each day, as well as cigarette ends too. We can't do much out the back because our neighbours like to hang stuff over our fence and I've seen my neighbour shoving our property away from the fence so she can hang things on it (brushes, mops, mop buckets, towels etc).\n\nOur garden has become a dumping ground and I'm wondering if I would be an asshole for throwing the balls away. Every time I've thrown them out of the garden, they end up right where they were. \n\nSo, would I be an asshole for throwing the balls away? ",

      "description": "Throwaway account btw. \n\nI'm in university where I met my current bf who I've been with for 5 months who I'll refer to as Ben. Before uni I dated another guy for about 7 months who I'll call Jay, we broke up because he was always travelling and it was hard to maintain long distance so it was better to be friends. \n\nLately I've been going through a lot of personal stuff; I've battled with anxiety since I was young and its been really kicking into high gear lately, my family is planning a big move that will either result in an excruciating commute to school or me having to live on campus or find a roommate, I just lost a friend of 7 years due to a major falling out and I don't really have anyone else besides my current bf and my ex. \n\nMy bf Ben has a really intense major and works on the weekends. He's usually the first person that I go to when I need to vent or talk things through, but he's super busy with work and studying so I don't want to bother him. Especially right now because we have midterm exams. My ex Jay is really busy as well, he works in music and is constantly travelling. We don't even see each other as exes, we really just see each other as long time friends. I usually only confide in him if Ben is busy and can't reply for a while.  \n\nLately Ben has been more distant than usual, because of exams and studying or whatnot. He cancelled our scheduled datenight to study and doesn't text as much except to hear about my day and say goodnight (which I'm not angry about, I understand he has to study and he still makes sure to talk to me at least a little every night). I needed to talk about some stuff, just a mini rant to get things off my chest. I didn't want to bother Ben while he was studying, so I texted Jay instead. I ranted to him and I felt better. Later during our usual \"how was your day\" convo, I told Ben that I was having a rough day but I felt better after talking to Jay. This made him upset, and he said I could've come to him if I was upset, and I should've before talking to Jay. I said I didn't want to interrupt his studying and said I would go to him first next time. We didn't get into a huge argument about it, he's a really chill guy and we just carried on with our convo for a little bit before he went to bed. \n\nThe way I see it is both of them are super busy, but Ben doesn't reply until the evening and Jay replies almost instantly, and I don't want to be stewing over something all day when I can get it off my chest that moment. They're also different in how they react: Jay asks questions and gives advice, while Ben just says \"that sucks, just go relax.\" I usually always text Ben first and only text Jay if I don't get a reply, but this time I just skipped the middleman. The only reason was really because I didn't want to bother Ben and I knew I would get actual responses from Jay instead of \"sleep it off.\" \n\nAITA for confiding in my ex before my boyfriend?",

      "description": "\nI’m 33, married with two kids. My mom is in a good place, about to retire. Sometimes she likes to invite us out to eat and always says “if you’re invited, you’re not paying.” My family doesn’t really go out, except maybe ordering pizzas once a week. So eating out isn’t really in our budget. Other things, like special crafts or classes that my mom wants to do, she will pay for. My husband and I combined have a decent income; enough to keep ahead of the bills, but we have no savings, student loan debt, and well, kids. My mom struggled financially when she was a young mom and has told me and my husband that as we were in the same place for the first few years of parenthood.\nSo this is why Im asking... I have a younger sister who has a very lucrative career and a husband in the same field, no kids. She insists on saying aloud every tome we all get together that my mom shouldn’t be paying for anything. They will grab the ticket from the table and pay their meals. This puts us in an awkward position. Sometimes it’s literally the question of: do we look like an asshole and be the only offspring to not pay our meal, do we charge it to the credit card, or do we overdraft our banking account?\nor like just today, my mom texted us asking if we wanted to do some candy making craft. I would never go make candy on any occasion except that it’s my moms birthday and she wants us to al be together and make candy. But this sister already texted and said she will only go if my mom agrees to not pay for anyone else.\nAITA for not freaking out about reimbursing my mom for special things she does for me that she has expressed she does not expect payment for? Until just recently my husband and I were over drafting every month just to keep our kids fed and bills paid. We sold our first house and have created a bit of a buffer for the first time in ten years. So we do try to surprise my mom and her husband by bringing them little gifts or cooking for them or whatever. But I can’t afford to keep up with my mom and my sisters. What do you guys think?\n",

      "description": "Let me start this off by explaining why I am the way I am, and why my mother is the way she is. My entire family is very dysfunctional, essentially we're \"triple traumatized\".  My mother was raised by a Holocaust survivor, was verbally/emotionally abused by one of her husbands, and had to deal with my abused. I myself was verbally/emotionally abused as well, and sexually abused at school. That screwed my mom up as well as myself. Given the constant fighting and screaming I had to deal with growing up, I just detached myself. I do not have the same attachments to family that most people do. My primary focus in life is academic/career success: nothing comes before that, including family. I understand why she is the way she is, but I just don't care anymore.\n\nMy mother is neurotically overprotective. I'm a senior in college, and she has shown she doesn't see me as anything more than a child. Every winter, she has a mental breakdown. She thinks I'm going to die when it gets remotely cold out. I shit you not, she invoked the memory of the *holocaust* when I didn't wear a hat going out one time. \n\nAnother thing she does is send me little \"reminders\" over text very frequently. She reminds me of basic stuff that a senior in college, or anyone of my age, should know how to do. Sleeping, washing your face, etc. *I know to do all of these things*. I am not inept. I'm finishing undergrad early entirely out of my own drive.  I've told her time and time again that when she does this, it's belittling and demeaning. She fakes an apology, but then she turns right around and does it again the second she gets worried. These are just two examples.\n\nI've lost my temper at her before. I don't like it when I do that, and I'm working on it in therapy. But I feel like she just never listens to me. No matter what I say, or the manner I say it in, anything I say to her just goes in one ear and out the other. I love my mother, and I'm grateful for everything she's done for me. But I'm just so tired of it. I'm tired of being belittled. If it takes cutting her out of my life to get her to stop, I have no problems with doing so the moment I'm financially able to. ",

I tried telling him how he needs to be brave to get over his fear of asking this girl out. But he wouldn't have any of it and told me to please stop talking about it. I did but he didn't talk to me for the rest of the period. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? I really want to see Tim get over his fears and go for this girl.

      "description": "A bit of background on me: I’m a competitive powerlifter. I total 1300+ @ 163 lbs (only mentioned for credibility; if you know much about powerlifting, it’s a pretty solid total, 420+ wilks. I’m not just some fat dude who calls himself a “powerlifter” to justify my eating habits). \n\nI have to eat. A lot. Right now I’m bulking and with my daily activity, I need a total of 3800+ calories a day. That’s a fuck ton of food. \n\nAs such, I admittedly eat unhealthy. Desserts many times a day, soda (easy 200 palatable calories), a bunch of snacks. Unhealthy foods are much more easy to eat a lot of versus healthier foods. I do get in 200+ grams of protein, but to gain muscle and to gain strength, the only thing that matters is your protein and calories. \n\nMy girlfriend comes from a good place, but she consistently nags me about my diet. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not afraid of a vegetable and fruit are delicious; she’s just concerned with the amount of sugar/fat I’m eating. But as mentioned earlier, 3800 is a LOT of food. I can barely tolerate eating that much with my current diet; I physically can not scarf down 3800 of “healthy” calories. I can eat much better when I’m cutting/losing weight, but that’s probably 1/3-1/4 of the time. She wants me to me to limit my sugar intake to 1 sweet a day, max. Which, again, sounds reasonable. But it is completely counterintuitive to my current fitness goals. \n\nAnd it’s not about weight. My body is great; when I tell people I compete, people assume i compete in bodybuilding. It’s genuinely about the fact that she doesn’t like me eating unhealthy. Keep in mind; I’ve been dating her for a year and I’ve competed for around 1.5. So this isn’t anything new. When we first started dating, she thought my “cheat days” were always just planned on dates because I look fit, so she assumed I had a much healthier diet than I did. \n\nAITA for telling her I refuse to compromise?",

Or if she goes to bed she’ll leave the TV on, lights on and fans on. And this isn’t just a one off, I’ve had to have this conversation with her on 6 occasions and those are the occasions where half the houses lights have been left on and she’s been gone for 6 or 7 hours.\n\nI know it hasn’t been my partner because he works a lot of the time, and this only started when she moved in. \n\nIt’s gotten to the point that if I know she’s going out I’ll ask her to make sure she turns everything off that needs to be turned off, or if we’re leaving to go to the same place I’ll check it. I don’t feel like I should need to check this.\n\nBut since we’re so strapped for money at the moment and we have been trying to conserve our electricity, water and gas I told her that if this continues her rent will need to increase to cover these costs. \n\nIt’s also stuff like putting a pair of socks in the washing machine and turning it on, or a shirt and turning it on, and those items are the only load. This has happened on a number of occasions, and she only uses the dryer never the clothes line which takes a lot of power. And we have beautiful sunny (sometimes a little hot) days.\n\nOr the dishwasher will have a plate and cutlery in it and she’ll turn it on. \n\nTl;dr my housemate uses excessive amounts of electricity and water even though I’ve asked her to conserve it and remember if she’s going out to turn things off, so I told her her rent will need to increase to cover this if it continues.

      "description": "One of my coworkers (F27) (I'll call her Sina) is quite shy or at least quiet and never complains, but she does her work well. Unfortunately another coworker (Monika) (F34) took advantage of that and often gives her part of his workload to do as well (and tells her to give it back to her to commit), which causes Sina to fall behind with her own work. Also, Sina does her work better, so Monika benefits from that as well, and when Monika does a shit job, she'll drop the task on Sina last minute and then lets her commit the faulty task. \n\nNow, I'd usually try to stay out of this (or at least wait until I have a good way to prove it to the boss, since I can't just record it in office), but here is the thing: From the looks of it, Monika is bound to get promoted once my boss retires (partly because of the work that Sina did for her). Unfortunately for me (or for her in the end), she's a very bigoted person that always talks shit about men in the company workforce, saying we are lazy and do a shit job, and that there should be more women anyways (I don't disagree with the last part though). At the same time she is the one who steals someone elses work and time... If she were to become boss, it could be quite problematic since I'm trying to get promoted to a different position where I need the votes of at least 3 company bosses (position my current boss holds). And of course I don't want a stupid lazy bitch to become my boss. Meanwhile I'm on good terms with Sina and I expect her to be more professional in said position.\n\nWhen Sina went on holiday for a week, Monika fell behind in her work, but intentionally didn't commit anything, probably wanting to let Sina do it to avoid negative feedback again... When she came back from holiday I talked to Sina and changed a setting so that work sent to Monika from her account would still be flagged as hers after committing. I also logged into Monikas account (I have a habit of watching people enter passwords, I think I know those of all coworkers by now), and commited all the work Monika had marked as completed but not yet commited (the stuff she usually lets Sina commit). \n\nThis didn't go unnoticed by the boss, and he angrily came asking why so much of Monika's tasks where flagged as Sinas and if that was the reason why Sina was always late with hers. It didn't end well for Monika (partly because of me and another coworker who said that we often saw Monika carry documents over to Sina) and she got a warning from the boss that she could forget a promotion and might lose her job if she does it again. Sina on the other hand got a raise.\n\nTL;DR: A coworker was being a bitch and pushing her mistakes on someone else. I exposed her in a sneaky way and made sure she'll not become my boss to avoid future trouble with her.\n\nAITA for doing this?",

      "description": " \n\nHey Reddit first time poster! But this is something that has been on my recently.. So Reddit.. Would I be the asshole for suggesting to my friend to stop being friends with his ex? So here are the key players, (Not their real names!)\n\nDerrick = My friend\n\nKaren = My friends ex\n\nHellen= Me and Derrick's friend (Very bad at supporting, or comforting people IMPORTANT LATER)\n\nMaddie = Karen's friend\n\nMe = ~~A magical wizard from the future~~ Me!\n\n**The relationship:**\n\nNow it started off great! They really both cared for each other. Then, she started to ignore him in every other class but lunch. Okay weird but... Then the event happened, It was a normal Friday I gotten home and started playing video games, then Derrick called the group chat crying, Karen had messaged him that she wanted to break up, since she liked Maddie (Maddie was a jerk too Derrick mind you,) My friend Hellen, couldn't handle this so she left the call, leaving me to comfort him. Derrick is a nice kid, he kept saying it wasn't Karen's fault for breaking up with him, that it was his!\n\nNow present day Derrick still kinda of has a crush on her. She caused him problems. But, funny thing is, this wasn't caused by the breakup. This happened months after it. But he continued to be friends with her, which, I am guessing may have caused this. Why? Because relationships with your ex can be terrible! He still has a crush on her, since he has every class with her and sits right next to her. Imagine seeing someone you were so close to having a relationship with dating someone else, or just being stuck in a friend zone with someone you love..\n\nSo Reddit WIBTA for suggesting my friend that it might be better for him to stop being friends with his ex? I might just be acting over protective, but I just want him to be happy!",

      "title": "AITA for having a girl stay over with me in a room I rented from a friend?",
      "description": "Sorry for the long post; it's complicated. \n\nI've been friend's with C for many years. I ran into some difficult times in a housing situation, and C and his girlfriend K offered to rent me a room. C had been dating K for about a year, and I was good friends with K as well. I was weary about cohabitating with friends, but they practically begged me to do it. We set some ground rules, rent cost etc, and one rule being that they were 100% ok with me having  girls over or whatever, (tenant/landlord law in the state forbids landlords from preventing a tenant from having guests anyway.) \n\nFast forward a few months, I had to have knee surgery which put me off of work for 14 weeks. In this time I needed an incredible amount of help getting around ( I couldn't drive either) and the girl I was seeing was amazing at helping me. She would stay over on days when I had early morning doctor of PT appointments and help me whenever she could.\n The problem was, K did not like this girl. K is the kind of friend who thinks she knows what's best for you, so even though she had no discernable reason to hate her, she just did. One week this girl had to stay over about 4 nights in a row, to help me getting to appointments and we were also working on a large charity project for a children's hospital ( this was around the holidays)\nI should note that this girl didn't shower here, we didn't cook or eat their food, drink their drinks or hang out in common areas. I/We literally stayed in the room I rented the entire time. \nAbout a week later I get this text from K:\n\n\"Hey, I don't have a lot of friends, but the ones I do have, I value a lot in my life. Part of the reason I probably don t have a lot of friends is because I don't like to bullshit or be fake. If there's something bothering me, I like to talk about it and resolve it. I know you've told me you've had bad experiences with roommates and I have too, trust me, but I really did mean it when I said that we will never have an issue, because we are all good friends. \nI'm going to be upfront because I don't expect anything less from you. Get your dick wet...i love sex and I don't feel like you should be deprived. But can (girl) just come less? She's there every single day, and we didn't really sign up for 2 roommates. My sisters will be here from dec 23rd till January 11th, and unfortunately we only have two bathrooms, so could she also please not come when they are here? \"\n\nI responded \"ok\" but I was actually hurt a lot by this. \nLike.. being accused of trying to move this girl in, when she had no property here and didn't cost them anything was insulting. Also they know I can't walk or drive around due to my surgery, yet assume she's just staying over for sex. Not to mention I felt like if I rent a room somewhere, I should be able to sleep with whoever I want in that room. \nI couldn't argue the point because they're the ones helping me out with housing, and I didn't want to put my friend C in the middle of this, but I felt like this was only said because K hated this girl. I started looking for a new place to stay immediately but it took 6 weeks. In this 6 weeks neither K nor C, or her visiting sisters would even acknowledge my existence. No one would talk to me or even make eye contact with me. Not to mention my birthday was during the time her sisters were over which made it incredibly lonely sitting in my room like a ghost in the attic. \nI moved out and haven't spoken to K at all since. C contacted me later asking me to apologize to K for \"getting weird and ignoring her\" after she sent that text. The thing is, I couldn't do it. I didn't want to be her friend anymore. Unfortunately it also cost me my friendship with C. \nTLDR: I rented a room with my friend and his girlfriend. They agreed before hand they're cool with me having girls over. Had a girl over too often due to needing help with injury/Charity work. Friend's girlfriend hated this girl asked me to not have her come over so often/ anymore. I felt like if I rent a room, I should be able to sleep with whoever I want in that room. Both friendships with friend and his girlfriend are destroyed. AITA? ",

      "title": "AITA for losing interest in this girl over too much affection?",
      "description": "Wondering if I'm being an asshole right now, even though I don't mean to be. \n\nI have been seeing this girl for a few weeks. She is amazing - intelligent, hilarious, and she's a great listener and conversationalist. For the first week, I was head over heels. \n\nWe've been spending a lot of time together. I'm an introvert and prefer one-on-one hangouts, but she texts me all day, every day, saying misses me or asking to hang out. Another problem is our budding relationship is almost.. overly physically intimate. I  know that that sounds like an absolutely crazy thing to complain about, but I can't get her to sit still for 5 minutes without kissing my neck or trying to get me to making out with her. That is not an exaggeration. Sometimes I just want to chill and enjoy her company and conversation. It's overwhelming.\n\nI'm not some hot model someone should be falling head over heels for. I'm not even a *super* sexual person... I enjoy sex, but have had abusive relationships in the past that make a lot of physical contact a bit stressful. It takes me time to feel comfortable with someone.\n\nThe most confusing part is that I've tried to tell her this. She told me she wanted me to always tell her whenever I was uncomfortable or needed space. Each time I've said so, she looks extremely hurt. If I told her every time I was uncomfortable/needed space, I'd be hurting her feelings all the time. Every other sentence she says is something about how much she likes me, or how handsome I am, or how obsessed she is with me. (She is a successful adult person, haha. She isn't sitting at home staring at a picture of me.)\n\nI don't want to hurt her feelings. Who asks someone else to kiss them and compliment them less? I'd be crushed if someone said that to me, but I really can't explain just how much of it is happening, and how uncomfortable it makes me. I'm not good at attention.\n\nThe last part makes me feel especially asshole-ish. She has an adorable dog, who is allowed into her bed. I don't automatically have a problem with that - the issue is that her bed is always *coated* in dog hair. I don't like being naked and coated in dog fur while trying to have sexytimes. On top of that, the dog (who is very big) whines if not allowed on the bed, which results in us trying to do the deed around it. I just feel weird fucking her with my thigh pressed up against her dog's ass. How am I supposed to say that without sounding like an asshole? She loves her dog more than life itself. How do I ask her to wash her sheets without sounding like a dick? Do I buy her a lint-roller? (Kidding.)\n\nTLDR: Amazing girl is super, *super* into me. Like, intensely so. Can't go five minutes without trying to make out with me. How do I ask her to back off without hurting her feelings? She asked me to be open but gets really sad whenever I do so. I was super into her but am getting overwhelmed. I don't want to sleep in dog hair. Might be shallow.",

      "description": "It sounds stupid and mean, but bear with me here. My dad is an extremely controlling person, whether it’s something big or something super little and pointless. This is something the entirety of my family agrees on, with the exception of my dad of course. One of those little pointless things he’s decided to control in my life is packing my lunch for school. The main reasons I have a problem with this are because:\na) The food in his house is often far past its expiration date and I don’t feel comfortable eating stuff from there unless I’ve checked the date. I have been packed moldy food several times before\nb) The food he does pack just doesn’t taste good. I’ll force myself to eat a bite or two, but almost all of it gets thrown away. I don’t want to waste food. I’ve asked him to pack different foods, but he never does.\nc) I literally don’t have room to carry it.\n\nI’ve asked him several times to just let me pack the lunch if he wants me to take a lunch that badly, to which he always vehemently refuses and yells at me about. I’ve asked him several times to, if he wants to pack a lunch, to just ask me first so that I can make a little more room in my bag and get a word in about what food he’s having me take. He always says he’ll ask, but I always walk downstairs to him with a fully packed lunch ready for me, and I’ll ask him again to just let me know before hand. It’s a never ending cycle.\nSo this morning, I walked downstairs to see a fully packed lunch on the table. I told my dad I wouldn’t take it and explained how I had asked him time and time again to just let me know first. He got angry and started yelling about how unappreciative I am and starting dissing how my mom never packs me lunch (divorced parents) and went on about how it’s his house, so he’ll pack me lunch if he so pleases. I didn’t yell back, I just went upstairs and quietly left afterwards. Honestly, had he just asked beforehand, I would’ve taken it, but he didn’t. He’s still mad at me for not taking the lunch.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for refusing to take the lunch my dad packed for me to school?",

My S/O and I have just moved in together he moved from Florida to be with me in New England. \n\nMy S/O has not been paying his half of the 1300 dollar rent bill for 3 months stating he is unable to afford it. I’m the primary lease holder so if I’m late on rent or something I’ll get screwed over. He texted me the other day that be bought a brand new motorcycle and is having it customized. \n\nHe left some paperwork on the table and I saw the final bill is 27k and monthly payments of 300+. When he got home that day from work I completely flipped out on him. \n\nHe called me some choice names because I raised the matter that I haven’t been able to eat a proper meal in 3 months because of him not being able to rent. \n\nHe is on the lease as a roommate so it won’t affect him like it would affect me if I’m late on rent. \n\nAm I the asshole for raising hell about him buying a new bike and not paying rent while I’m going without?

      "description": "I've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.",

      "description": "OK, first of all, thanks for reading. This happened two years ago and is still on my mind sometimes. Also, English is not my first language so my apologies if I mess up.\n\nSome background info: I'm a bit of a recluse. I work from home and love love love it. But, there are times that I don't have to leave the house for a few days. Not that I don't want to, I just don't have to. As I live in an apartment building and the mailboxes are all downstairs, I don't check my mail every day. I rarely get mail anyway, everything is digital these days. I only get spam and some local newspaper. And mail addressed to the previous owners.\n\nI bought this house a few years ago, in August, and moved in in November 2012. The previous owners were somewhere in their 80s and moved to an assisted living facility about a mile away. It's on the way to the cinema and my parents.\n\nAfter I moved in I received a considerable amount of mail for them. I would collect it and when I went to the movies about twice a month I would drop it off in their mailbox at the front desk.\n\nEvery once in a while I would receive a mourning card for them. I didn't open them, I don't even think I'm allowed to, but I would jump in my car and drop it off, because I wasn't sure when the card had arrived. This happened a few times in the first few years. Sometimes it was late and I would wait until the next morning to drop it off.\n\nSo two years ago. I had been living there for 4,5 years. I received two mourning cards within a few weeks. I dropped the first one off immediately. The second one... well crap. Something went wrong. I put it in my bag to drop it off but I wasn't feeling well and got distracted. I suck. I spent the weekend on the couch like a coughing corpse and totally forgot about it. It took me three days to drop it off. And I didn't even know when the card had arrived in the first place. Shit.\n\nI dropped it off in the morning and the next day I received a letter. From the former owners of this house. They were mad as hell, because they had missed the funeral. Apparently the funeral was on the morning that I had dropped off the card. Oh shit. They asked me why I hadn't given them a call so they could have picked up the card (I don't even have their number. Luckily they didn't have my number either otherwise they would have called me. Dodged a bullet there). They were upset and condescending and calling me irresponsible and selfish.\n\nI didn't do it on purpose and it had been over 4,5 years since I moved in, why in the name of fuck do I still get your mail? What if I was on vacation or in the hospital or god knows what? But I still feel guilty, although my friends and family tell me not to, especially after their shitty letter. There was some more correspondence after this in which they acted like five year olds, but it doesn't change the fact that I was late delivering the card.",

      "description": "So I feel like an asshole, but I also feel like I didn’t have a choice. I have some anxiety and am a hypochondriac, not sure if that makes a difference in your judgement, but that’s my reasoning. \n\nI was in a grocery store shopping with my infant son. A young girl walks by with her dad and she is puking everywhere. I took my son, left my cart and just walked out of the store. I just assumed it was a stomach bug (or something worse) and I didn’t want myself or my son to get sick so in a split second decision I just grabbed him, turned around, and left. I only had a few items, but one of the items was bagels that I put in a bag that could not be returned to the bin.  \n\nI feel like I am an asshole for leaving my shit there, but I panicked, and maybe wasn’t thinking rationally. I feel like I essentially stole the bagels because I didn’t pay for them and they are un-sellable, and some store employee will have to return my 3 other items - probably after mopping up puke. I guess I’m wondering if I was in any way justified, or just a straight up asshole.  It is 30 minutes later and I am sweating and feel nauseous.  Stupid brain...",

      "description": "I'll make this one short and sweet. I live with two of my close friends. Let's just call them 1 &amp; 2. So 1 &amp; I decided to order our groceries through an app that'll have them delivered to us &amp; split the total. We asked 2 if he wanted to add anything to the cart and 2 said \"Nah I'll go to Walmart and get food I'm good.\" So 1 &amp; I left it at that. 1 &amp; I ran through the food and decided to place another order a few weeks later. Same thing happened. 1&amp; I filled up the cart with essentials, and then asked 2 if he wanted to add anything and split the total with us. 2 said \"Bro nah that place your food shopping at sucks. I'm good\" then 2 got up and walked out lol. So I get home one day and see a little bit of smeared jelly, crumbs, and an opened loaf of bread on the counter. Turns out 2 made a PB&amp;J sandwich with 1 &amp; I's bread. So I text 2 letting him know I would never turn down food from someone, ever, but if 2's going to be eating anything 1 &amp; I paid for than 2 has to pay part of the grocery bill. 2 was exclaiming \"it's only bread peanut butter and jelly why are you taking it so serious?\" &amp; I was tryna explain to 2 that it's about the principal of boundaries. You don't shit on food in any way, especially two guys food shopping who are asking you if you want to split a bill and save money and say \"Nah that place sucks\" then turn around and eat food that came from that same establishment you said sucks a day ago. I had to tell him all this plus, please don't touch the food unless you've put money towards the bill or AT LEAST ASK one of us to make a sandwich. Now he just orders dominos every night while we cook and eat the craziest meals every day. I feel like an asshole cause he won't eat meals with us anymore but he did it to himself though.",

      "description": "I go to a vocational school and I’m in a close-knit group with friends in all different classes. ‘Katie’ is in hospitality, they are trained to be servers/bartenders etc. I think it’s valuable work even if it’s not glamorous, but it has the reputation of being the class you sign up for when you can’t get into anything else.\n\nFrom the moment I started here Katie glommed onto me. I’ve tried to be nice but Katie is racist/homophobic. I have heard her use the n-word and call people fxg and dxke among others. Each time I hear it I correct her nicely but she always does it again. One of the guys at our lunch table is gay, too.\n\nShe lies all the time and talks about really inappropriate stuff; we’ll be talking about music or something and she’ll say her uncle went to jail for molesting her cousin (yes that happened and it was as awkward as it sounds).\n\nA few days ago at lunch one of our other friends was showing everyone the photo book her boyfriend made her, and while no one was looking, Katie drew mustaches/glasses/crazy hair on their faces in a couple photos and thought it was hilarious. If that isn’t bad enough she refused to apologize and our other friend was so upset.\n\nAfter the picture incident I told her we needed to take a break while she figured out how to be a good friend. She laughed and said I sounded like an episode of Daniel Tiger (idk what that even means) and walked away, and then yesterday she tried to sit at our table at lunch. Everyone stopped talking and looked at me, so I said ‘can we help you, Katie?’ and she said ‘no, why?’ to which I replied ‘I told you that we need to take a break, so you need to find someplace else to sit at lunch’.\n\nShe went and TOLD THE VICE PRINCIPAL that we were excluding her because she’s in hospitality. VP then told me I needed to be nice to Katie because she doesn’t have many friends. I told VP everything I just wrote and she said ‘I know she’s socially awkward but you still have to be nice to her’.\n\nToday she was sitting at a different table where no one was talking to her, and one of the guys at my table asked if we were maybe being a little harsh since none of us really talk to her outside school either. But then everyone mostly agreed it was nice to have a normal lunch for a change.\n\nSo.... AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my husband to show me his bank account transactions because I think he was lying and losing my temper when he wouldn't?",
      "description": "So this is not my usual account, as I don't want people to know that my marriage is on the rocks.  I'd like to start by giving you a rundown of our history so far, so you can get a general idea of what each of us are dealing with. This will be long. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nMy husband and I have been married just over 5 years. What I didn't know when we got married was that my husband had a gambling issue. He hid it very well when we were dating and for a good few months after we got married, but then as we started living together there were aspects that didn't add up. Less than a year into the marriage he admitted that he had a gambling issue.\n\nMy husband is paid weekly, and his pay is fairly high compared to my own. He earns about 75k per year, whereas I earn about 60k now. To compound on the pay gap, I was a student when we first met (husband is a lot older), and worked restaurant jobs during the first two years of marriage. Then I moved onto an admin job, and now I am working in my field of choice. It is entirely fair to say that my husband has consistently earned more than me. I estimate that if I had brought in about 110k over the last 5 years, my husband had earned around 200k or a little more.\n\nMy issue is that my husband had never, not once, missed a week of gambling. Each payday he is in a pub or at the casino, gambling. The smallest amount from memory is about $200.00 per week. When he is feeling especially addicted, he will literally blow his entire week's wage on pokie machines, and then ask me for part of my wages too. This has happened more times than I can count. \n\nDuring our marriage, I have managed to compile approximately $30k in personal loan debts and $42k for a car loan. He has asked money from every member of his family, to the point they will no longer lend him money. He gambles every tax return away. He has gambled about $8k of personal loan debts. We have since sold the car, so I have about 30k in debts owing in my name.\n\nI interpret this to mean that my husband is not bringing in enough money into the relationship, regardless of how much he is earning, as he is spending a significant chunk on gambling. \n\nMeanwhile, I generally try to scrimp. I cut my hair once a year, I never do my nails, I don't buy clothes unless I absolutely need it. I feel that even if I have earned less, I have brought into the relationship as much, or arguably even more, than my husband. \n\nMy husband does not agree. He is adamant that he could not have spent as much as I say he has. We fight over money every payday. I was patient and kind the first year or so, until my personality started getting ugly, and frankly abusive, towards my husband. In my defense, I genuinely have never shouted at another person in my life. My husband is the only person I lose my temper with. We are now at the point where I will be screaming all sorts of abuses at him at the top of my lungs. I feel like if I don't, I will die or implode from stress.\n\nI am now at a point where I inform him on almost a weekly basis that I will be leaving him. He is now immune to my threats, understandably, but it's like an addiction I cannot stop. My husband now informs me that I am not 'loyal' for saying such things. That we should be sticking it out through thick and thin, and he is hurt that I would say such things.\n\nLast week we agreed that each of us would bring in an equal amount into the relationship, and the rest of our money we would spend as we please, whether we are gambling or doing our hair. He was good last week. However, this week, he claims not to have received his wage, that their system had been down, and he would give me the money when he received it. He was supposed to have been paid on Wednesday. It is now Thursday night, and he says he will receive it tomorrow. He asked to lend me $50, he just wanted a drink at the pub, he will pay me back tomorrow along with our fixed amount. I agreed. An hour later he called me and asked me to lend him another 100. He will pay me back tomorrow, he says. Through 5 years of his working at this company, his pay has been delayed once. I therefore informed him that I find this hard to believe, and if he showed me his bank account and confirmed that he had not received his wage, I will give him the 100. He flat out refuses and asks me why I cannot wait until tomorrow, if I just wait, I will know. I once again blew my top and screamed at him. \n\nI now know that because I screamed at him, he will be upset, and feel justified in spending everything he has and blame me because I could not wait one day.\n\nAITA for 1. asking my husband to show me his bank account in the first place and 2. losing my temper when he didn't?\n\n(I think people will want to know this - why do I keep giving him money? He will not stop asking until I give it to him. If I lock myself in a room at midnight so I can sleep for work the next day, he will bang on the door until I open it and give him money. He has hacked into my bank account a few times to take my money without my consent.)\n\nTL;DR: husband has been gambling significant amounts of money since early on in our 5 year marriage. I became suspicious that he was lying to me today and asked him to show me his bank account as proof, and screamed at him when he wouldn't.",

      "description": "Hi Reddit,\n\nMy Partner and I have found a beautiful spot to go on our holidays, opposite the beach, not very expensive, calm waters, good water temp, great walks, etc... but then my sister came along and started holidaying with us. normally this is fine, like a whatever we don't really care situation. She is a bit self centered and is a massive FOMO (Fear of missing out) most of the time she will try to do everything with you or try to get everyone to do the same thing. I have one kid and he tends to get a bit annoyed about this because he likes to be polite but he also likes to do his own thing so he doesn't really enjoy when my sister tries to do everything we do. My sister also has two kids, which means whenever her kids want to do something my sister tries to get everyone to do the same thing. My son recently confessed to me that his starting to reach his breaking point, and wants to have to have the next 1-2 years of our holidays to ourselves and his and our friends.  \n\nThis has been going on for about 3-2 years and is starting to seep into other holidays we do as well. She also tends to stay for almost the entire time where down there so that just adds fuel to the fire. We really just want to  holiday without her for a year or two. This whole situation also stops us from inviting my son's and our friends, due to lack of space and everything we mentioned. It's really hard for us to say stop, since she is family but this hole situation is getting really hard and annoying. So will we be the assholes for telling her to stop.",

This cat looks jacked up. He has three legs, clumps of matted hair all over him and gooey stuff coming out of his eyes. I say “meow” to him then he is all over me. Loving up on me. Rubbing on my legs. He even let me pick him up. Then that neighbor comes out and says to me “I know he looks rough but I don’t want you to think he’s neglected. He’s been missing his leg since he was a kitten.” And I said “well he needs a good shaving to get rid of these clumps of matted hair” then she laughs and says “well he is a really mean cat and there’s no way to get him shaved. I can’t even let him inside the house because he will attack my kids and dogs. Plus he’s old and doesn’t have much time left” Meanwhile this cat is still loving up on me and being a sweetheart. Then she leaves. So then I steal the cat. I take him to the vet where I get the clumps of hair shaved off him, get him some medication for his eyes and ears, and get flee medication. He’s now at my house and seems a lot happier and healthier. He’s still an outside cat but he comes in and chills on the couch with me and my dogs. So tell me AITA? Did is steal this cat or did I rescue him? Should I drop him back off at that house? I feel like if I take him back that they will just neglect him some more. ",

We moved in together in November. \n\nSo here is what happened; I woke up at nine so I could get ready for work, and I am a morning pooper. I always have to poop as soon as I wake up in the morning. So get up and walk into our one and only bathroom and he’s already in there running a bath. Of course since I just woke up I needed to poop, I see he is still clothed and I asked him to leave the bathroom while I poop and he flat out declines. \nAt this point we have lived together long enough for him to know that not only am I a morning pooper, I poop fast. I’m talking start to finish, including washing my hands, no longer then 3 minutes and that’s if it’s taking me a while. \nI tell him he knows it’s only going to take me maybe two minutes and I’ll be done. He still refuses and tells me I can either poop in front of him while he’s taking a bath or I can hold it until he’s done. He said I needed to get used to pooping around him since we live together now even if I’m uncomfortable with it. \nI cannot poop in front of people, let alone my boyfriend, so I get obviously upset and passive aggressive and held it until he was done with his 40 MINUTE bath. \nI’ve been wondering since; am I the asshole for getting pissed off he wouldn’t let me poop, even though he was already using the bathroom? Or is he the asshole for not giving me three minutes to poop? \nObviously he didn’t care if he smelled it either way. ",

I decided to steal the dog back one night. He recognized me and everything. He was so happy to see me. I took him to my new place. He was covered in fleas. The reason I never even asked for the dog back was because I knew the answer would be no. The reason they took him in the first place was because of their 6 year old. Also they didn't allow the dog inside the house at all which is weird since Chihuahuas are indoor pets.",

So until we actually start dating, flirting with other girls is fair game. And I like to to be talking to multiple girls at a time, so if one potential relationship falls through I have other options. \n\nCurrently I'm talking/texting with 4 different girls, let's call them Emma, Ava, Julie, and Sophie. And to be clear, I never told any of them I was their boyfriend/we were exclusive. Basically, I'm trying to hang out with all 4, see who I like most, and proceed from there. \n\nAnd Sean, a guy I know, although we're not super good friends, seems very pissed at me for this. Whenever we're in conversation, he always makes statements here and there about me 'being a fuckboy' or 'hanging out with a bunch of girls'. I don't know if a) he just has a problem with me in general and is using this one issue to make it clear b) he actually has a problem with me talking to multiple girls c) he's just jealous or d) he likes one of the girls I'm talking to.\n\nEither way, I didn't think I was doing anything wrong, until yesterday, Sean sits at the same table as me during lunch. He was doing his usual passive-aggressive roasting, and usually I just ignore it, but I was pretty annoyed, so I just looked at him and asked if he had a problem. He then proceeded to call me out for 'being a fuckboy'. \n\nI think he was out of line here. Aita?",

I bought him a box of chocolates and handmade him a paper lantern with scenes from one of his favorite movies.  He bought me a personal size cake made to look like a rose. \n\nWhen he opened his chocolates, he offered me some and I ate one piece. When I walked past him an hour later, all of the chocolates were gone. Like 30 chocolates. He has a serious sweet tooth and will literally eat an entire package of sweets in an hour or so if he doesn’t stop himself. Anyway, I ate a little bit of the cake and put the rest away to be eaten later. I like to savor things. \n\nThe next day, I went to make some breakfast and the rest of my cake was gone completely. He even licked the frickin frosting off the container. I wouldn’t have minded if he’d just had a piece but he ate ALL of it. And, this kind of thing happens a lot and he gives me a hard time for “hiding” junk food from him. I don’t hide it, I just try to keep him from eating all of it or I will get none. He thinks I should eat all of my portion right away to make sure I get it. I’m sorry, but a huge package of cookies should last a few days - not be gone in an hour and only eaten by one person. \n\nIt’s unhealthy, rude, and disgusting imo. He shows no remorse for doing it and laughs about it like a little kid. He doesn’t think he’s wrong or that there’s nothing wrong with what he’s doing. \n\nAnd, no, he’s not a stoner. He just eats constantly and he’s gained quite a bit in the 3 years we’ve been together. I know this is stupid and trivial but he’s seriously ruining his health. ",

This left me with abandonment issues, especially as her parents had always shown blatant favouritism towards my sister and she had been planning to take my sister with her when she left.\n\nAfter my mother left my dad reached out to his sister (aunt), her husband (uncle) and their kids (cousin 1 and 2), and we started to see them more regularly. We hadn’t spent much time with them before, which aunt told my dad was because they never liked my mother.\n\nWe never had much in common and it always felt a bit forced spending time with them now. Uncle is very controlling and always made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I refused to hug him once and he followed my around trying to force me to, and told me I was being disrespectful. He’s also intimidated me before when my dad wasn’t around, telling me I won’t get on in life if I’m not more likeable.\n\nCousins have got worse over the years, and last time they visited us they wanted to spend the whole time with my sister, and tried to leave me and my boyfriend on a shopping trip when we driven them into town, so they could just hang out with my sister. They even tricked her into going on a walk with them without me. After they left my sister told me that they had been badmouthing me and my dad, saying that I would be a bad mother and that I was too affectionate with my boyfriend.\n\nAunt doesn’t say much and likes to pretend her family is perfect, but is really judgemental of us.\n\nA few weeks ago my aunt called my dad (they talk every week) and during the conversation mentioned that he should come and visit sometime, and that my sister (who’s just finished university) would be welcome to move in with them and look for a job there. She didn’t mention me once.\n\nAfter my dad told me that I got really upset and ended up unfriending them all on facebook. I haven’t spoken to any of them since. I feel like I’m being really petty and they haven’t actually done anything wrong, but they’ve still really hurt me with their actions. I also don’t want to cause any issues with them for my dad, and I just know that they’re going to use my behaviour against him.\n\nSo reddit, should I keep ignoring them and cut them out of my life completely or am I being an asshole and should just suck it up for the sake of my family?",

      "description": "So my friend (15F) has been messaging an older guy (20M) that she knows from her youth group. \n\n\nI did not know how old this guy was until recently when she sent me screenshots of her messages with him on Instagram and he blatantly asked her out because he “liked her for awhile” and “thinks she’s pretty.” She said she only ever thought of him as a friend but could see a possibility of being with him if he were closer to her age. He said that maybe she’d be lucky enough to get a kiss from him. I found it quite disturbing and since the age gap was mentioned in the messages, I asked her exactly how much older he was compared to her. \n\nLooking out for her, I told her that it seems a little immature of him to hit on someone five years younger than him and that it sparks a red flag, especially since they’re both at completely different stages in life. She told me to not ruin this high for her and that he’s “pretty” and that I should stay out of her business. \n\nI don’t want anything bad to happen to her cause I care for her as a friend and I’d feel awful if I didn’t take this seriously. \n\nAITA in this situation?",

      "description": "So our mom died when I was 8, my brother was 12. I went and lived with my dad and step-mom who are Pentecostal and super great parents. My brother went with our grandma. By the age of 15 he was smoking weed, at 18 that turned into meth. He got caught up with a possession charge, then a child endangerment charge because his friends kid was in the house while they were cooking it and now at the age of 26 he’s been in and out of jail probably a total of at least 1.5-2 years. While he was out I have tried to get him to places to help with his addiction and he has went to rehab and came out “a better man” only to fall right back in the same rut. I’ve prayed for him. I’ve put his ass in the dirt and screamed at him. I’ve cried with him. I’ve tried to just spend quality time with him and keep him accountable and nothing works. You can’t change someone who doesn’t want to change. Long story short he is back in jail I just heard and I frankly don’t give a shit. I still hope that he turns his life around but I could care less about what happens. He’s a fu**ing adult with 2 kids and can’t get his life together. No longer my problem is how I see it. AITA? ",

      "description": "My grandma has never been anything but kind to me. Her first instinct whenever she sees me is to feed me or give me gift money. Her face lights up and she can’t stop smiling and holding my hand whenever I’m around.\n\nHowever, I know that I’m the favorite and she treats the rest of her grandchildren less favorably. I’m the oldest daughter of her oldest son, so I get the best treatment (it would have been even more extreme if I was born male). My sister sort of counts since she’s also from my dad. My older male cousins don’t count since they’re from my aunt and my younger female cousin doesn’t count because my uncle adopted her. She’s never come out and say it, but everybody can tell because she never gives the same attention to my sister and cousins. At one point she was even increasing the gift money (I’d get $20 while my sister would get $10, my cousin would get even less, etc).\n\nIn addition, she’s horribly verbally abusive to my dad, mom, aunts, and uncles. My grandpa died when my dad was very young and left my grandma with young children in a foreign country with no education or English-speaking skills. She used verbal and physical abuse to corral my dad and his siblings into order, and she’d manipulate them against each other. She constantly unfavorably compared the siblings to my dad, and would punish my dad for their infractions. They still resent my dad for how my grandma treated them, while my dad still gets the brunt of her anger.\n\nShe’s very old at this point (100+) and really should have assisted living, but refuses a caretaker or retirement home. My parents took her in at one point, but she cried to my aunts and uncles about how my parents were abusing her, and there was a huge family fight. She’s never apologized about it. The last time I saw her at a family event, she was ranting about my dad so horribly that my uncle and I literally wheeled her out to the car mid-tirade. \n\nI’m extremely close to my parents and sister and hate the way she treats them. I mentioned to someone that I never want to see her again. They were shocked that someone who is so close to her family wouldn’t feel the same way about her grandma. They also thought I was being a little harsh when my grandma’s never been anything but nice to me, and said I should give her the comfort of her favorite grandchild before she dies.

      "description": "My friend has not been diagnosed with depression ... She might just have the kind of Debbie Downer personality that's a bit overboard at the moment. \n\nWe meet 3 years ago at work. She would often complian about everything.. Work, the country we live in, other people etc. \n\nThen, her best friend left our work place, and after a few weeks of her trying to catch up with her, the friend sends her a text saying that she didn't want to have anything to do with the old work place because she had had such bad experiences there, and just cuts ties with her. She was devastated.\n\nWe become closer..best friends, tell everything to each other kind of thing. \n\n2 years ago she started having doubts about her relationship and complaints that she does everything her boyfriend wants and never gets what she wants. Every time we go out, day or night , he calls , insisting for her to come home.. \n\n1 year and 1/2 ago she meets this guy at work and ends up having a crush.. they see each other twice for coffee.. but nothing happens from there on. Then 1 year ago she meets another guy.. this was worse.. for the first couple of months they declare love for each other... But she ends up saying she will never leave her boyfriend, so ended it with the guy.. she never physical cheated because they live in different countries..but emotional cheating in my POV.\n\n it gets complicated. This guy is super depressed, is in therapy, had has a history of attempting suicide in the past. He's also the type that uses that to guilt people in to things. He's super in love with her, and she just wants to be friends, says they have an amazing connecting, and he's family.. so they still talk everyday.. she hides a lot of the communication from her boyfriend, because she knows it's too much to be acceptable. But since he's so depressed she seems even more  Depressed from being connected to him and enabling this friendship. \n\nI can't help but judge... I've told her she shouldn't keep contact with him after their involvement and because he's still In love and won't be able to get over her if they still have contact. I've only said something over hours and hours of her complaining that he cries a lot because they're not together. \n\nHer boyfriend might not be great.. but I don't think he deserves this.. even if they re just friends now. \n \nWe used to have lunch everyday.. but I've avoided seeing her as much.. I schedule meetings at lunch time. When I do have lunch with her I'm always thinking \"this time will be better, this time she will be in a good mood\".. and then regret it later.\n\nShe used to have other friends, but I'm her only friend now. We used to go to breakfast Saturday morning when I was single. She's told  me she used to be happier because we would go for breakfast and have some laughs, and that now she has nothing in her life to cheer her up. She kind of made my feel guilty for her misery.. which I feel was unfair, and it's too much responsibility to be her only friend.\n\nI can't keep scheduling meetings and giving excuses... I don't like lying.. not even white lies.. but I also can't tell her I can't deal with her, I think it would devastate her.\n\nSo I've blew her off several times by saying I want to have lunch alone, because I need some time - this is true and has happened in the past, she knows I'm introverted and need less social time and has always respected that... But I think with time she will start to feel suspicious because I'm consecutively doing it... She's already asked me if anything is wrong and said I no. Not seeing her everyday has made me so much happier... But as a friend shouldn't I be there for her? Instead of just cutting her out because she's been having a bad time? AITA?\n\n \n",

He offered to sell me his headphones for some money, but eventually the conversation roped me into asking him for details about his situation. He stated he was currently in rehab, and was going thru a difficult time. Towards the end he stated that for this specific step of the rehab program he was on, he needed to make friends  because he needed a positive influence in his life. He asked if he could have my number, but i declined. He was visibly disappointed, and hurt. But tbh i said no out of the fact that i had no idea who this person was, and of i gave them my number, i had a fear that maybe he would resort to relying on me for money. I couldn't take that risk, but i can't help but feel like morally i made the wrong choice in that decision. ",

I was taking a trip to Canada this weekend with my school, which had my best friend Helen, her best friend Kate, and this guy named Jake. Just to preface, I’m a single gay guy. One night, Jake asked to sleep in my room because his roommate was really sick and they slept in one bed, so I agreed.  So he came into the room and we slept opposite sides of the bed. But he then initiated touch and soon enough, we hooked up (like making out and cuddling, not anything further). \n\nLater that week, Helen told me that he and Kate have been dating for about half a year, which I didn’t know about at all. I also thought he was straight until we hooked up and now I don’t know what to think. I later saw them cuddling while watching a movie during the trip. I talked to Jake afterward and we said that everything was cool, never to talk about again. But now thinking about it, I’m unsure. Am I the asshole if I don’t say anything about him cheating to Kate?",

What is the issue is me telling her that I don't know if I can stay with her or not.  \n\n\nWe had unprotected sex and she had not taken her birth control in about 2 weeks. She never told me this. In fact, according to her, she purposely just tell me. Since we've been together she has been on birth control and I've seen her take it on a usual basis in the morning. So I tended never to question her about it. We had talked about her wanting a child and I said I didn't want one until after marriage. She seemed to at least understand why I wanted that and then added, \"well I definitely don't want one until after college.\"  \n\n\nFast forward to present day, everything has seemed to erupt. She's mad at me now. She said that I took my own risks by not using protection and she's right, I knew that and understand that well. I told her that I understood that. It's just that I can't help but feel like I've basically been lied to. She knows that I know that she's been taking birth control. She would always tell me when she was about to run out or when she had to go get more. Not this time though. It had been about 2 weeks since we had sex and then we had it about two weeks after she had stopped with the birth control. She *chose* that. Chose not to tell me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I really feel like I'll never come back from an action of that magnitude. How do I trust her now? She told me she's sorry but at the same time, she's happy about it even though she understands that I was not ready. She thinks I'm abandoning her even though I've voiced that I will absolutely be a father to the child. It's honestly alarming to me that she takes the whole situation lightly. Like her feelings out weigh mine. Now I'm pretty hurt about the whole situation.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Fiance (M26) and I (F27) have been together for 3 years. He is the love of my life and I am so excited to spend the rest of my life with him. We started discussing marriage and made a mutual decision that it was what we both wanted. He asked me about the ring, and I told him I would prefer not to have an engagement ring and would rather we both pick out inexpensive bands together that we both put on at the wedding. He agreed with this and also said he doesn't need an expensive band for himself. I also told him that I don't need a proposal, but he told me he really wanted to surprise me with one and that he had been looking forward to it for a long time. I told him that I'm excited to see what he comes up with and that I'm looking forward to saying yes\n\nMy reasons for not wanting an engagement ring are 1. I don't like the sexist nature of the tradition that the woman wears an engagement ring, but not the man and 2. I would feel really nervous wearing something that expensive on my hand all the time. I would much rather have a simple symbol of our bond that we both share equally and put on together at our wedding.\n\nFast forward to the end of January. Fiance and I both take some time off work for a nice vacation in the mountains. On a hike he gets down on one knee and proposes. It was really magical and he did a great job. The only problem is the proposal also included a really nice looking ring. Of course I put it on in the moment and said I love it but I was really miffed my fiance didn't respect my request.\n\nWe talked about it later and I found out that he spent over 1000 dollars on it. I feel terrible that he dropped so much money on this and I'm constantly worried about losing it. I have not been wearing it and kept it in a box in the drawer so that it doesn't get lost and he seemed really hurt by this. I told him that I never even wanted a ring in the first place and he thought I was just saying that because I didn't want him to be out so much money. I also told him my reason about thinking the tradition is sexist and he said he wasn't trying to be sexist and thought it would be meaningful to me.\n\nI want to tell him to take it back but I don't want to hurt him even more. On the other hand I really don't want to wear it on my finger for the rest of my life, knowing it's so expensive and that he is not doing the same thing and gets to wear just the band like I wanted to. It would make me feel like we are not equal partners.\n\nTLDR: I said I didn't want a ring and fiance got me one anyway. Now I want to ask him to sell it/take it back. Would I be the asshole if I did that",

And obviously, no one wants to change into nice clothes when they get home from work. But even on the weekends he'll wear his graphic tees. When we go out to eat or something he'll usually wear like a plainer grey v neck or the like though which is nice.\n\nBut I just feel like it's not super sexy to be wearing graphic tees that often as an adult. He says that he'd rather me be direct about me liking/disliking something about him instead of telling white lies.

      "description": "Preface: my boyfriend (32) and I(28) have been together for 9 months or so. He is very concerned when I want to do things without him. We have come to an agreement to run plans by each other before we make them to be considerate about the other. \n\nIssue: A lifelong friend of mine asked me if I wanted to go to go to the big city near by on 420 to celebrate back in january. I told her yes I'd love to. This was before my boyfriend and I came to the agreement.\n\nI remembered the plans a few weeks ago and told him about them. He said he'd really really like to go to, because he's never done anything on 420 and would like to experience it. He said he wouldn't mind just sitting near us an playing on his phone or switch. I said of course I would ask her, but since she invited me I can't promise anything. He seemed fine with that.\n\nYesterday she texted me to confirm, and I asked if he could come. She said she would really prefer it be just girl time, that she was looking forward to that. When I told my boyfriend, he said that me going without him was a deal breaker for him, and that I either needed to insist that he come along too, or cancel the plans with her instead. I said I would ask one more time, mentioning that he would sit nearby and not bother us, but that I wouldn't absolutely insist he go (I find that incredibly rude, she invited me) or cancel. That was not good enough for him, he said it was a still a deal breaker if I go.\n\nAITA for thinking I should go anyway, and that he is being out of line? ",

      "description": "I am a manager at a small retail establishment and am working on hiring a part time sales associate. The position has been online over a month and we have received 0 qualified candidates. The other day a middle aged woman “Karen” who works across a couple locations came in while I was reviewing resumes. \n\nI was reading two resumes with another employee and they were just awful. Resume 1 listed their birth date while subsequently leaving off their education. In my country it’s illegal to ask the applicants age, only if they are over 18. They were 22. The resume did not list any skills they had picked up at their previous two part time jobs nor the dates that they worked there. It was half a page in normal size font that they increased to take up a whole page. They did not have a drivers license which is a requirement for the position and did not have any cover letter. \n\nResume 2 was 3 pages. They had one part time job, again not listing any acquired skills. They had their education as the last segment on their resume. They filled 2.5 pages with volunteer experience leaving off any dates or skills acquired though these experiences. Most volunteering was 2 hour projects. Their contact information was only located on the second page of their resume and they only had their name on the first page. Their font and size were not consistent across the document. Again, no cover letter. \n\nAnyway, Karen comes in while I’m lamenting on how bad these resumes are and how I dread we’ll never find someone qualified enough to fill our basic entry level sales associate position. Karen has marital issues that the staff is well aware of because she literally never shuts up about them. I can tell you about her financial troubles, her kids, her husband and her *gag* sex life (which I NEVER asked about. Super funny though because she tells everyone about her husbands ED and how he can’t hold a job because of it??). \n\nKaren starts tearing me a new one in that mom way for “harassing strong young men for their *likely* (obviously unknown because we can’t ask) mental disability”. I interviewed both of these candidates anyway because were so desperate for a hire. I understand not all mental deficits present but they both seemed normal, just lazy. I explained to Karen that it takes nothing for someone to google “how to write a resume” and even just follow the first google example, but she still says I was being mean and abusing my power. \n\nCome to find out she has been telling the other locations she works at how I’m a horrible manager and no wonder no one will work for me. She has taken each of my employees to the side and asked them how they feel about me. They told me that Karen made them feel very uncomfortable by doing this and that they have no issues with me. \n\nTLDR: older female coworker says I’m being unfair by criticizing resumes. I interviewed the candidates and they were not a good fit as their resume suggested. ",

I typically am the one to stock the stoves at bedtime, me and the wife head to bed at the same time, on this particular night it was very cold and windy, this caused both stoves to use up their wood somewhat early so a new fire had to be lit in each stove, after I could verify that both fires had started successfully I headed off to bed. When I got to bed my wife had already been there for 25 minutes and she was nice and warm, I tried to slide up next to her to warm myself back up after hanging around the cold stoves to ensure they lit. She did not like this, started complaining that I was to cold and shoving blankets in between us. I was offended, said \"oh, i see how it is\" and rolled back over to my side of the bed. and fell asleep warming myself up. In the morning she's all bent and obviously upset and she says its because \"you rolled over to your side of the bed angry last night\". so my question is, AITA for expecting my wife to warm me up after coming to bed cold because I stayed up a little later to make sure our wood stoves were burning?

      "description": "To be blunt, she screwed up. She had an... Episode due to mental health, took 5000e in payday loans from different companies, and spent around half on games, jewerly, god damn microtransactions on a Phone game, etc.\n\nNow, to Her Credit, she Came clean about it pretty quickly, and admitted she needed help. We Immidiately used the rest of the money to pay Off few of them (they had a first time customer offer, no interest if paid back inside a month of taking the loan, thankfully), leaving about 2300e left to pay from Her own income, which, due to the Fact that we don't have money, Will start to grow interest soon. Nothing we can do to stop that now. Anyway, onto the AITA part.\n\nShe has a large sum of money (2000e give or take 300e) coming as backpay for Her disability, and she has expressed hesitance at paying the loans back with it. As in, she keeps asking why she can't just pay the Monthly payments, over and over, and me explaning how 260% yearly interest rates are insane, over and over. Ofcourse, rent and bills need to be paid first, but after that, I told Her, the rest should go towards paying  the debt, due to the huge interest rates payday loans have. It won't be enough for all of it, but still a significant step towards getting the Hell out of This hole she dug.\n\nI also told Her that she doesn't need to worry about anything Else, moneywise. I'll feed and clothe Her, get food for Her cats, buy gas for Her car, take care of everything Else Until the debt is paid, as long as she devotes all Her money to it apart from rent and bills. Even thou I don't have any more money than she has, I can improvise the rest we need. Surviving with basically no money isn't exactly new to me... \n\nTo give some more insight into This:\n\nwe both are on the same kind of disability, usually get the same amount of money per month, around 900e. \n\nWe live separately, have separate money, everything. She doesn't live at my place technically, but she does spend most of Her time with me, and stays at my place almost every free night we have. \n\nWe are both students (the disability we get paid is tied to our studies, so if we don't get courses done, we don't get money. It is thing Where I live). \n\nwhile we have separate finances, we do live a quite symbiotic life what Comes to spending money on food and such, so while Her debt isn't my debt, it does affect me, and how much money I have to spend on other things. \n\nSo, AITA for expecting Her to use the money she is getting to pay most of the debt Immidiately, instead of the Monthly payments?\n\nPs. Before I start getting monetary advice, thank you, but no need. We have contacted multiple organizations that provide free professional consultation for situations just like This one. I'm sure that if there is a better way to do This than what I Came up, they'll tell me about it. ",

      "description": "For context, OF is old friend, and Callum is a good friend of mine. I've been having issues with him OF since mid year 7, and it's hit me really hard atm. I'm currently in year 9. Be warned, it's a long post. So, I've recently cut ties with OF because I'm so sick of his bullshit. It started in year 7 with little things. OF would constantly take up the majority of the table in class, leaving me with about 2 A4 sheets of room, barely enough to work. When I would complain to him about this he would get really childish and say things like \"Is this better?\" while proceeding to take up more space. This got too much for me, as I'm very dedicated with my work, so I moved. Problem solved? NO. He'd move next to me and do the same thing. That was just the start of it. OF would constantly seem to be seeking attention, as much as I hate that term. He would do all he can to be the center of everything. It started with little digs at us, using words like fagget loosely without knowing the meaning or history of the words. He would then get to headlocking us and trying to yank our hair out because it was 'fun'. It got to the point where he would steal our phones and run around the school so that we could chase him. This annoyed me and Callum a lot, and in OF's defense we could have kept our cool a bit more than we did. Either way, we got to the end of the year, things died down, and we went into year 8. This was when things got worse. OF had gotten over the desk control, but had somehow gotten worse. He started insulting us and making fun of us for things like our body shape, really petty and immature things. Then when we would have a go at him back(again, should've kept our cool), he would resort to violence again. This went on and on. He could insult us but we couldn't even joke about him. He would also get very angry if he lost in games of downfall, and sometimes again, resort to violence. Things went on until 4th term. The boys invited me to be their goalkeeper for a futsal team. This worried me, and I'd be here forever if I explained it all. Basically I have on and off mental health issues and possibly social anxiety, not sure though. It sounds stupid, but the position of goalkeeper is a lot of pressure on me. I told OF all this and more, and explained that I didn't think it would be good for my mental health (I was right). Not to my surprise, OF wasn't sympathetic in the slightest, despite 'weawwy tweasuwing my fwendship'. He went on for weeks saying shit like 'OoOoHhH nOoO I can't be goalie cus I have depression! Get over it fagget.'. This really got me down, and I still don't understand why he said that. The same kind of thing happened this year. I felt quite down during a futsal match and he picked up on it. Same kind of thing 'if you feel like shit then don't come. You played like shit.\" This was the turning point for me, as I beat myself up about it anyway. I was sick of it. Am I the asshole for cutting ties with OF?",

      "description": "In October of 2018 I went to visit family in Europe and needed someone to stay over and watch my cats. I found a local girl (late 20's early 30's) who posted a pet sitter ad on a community website. We met, I checked references, agreed on a price, and everything seemed fine. I left payment on my counter before I left with detailed instructions. One thing I stressed was not to have anyone else in the house. I have rescue cats who don't like strangers, especially males, and she said it wouldn't be a problem. The day before I was to return home she sent me a message asking where the broom and mop was because \"I want you to return home to a clean house\". I told her not to worry about the floors because I do them a certain way and we left it at that. She was set to leave at 7:30 that morning for work and I got home around 9am.\n\nWell, when I got in the house reeked of feces. She left a big #2 in the main bathroom, the cats had peed multiple times in both the showers, there were food scraps in the bathroom garbage, and she didn't even bother to make the bed. She left wet towels in the dryer, and the kitchen was a disaster. It looked like she cooked a Thanksgiving feast. Food remnants in the sink, on the counters, drips down to the floors. My big crock pot and rice maker were left out and the dishwasher was full including casserole dishes, mixing bowls, measuring cups, herb scissors, turkey baster, etc. I could tell my dining room table was used because every chair was put back askew and the drop leaf was used. She used all my flour, left grease in multiple baking pans, left her own food/leftovers in the fridge, and multiple Tupperware containers were missing. This to me seemed like she had a dinner party when I specifically instructed her not to have people over. I was pissed, so I never contacted her again.\n\nShe messaged me yesterday asking if I would be needing someone to watch the cats in the next few months because she is trying to fill her calendar with house, pet, and baby sitting jobs. She posts in a local Facebook group so I know she is looking for work outside of her school district job. I wouldn't have brought any of these issues up with her, but since she messaged me again i'm debating telling her why I wouldn't use her services again detailing what I already outlined. Would I be the asshole to call her out after almost 6 months of silence?",

We share the same father, but different mothers. \n\nMy stepmom (his mother) came into my life at about age 10, and although we generally get along, I tended to have a lot of clashes with her over the fact that I felt like she was trying to replace my biological mom. I am very close with my biological mom, but she lives very far away and I rarely got to see her as a child, something which really bothered me. Although I don’t really feel like I resent my stepmom, I to this day just don’t really feel that attached or close to her.\n\nI do not feel attached to my brother at all. I have a hard time seeing him as anything more than just another toddler. This isn’t to say I dislike him: he’s a cute, funny child, but I just don’t feel the bonds with him I feel with others in my family. I feel like I try to be a good sister: I play with him, I talk to him, I’ll help with the tasks related to a baby when needed, but I just don’t feel anything. I want to feel like he’s my family, but I can’t.\n\nAITA for not being able to love my own brother? ",

Examples: school, news, my little brothers. But every time i try to mention something she just doesn't care and answeres \"huh\" or stays quiet and doesn't even change the subject. So with time, i've just become more quiet.\n\nRecently, she's been mentioning that i'm quiet and that i need to start talking and stuff, also saying stuff like i don't respect her or that i'm a life-less robot.\n\nYesterday she went full breakdown, started cussing me telling me that i'm an idiot, retarded, respectless etc. She straight up bullied me. I never thought my own mother would make me this sad and low. So i went home and she called me twice but i was kinda scared to answer since she cusses at me pretty often over the phone and telling me that i play on the ps4 too much (i don't play that much) and that i'm a fat lazy nerd/looser (i'm quite healthy).\n She then messaged me asking why i won't answer and i replied \"because you're always mad at me. \n\nMom: \"i'm mad at you because you never say a word\" \n\nMe: \"i'm scared to because you'll just get mad at me\"\n\nMom: \"have you ever sat down and talked like a normal human being?\"",

      "description": "Last semester, two of my roommates and I agreed to share a Chegg Study subscription. Chegg Study is useful for accessing textbook solutions, posting problems to be answered by \"experts\", and searching solutions previously worked by \"experts.\" For college students, it costs $15.00/month. Split among three people, that is $5.00 each per month. We will call my roommates Sally and Betsy.\n\nBetsy is the one who suggested we share a Chegg account. We were all studying one night, and Betsy had a chemistry test the next day. She kept saying how useful Chegg would be for chemistry. I thought it could be useful to me also, since I'm a science student. Betsy suggested the three of us share a Chegg account and pay $5.00 each per month. I knew that by owning the account, I was accepting the risk that my roommates might not hold up their agreement. Nevertheless, I created the account, shared the login information with Betsy and Sally, paid the $15.00 for that month, and sent Venmo requests to Betsy and Sally for $5.00 each. They each paid and we continued to study happily.\n\nThe second month rolled around, and I billed them both for $5.00 after Chegg charged me the $15.00. Sally texted me saying she didn't find it useful but knew it would be useful to me and Betsy. This annoyed me, but I had seen it coming. I decided I would retain the service if Betsy still wanted to share. I didn't bother asking Sally for my $5.00 back because I suspected she would refuse to pay it and throw a fit. Betsy agreed that she and I would retain the Chegg service and pay $7.50 each.\n\nThis month, like every other, I billed Betsy for my $7.50 after Chegg charged my account. She didn't ever pay it. I texted her and asked about it today. She said she wouldn't be using it anymore. I said that was fine, but I still needed the $7.50 because I had already been charged for the month. She was flabbergasted that I had the nerve to ask for my $7.50 that she had effectively spent by not notifying me that she wished to cancel the service. She says she will not pay for something that she isn't using. I explained that this would be like me refusing to pay rent because I decided to move out without giving her notice to find someone else to take over the lease, although the money is not that much. She became irate and insisted repeatedly that she said she \"only needed it for chemistry\" and that she had told me \"MONTHS ago\" that she would not need it after that. In my memory, this is false; she said she would use it for chemistry, not that she wanted to cancel it after the semester ended. And even if she did say that, I think she should have had the courtesy to remind me that she would no longer need the service. We both agreed that we should have had a conversation about whether we intended to continue using it after the semester ended. I told her I wasn't going to fight her over $7.50, but I was frustrated that she had asked me to create the account, then not held up her agreement. She raised the point that I didn't charge Sally for $5.00 when she decided to no longer pay, and I said that it was beside the point because she owed me $7.50 regardless of the $5.00 Sally owes me. I said that at some point, it's my money they're spending by refusing to pay. I feel that if the roles were flipped, she would demand I pay her $7.50.\n\nAITA for asking her to pay me $7.50?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "For context I’m a 16 year old boy, and my dad is 51. \n\nI’m in my room revising science. Mum comes in, she asks for me wipe down all the surfaces in my room, I say no, because I’m revising and that I’ll do it eventually. She leaves without saying a word, and leaves the door open. \n\nI ask her to shut the door, but there was no response so I shouted it. I knew she was ignoring me. I go to her, and ask her to leave the door open, especially when I’m trying to revise. She tells me to stop telling her off\n\nMy Dad comes over and starts telling me off for ‘harassing’ Mum, I said that I’m just telling her to shut my door behind her. He starts getting angry, and threatens to turn the power off (his usual response), he goes towards the door and I tell him to stop. He backs off, I start saying that he shouldn’t have even got involved. This annoyed\nhim, he towards my room and began to raise his voice. \n\nHe gets close to my computer, so I get in the way. At this point he’s shouting, so I’m shouting. I’m saying that I’m just trying to revise, that he should leave me alone. He then unplugged my PC &amp; picked it up, but then he threw it on the sofa in my room to engage me. At this point he’s closing in on me. Cursing at me at me and all, I’m swearing back in response.\n\nHe begins to put his right arm back, as though he were about to punch me. He starts saying something along the lines of, “do you wanna go?” I back up but he just gets closer, at this point mum is in the room witness to it all. She’s not interfering, just watching. I end up on my bed, and he grabs my leg. I shake him off. I shout at him and tell him to stop getting violent, he carries on.\n\nAt this point I’m on the other side of the bed, he goes towards my Xbox and begins to unplug that. He picks up my Xbox and the computer and walks out, saying that he’s not done.\n\nNow I turn to my mum and say I hope she’s happy that she’s caused this, she says it’s my fault. I say I hope she’s happy that she married someone who would threaten their son like that, and try to get violent (this isn’t the first time he’s gotten violent) \n\nEventually, he comes back. There’s more swearing and shouting going on, my mum is stood between us this time. I was saying he’s horrible, and he insisted he doesn’t care. He starts telling me off for still living here, saying that I am leeching off of him. He begins walking off and I tell him I don’t love him and I never have (dramatic, ikr) He shouts back saying that he doesn’t care; that I apparently hate everyone in the family. I say that’s not true as it wasn’t.\n\nI say that I only hate people who are horrible, and he is the worst one. He said he doesn’t care.\n\nOnce he’s gone into the kitchen my mum says “stop! You’re upsetting your little brother”, I reply saying “how is that the person you’re worried about being upset?” (Bro wasn’t near) \n\nMy voice cracked in my response and I ran upstairs and cried my eyes out.\n \nAITA?",

My best friend was always hanging out with his gf and her friends/family. He even got the gf’s friend a job with him while I’m struggling to find a decent job. My other roommate is hanging out with the rest of our friends and I’m stuck at home. \nWell an opportunity to move and help a family member came up and I took it immediately. I packed my things, said goodbye and left. I moved 1,000 miles away. I still paid rent every month till the end of our lease cause I couldn’t find anyone to fill my spot. I wasn’t that I hated my friends but I wasn’t happy and felt stuck. \nSkip ahead a couple years and I’m talking to my best friend and he’s still really fucking pissed at me. Said I put it on myself by not talking to him about it and just leaving.\nTL;DR Moved out without telling roommates to get out of a rut. Still paid rent. Pissed my best friend off in doing so. ",

And I have known performance issues, I can achieve an erection but cannot maintain it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was hanging out with a previous coworker(45F), that I hadn't seen in about 2 years at her place. We had fooled around in the past and sext recently, in the past few months. We were drinking and chatting, small talk mostly catching up. Talked about the last time we saw each other and relatively quickly started making out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe went to her bedroom where naturally one thing led to another. I was hard and we started having sex, lasted a few minutes before I felt myself getting soft inside her. Horrible feeling for me, probably terrible feeling for her. I rolled onto the bed and lie there, she was pretty calm about it as I have found most girls are in the moment. We talk a bit and things start heating up again, we decided to try more oral stuff this round, similar to the last time we hooked up. Hard, close, but couldn't finish and again found myself losing my erection. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I am pretty defeated mentally, this girl seems eager to please and I obviously want to finish. We laid there cuddling talking, and she tried to heat things up again. But I was already so far into my own head at that point thinking about so many different things I don't know if anything could have gotten me hard at that point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe laid there for about 15-20mins with me holding her talking, some things sexy somethings neutral. I decided I needed to figure out a way to get myself out of the situation and wanted to leave. I did not know how she felt or what exactly she wanted, but I was extremely uncomfortable being unable to perform. I said I needed to use the bathroom, so I got up from the bed and went. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finished doing my thing and when I came back I just immediately grabbed my pants that were on the ground and said \"I think I am going to go.\" She responded with \"Seriously? Right after?\" I retorted with \"I didn't cum, so I think I should go.\" I never hesitated putting my clothes back on, I remembered where every article was and quickly made sure I retrieved everything. I asked if she was going to walk me to the door or stay in bed. She said she would walk me out, she grabbed a robe and walked me to the door. We exchanged an awkward hug kiss thing and I said bye and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I the asshole for getting myself out of a situation I no longer felt comfortable in?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr I had sex with a previous coworker, could not finish which made me uncomfortable. Because I was uncomfortable I left shortly after without much reason as to why.",

      "description": "I recently got engaged, and started to look into wedding dresses. On Wednesday I decided I wanted to start looking around for dresses I like, and I made an appointment at a wedding dress shop for the following day at 11am.\n     Now, the reason I wanted to go do this initially without a large family presence is because I have a somewhat difficult relationship with my family. My mom and gma specifically can be extremely opinionated, to the point where I feel like all they do is criticize me or talk about me behind my back. They have the attitude that you should always agree with their opinion, and dont really accept your opinion. My Fiance is often frustrated with them because he feels they are \"narcissitic\" and they cause me to feel very sad or negative about things that should be exciting. Because of this growing up, I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety. I felt that if I went with them and found a dress, they wouldn't like it or they would be very negative about it. This is what led to me wanting to try on different styles of dresses without them. I wanted to figure out what I like, not what THEY like. \n     I did ask my sister (my maid of honor) to come with me to the dress appointment, and I also let my mom know I was going. My sister said she wanted to go, but she had to work. However, she did not feel like going to work, so she asked me to type a message to her boss to get her out of work, which I refused to do. Since no one else was available, I just asked one of my future sisters-in-law to go because I knew she would be supportive. \n     I tried on 6 dresses of all different styles at this fitting, but I just fell in love with the second dress. I was not expecting to actually find \"the\" dress at this appointment, but it just kind of happened. My gma had previously offered to pay for my dress, so I called her to the store to see it. I also called my sister, who was supposed to be at work. Turns out she only went to work for 2 hours, and got home around the time my appointment started. It was minutes from our house, she knew I was there and had the option to come. I told her I found something and wanted her to look. She was visibly annoyed, but she came.  I tried on 2 more dresses with my gma and sister there that I let them pick out. After those, they did say they liked the dress I found, and my mother, whom I facetimed, said she loved the dress and thought I should get it.\n     My gma got the dress for me. She seemed a little sad, but was happy I was happy. My sister mentioned that she was kind of hurt that I chose to go with my fiance's sister instead of her because she would have liked to see me try on dresses. I feel like she had the choice to be there, but decided not to come. \n     Now I am feeling incredibly guilty and selfish for how everything played out. My fiance believes that I gave the opportunity to come and look at other dresses and its their own actions that made it so they were not there. So, Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "For reference, my parents always thaught me to be the one to be above something, for example when a conflict requires someone to step back and just let it go, or admit to be wrong or even apologize for something I did not do, to do it, just to avoid unnecessary conflict.\n\nBut that lead to the situation I am in at the moment, pretty much everyone just tramples on my opinion or similar, its like strangers kind of feel it that they can do that to me, cause i am expected to be the one to give in.\n\nBut after keeping shut about everything i felt was rude and not supporting my own opinions, i got soooo angry the last time something happenend and it all came out in a single burst of wrath.\n\nNow to that what happened: My Grandpa had birthday and invited me and my parents to a really good restaurant in range of their home. We drove to the restaurant, got our table and ordered drinks. Then the disaster happened: Our table was kind of small, and we are a large family (all of my uncles, aunts and so on were invited too) so we had to sit a bit wider to fit everyone of us to the table (note, the restaurant is a bit small too). Then some entitled bitch, lets call her Karen, came in with her younger sugarboy and her goddamn noisy rathound( or chihuaha or how you call them) to sit on the other table, back to back with me. (Note, she was fat, not chubby but fat) She sat down on the seat back to me, and needed more space to sit there, but she didn't ask me to make room for her, she just shoved the seat against my back till i made room myself (which i thought was rude) but i didn't react to that yet. When she finally got to sit in her seat, she shoved her seat against mine again, even though i had no place to make room anymore, but i even endured that one. But when she shived her arms violently against mine on MY! Armrest so she could reach her ratdog in her bag, i flipped.\n\nI stood up and asked her what the fuck she thinks she is doing, pushing me away without asking first and then just pushing back more for no reason whatsoever. Entitled Karen looked at me like:\" why is someone like you even talking to me\" which made me even angrier so i told her to back the hell away or something happens. With a big grunt of hers she moved her seat more to her table( she had more than enough room for her, even after that move) so i could sit comfortably again.\n\nMy parents looked at me like I just did the unthinkable. Why the hell am I supposed to make room for Karen even though I was there first(!!!), she was rude as hell and she didn't even need so much place to begin with!\n\n\nSo my question is, AITA?\n\n\nTl;Dr: Entitled Karen wanted more room than necessary on her table, even though I was there first and had no more room to make, so i flipped on her rude behavior (she didn't ask me to make room, she just physically pushed me to do it)\n\nSorry for my english, not a native speaker.",

      "description": "So this happened a few days ago and I'm trying to grapple with left over feelings. \n\nBackground: My partner and I had a few weeks break in the new year and had planned a semi-local two week trip. At the same time we planned for my parents to come for one of the weeks and are visiting from my home country. We planned to stay together and do activities in that time. My Mom generously said my Dad and her would cover things while we were together. Awesome. I'm super thankful for them doing this. So one of the days we finish a small fishing trip and some wine tasting and my partner and I had discussed maybe doing dinner just the two of us. I ask/let my Mom know that we wanted to have a dinner out, just the two of us and they are all sweet with it and say they're planning on eating in. Side note, my Dad still cooks like 6 people still live in a house so already on our holiday we have too much food. So we eventually find a place, order, eat and have some leftovers of a half n' half pizza. We end up going back to the AirBnb and I go to chill in the our room. My Mom comes in chewing on a piece of my partner's pizza and sits down on the bed staring at me. I kinda gave her this look to which she says something along the lines of \"What..why are you looking at me like that/what's the matter??\" I think I said something like \"Well, that's Dan's pizza... you should have asked.\" Immediately she gets angry/hurt/defensive, says something (can't remember), I respond then she leaves. Suddenly outside the room on the balcony I hear her talking quite upset to my partner about what I said.   \n\n\nDan didn't know at all what was going on. He had come out of the toilet and was having a smoke when she came up. (D for Dan, M for Mom)\n\nM: \"Sorry Dan I ate a piece of pizza, I hope thats fine\"\n\nD: \"Absolutely, not a problem, but I would liked to be asked in the future.\"\n\nM: \"Why?\"\n\nD: \"Its just common courtesy.\"\n\nM: \"But we've paid for everything. We've paid for the trip, accomodation, activities. I don't have to ask for a bit of pizza.\"\n\nD: \"Its still common courtesy to ask regardless of what has been done.\"\n\nM: \"Well I've given you all this and I expect the same in return.\"\n\nAt this point we were just trying to get across that common courtesy should be used no matter the case. We paid for the pizza and still may have wanted it, but were happy to share. We tried giving other examples but it boiled down to her believing/expectation that if she gives then she expects to receive no questions in return. We tried to explain that she made it seem like listing what they've paid for was more a gift with strings attached rather than an unconditional gift. We also said that while those might be her expectations, other people (like us) don't necessarily expect the same of others.\n\nIt ended with silence, in the morning it was the same and is still technically unresolved but I was left feeling like I wasn't wrong but guilty because she/my Dad had paid for everything. Reddit, am AITA somewhere in this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Mom and Dad paid for part of a two week trip we (including my partner) spent together. Mom got upset when I said she should have asked before taking a slice of pizza from our dinner out. My partner and I were just bringing up common courtesy while she felt that paying for accommodation, activities and groceries entitled her to a simple slice of pizza/not needing to ask. AITA for saying she should have just asked first.",

      "title": "AITA For not letting my little brother use my controller?",
      "description": "Okay so for context:  \nI'm a freshman in HS, and I have a little brother who we're gonna call \"Zam\" for this interaction because I don't want to put his name out on the internet, despite it being a very common one.\n\nSimply put, Zam is the kind of person to rage at video games. A lot. A few years ago when we used our PS3 a lot, he broke about 4 controllers in separate fits of rage, and during his fortnite addiction, I heard some loud banging from across the hallway. The next day, he started asking for my controller.\n\nThis controller is simply a wired Xbox controller made for people who want to play PC games using a controller but don't want to spend the 60 bucks on a wireless controller that I got for my birthday. I use this controller a lot for the sort of couch co-op or games that have very simple controls (Think GBA emulation, The Binding of Isaac, Super Treasure Arena, etc.).\n\nSo I say okay at first, but tell Zam he needs to save money up for a controller of his own. He says he will, and I'm alright with this deal.\n\nThat was three months ago, and he has yet to get a new controller, and I've heard him abuse mine more than once.\n\nEventually, I wanted to play some Isaac with my computer connected to the TV so I could sit on my bed while playing, and asked if I could use the controller once he was done with his round of fortnite. He muttered sure and continued playing. The round ends, and he doesn't give it back. Instead, he just queues up again. I tell him to give it back, and he says \"I just started this round, let me finish R\\*tard\". I'm livid at this point, so I unplug the controller, turn off the xbox, take the controller, and walk out of the room. (This was probably an overreaction, but he used R\\*tard specifically against me because I have Asperger's Syndrome). He calls me an asshole for doing that and he attempts to grab me and shove me against a wall. I shove him away, he stumbles, then he runs down to mom, crying, and tells her that I beat him up (He's 12, and he wasn't crying when he got stabbed by a fucking fish hook from his own stupidity). I got grounded for a week on account of \"Treating my brother like crap\", and he taunted me by using my controller the entire time I was grounded.\n\nI had enough, and I've taken it; every time he asks for it I say no.\n\nHe still insists I'm an ass for doing so, and that's the question: Am I The Asshole? I know this is really petty and all, but it would be nice to know.",

      "description": "My (35F) husband (37M) have been together for 10 years, married for 8. We have two kids. I'm pretty active on SM (mostly FB and IG), he posts on FB maybe once a year tops and on IG maybe once a month or so. Neither of us use Twitter or Snapchat. \n\nI have no issue with his SM usage except for one thing - he has never posted a picture of me. On FB he says he's married to me, but doesn't have a single post or picture of me on either account. It's about 50% our kids, 30% travels (either trips he's taken alone or with friends or us together), and 20% his work/friends. About 1/4 of all those pictures include him. Even his profile picture is from our wedding but it's just of him!\n\nWIBTA if I asked him to include a picture of me somewhere? I don't think I'm ugly or embarrassing to look at, and I don't need it to be a sappy post or anything like that. But like, if he's posting a picture of the kids at the zoo, why can't I be in that picture too? Or if we go on a trip somewhere, why not post a picture of all of us instead of just a landscape/the kids/him and the kids?\n\nIs that a weird request? Also, I post pictures of him maybe a few times a year and he has no issue with it. \n\nTLDR: Husband has never posted a pic of me on social media, WIBTA if I asked him to include me sometime?",
