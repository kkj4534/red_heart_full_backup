      "title": "AITA for not taking a dog that I was lied to about into my home?",
      "description": "I know this sounds much more simple in the title than it really is, but me and my girl friend feel like we’re going crazy.\n\nI’ve been with my girlfriend for a year and her, her mom, and her family have literally helped me out of such a deep situation. I love these people more than anything and I would do anything for them. \n\nThis morning, my girlfriend had a message from her mother asking (more so telling) us to pick up some stuff from a few different locations and to keep a dog for 2 weeks. We live in an apartment and can’t keep unregistered pets. After telling her that we had plans that would be derailed if we had to take care of a dog, and providing her with the reasons for why we were apprehensive, she wouldn’t take no for an answer. We hesitantly obliged because she’s done so much for us.\n\nWe get home with the dog hours later believing it was house trained and come to find out, it has fleas, and her mother knew. She gave the dog a flea bath that morning and a flea pill, but it was still scratching and its cage and bed hadn’t been washed. We also have a cat which I would rather not have getting fleas on top of our house becoming infested. Then, we go into the bed room to find the dog had peed on the bed. And the shower mat. And the entire, carpeted floor leading to those spots. I had just walked the dog before the car ride, which was to be fair, over an hour long. But we had previously been told it was used to being created for 12 hours and WOULD NOT go in the house.\n\nHer mother is now slightly perturbed that we want to bring the dog back to her so that we don’t risk our apartment being ruined. AITA?\n\nSorry for any errors, I’m on mobile.",

      "description": "Before I go into the story, here's  a little context.  I found a group of people on my PS4 that I've started to play with a lot recently, and I had invited a friend I knew in real life, let's call him Josh, to our group.  I've known Josh for a few years, and he's been an alright guy, but could get very negative at times.  So here's the story.\n\nOur group, including myself, were playing a game when Josh joined our party.  Everything was fine until about 5 minutes after we started playing, when Josh started to insult me by saying \"No wonder they asked me to play, you're complete ass\" and \"No surprise you got left out of our team\", since there could only be 3 people on a team and there were 4 of us.  Josh went on for a few more minutes, cracking more trash talk on that level, when I snapped at him and told him to stop talking trash and to shut up.  After every game they played for about 45 minutes, I'd ask who I would switch out with in the group, and Josh would either outright ignore me or tell me he didn't know or care.  After that 45 minutes or so, I told him to stop wasting my time and asked if he could swap out for me.  He only continued to talk trash to me, and I told him that I couldn't take anymore of his trash talk, since at that point the entire night was ruined for me because of the negativity that already happened.  He laughed at me and told me to \"man up\", and to stop being a pussy.  I kept trying to tell him I don't want him to talk that way to me anymore, but he just kept calling me a crybaby and to man up.  At that point, I just told him to f**k off and to stop talking to me anymore.  He then told me his trash talk was \"Just a joke\", but how could it be funny if nobody laughed or liked it?  At that point I just got off, and afterwards one of my teammates messaged me to apologize for his behavior and how he acted.\n\nAITA for the way I reacted to Josh and his trash talk?",

      "description": "A few weeks ago my roommate and I drove to Chicago for St. Patrick's Day. Usually for these trips, I would split the cost of gas with him, because he uses his car and it wouldn't be fair to ask him to front the cost of gas. We try to split everything and be as fair as possible. During the day, he told me that a friend of his was flying in from O'Hare Airport and wanted a ride from there back to our school, and if he gave her a ride then she would pay for gas.\n\nSo, his friend paid for the gas and tolls and we all drove back together. I thought that that meant the expense was taken care of, but he told me that I still need to pay for half the gas, even though his friend covered the entire thing herself. I told him that that didn't make sense cause neither of us put any money in so there was no cost to split, her friend covered the whole thing. He told me if it weren't for her then I would have had to pay so it's only fair if I still give my half. We changed the subject and I thought he forgot about the whole thing until today when in the middle of the day I saw he put in the cost of gas and tolls into the splitter app that we had.\n\nI suspect that this is happening because he just ran out of all his spending money from his summer job, and he also currently owes me $40 total so he can't really pay me back. I've also been able to get gift cards from my parents that we used to buy things for our room, and I never tried to still charge him half the cost of these items, since I thought if we managed to get a deal on something then we both share the benefit of saved money. I have a job I work on campus for spending money so I also could really easily eat the cost of this, it's just the principle of it that bothers me. If he told me at the end of the school year that he couldn't afford to pay me back, I would happily forget about whatever he owes me, but this just feels like he's trying to rip me off.\n\nHe's always been a really honest and straightforward guy, so I'm just trying to see if I'm missing something or wrong about this. Am I the asshole if I explain again why I think this is unfair and refuse to pay half the cost of gas, or should I just drop it?\n\n**tl;dr** Roommate and I usually split the cost of things. He got his friend to pay for gas for a trip but still wants me to pay \"my half\" of the cost of the gas. I don't think this is fair. Am I the asshole if I refuse to pay this?",

      "description": "Ok, so this is my first post here and really my first major post of any kind on Reddit. Here goes....\n\nAt the beginning of February I started seeing this lovely lady that I had met on a dating website. We talked for a few days and we got along great and had plenty to talk about. We spent time with each other several times a week and things were going great. \n\nAt the beginning of March I caught the flu. She came over, took care of me, I was very appreciative of her. For some reason, she wanted to have sex. Why she wanted to while I was feeling like I was on the verge of death of beyond me. Being the person I am, and wanting to cater to my partners every want and need, I said sure. So we’re in the middle of this and I can’t get it up. I’ve never had a problem with ED and I chock it up to being sick and medicated. This made her very upset. She told me that she couldn’t do this and left right then and there. Needless to say, I was pretty confused and hurt.\n\nA couple of days go by and we’re having lunch and she tells me that thats just not something we should cope with but she really wants to be friends. I think what she did was pretty shitty but I still want her. I tell her that I can’t be friends with her because I don’t wanna be around someone that I want that doesn’t want me. I tell her that maybe after some time has passed we can say hello again and be friends. Apparently this makes me a giant asshole in her eyes and every time she sees me I get a death glare (we don’t work together but we run into each other from time to time just because of our proximity to each other).  I call her by her proper name (Ms Lastname), I say hello, treat her as any normal person would treat another but I don’t engage. I treat it as it never happened. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Ok so I've been talking to this girl on and off for a while. But recently in the last couple months we've been talking a lot and started hanging out and I started to really like her. I've asked her out on dates jokingly a bunch of times I just wanted to do the actual asking out in person. But then after almost 2 months of me constantly asking her out and she keeps on dodging saying she's got work and other plans I got a little fed up. Cause I mean she can find time to visit her ex boyfriend who's in jail but cant make an hour or two in the day for me? I mean it's obvious she doesn't like me right? But she is also texting me and sending snaps all the time and I know she talks to me more than anyone. So a couple days ago after she said no again I told her how I felt and how I wanted more from her. She gave the same excuse of oh she likes talking and hanging out with me but shes busy but also said that shes really sad and has no motivation and doesn't have time for personal relationships. When I said it's not fair for her to want me to keep talking to her when I want to date her she says she \"understands and respects that\". So we kinda left it at that and I haven't talked to her since. \n\nSo am I the asshole for asking her out even though she is going through something? Or was she just stringing me along cause she wanted the attention and gave a generic excuse cause she doesn't wanna go out with me? Should I keep talking to her and help her through the tough times with no expectations? I'm really torn and could use an outside perspective. Thanks",

      "description": "I was doing homework with my girlfriend one evening, we had separate subjects to focus on so it was mostly silent between us. I got a text from a friend of mine about something personal to them. I'm typically their only outlet for stress and advice, and this time happened to be more serious than incidents in the past. My girlfriend doesn't know this person, only hearing about them occasionally.\n\nI replied back giving my advice and went back to my work. My girlfriend then asked what it was about and I didn't say anything aside from that it wasn't about either of us, just their own issue. She got upset about that, saying \"best friends (or gf/bf) share everything with each other, especially if they don't know the other person, since they can't do anything about it\"\n\nI disagreed with this idea, I felt the friend in question only trusted me, not my gf, and that trust shouldn't have been violated. She left shortly after clearly still upset. My gf and I typically share a good level of trust with one another so I don't think she was insinuating anything else by her statement.\n\nSo Reddit, Am I the asshole for not sharing my friend's story with her?",

      "description": "I’m on mobile just FYI. \n\nI’m a M (28) and I had just gotten into a relationship with a F (21) and I thought things were great but apparently I’m an asshole for hiding my age. \n\nBackstory: \nI’m 28 and decided to go back to school to finish my degree. One of my classes required a group paper to be turned in at the end of the semester so at the start of the semester the professor assigned us random groups. I got paired with 3 girls. We get along great and everyone is actually pulling their weight in the group. We have a group chat set up and every time we meet up to discuss the paper everyone usually shows up. Eventually I notice a girl there, the girl in question, was flirting with me a lot. Let’s call her Kat. \n\nThe story:\nOne of the girls there let’s call her “Becky” is a bit of a party animal and she had invited us to a house party her BF was throwing. We all said we’d go. I got there around 11 and Kat showed up later around 2:30. I assume she was bar hoping. She had walked in with her friends and as soon as she saw me she headed straight for me. I’m not use to women going after me because I’m average looking at best but it felt nice. We hit it off and ended up sleeping together that night. The next week we were always together and it was heaven. \n\nWell one day we were talking about high school and she, out of curiosity, asked me when I graduated. I told her 2009 and she looked shocked. She made up a reason on why she had leave abruptly and I was left confused and alone on my couch. Such is life. Anyways I texted her later that night to ask if we were good and after an hour of waiting she sent me a message that basically said she wanted to go back to just being friends because I lied about my age to her and she didn’t want to be with an older person. Honestly I never lied to her The subject just never came up. The only reason I knew how old she was is because her 21st was in February. It never occurred to me that my age would bother her, after all we got along so well. \n\nHonestly that hurt like hell. First time I’ve ever been rejected because of my age. So am I the asshole for not telling her how old I was before we got together?\n\nTl;dr: Girl I dated for a week never asked how old I was and when she found out broke up with me. \n\n",

      "description": "A little background, I was never really into sports until my 30's. My friends have been their whole lives, so there's a stigma of me not knowing anything.\n\nI'm in a group chat, friend A text a pic of his parlay for nfl playoffs. Friend B says \"I'm not big on the rams\". Friend C says \"cuz it's gonna rain\"? I type \"lol yea\". They're a fair weather team so it made me laugh. \n\nFriend A text \"the F do you know?\" to me. I said their play has been questionable last 5-6 weeks of the season and if they can't get their run game together, Goff can't save them. Friend A says \"wow, we got Romo here\". Everyone laughs. Now I'm starting to get piss. Not because of trash talk but because he's not saying anything to friends B and C for questioning his pick. Once again I feel like I'm getting singling me out. It almost like they act like I'm not a man because I don't know enough about sports. I know more than the casual fan but not in their eyes. \n\nThere's a lot of back and forth through out the day. They think I'm just talking trash. I finally told them I was really pissed and watch out they next time they need help fixing shit in their house and buying tech stuff. I'm really handy in those areas so they're always asking for my advice. They don't know the difference between a hammer and a nail. \n\nI think what made it worse was when I told them that they may not realize but they're always degrading me because I don't know as much sports. Friend A said \" we're just joking\". I said doesn't look like it because you didn't say anything to the two other guys and they're the ones that questioned your pick. \n\nFriend A said sorry and he won't bring up sports if it makes me feel bad. I said sorry for overreacting and that we should be able to say anything we want to each other. I did it to calm the situation more than I was really sorry because I really did felt like it was unwarranted since I didn't questioned his pick and he insulted me. \n\n\nThings haven't been the same since. Friend A isn't really talking to me anymore. Was I being too sensitive? \n\nTLDR, told my friends off for insulting my lack of sports knowledge. Was I being sensitive or are they snobs?\n",

      "description": "So this happened last week and I’m still bewildered by it. \n\nWe went to the Elton John concert at Madison Square Garden. It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe’re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they’re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton’s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt’s an Elton John concert. True, it’s not the kind of music that you’d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn’t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n",

      "description": "GF works an evening shift and gets off work at 10pm. We only have one car, which I use for commuting. GF takes transit to work, but since I'm a 9-5 job I can always pick her up at 10. Recently one of her coworkers, a lady in her 50's, has starting asking for rides home with us. She lives fairly close to us, about 5 mins out of our way. Dropping her off makes our 15 min trip home about 20 mins. \n\nOnto the issue. I did not mind giving her a lift the first couple times. I just figured she was stuck without a ride, so I was happy to help. I bet you can guess what has happened. She now asks for a ride anytime she works same shift as my GF (a few nights a week). Again, this would be fine if she was a friend of my GF's, but I asked her about it and she says that the lady who needs rides only ever started talking to her when she found out we live near her. She also only talks to my GF at work to ask for a ride. They are not even what you would call work friends. My GF says she even feels a bit used, but is too nice to say anything. One of her actual friends at work told her another lady used to give her coworker a ride before she moved, and she felt used as well. \n\nCoworker has never offered gas money or any thing else for the ride. For comparison, we give GF's friend a ride home once and while and she will always bring in some food or snacks to share with GF while they work. We never mind giving her a lift because we can tell she appreciates it, and she's a friend. \n\nIt's also not like the coworker in question is trapped without us. There is public transit, and she lives with her daughter, son in law, and a friend who all drive. She also has a BF. Whenever we drop her off at home there are always 3 cars in her driveway. Why can't any of them ever pick her up? Maybe even offer my GF a ride home with them to save me a trip? \n\nAITA for feeling sour about this? ",

      "description": "This is probably a weird one lol but I actually got some really helpful feedback last time I posted here, so I wanted to try it again. \n\nI just had a baby on Feb 8th. She came via a scheduled c section and was a little over 3 weeks early. I always planned to breastfeed for at least a month because of the medicine I'm on. It would help keep her from having any withdrawal symptoms, which it did. \n\nThe reason we had to take her early is because I had an umbilical cord aneurysm, which is an extremely rare and dangerous condition, and she was smaller than she should be. She was measuring about 2-3 weeks behind what her gestational age was. So, I had her and she was tiny, 5 pounds 4 ounces, but otherwise healthy. I have tried breastfeeding 3 out of 4 of my kids and I always end up supplementing because I don't make enough milk. With my girl being so small, the Drs recommended supplementing with formula anyways, to help her gain weight. She's a little over a month now and weighs 7 pounds. \n\nNow here's the thing, I hate breastfeeding. It's time consuming, its uncomfortable, it's sweet and a great bonding experience sometimes when she actually latches on, but she's not great at that likely because of her being premature, so I have to pump. I don't make a lot of milk at all. I make maybe 5 ounces a day. And that's if I pump consistently every couple of hours. Pumping takes about 20 minutes each time. \n\nSo, even though I know breastmilk is better as far as nutrition and all that, I want to quit. I feel like it takes up so much of my day and for very little payoff. I'd rather spend that time with my kids or snuggling my girl. So, would I be an asshole? ",

We moved to another state &amp; away from all of our family &amp; friends on the idea that he would have a job where he'd only travel 30% of the time and take a significant pay increase (from \\~90k to over 115k per year). His previous job (in Pennsylvania) had him traveling Mon - Friday EVERY week, with maybe 2-3 business days at home if we were lucky. This seemed like a big improvement. It's also a nice city. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy job lets me work from home as long as I'm putting in 40 hours per week, and I have to travel about once or twice per month (no more than 2 trips of 2-3 days each). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he took the new job, his company paid our moving expenses, so that meant he \\*\\*had\\*\\* to stay or we'd have to repay $20,000 in expenses. However, both his travel and compensation haven't been what he was promised. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis travel has consistently been at 70+%. This has been \\*so difficult\\* for me, at first because I was pregnant, and now because I'm essentially single-parenting our kid. I love my daughter, but I struggled way longer than I should've with PPD because I had no support system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband says that there are plenty of people out there who are single parents with less money, and that his job is supposed to be easing up on travel for the rest of the year. He's told me that I'm just weak for being frustrated with him being gone, and that I'm nagging him about quitting when his job makes us way more money than mine does. He says I should just focus on losing weight and making friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor context, he was gone 4 weeks in January, at least 50% of February and March, and now is gone all of April. When he's gone for these huge stretches, it also means I CAN'T travel for my job, which makes me look bad in front of my boss. I've tried to get him to commit to not going on a trip if I already has one scheduled, and he's said he 'can't promise anything'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the other big problem is that this just isn't the life I want. I love my husband and even though we have our issues I want us to be together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe keep fighting about this and he says I'm an asshole for harping on this constantly. So, reddit, AITA for complaining about my husband's travel job and do I just need to suck it up?",

      "description": "Hi all, a little backstory; We are both 18, her family are quite close knit and share home-cooked family meals every night.\n\nI started seriously going to the gym and eating right after being tired of being skinny for the past year or so and wanted to change. My girlfriend did the same although she said she wanted to lose weight (she's honestly gorgeous and I cannot for the life of me fathom why she would want to lose weight) but I said I'd help her out and support her (this was about 3 months into my own training). FFW to today, it's been about 4 months and I had sent out my scales as my snapchat streaks, I had just hit 64KG which I'm happy with. I asked her about her own weight and such and she said to me that she hadn't lost any and had in fact gained some. I asked how many calories she is on per day and she told me around 1200, I track my calories and macros to a T and she had told me she'd been doing the same, I asked to see and she showed me a 1200 calorie MyFitnessPal screen with food she had eaten. This is where an eyebrow was raised. I told her that if she was to lose weight it was as simple as burning more calories than she gains and that 1200 calories is too little for her to even function correctly, let alone gain weight. She said she swears by that, I asked had she been tracking these home-cooked meals correctly as I know how difficult they can be to keep track of, she swears she has been doing that correctly as well. This is where I will admit I got a little annoyed, I hate people not just being truthful with me. I told her that she is either not counting every correctly and quite drastically incorrect in fact, or that she is lying to herself and complaining at a lack of results. I could've continued but I began to feel bad as if I was berating her. She is now not happy with me and although I do want to apologise, I don't even know what I'd say. \"I'm sorry you must just have no metabolic rate\"?? I have apologised for the way in which I said it, but she told me it sounded like I was telling her \"she's not doing good enough\". \n\nI don't know what else to really say. Am I genuinely in the wrong here or did I just handle it poorly?",

      "description": " I (19M) still havn't decided if I'm going to go to Thanksgiving tonight or not. So a bit of back story is this.\n\nThe day I turned 18yo I moved away for a job I had lined up. A few months back I moved back to my home town after a little over a year of not seeing my family at all only phone calls with my mom and aunt. When I got back I reconnected with my family and some old friends. I was living with my mom again and staying 1 or 2 days a week at my aunts farm. My aunt has 4 grandkids she have custody of. 3 boys (17, 14, and 12yo) and 1 girl (12yo). I really enjoy spending time with all of them after such a long time not seeing them. I work A LOT and spend most my days off either at my aunts or at friends. Me and the 17yo was super close growing up and we reconnected very fast. We have became like best friends again, like when we was a bit younger. During this time I also realized that the 12yo girl is a lot like me. Her, the 17yo, and I started hanging out a lot at my aunts farm. It got to the point where she would follow us around when we fed the animals or ride the 4-wheelers and Dirt bikes, and I was fine with it because she was a cool little buddy to have around. I'm pretty sure she has some abandonment issues due to her parents running out on her when she was just born, so she is very clingy and literally wants me around her 24/7. She is also the type of kid that is very cuddly, while we watch YouTube or something on my phone she will lay her head on my shoulder, she will lay her feet across my lap while laying on the couch, she will try to sit on my lap and I normally tell her to get down because it just feels weird. You know that kinda stuff but she does it with pretty much every adult she is around.\n\nWell last Sunday I was staying at my aunts and the 14yo and 12yo boys was gone to there real mothers house, it was just my aunt, the 17yo, her, and me. I get a phone call from my mother who tells me I need to leave because her thinks there is some inappropriate stuff going on between me and my cousin. I tell her there isn't nothing going on and how it is fucked up that my mother would even think something like that. I stay that night, but during the night i can hear my mom on the phone with my aunt. They are talking about me, and my mom is telling her the same thing she told me. The next morning my aunt is acting very weird every time I get near my 12yo cousin. She wouldn't let my cousin go anywhere on the farm with me or the 17yo cousin. My 17yo cousin says he is going to drive to McDonalds and grab us all something to eat. All 3 of us was watching a movie before he said he was going to leave to get food. So me and the 12yo was going to stay there and finish watching the movie. My aunt starts screaming at me about how I need to go with him and I can't be alone with 12yo cousin, telling me if I don't go with him I can just go home. My 12yo cousin was sitting next to me during this and started tearing up. It made me feel horrible and like I was a piece of shit for spending time with my cousins.\n\nWell since that day I been ignoreing all my mother and aunts phone calls. Spending all my time at friends house except one day where i avoided going home for as long as I could then just went home didn't say anything and went to bed. I'm unbelievable hurt that my aunt and mother would think I would do something like this. I don't feel welcomed in my moms or aunts house any more. Now they are both confused texting me things like \"whats wrong, you aint' been acting like yourself\" They sent a text about what time Thanksgiving was and I sent one back saying \" idk if I'm coming yet\" and now they are pissed at me for not wanting to go. The only thing that makes me want to go is cousins. I don't want them to think I don't want to be around them anymore. But I can't bare to be in a room with my Mom or Aunt. I feel deeply hurt by them thinking I would ever do something like that, it makes it a lot worse by them acting like they don't know what is wrong with me. So I just been ignoring them and avoiding going around them.\n\nI know it will hurt all 4 of my cousins feelings if I don't show up for Thanksgiving because I am the only other family they have beside my mom and dad. They won't understand why I don't show up, all they will think is that I don't want to be around them.",

      "description": "First off I'm in High School, we are both 17 and are seniors at the same school we'll call her Taylor.\n\nWe became friends about a year ago when we were in the same friend group. We connected over mental illness as we both have depression and we made a commitment early on to be there for each other if anything happens. We both went through breakups where we would see each other often and this is when I started having feelings for her. She explicitly told me that she likes me and is beginning to have feelings for me, so I'm stoked. Being close was something that always calmed us down and got rid of any anxieties. The problem is we became close before her and her boyfriend (my best friend) broke up. He knew about it immediately and we both said that we would stop. We never did. Fast forward past the end of their relationship and Taylor and I still hang out all the time. We'd lay with each other, kiss, etc. it was about whatever made us happy. This lasted maybe two months. Then I am told about another guy she has hung out with. At first I was fine with it because I knew I couldn't be in a relationship with my best friends ex anyway and it's not like we have had sex or anything I thought at that point she didn't owe me anything, but then something shifted. She was unavailable when I needed someone to be around. On New Years Eve she invited me to her house because I had told her I didn't have any plans, but when I got there there was a guy who I hadn't seen before sitting where I sit. She invited me and the guy she has been ditching me for. I settle in for a night of being uncomfortable around one of her friends who doesn't interact with anyone, but Taylor, and a guy who I had never met before. After playing a card game on the floor everyone got on the couch and immediately Taylor's head is on this guys shoulder. This is where it began to hurt. I tried not showing how sad I was by pretending to be asleep, but when midnight hit they kissed. I wanted to cry, but obviously couldn't.\n\nFast forward again to a few days ago and I am invited to her house after school and I head over. She lays on top of me and I am happy, I forgot all about the guy from NYE. Then after about an hour of being with each other she asks me to leave because she is sad. This is where my red alert came in. She never has asked me to leave because she was sad, it has always been the opposite of going to her when she was sad. I'm not going to argue though so I say goodbye get into my car and go around the corner for not even five minutes just to see a blue mustang pulls up and out hops the guy from NYE. My heart sunk. My mouth tasted sour and I sat and cried for half an hour.\n\nI called her out on it and she came up with the excuse of \"I was actually sad, he just decided to come over.\" Like I am some kind of moron who doesn't understand when I am being used. And like I get we have never been more than friends officially, she doesn't need to be telling me every time she hangs out with another person it just feels super bad, because when I am around her I am extremely happy, but I cry almost every time I leave. It makes me want to stop interacting with her because she is starting to treat me like shit.\n\nWIBTA If I ghosted her because she continues to see people, even if she helped me a lot through a really hard time. Or am I just a stupid kid who needs to get that what we had isn't what I thought it was.",

Most of that time our friendship was fine, up until he left for Thailand for a few months three years ago.\n\nWhen he came back he was really depressed but refused to seek medical or therapeutical help, everytime I told him to, since I suffered from depression as well and being on meds helped me.\nHis depression made him avoid his old friends, so over time he ended up with only me, which I guess is why he fell in love with me. \n\nFrom the beginning I was refusing, since I wasn't interested in him romantically yet he would push on and on, to the point of me being scared of him.

      "description": "On mobile, apologies for formatting issues. Also, tldr at bottom.\n\nI've lived with her for five months on residence at school. There's three of us living together. In our suite we each have our own bedrooms and share a kitchen, living room, and bathroom. \n\nI'll state right off the bat that she's an international student from India and I've lived in Canada my whole life, and don't really know about Indian culture. I understand that there's definitely going to be cultural differences and I respect that, but I dunno man. What gets me about her is that she doesn't do anything for our apartment, and then lies about it. \n\nWe wrote and signed our roommate agreement last semester, which included a weekly-ish cleaning schedule for common areas on monthly rotation, an agreement that we'd each take turns taking out the garbage/recycling, and that we could share things like appliances, dish soap, etc (and agreed to share those expenses). The cleaning schedule would rotate us through shower/floors, toilet/sinks, kitchen, and we'd share the living room.\n\nIn these five months, she cleaned the kitchen once. That's it. We can obviously tell when she doesn't do her assigned chore because whatever it is will be dirty, and she's also the one who by far causes the most mess, especially while cooking and tracking rocks all over the carpet. Then we'll ask her to clean up and she'll say she already did. We say we can see that she didn't and she'll say that she'll just do it again, which she then clearly never does. I'll leave notes for her as reminders and she just throws them away.\n\nSome examples.\nShe will take our broom and sweep the crap from her carpeted room into our capteted hallway and leave it there. She vaccuumed her room the other day and then stood in the living room with the vacuum on for 5 minutes and didn't vacuum up any of the million rocks at the entrance and hallway. She spits all over the sink faucet and mirror when brushing her teeth. She left period blood smears on the toilet seat and toilet paper.\n\nShe also has not helped pay for anything that she uses. Refused to pitch in for our shared vacuum and microwave. Doesn't buy dish soap or sponges but uses mine.\n\nAnd - just a personal note, nothing to do with her irresponsibility - she smells so bad. I understand that this might sound bad on my part and I'm trying to be understanding/sensitive about it, but literally the strongest BO I've ever epxerienced. We can smell her trail wherever she goes in the apartment. Once a friend of mine was on a trip with her and she fell asleep on him on the bus and he said he had to wash his jacket to get her BO out of it.\n\nNow, I've had other bad roommates in the past, but she really takes the cake. I have argued with her over things in thr past because she insists she does nothing wrong. I'd expect more from a 24 year old master's student.\n\nWe spoke with our RAs last semester and they basically said that they can't do anything other than talk it out with her unless we feel a risk to our safety, and we know that a chat won't change her ways. So the other roommate and I just do her cleaning for her when we get too fed up with trying to get her to do what she agreed to.\n\nTLDR: Roommate always says she didn't make the messes (which she did) or says she did her cleaning (which she didn't). Major BO. Doesn't pitch in for anything. She's from India and I'm trying to be sensitive of cultural differences but just can't deal with her shit. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Title says it all. I was in my last year at school and what started as a hook up with a girl turned into something that last an entire year. We were inseparable and definitely loved each other. But the entire time she had a long distance boyfriend which she justified keeping because at the end of the year, I was graduating and moving across the world, so there was no change of a serious relationship with me ever developing.\n\nSo we ended things by me moving across the world for a year but now I'm back and living ~1 hr plane ride away from her. Her hometown is where I live now and we reconnected a few months ago. Basically, for Thanksgiving and now Christmas/New Year's, she's been in town and we've been hooking up like crazy. The chemistry is there and so are all the emotions too. She broke up with her boyfriend a few months ago and wants to try doing long distance with me now. \n\nThere's no doubt I love her and I accept responsibility that I bare a burden of the blame because I was complicit in her cheating. At the same time, I don't think I could ever trust her. \"You lose her how you win her\" I've read all over the Internet. AITA for cheating with someone and then using that as the basis for not wanting to be in a relationship with them?",

      "description": "Okay so here it is. About a month ago I saw my favorite hockey team was playing in Detroit on Feb 17th. My best friend, Brad, who live 3 hours from me and 3 hours from Detroit had the idea to go to the game with my fiancee and me, as she is as big a hockey fan as I am. I agree and we make plans to go.\n\n After some time had passed, let's say a week ago, Brad text me a series of messages asking me if it would be alright if we go to the game just the two of us as a sort of \"guys night\" now I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss those days, but I love my fiancee and dont ever have the feeling of not wanting her to join me for anything. \n\n Reluctantly, I agreed to ask if she would mind staying with Brad's girlfriend and 2 year old son while I went to the game. She got upset the first day then the next day she said \"if you can afford it you can have your \"man-date\"\"now mind you I dont own a car, we both use hers so it's really me asking \"hey can I borrow your car to go to a hockey game while you hang out with a baby?\" \n\n Fast forward to yesterday and I see the weather is calling for snow all day in chacago and auburn, where he lives. My fiancee drives a Hyundai Veloster and if you dont know what that is, it's a 3 door, 2 wheel drive, lowered car with street slicks as stock tires. Not very ideal in long drives with snow. \n\n I call brad last night to speak to him about possibly not going if she doesn't want me driving in her car, alone for that long in snow. I'm immediately met with resistance as he doesn't think it'll be bad for me to drive.  I explain that even though we made the plans a long time ago and I fully plan on going if the roads are fine but it's also not my car and its ultimately her decision. So we agree to get some sleep and check in the morning.\n\n As I woke up this morning I see a light coating of snow and there doesn't seem to be a any coming down. I speak with my fiancee about going and she is reluctant as before because sure while it's not snowing now it may be later and could get worse for the car, also we went to Detroit l last year and nearly destroyed our rim in a pot hole so it's really not ideal.\n\n She ultimately decides she doesn't want me driving and after talking with her it's the right idea. Now, I've been friends with Brad for 15 years, we moved from Alaska to Illinois together, hes my best friend and I know he'll understand.\n\n As soon as I tell him that I can't go he launches into a tirade of \"you're really going to do this to me?\" And \"we had plans, the roads aren't that bad, stop being a pussy.\" \n\nI've been laying in bed for the last hour thinking about this whole situation and writing this out. So based on everything, AITA?\n\nTL;DR\nHad plans to drive 6 hours to a hockey game, snow happens, I cancel and friend gets mad. \n",

They really only allowed slight affection or they'd shrug it away and at that point it kind of just left me starved of affection or however else you would put it, I'm not sure how to word it. \n\nI went out with some friends and met a guy in the bar we were at for a simple get together. Nothing overly special happened then and I took his number with me nonetheless, he was insistent and I didn't exactly want to start anything so I took it, not exactly expecting to use it. \n\nOne night, after an argument with my partner and over frustration and loneliness I texted him and we arranged something and for me to come over to his apartment. When I came out of it, I only felt a little bad, I just felt like I had finally had romantic attention that time for the first in a long while. \n\nDoes this make me a terrible person?

      "description": "Sorry for any problems with formatting, this is my first time posting on this reddit and I'm on mobile.\n\nThis has all happened within the last 24 hours, and I need to get it off my chest.\n\nI'm a 19 year old girl who still lives with her parents and has no curfew. Yesterday I spent the evening out with my friends. At around 9:30, we sat down at a McDonald's and got to talking and lost track of time. At around 10:30, I realized it was too late for my mom to be up (she wakes up around 5:45-7:00, and goes to bed around 10.) I asked my friend if it was ok if I stayed at her place, and before I could let my mom know, she texted me. She was asking if we were done shopping yet, which I told her we weren't, and then I told her that my friend said it was ok to stay at hers. My mom argues with me, telling me I should just come home, that it's too late to be doing this. My friend is exhausted, and is worried about how she can get us home safely in her condition (I live on the other side of town from my friends.) Mind you, its closing in on 11 now. It ends with my mother telling me to make a desicion, and getting pissed at me for making the choice that would probably have been the safest for me.\n\nThere has been another incident like this, (however, I was still at home), I had stayed up past midnight working on something and was too afraid to go to my room to sleep. We have 4 dogs, one of which will bark at just about anything that moves, so if I went past my moms door, the dog would wake her up. My mom is someone who seems to get mad at me for anything, and has gotten mad at me for waking her up like that before. (Including one time where the dog she shares a bed with jumped down and scared her awake while I was working on homework in my bedroom, and she yelled at me for not putting it away, even though the dog doesnt have a pin or anything. She didnt apologize either.)\n\nThat night at my friends house, I cried in my friends arms because this is actually a normal occurrence (not staying out so late, but her saying I'm inconsiderate and prioritizing friends over family) and I nearly had a panic attack two times that night. My therapist and I have discovered that a majority of my mental health issues come from her.\n\nMy mom is basically ignoring me (kinda) after telling me I didn't consider my family, and how I dont prioritize my family anymore, that my friends come first, she left the house with my sister, who at the time isn't saying alot to me aside from short sentences. But I had considered my family and figured out an alternative. My friends are on my side, saying that what I did was considerate, and that my mom is just a helicopter parent.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation??",

      "description": "So I work at a 7/11 3rd shift we aren't suppose to let people in the restroom from 10pm and 6am except officers and for our use. I keep getting written up multiple times for letting people use the restroom even though I dont give anyone a key and it's my co worker who does it. I've told my manager countless times who is doing it and he said \"it doesnt matter just dont do it\". \n\nOne time I got written up because a drunk girl stole a sandwich asked Him for the key, half ate the sandwich leaving it on the floor, piss all over the floor. I stayed overnight and he left around 12 and guess who got blamed when the manager came to see in the morning? \n\nToday there are signs saying restrooms out of order. Even more of a reason not to let people in! He gave the keys to 4 customers in the past hour while I've already been on shift the past 4 hours and let no one in. I took the keys from two seperate parties and said the bathroom is out of order since no one reads signs on the door anyways. I do my rounds and see that in the women's restroom there's piss and liquid shit all over the fucking floor. I call him over and he says, \"Its not that bad\" and it set me off. I said, \"Do you know how to follow fucking directions?? This is the thi-\" \n\nHe tries to mad dog me saying, \"Ayy watch your fucking mouth with me or-\" \n\n\"Or what R?? Beat me up while you're on parole? Cameras are fucking everywhere and you wont fucking do shit! Now I have to clean up your mess again!\"\n\n\"I got it do-\"\n\n\"Like last time with the sandwich huh??\" I slammed the bathroom door and start cleaning. Let me tell you, cleaning up human feces isn't the easiest... \n\nAm I the asshole for yelling at him? Should I apologize for it as well?",

      "description": "Basically, we were arguing about where to go shopping. I wanted to go to a big city, and it would involve public transport, while she wanted to go to our city, wich meant we would go walking. At one point she told me that we should go where she wanted if only in order for me to exercise, as I'm putting on weight and I'm flabby.\n\n I have suffered from anorexia for years and began my recovery a few months ago. I am still underweight, but I put on a lot of weight and I feel uncomfortable with my body (for the record, I'm in therapy). I felt fat and ugly and stupid and triggered. \n\nThen I did a bad thing. She suffers from severe acne and she is really insecure because of it. I told her that my body shape was not her business as her skin was not mine, and that her skin was much worse to the eye than a little flabbiness. She burst out crying and called me out for it with our parents. They were furious and punished me taking away my pocket money, saying that I shouldn't have replied.\n\nSo, AITA? ",

Only one of the families is religious, but I don’t feel comfortable going over to any of their houses. \n\nFriends A’s parents are religious, and they say that being lesbian is a sin, and that I should eat animal-based products because God made them for a reason. Friend A got mad when I said I wasn’t conforbale around her parents, and she accused me of “being selfish and hating those who don’t see the same as you”. \n\nFriend B’s parents think being lesbian will harm society because we can’t have children “normally”. They think vegans are ignoring “life’s natural processes”. Friend B says that I should respect their views and that I need to “get over myself”. \n\nFriend C’s family thinks that I try to “force [my] lesbian and veganism on others”. I have never once mentioned that they, or anybody for that matter, should change their lifestyle based on my personal views. Friend C says that she understands why I am upset and she’s willing to talk to her parents.

      "description": "My MIL is a horrible beast. She is the epitome of “pity party, poor me, the world revolves around me” type of person. She literally lives 4 minutes away from us, but has seen her grandson once in the last 6 months. She’s also the type to post on Facebook those dumb-ass “I love being a grandma, my grandchild is my life” memes, when she clearly has no desire to see him. I a, constantly reaching out to her, asking if she wants to come over for dinner, asking if she wants watch the baby for a couple hours to help my husband and I out. It’s always no, she’s busy, her back hurts, her best friend just got cancer, she got into a motorcycle accident (which did happen, but fuck her), there is always an excuse. \n\nSo yesterday I decided to reach out one more time. I asked her if she could watch the baby for a couple of hours next Friday so my husband and I could go out to dinner for my birthday. She read it but never replied, I sent her a question mark today and she replied with “I don’t want to make plans Incase something comes up”. I was really confused for a second and sent “what do you mean?” And her response was, “I might be going to a bonfire next weekend and my back hurts.” I literally saw red, I was so unbelievably pissed at her. She never ever helps me with my son, when I was pregnant my husband and I were going to move a few states over to be near my parents so they could be a part of his life, and she cried and begged us to stay. She has been awful ever since. I tore into her, I basically told her she was a piece of shit grandma, and person. That she needs to get her head out of her boyfriends ass, and that I’m fucking over it. She likes being the grandma on Facebook where everyone tells her how amazing she, but can’t step up to the plate in real life. I told her she was cut off. I’m sick of the excuses and it’s done. And I felt really empowered in the moment to finally stand up to her, but now I’m feeling really guilty. \n\nMy son absolutely loves her, when he sees photos on Facebook or the phone his face lights up and it just makes me so unbelievably angry that she can’t give him the time of day.

      "description": "I was sexually abused by my older brother (4.5 years older) for nearly 5 years when I was a kid. I only told my parents about it when I was 12, and they just swept it all under the rug. Like, they didn't involve the police or CPS, they didn't separate us or put us in counseling- nothing. They were extremely religious and I believe they wanted to save face in their church. My parents were also very neglectful and abusive (physical, verbal, and emotional abuse, denying me critical medical care etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe context is important because for a long time- until about a year ago- I just dealt with it on my own. Absolutely no one in my life gave me any reason to believe I was a victim of sexual abuse. No one made a big deal about it, so why should I? After I told my parents no one ever brought it up again. I always felt very responsible for what happened- I didn't even think of it as abuse until I was older. My brother and I were never super close, but we ended up living together when I was in my mid 20s (mostly out of convenience). The biggest issue I had living with him was his wife.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI won't get into personal attacks (though boy howdy could I). This woman and I just don't mix. We are oil and water. We were closer as teenagers when they first started dating, but over the years our relationship became so strained that living together just wasn't working out anymore. I didn't move out on great terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I moved out, the #metoo movement got really big. I made a vague post supporting it on FB. A while later I noticed she had unfriended me and I texted her to ask why. She said she saw my post and she was upset about it (she knew about the abuse before they got married). We had a big fight which ended really poorly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was only after all of this happened that I told my boyfriend (now fiance) about the abuse. The fight had brought up a lot of old feelings and I was really just looking for support. He was horrified to say the least. I spoke with his parents about it and the were shocked to discover I had endured so much abuse and neglect for so long. The more I thought about it, the more outraged I became. So I decided that to help put it behind me I would finally report the abuse to the police.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as my family found out, I was demonized. I mean really- they made me feel like a monster- like it was the worst thing I could have possibly done. They accused me of only reporting it now as a means of revenge on my brother after moving out. The police ended up closing the investigation and no charges were filed. I was never given a clear reason why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes I do regret going to the police. If I had just kept quiet I would still have my family. Sometimes I really feel like they were right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I have kept quiet? Was going to the police wrong since they didn't file charges anyway? AITA?",

My parents decided to move to the same city I work in because of their financial troubles. Unlike Western and European countries, it's fairly common for adults to stay with their parents in India. We believe in staying with the family and the culture revolves around it. \nThey decided to move to my city because of their financial troubles. They sold off the house to get some cash and pay off the debt and have now decided to come and stay with me. The parent-kid paradigm here is a little messed up and I cannot say NO to this decision. It won't be ideal. I will be frowned upon by the society and will be deemed as a bad, ungrateful son. \nI love my parents and have nothing against them. On the other hand I love my freedom more. The very reason I had moved out was because I wanted to live my life my own way. I have gotten used to a certain lifestyle and the thought of staying with them is suffocating. They are manipulative and can be extremely taxing. I am trying to sum up the courage to tell them that I can't stay with them and would like to stay separately. I am willing to help them financially in any capacity I can. They wont understand my perspective and it feels like the only choice I have.",

They did, however, post a synthesia (scrolling piano notes) video on YouTube for the entire piece, without including a MIDI, even though the title of the video said it included a MIDI file. I’ve been watching the video and tediously copying it into sheets for my own personal use and was thinking of posting the finished product for others to learn from. Many people would want access to it, and I’d be sure to give credit where it’s due if do post it (and wouldn’t dream of selling it) but still feel apprehensive as it’s not my creation. Still, the piece isn’t /by/ this person, it’s just their transcription of a completely separate composer’s piece. So. I’m a bit torn. I could make a few changes and call it my own cover, but that feels a bit cheap as there’s not much I could really tweak.

      "description": "For context, my roommate has been going under a lot of stress? I guess lately. Her young nephew that she sees a lot has gotten sick, and she's pretty worried for him. She also has to babysit her other autistic nephew on weekends, so she doesn't get much free time in between caring for them, cooking, cleaning, and studying.   \n\n\nAnyways, lately, I've been trying to help out more past the rent and keeping the general area clean. Cooking, doing more cleaning, etc. She's been on edge and kind of snappish so I was trying not to direct those insults on me. (I can't handle other peoples' emotions well, I smile even when the situation doesn't call for it, and I can pretty loud, though I don't realize it.) A few hours ago, she asked me to take out the trash for the garbage truck. I wasted a few hours, but ultimately I was going to do it, and I did. However, when I was leaving, I figured I'd forego the usual footwear since it's dry and like 10 seconds between the garbage can and the door.   \n\n\nApparently, before this, she was asking me to wear my shoes. I didn't hear this part, and just kind of left. That's when she snapped? She starts screaming about how she's locking the door and me out, except there is a garage. The door between the garage and the house is open, so I could just go in from there. I'm p chill about it, she's under a lot of stress. I may be annoyed, but I'm not pissed. \n\nThis seems to piss her off even more for some reason, though. I'm not entirely sure why? She storms into the house, and when I go to replace the trash bag on the trash cans, she's become even more pissed off, yelling at me about how I should respect her more, to stop smiling, and something like that? She tries to kick and hit me too, so I just kind of removed myself from my situation. I'm in my room now, locked the door. She's still pacing around outside screaming. Frankly, if I was the asshole, I wasn't trying to be. Am I the asshole, reddit? If I am, please help me apologize to my roommate. ",

      "description": "I ended my friendship with someone I thought to be very well with. The whole story took place at the beginning of september and I'd love to pretend I am over it, but since I am still thinking about it occaisonally, I can safely assume I do regret at least a tiny bit. \n\nWe know each other for 3 years and have been together on several holoday trips. We were the kind of friends lurking around in the voice chat until deep into the night, talking about all the stupid things 16 to 19 year olds had on their mind. \n\nHis birthday is on the beginning of september and he invites me for a small party with only 4 guests, all of our friendgroup. He didn't want to celebrate big this year he told me. \nHowever shortly after the invitation, I notice my friends, the ones invited along me to the small party, talking abour the big party on saturday. I was invite on friday though. \nOf course I curiously asked about the details. Turns out my friend is about to throw a big party on a playground with lots of alcohol and lots of guests the day after. He paired up with a girl he knew from school and overall round about 30 people were invited. \nWhat made me go crazy was the fact that everyone else from our friendgroup was invited, except for me, they were told to bring their girlfriends aswell. At that point I openly asked him, why I wasn't invited. I was told about there not being enough space (remind you 30ppl on a public playground!) and the others were \"only\" invited because of some kind of \"chain invitation\" person x because he knew y and  then z for x so he had more than one. I further questioned why I wasn't in his \"chain\", but he didn't answer. \n\nAnyways I went to the small party (I shouldn't have went there) and when I left I waved one final big ass red flag about the next day, asking when I should be there tomorrow. He smirked and he should have left it at that, instead he insulted me :\" I am not going to invite you, but I won't send anyone home who shows up.\".  \nThat pissed me off, I turned around without saying anything. \nNevertheless he isn't done yet, the next evening he send me pictures via SC/Instagram etc about his party. I blocked him everywhere afterwards and muted him on Discord. \nAround that time our common friends tried to bring us back together, he was apparently admiting slight remorse to my friends, worse for me was however that none of my friends, who all were invited, understood my anger against him and played it down. The party was bad/boring but noone out of 5 guys could understand my position. I told all of them to stop trying to get us back together and after a while they  respected. \nThe swing in the story is the birthdayparty of a common friend at the end of october.  We were both invited and I made sure to be polite with him, but cold. Inevitably he asked me for reunion later during the party, I reclined, I thought about what to say beforehand, because I wanted to \"stay strong\". \nThe next morning I was talking with my mother about the party and mentioned howI stayed strong (note this is how i first viewed it, since my ego was scratched). She just asked me, wether I was sure and happy with my response.\nNow it is the end of december and I still sometimes thing about my decision to recline. \nTherefore I decided to set up the post.\n\nAITA?\n\nDisclaimer: Not in the US, but Germany, hence public drinking not a problem.\nExcuse the formating, I am writing on mobile.

Over the weekend, while she unpacked, I put together a bed, two nightstands, a shelving unit and a shoe cabinet. The last thing I had to put together was a new desk for myself, and the only chance I had to put it together was a couple evenings ago when I came home from work. \n\nWe made it a family event, my wife kids helped me get the right parts/screws, etc. At one point, we had to screw in something like 6 or 8 bolts, so I did the ones on my side of the desk, and she did the ones on her side. I then went over and gave hers a quick tighten with my screwdriver, and my wife got PISSED at me. Saying things like \"Why am I helping you if you're just going to go over it anyway?\" and stuff like that. It didn't help to explain that a) they need to be closed tight, because if something happens to the desk the computer and everything else on it will be fucked, and b) all chauvinism aside, I'm stronger than her and was able to tighten the screws more even after she finished.\n\nObviously I think I didn't do anything wrong. So am I the asshole here, or did she blow things out of proportion?",

      "description": "*Mobile, sorry in advance\n\nBackground: I’m a 16 y/o male whose been chubby my entire life. My family never seemed to judge me about it, but they were all for me trying to lose weight. My entire family is overweight. I started my weight loss on December 2nd, with an initial BMI percentile of 94.\n(0-5 Malnourished, 5-15 Underweight, 15-85 Healthy, 85-95 Overweight, 95-100 Obese)\n\nFast forward to now, and I have went from being in the 94th percentile to the 77th percentile. My family all seemed to be proud of me, but once I started losing weight, I realized I wanted to be more then “not fat”.\nI’ve noticed that even though I have lost a good portion of weight, I still have a lot more fat then I thought I did to start (significant amounts on my love handles, which were what I was most insecure about when I started). I feel like they also just don’t really understand what my body is built to look like, because I’ve been chubby all my life, covering up my features, and how I always wear baggy clothes. \nMy family doesn’t support me trying to lose anymore weight. Just to clarify, I’m not anorexic, or have any eating disorder. In fact, I pretty regularly eat like crap, with them next to me. I really don’t understand why, but whenever I bring up my goals, they all seem to say something along the lines of “Stop, you’re to skinny.” or “You need to plump up again.” I’ve explained multiple times to them exactly what I’m doing to lose weight, why I’m trying to lose weight, and why I feel that I haven’t met my goals yet, but they keep trying to shut me down, and don’t support me, which is something I really feel like they should be when I’m trying to make a pretty drastic change in my life.\nThe other day, one of my family members made one of these remarks again, and I had had enough. I told them all that they were being asshole for how little support they were giving me and them just wanting me to conform to what they want me to look like.\nI’ve started feeling guilty about lashing out like I did, but I they know I don’t have an eating disorder, so I just don’t know why they keep shutting me down.\nSo, AITA?",

So on 9/11 I sent out a shockingly inappropriate message that was clearly a masochistic joke, esspecially if you knew me.  Everyone thought it was funny except for one old friend that in the past has made some very inappropriate jokes as well which is why she was one of the people I sent the joke to.  Needless to say I thought she would find it funny but was very wrong.  It was a reaction as if someone she knew died in one of the towers.. To me it was like she decided she was miss morality, riding high on her high horse.  It was so blatantly a joke that coming down on me the way that she did just made me feel like she was the one being a judgemental over-sensitive self-righteous asshole.  \nI’ve known this friend for 10 years and she knows my sense of humour.  Below I’ll post our text convo and let me know what you think-I don’t know how to properly load it so I just copy-pasted word for word.  I’m me(obvs) and friend is ‘A’\n\nMe-Happy 9/11!!! 🎉🎈    ✈️🏢✈️🏢🎉🎈\n\nA-That’s fucked up \nA-No seriously dude. It’s terrible. \n\nMe-Sorry if I offended you it wasn’t the intent\n\nA- Well did you really think I would laugh at that? It’s not funny. I hope you didn’t send that to anyone else. \n\nMe- I sent it to my close friends and everyone except for you knows it was just an obviously inappropriate joke and has sent back something either even more inappropriate back, or has laughed.  Do you want me to screen shot the conversations and send them to you?Chill the fuck out.\n\nA-I know that you meant it as an obvious inappropriate joke and No I don’t need to see what other people have sent back. I don’t care. It did make me feel uncomfortable and honesty lose a little respect for you. \nA-Don’t reply. Honestly. I don’t care for you to ‘defend’. It’s inappropriate, horrendous, and nothing you say will make me think otherwise\n\nMe-I wasn’t going to, I’m sorry you feel that way\nHave a nice day🙂\n\nAITA??\n",

      "description": "So this is pretty long so I’ll get right into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summer of 2017, a famous korean singer was coming to a major city near me. Me and my best friend were huge fans of this singer (I was a bigger fan of this singer) but we both loved the genre and it’s how we became best friends when we were around 10 (both 21 now).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways seeing as it was a big concert in a large city my overprotective parents wouldn’t let me go to it by myself, so I had the idea to invite my friend along. Here’s where things will get complicated later on. The tickets were $300 each and my friend said this would be too much for her to pay. She was basically family, so my parents offered to pay for her ticket on the condition that she pay them back eventually. She agreed and we went to the concert and had an amazing time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a year and a halfish, I started my second year of college and things were fine. I still talked to best friend normally and sometimes I would hit her up just to say \"hey how are you?\" and all that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom messaged me out of the blue that she was very hurt by my friend and sent me a screenshot where my mom asked if my friend had been able to save any of the $300 of the ticket cost. Now I’m guessing at best my mom believed my friend had forgot, at worst, my friend hoped we had forgot about her owing us and tryed to move on past it. My friend became hostile and questioned my mom on when I would be paying back for all the times she’s bought food when we would hang out or go out to the mall over the past \\~10 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis blindsided both of us as I’ve never had a full time job but my friend has been working as much as she can ever since she could work I think. On the rare chance I’d have money I would fully offer and insist on paying for things but many times my friend would refuse. Me being clearly confused asked my friend how much she thinks would be a reasonable price to pay her back if she was really serious. All I got in reply was “fuck you”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind, I wasn’t the one who paid for her ticket it was my parents, and we’ve NEVER had any issues over money or paying for things before so this was totally out of the blue. I questioned her on why she was being like this and she became defensive and accused me of only hitting her up to talk so I could harass her to pay back my mom (I messaged her asking about it a day before my mom did, but I had no idea my mom would ask her about it as we don’t talk daily).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then we haven’t spoken in over a year I believe and I’ve lost some sleep over wondering if I truly did something wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: my parents paid for my friends concert ticket on the condition she repay them, then when they asked if she could pay any of it back after nearly two years later, she demands I repay for all the times we have hung out and bought food/movies over the past 10 years.",

      "description": "Right then: first the setting. My condo has all the activities area stacked together. So there’s the pool, behind which is the gym next to which is huge open area for barbecue and hosting parties and finally the kids playground. The gym has glass windows, so everything outside inside can be seen. \nI like to workout in the evenings because it’s cool and less people around. \nCut to today evening: Me and another neighbor/friend decide to workout together. We enter the gym and there’s an older gentleman working out on the arms machine. I start my cardio on the treadmill and I see this kid (7-8 years old? I dunno how to guess their ages) comes up running and knocking on the gym door asking me to open the door. The door can be opened only with the condo key card which I guess was with his mother. \n\nNow I know this kid. Every now and then he comes in the gym after his playground time and starts knocking off stuff, playing with dumbbells, putting stuff under the belt of the treadmill, switching the machines on and off, etc. \nthe first time I let him in he had a screaming match with his brother who was outside the gym so they were just screaming at each other separated by a soundproof gym glass but it was annoying me and others who were inside the gym. He then proceeded to kick, lick and punch the gym glass wall. His mother meanwhile was just chatting with another neighbor as if this whole noise was her usual decibel.\n\nThe second time I let this kid in he put a dumbbell (smaller ones) on the treadmill when a girl was on it causing her to lose her balance but she had good reflexes and was cooling down so impact wasn’t much. She just scolded the kid and asked to talk to the mother but the mother wasn’t interested and took the kid home.\n\nCut to today, he bangs and bangs on the door screaming to be let in. But I do not. Neither the uncle.  My friend was between sets so he couldn’t and by the time he was done the kid started a full blown tantrum and ran off crying/screaming towards the playground.  My friend is saying I was a prick not letting this kid in but my friend has never seen this kid’s behaviour. \nMy friend is like making a kid cry like that on purpose is assholey. \n\nSo was I really the asshole? I’m reeling towards no but my friend says kids are kids, therefore I was/am. ",

      "description": "Got into an argument with my dad about eating pork, wondering if I was being insensitive or if he's overreacting.  I'm a 19 year old girl who's not religious. My dad is Muslim. We never eat pork at home and I would never buy a product containing pork and store it at home, because it just feels wrong. No one in my family orders pork when we go out to eat either, even if the rest of the family isn't Muslim (except my half sister)  I have barely tasted pork in my life actually. \n\nBut yesterday was Christmas dinner and my family were at my grandma's house. My dad isn't Christian but he still came along because he was invited. The main star of this Christmas dinner is a glazed ham, which I'd helped my grandma cook so I tasted a piece. When we got back home my dad scolded me for it and got angry at me for having eaten pork, calling me a liar and hypocrite. I told him I would never eat pork at home but that I'm 19 and want to eat whatever I want because I do eat pork. This just aggravated him further, he said he knows I'm trying to personally hurt him by eating pork. ",

      "description": "\n\nTL;DR: My roommate agreed to keep a security deposit in exchange for my portion of the rent, but now that he’s realized getting the deposit will be difficult, he’s claiming he never agreed and I owe him regardless of what happens with the deposit. \n\nI’m moving out of a 2BR apartment, but my roommate is staying and resigning the lease. At the beginning of the month, my roommate paid the full rent (and normally I then pay him my portion) This time, I asked my roommate if I could keep my portion of the rent in exchange for him keeping the whole security deposit on the apartment. He got a little confused and thought I was asking him for money, but I was like “no, you don’t have to give me any money, I’ll just keep this final month’s rent to help offset moving costs and you can keep the entire deposit since you’re staying here.” I suggested this 1. So I would have more money to put down on a new place right away and 2. So that I could avoid having to deal with management, because they’re horrible and I wasn’t sure they’d be cooperative in paying us. Anyway, he said he was good with my proposal. So, I went ahead and made plans for a new place and put down my first last and security there. \n\nTurns out, for some reason the terrible management is asking him to pay an additional half a deposit to re-sign the lease, saying they’ll send half back to me, since I’m moving out. Sounds like a scam to me, because they could just as easily keep the whole thing, since it’s technically in his name as much as it’s in mine. So, my roommate comes back to me a couple days later and says that since they’re not just keeping the deposit, he wants me to pay him. I sort of avoid the issue and say “we’ll see, I don’t see why they would do that, we should talk to them more about it.” In the end, the management calls him, “furious” that we’re “pestering” them, and they say they’re going to send a check back later and he just needs to pay up now. So now, my roommate is saying he only agreed to “let me hold onto the money until we found out what the leasing company wanted to do about the deposit.” And that I owe him, regardless of what happens with the deposit, even if we get scammed out of half of it. \n\nNow, I understand that he doesn’t want be out $1000 or be scammed by the management; neither do I, which is why I planned this out from the start. He initially agreed to my plan, but once he realized the drawbacks, suddenly he says he never agreed and says I owe him (even though I’ve already put all that money down elsewhere). He doesn’t have any cash flow issues, he’s actually very well off, he just wants me to be on the hook for the money instead of him. I think it would be fair for me to pay him half, so that if they scam us, then at least we’re equally scammed since we’re we’re equal co-signers. Would I be the asshole if I proposed this and refused to pay him the entire amount? ",

      "description": "Background: My dad was in the middle of renovating the house when my dad suddenly August. His friends have offered to help us do the rest. My Mom is a very emotional person and easily gets stressed out. My brother is a dick to me all the time. He critiques and shames me for everything. He goes out of his way to annoy people and all my mom will ever do is \"talk\" to him which results in nothing, he's never been punished in his life. My dad always had a temper and my mom would tell me and my sister not to tell him when my brother would misbehave. My mom rarely gets angry, I've only been able to actually piss her off a few times in my life.\nMy brother works 3 shifts a week. He sleeps in 5 days a week. I'm a full time uni student, I live at home, I get up at 6:45 every day I'm at uni and I'm at uni until 4. For the past week my dad's old friends have been working on our bathroom. Someone has to be awake before they arrive, my brother has been doing this for the week. I’ve started going to the gym and eating healthier. I don’t want to get cancer like my dad. I also have trouble falling asleep and my new diet gives me constipation and stomach cramps. My mom told me I'd need to get up early to let my dad's friends in. I asked why my brother can't do this since I’m at uni all week and she said that it’s because he's done it all week. He's been getting up earlier but still gets up after me. I told her that and she threatened to not take me to the gym. Fast forward to 3 in the morning and I'm really tired but can't sleep and I've got really bad cramps and constipation. I go to the toilet and my mom tells me that I need to be up in a few hours. I then ask again why my brother can't do it and she just fucking yells at me, which she won't even do to my brother when he's annoying her. She storms off and slams her bedroom door and yells \"MAKE YOUR OWN WAY TO THE GYM!!!\". This morning she wakes me up and I hear her slamming doors. It then becomes apparent to me that it's just me getting up and not us both like I'd been led to believe. My mom comes home from work and I say that I'm really angry and disappointed with how she acted. I again point out the fact that my brother can sleep in basically all week. I also mention how unfair I think it is that she threatened to punish me while he has done way worse stuff to me and has not only never been punished but has been protected and defended from any consequences. My mom then breaks down into tears and says \"fine! I'll do it all on my own” “just thought someone would help me\" she then leaves and I'm sat here now feeling like shit cause I made her cry.\nI really need to know if I'm the bad guy in this cause I feel like shit about it.\n\nIve had to leave some stuff out so here's the full version \nhttps://textuploader.com/151hz\n",

Unbeknownst to her every night i watch a nature/calming video to help me sleep since my mind often races a billion miles an hour. When she came up it was 11 and she told me to turn everything off and go to bed, which i did. But i left my phone on and went to youtube to watch the video, i didnt know it was on full volume and my phone then begun screaming about CRABFEST AT RED LOBSTER and my mom heard that and started yelling at me. I apologized for it, but asked if i could watch a nature video to help me sleep, and she refused and begun shouting at me. We argued for a while and i called her a psycho since i was so angry (more about the principal at this point honestly) then thought fuck it and just went to bed\n\nhowever in the morning she called my dad, who is very scary when he is angry and when she went to work (i do online school) he came over and chewed me out, and brought me to his place to \"watch over me\" (i do online school unsupervised usually) i tried to explain the situation but that was just \"backtalk\" to him and made him angirer.\n\nLater when he was calmer we talked about it again, and i found it my mom had lied about the situation to him to make me seem like more of an asshole (\"He out of nowhere blurted out he wanted to live with you! He was obviously lying about the video, he was doing it just to make me angry!)\n\ni confronted my mom about the lying and she just shrugged. Am i being self centered in wanting an apology?\n\ntl;dr tried to watch asmr nature video at night, fucked up and played a loud ad, mom heard that, got angry, i called her a psycho, she shipped me over to dad where he can scream at me longer, mom lied about the situation, noone has apologized but i want an apology",

      "description": "So the context is my two friends and two other people were looking for a four-person house to move into next year. They found a nice six person house and needed two other people to fill up the two remaining spaces. They went ahead and paid £600 (£150 each) to reserve the house and then asked me if I wanted to join them, saying I would have to give them £100 as my share for the reservation of the house, although I had no input in the decision to reserve the house. The £100 was so each person would pay  £100 each. I mentioned that the rent was quite pricey but they had already reserved the house so I took it they had made up their minds already. Eventually, I decided to join them and I gave them the £100 to replenish them for the reserving the house. Less than a week later they have decided they do not want to go through with that house because it's too expensive. I felt like they reserved the house without me and after I joined them they made a decision to not go through with it, a decision that I oppose and so I asked the friend I gave the money, to return my money because it's not fair on me at all. I just want to know if I'm justified in asking for my money back. AITA.",

      "description": "I've been divorced for about a year but we are still friends and co parents I'm staying with my ex for a couple weeks while waiting for my new place to be ready. He has primary custody but I am with them every day.\n\nI work graveyards with floating days off. I really like my job. I'm an unsocial night person so just working all night with my headphones in is great. Plus it works for parenting because I go home and get my kids ready for school, wake up and hang out with them until they go to bed before I go to work.\n\nMy ex has a high paying Monday through Friday job. He's been pushing me to get different work because he feels like he can't have a life outside his job and our girls. I usually have to work weekends. If he has something planned I ask for time off to take care of the girls. Like he wanted to visit a girl in another town he was interested in dating and I took a whole weekend off to give them time together. But he insists I need a Monday through Friday job to give him more time off. I'm doing really well in my job. It's union and has benefits and my boss wants to start giving me more responsibilities.\n\nToday I was asked on a date. I told the guy I could do a lunch date because I had to spend time with my girls in the evening. We went out and it went super well. He asked if we could go for drinks after they went to bed. Since I have the night off and it's a work night for my ex I said it should be fine. But it would just have to be drinks so I could be home in the morning for the getting ready for school routine. My ex flipped out. Accused me of being selfish and decided he's going out instead. I had to cancel drinks with the guy (he still wants to take me to lunch tomorrow). He's been gone three hours. I put the girls to bed alone.\n\nI don't feel like I'm being selfish but I could be wrong. I don't go out much between my work and parenting and sleeping. Am I denying my ex time to live his life? Sorry this went on so long.",

So here is the story. \n\nMy boyfriend (22) and I (21) started dating when we were 18 and we were serious from the beginning. Those years are young to be engaged or anything else so we just decided to make it a serious relationship. 5 months ago we moved away to a different state and we both had trouble meeting friends here. I am socially awkward person and its so hard for me to fit in with other girls, I always got easier friendships with guys. Since we are in a serious relationship im not allowed to meet guys here because \"all guys want sex\" (his words).. \nOn the other hand he met few girls but for his excuse \"theyre ugly and he would never do anything with them\" but yeah he met them even though Im not allowed to meet guys! Okay.\n\nSo, he introduced me to this girl (27) that is his new bestfriend about two months ago I guess and she gave me weird vibe from the beginning but okay, im just a *jealous girlfriend* so I cant judge! She mentioned some city that we all should visit and its 4 hours drive. I agreed in the beginning thinking it will never come to realization because we all have filled schedules. \n\nFast forward to few days ago, they start to plan that trip to happen next weekend! First I told them no way I can because I work and even if I could get a replacement I dont have any money saved up because of hilarous bills. He told me he really wants to visit that city and its always been his dream so he's going. \nAm I in the wrong for being mad at him about it? Its just two of them going but if not just two of them then she is bringing her other female friends.. I dont know which one is worse.\n\nI should add he cheated on every girl he dated before. ",

      "description": "I'm an atheist living in a deeply religious country. Half my family is catholic and half is evangelical christian. And of course they have weddings, baptisms, christmas, funerals, etc. But I just can't bring myself to go to these events anymore. It's draining and makes me feel uncomfortable to basically support their beliefs that have caused so much harm to people around the world. The state of organized religion is so dire and I feel they have too much power in my region, messing with the government and working overtime to limit civil liberties of women, minorities and LGBT people. In the past I have attended these events, but it has grown more and more difficult to do it. \n\nTo give you an example, at my sister's wedding the pastor spent half the sermon (or whatever it's called) raging against same-sex marriage. And I'm gay. And this happens in almost every of these events: I don't know how they do it but they are able to bring it up. I'm also pro-choice; and of course they are not. Thousands of women have been forced to carry their child after being raped because of the religious influence in the government and the strict abortion laws that we have. That's without mentioning the circle of pedophilia, the belief that I'm a complete sinner and the overall atmosphere of oppression I feel. \n\nOf course I'd like to be there for special family gatherings. And I will go to the dinner, party or whatever after it (and usually they are alcohol-free since evangelical christians don't believe in drinking (or dancing!). So, am I the asshole? I'm conflicted. \n\nTl,dr: I'm a (gay) atheist in the middle of a huge religious family and attending their religious events has  become too uncomfortable; so I have told them I won't attend anymore.

I apologize in advance for bad english, it's not my first language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really fucking pissed off right now and I need you to talk some sense into me.\n\nSo, I currently live in a flat with two friends. In the past 2 months, every time I've been away for the weekend, I've come home to a fridge that was full of moldy food. Like, nearly every single thing in there had mold on it. That happened maybe, 3 times? And every time my flatmates managed to be away when I've discovered the fridge, so I cleaned it all up, including scrubbing the fridge with vinegar. Important to note is maybe that every time it wasn't my food that was the culprit. Most of the time it was something like an open package of sour cream that spread everywhere. I've talked to them about it and their reaction was something between 'We're sorry' and 'Well, but you dont have to clean the whole fridge just because of  some rotten food, so thats your own fault.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, today I came home and found a package of carrots in the vegetable section. When I looked into it, I saw mold. So I didnt want to bother with it and just threw the whole thing away. I left my flatmate a polite note that asked him to maybe scrub the vegetable section, so I could put stuff in there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours later he came to me and said, 'I get you don't like mold, but you really didn't have to throw the whole thing away. It was only two molded carrots. Mycotoxins dont even spread in carrots, I couldve just cut the molded part of'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI offered to buy him new ones, but wtf, apparently he dug through the fucking **trashcan** just so he could prove me 'wrong' somehow? Like, wtf, is that normal? I mean, okay, maybe they werent all wrotten, but is it really my job to inspect his food just so I dont have a moldy fridge? Or in other words, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "description": "On mobile, sorry about any formatting issues.  \n\nSo, one year ago I had to have emergency surgery and ended up with a colostomy bag.   Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! ",

      "description": "Hello all \nAm very confused with feelings atm so I'm wondering if any of you could help me rationalise.\n\nI've been going out with this girl for 4 months, and are in our first year at university (college) so 19.\nI've known she's a bit wild and does drugs from time to time however her use has only started to worry me this week.\nIn her final year at school she did coke around 10 times and since being here had a busy patch of at least 5 times in November although has only done it once since January and not for the past two months( without me even bringing it up). I know coke use is normal and social at university but am worried that she could get into an addiction at some point and this scares me\n\nIs her use in line with university students going a bit experimental early on?  Or could it signal further issues and I was right for getting annoyed at her.\n\nLogically I feel this is common at uni and it's stupid to believe that she could end up an addict with that use pattern but I'm not sure what you're experiences were with contemporaries at your college and casual drug use so who knows.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "For context, I work at a fast food place that closes at 10 pm. We typically have 4 closers. \n\nWe have one manager who is specifically known for being a hardass and kind of an asshole. There’s also a very reasonable suspicion of homophobia considering how he treats some of our gay employees. The other night, we were already understaffed. A couple people agreed to stay later so we had the bare minimum amount of closers. I was scheduled until 9, an hour before we close. At about 8:45, One of our gay employees, with whom this manager has found unreasonable excuses to get mad at him before, was taking an order, and the customer’s card got declined. The employee says he’s fine and just lets the customer get his food, and said he’d pay for it later. The manager gets wind of this 5 minutes later and sends him home because in the managers eyes he basically let the customer get away with theft, despite the employee offering to pay for it once he went and got his wallet from the back. \n\nSo, we’re down to three closers with 10 minutes before I leave, and this manager says “so you’re staying and closing.” He did not ask if I wanted to stay and close. I had homework to do, and I was genuinely pissed at him. I told him “no, I’m not closing. I’m scheduled until 9.” One of the other employees got upset with me for not staying.  My rational was 1: I was scheduled until 9, and I’d have to stay an hour and a half later. There were a few people scheduled until 10 but not close who would only have to stay for half an hour later, 2: I had shit to do that night. I’m still in high school and have a lot of homework and 3: It’s not my fault there weren’t enough closers. It’s not as if people called in sick. The manager willingly understaffed us. It was his fault. \n\nTL;DR, Manager sends home a closer for a ridiculous reason, asks me to stay an extra hour and a half since we’re “understaffed,” I refused for several reasons and got called an asshole for it.

      "description": "\n\nAITA for talking to my wife about a friend's bachelor (stag) party?\n \nSo I read a AITA about a guy who didn't tell his wife details of his bachelor weekend and got in trouble for it and it reminded me of this situation from a few years ago (tldr at the end):\n \nMy best friend since junior high was getting married.  He'd asked a mutual friend to be his best man, which was all good, this friend was having a shitty year (lost his father to suicide) and was pretty much as close to the groom as I was, so it really was the right choice.  This mutual friend ('Best Man' from here on out) knew that it was a tossup between him and I and came to me and said that if I wanted to stand up and say a few things at the reception as “co-best man” he'd pass the microphone off to me. I was really happy about the offer, it was unexpected, and, more importantly, I was really looking forward to standing up and passing on my well wishes to my best friend and his wife so I readily agreed.  The reason I was looking forward to the well wishes part so much is that we're a group of ballbusters.  I care about the groom a lot and I know he feels the same way about me, but it's one of those things that stays unspoken and it'd be really weird to bring it up one on one. But, as odd as it might seem, it'd be way less weird to stand up in front of a room full of people and tell them how awesome he is (yea, that all may not sound healthy but it's who we are).  This was an opportunity to make sure he really knew how important our friendship is to me and for me to let him know what I really think of him despite the ball busting.\n \nSo the best man sets up the bachelor party a week before the wedding, pretty standard stuff.  Lots of booze, hired strippers, lap dances, etc.  Now, the bride had a pretty good idea what was going to happen, she didn't approve per se but she didn't make any demands on the evening and she wasn't going to turn it into a fight.  Basically, she just didn't want details, which is cool enough on her end.  My wife and I on the other hand have a different relationship.  My wife has zero objection to strippers, she gave me shit the first time I went to a strip club specifically because I was broke and couldn't possibly be tipping well enough.  She's always trusted me then to know our lines and not cross them and I've always held true to that trust (this time was no exception).\n \nSo Bachelor party happens, just drinking and strippers, exactly what everyone expected. My wife asks me about it the next day and, not thinking anything of it, I gave her a rundown of what happened.  That's just how our relationship works, she told me the details of her own bachelorette party right to my face (strippers were involved with hers. I didn't have strippers at mine, my brother was planning it, it would have been weird).  She knew that the Bride didn't want details and she for sure wasn't going to be running to the bride with what I told her.\n \nSo cut to the rehearsal dinner and this exchange between me and the Best Man:\nMe: \"something, something about finishing up my speech for tomorrow\"\nBM: \"You don't get to make one\"\nMe: \"What?\"\nBM: \"Yeah, you talked to your wife about the bachelor party.  You broke guy code, you don't get to make a speech tomorrow.\"\nMe: \"What?  Did she tell the Bride?\"\nBM: \"No.\"\nMe: \"Is the Groom pissed about it?\"\nBM: \"Not that I'm aware of.\"\nMe: \"Well, WTF?\"\nBM: \"You broke guy code, man.\"\nand that's where it ended.\n\nI. WAS. PISSED!\n\nbut it was the night before my best friend's wedding, that weekend was about him and his wife, I was most definitely NOT going to make it a thing.  So, I tamp down my anger, proceed with the night as if nothing happened (got a little more drunk that I'd planned on but nowhere near drunk enough to cause issues) \n \nOn the ride home I tell my wife about it and ask if she said anything to the bride, or if she said anything to anyone about it.  She said she definitely didn't give the bride details, she may have said something to someone just about us having a conversation about the party but she wouldn't have gone into detail.  Honestly, she couldn't remember and frankly, I couldn't remember whether or not I had said to someone that she and I had talked about it.  I certainly wasn't going out of my way to talk about the bachelor party (especially in detail) but I very could have easily said, \"Yea, my wife and talked about it\" if someone brought it up. \n \nSo, I rant and rave a little on the ride home.  Honestly, there's no way to tell who let it slip that we talked about it because it didn't seem like something worth hiding so none of the ranting was directed at her, it was all directed at the Best Man.\n \nNext morning is wedding day.  The groom has some shit that needs doing at the venue.  I show up early to his house to head out with him to ostensibly to give him a hand, but really just to be there for whatever he needs (in my mind, what a best man should do but the actual best man wasn't planning on doing) The Groom was going to be sitting at the venue alone for 4+ hours otherwise.  While the groom and I are there having a drink at the bar I asked about the night before.\n\nMe: \"So did you hear Best Man told me I could stand up and say something today but went back on it last night because I 'talked to my wife' about the bachelor party?\"\nGroom: \"Yea\"\nMe: \"Are you mad about me saying something to my wife?\"\nGroom: \"No\"\nMe: \"Is the Bride mad about it?\"\nGroom: \"No\"\nMe: \"Then WTF?\"\nGroom: \"I dunno but it's his call.\"\n \nAnd that's as far as I was willing to go into it.  Again, that day wasn't about me at all, I wanted to know if I'd pissed off the Bride or Groom and that's it.  I put my game face on, played nice and had an overall good time (almost made the wife cry before the ceremony because I told her she was family and meant it, she did get a little mad I almost ruined her makeup : p).  I was still pissed but I very effectively compartmentalized it and had a good time (exactly what I was supposed to do). \n \nI feel a bit like an ass because on some level I made a part of their day about me (only to me and my wife, though) but I missed out on a rare opportunity to share heartfelt feeling with my best friend and his new wife.\n \nSo AITA for telling my wife what went on at the bachelor party when she asked then being pissed about the Best Man's response?\n \n(To make one thing clear: the only person, to this day, that even knows I was pissed off is my wife.  Clearly, I would have been an asshole to make an issue of it, I didn't.)\n \nTLDR:  Best friend's wedding.  Best Friend choose another close friend to be his Best Man, which is the right choice at the time.  Best Man labels me co-Best Man, tells me I can make a co-Best Man speech.  Then, at the rehearsal dinner, tells me I can't make a co-Best Man speech because \"I broke guy code\" by honestly talking to my wife about the bachelor party (she asked what went on, I answered truthfully).  Details of the bachelor party remained in confidence (Bride didn't want to know and wasn't told), just the fact that I talked to her caused the speech offer to be rescinded.  I got pissed at Best Man but didn't let anyone (aside from my wife) know I was pissed.\n \n \n\n\n",

      "description": "Sorry for the clickbait-y title.\n\nI'm a part of the club at my college dedicated to a semi-niche hobby that I'm really passionate about. Last year (I had been in the club for 2 years technically, but had only really been attending meetings &amp; active for 1 year), during elections for the following year (this one), the officer team decided that whoever was elected vice president would become president. At the time, I didn't have too much of a stake so I voted for the person that's currently VP and ran for another officer position (which I got).\n\nSince then, I've had some disagreements and frustrations with how the club has been run, and I've felt like a lot of my suggestions and complaints have been ignored or pushed away. I try not to air my dirty laundry publicly or anything because I think it's important to put up a unified front, but other people in the club and in the non-collegiate community of my hobby that I talk to have told me independently that some of the choices the club has made have been weird and/or frustrating. Elections for next year are coming up soon and the VP taking over as president isn't in our club constitution so I figured that was a hope rather than a rule, so in our group chat for officers I was like \"hey, what's the process for running for president\" because I thought I would make a good president. Some of the other officers agreed that the way we did things was a little weird so we agreed to have a meeting about it. \n\nWe ended up having an officer meeting where we were told, basically, \"the VP earned this, they deserve this, and it's a douche move to try to take that away from them.\" In addition, we were told that the way we have to charter our club is really convoluted and the organization we're chartered under is super inconsistent with their rules, so this was partially so that the current president could spend the year training the VP to become the next president.\n\nAITA for wanting to run for president? I get that we voted for VP last year, but the decision to change how the president got their job wasn't made by the full club, and I think it's weird to expect people to know 2 years in advance who they want the president to be, especially since most of our members are lowerclassmen and might not have even been members for very long (including, by definition, the person that gets elected as VP).",

      "description": "I recently moved into a place with two random roommates. I get along great with one roommate, the other not so much. A little info on him- very spoiled, parents pay for rent, groceries, etc. never does dishes/cleans/lets stuff mold, etc. just generally gross roommate stuff. Also, he is an Alcoholic/cokehead- I was warned by first roommate after I moved in not to leave alcohol in kitchen or problem roommate would drink it and generally take forever to pay back. \n\nSo, this roommate likes to party. A lot. Most nights (weekdays, weekends, whenever) roommate will go to bars, get plastered, come home w/ randos and do coke all hours of the night. My room is on other side of kitchen wall and this noise keeps me up all night, even with ear plugs. I have work at 7am most mornings (and go to school after work) and this was severely pissing me off. One morning after this occurred, I approached roommate with something like “hey man, I have work early in the mornings and when you bring people over during the week it gets loud and I can’t sleep- can you keep it to the weekends/be quiet after midnight during week?” (VERY reasonable in my opinion) Roommate said no prob he would do so. Not even 3 days later, same deal. 2am-6am Tuesday night, singing queen songs and doing blow. Other roommate is not happy either but doesn’t like confrontation, and noise doesn’t hit his room as much. \n\nI decide I’m sick of it, and one night while they’re going at it I walk into living room with my Bluetooth speaker, turn it up full volume and blast the heaviest screaming death metal I can think of while smiling/kicking feet up on couch and twiddling thumbs. Everyone calls me an asshole but leave and I am able to get some sleep before work. So, was I an asshole? \n\nTLDR: alcoholic cokehead roommate sings queen all hours of night on week nights keeping me awake before work, I decide to blast screaming death metal to make him and his friends leave.

      "description": "Posted this over on another sub but I'd like your feedback as well.\n\nWe were very close friends from middle school, high school, and college. Then after 5 years living in different states we started a long distance relationship. We've been planning to move in together for years untl we finally did it just recently. I secured our house and arrived first, then he arrived about a month later from our home town.\n\nThe plan was mutual; leave our pasts behind and use this move as a fresh start, to drop our bad habits and totally transform our lives.\n\nIt's been weird. Kind of disappointing. He's very much the same person I knew from back then, maybe too unchanged from how he was in high school. And different in a few ways that have been effecting me negatively; mainly he has a huge lack of self discipline.\n\nI've been working on myself for the past couple years, to quit smoking, wake up early, stay fit, hygenic, and ward off depression to great success. When we lived apart he used to tell me how he can't wait to walk with me and eat like me to lose weight. Now that he's here he has some excuses to not go out, and sometimes encourages me to stay in as well. He also has a stubborn fastfood and soda habit with no desire to stop.\n\nThough I still go out and do my thing, I start much later because I often want to stay up with him watching his shows and playing games to spend time with him because we both work during the day. \n\nHe doesn't heed my advice. He wants to lose weight but doesn't want to eat differently or excersize. I was under the impression he wanted to move with me to change his life but it's not turning out to be the case and it's honestly such a bummer that his motivations are so different than mine. I thought we could help each other but as the days go by he keeps rejecting my help.\n\nIn short, my schedule has gone haywire and we literally eat different meals every time of day.\n\nThis morning we were talking and ended up in a weird one-sided argument because he thought I was blaming him for something menial, though I wasn't.. Sort of like the last tiny straw that broke the camel's back. I feel it's too soon for this to be going so awry and I'm already considering an end to this relationship. The trouble is the recent move and living together even after our initial plans have crumbled. Don't know if breaking up now is exactly strategic or if I should wait it out a bit longer. And still I wonder if I'm just being an asshole.",

      "description": "So basically I work for an international company who decided to donate the entire companies christmas parties budget to charity. There were reasons I won't go into for fear of identification.\n\nMyself and coworkers feel like this is a bit of a dick-move... not the charity donations obviously, but which pot of money they have chosen to donate. They aren't donating any company profits or senior staff bonuses, they're just taking away one small joy from their low level employees. As one person paraphrased the decision \"we really care about this issue, but not enough to put our own money towards it, just our employee benefits\". They have not asked us if we are happy to do this and to be honest if they had we would have said yes, that's a much better use of the money. They could even have asked for donations and I'm sure most of us would have put something to the cause (albeit probably not quite as much as the company would spend per head on a party).\n\nBut of course now we are looking to organise our own christmas party which will be self-funded. So I feel like I'm now out of pocket having to pay for it, and I really don't earn much to start with, and already donate what I can to charity and even volunteer on weekends. I guess if I was really that hard up I could just not go and as I'm writing this I'm feeling more like an asshole and starting to think I know which way responses will go.\n\nBut I'm still interested in what everyone else has to say, so AITA for feeling disgruntled that our employer has done this without asking us first?",

      "title": "WIBTA for telling my step-mom I’m no longer comfortable calling her “mom”?",
      "description": "Obligatory long time lurker, I’m on mobile, etc.\n\nThere’s a lot of context to this. To start, when I was three months old, my mother passed away from horrible lung cancer. No one knows how she developed it, and she was taken from the world far too soon. I have only a few pictures and don’t know much about her.\n\nA year after her death, my dad remarried. We’ve always referred to it as “our wedding” because it was the start of a new family with the three of us. I was only just over a year old at the time.\n\nGrowing up with three branches of family was weird. I’d get confused in elementary school, trying to expand my family trees. Because I had two moms and one dad. We’d visit all three parts of the family and I just assumed it was normal after awhile. Sure, it was hard to explain, but it’s how I grew up. Now that I’m older, I know it’s not normal. I don’t know a single person who calls their step-mom “mom.”\n\nIt’s a bit different for me. My parents made the decision when they got married (again, I was only about 1 at the time) that I would grow up with her as “mom” and that was fine. I don’t have many memories from childhood, but I guess they were good at explaining it because I wasn’t confused. I had mom, dad, and Anna, my real mom who I referred to by name.\n\nNow that I’m older, I hate not knowing much about her. I only learned of her birthday two days ago. We never bother celebrating or doing anything. It was never even mentioned to me. Maybe I’m just too emotional about it, but I would have liked growing up celebrating my mother’s birthday. Similar to this, I’m sick of calling her by her name. It’s so impersonal and I want to respect her as my mom.\n\nI’m not religious, but if she’s up there watching me, I want her to know that I think of her as more than an entity that means nothing. She’s my mom, and I think it’s time I can call her that. And just like that, I will say that the decision to call my step-mom “mom” that was made by my parents is no longer sitting well with me.\n\nI’m not sure if this sounds like a validation post so far, but here’s where it gets complicated.\n\nMy step-mom has a lot of problems. As someone with diagnosed depression and anxiety, I see some of my own symptoms in her. She has celiac and meineries (?) disease. Without going into what those are, it basically just means she can’t do anything. She stays at home, does laundry, occasionally goes shopping, watches soap operas, and takes her daily nap. To me, it seems like a miserable existence. I don’t know how she does it, living.\n\nShe’s very sensitive about all matters regarding the fact that she’s not my real mom. Any jokes or lighthearted comments I make about her “not being my real mom” or “they might think you kidnapped me because I’m not adopted” are always taken horribly. I know that some of those might have been dick moves, but I only mean them as a way to poke fun at our complicated family situation. She doesn’t see it like that.\n\nAnd now that I’m 17 and old, I want to connect with my real mom more and part of that for me is respecting my true family connections that have been kept from me. And the idea of calling my step-mom “mom” just doesn’t seem right anymore.\n\nWIBTA for telling her this? I don’t have to stop calling her mom, but I know she’ll be heartbroken no matter what I say if I bring it up. Thank you for any responses, no matter what the feedback. It’s been hard a hard topic me lately, and I just want to move forward with the least amount of damage.",

Always had good grades, never really got into trouble, etc.. it’s also worth mentioning that he’s been playing a lot of video games at his sisters house recently, more than my husband and I would like. this year starting out he got caught vaping at school. We took his keys and all that and we thought everything was good. Well about 3 weeks ago I found a juul pod in a pair of shorts. I haven’t seen him wear these shorts in a long time and they were stuffed under his bed so I figured it may have been from when he got caught before. Just to be safe I bought a nicotine urine test and tested one morning when he forgot to flush and he tested positive. We had a talk and he ended up lying at first then told the truth once I told him I tested him. I took his PS4 from his sisters and I’ve never seen him this mad. He keeps insisting that I couldn’t take it because he paid for it and it wasn’t in our house, etc... I told him to get it back he needed a job and needed to pass a nicotine test. It’s been a week and he has a job but hasn’t passed the test. He destroyed the juul and gave it to me but I’m waiting for the nicotine test to test negative. It seems that we just argue every day and it gets worse. He’s never been mad for this long. AITA?",

      "description": "A little long. My dad is 65 and has been smoking cigarettes since he was 13, I believe. He has worked for delivery companies (think FedEx, UPS) his entire adult life. Played hockey growing up and has always been a \"mans man.\" Then my spouse and I had our son, and all that melts away and he is a huge softey around the kid. I hate cigarette smoke and have voiced that my entire childhood and asked him as soon as we got pregnant to stop or find a less stinky alternative. He tells me no problem and how excited he is. \n\nFor the past 10 or so years, he has had this now nickel sized sore/scab thing that continues to grow on his face that we are all sure is cancerous but we aren't doctors so what do we know. We suggest he goes to a doctor but because he is a private contractor, his deductible is super high and he refuses and always makes an excuse saying, \"I will soon.\"\n\nCue baby being 4 months old. My parents move closer to us, mostly because mom is retired and wants to babysit. Our son is always over there and I am too. I've noticed coffee cans on the back porch, which have used cigarette buds in them. Confront him on that and I understand how hard it is to quit so I offer help (buying patches and what not) and he says hes got it dont worry. \n\nNow, 15 month old baby stays with them regularly. Still smoking, no signs of quitting but a lot less and never at his house. I assume only at work. He doesnt kiss him but gives me grief about it each and every time I pick him up. Saying how much he loves him, how he wants to give him kisses, etc. I finally said well that thing on your face, we all have no idea what it is and its leaking fluid randomly (he keeps a bandage on it.) He got offended, cursed at me and blamed high insurance prices and I left not wanting an argument. My mom isnt sick by any means and she kisses him, but that doesn't mean I want my kid to get kissed.\n\nBut, am I the asshole for not letting my father kiss my son when I dont know what is on his face/leaking from his face?

One of the girls and I started at the same time and the third was hired a month later. I kinda talked to them individually because our cubes were spread out and it seemed more natural because of the timing. We all three went out for drinks one night had a good time As time went by I took the third coworker out on date and we hung out pretty frequently after that, but nothing consistent. \n\nFast forward about a year. I have been out with my coworker quite a few times on dates and she slept over, but nothing more than making out and nothing as far as a relationship because he was a little hard to get and focused on her career. The other coworker who started when I did is friendly at work and constantly complains to me about her boss over IM. Over the summer we hung out twice and I dog sat for her over a weekend. We had a fun connection at work as we worked on the same projects but I never thought she was in to me, she said she would never date a coworker after lunch one day.\n\nJust this past week, girl #1 was acting a bit weird and then on Friday they both went to happy hour. I noticed tonight they had both deleted me from Snapchat. I’m running through the possibilities and I’m starting to think they both had feelings and something came up at HH and they spilled to each other. The coworker I dated was trying to keep it super secretive at work but one night she asked if I ever dated the other girl (based on one day that her new bossed asked if me and girl #1 were because we talk at work a lot). \n\nAm I an asshole?

      "title": "AITA for putting a “tip jar” up when I drive Lyft",
      "description": "Info: I’m a 22yr old college student trying to earn money for books, food, and some occasional fun. I tried working a regular job only to have my grades fall. \n\nSo I’ve been driving Lyft for a few months, and it didn’t take me very long to notice that MOST people don’t tip after their ride. No matter how great the ride is (I usually have pretty good convo, and I offer amenities like a charger and usually give the riders a chance to pick the music for the ride), most people just ride and move on with their day. I receive a tip 10-20% of the time according to my ride history. Although it makes me angry, I’ve pretty much gotten used to it. \n\nHere’s the thing- tips make the difference between earning decent money (15-20 an hour) and earning less than minimum wage on some days. It gets really shitty sometimes, especially since Lyft/Uber drivers have to use their own gas (don’t get paid) to travel to the pickup location. This may not seem like much, but with gas prices going back up, it really adds up over time and eats into the already terrible pay. \n\nI understand that I can get another job, but since I have class during the day and really don’t want to sacrifice my studies, I pretty much have no other option. The freedom that ride-sharing gives you to work whenever you want is a real benefit. \n\n***So to try to boost my earnings,I grabbed an envelope and wrote “Tips for gas and rides that didn’t suck” on it and hung it in my car. Although when I have it up, I usually do get more tips than normal, I kind of feel like an asshole for possibly pressuring people into giving me a tip. Sometimes I can tell it makes people uncomfortable. ***\n\nTBH I have a problem with the fact that most people will tip their waiter but not their driver. I feel like giving someone a ride is much more personal than serving at a restaurant, as it requires more personal conversation, and you literally have their life in your hands while they’re in the car. I feel a good quality ride + good conversation + a few extra amenities is equivalent to a waiter giving you good service in a restaurant (what else can you possibly do during a short ride to campus or to the store). Maybe because people don’t know how little I get paid? The app makes it really easy to tip, but since people don’t see that screen until after they get out the car, it’s a lot easier for them to stiff drivers on the tip because they don’t have to do it in front of other people and will probably never see that driver again.\n\nAm I pressuring/manipulating people? If so, how can I encourage tipping without being asshole if I’m already doing my best to provide a good service. \n\nTLDR: I drive Lyft and the overwhelming majority of riders don’t tip, so I put a “tip jar” up to help encourage/remind people.

      "description": "Alright alright hear me out becuase the title makes it sound worse than it is.\n\nSo I was on a dating app and matched up with a guy with some sort of arm deformity (is that the polite way to say it?). No big deal. I'm all about personality and how someone treats others.\n\nSo we start chatting and ge asks if i ever kissed someone. I said no (Im 22 btw). He asks if i would kiss on the first date and i responded no since I'm not comfortable with that. He then asks if I'd be willing to hold hands. I said probably not becuase i just met you and this is a first date.\n\nHe gets upset and pressed me after i told him I wasn't comfortable and says \"why? Its just holding hands?\" And i say \"Becuase I'm just not comfortable with it.\"\n\nNow its got **NOTHING** to do with his condition. If he had normal hands I still wouldnt hold them on the first date. I've never really dated anyone before and don't want to rush things.\n\nSo am I the asshole?",

Ever since Fortnite came out he’s got more and more addicted, to the point where he’ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent’s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they’re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn’t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he’ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don’t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I’m the asshole for hiding it, I’m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. ",

      "title": "WIBTA for confronting a friend about my feelings of abandonment?",
      "description": "TL;DR at bottom. Also I’m typing this on reddit mobile so sorry about formatting.\n\nSo for some background, I have been friends with this person ever since I was 12 years old, we are both now 20. I’ve also always been a little bit in love with them and they are aware of this, but it’s never been an issue within the friendship, as the feeling was mutual, however, I wasn’t out as queer to my family yet. I’m very emotionally attached to this person, they’ve been one of the closest friends I’ve ever had.\nMy friend grew up under an abusive and emotionally manipulative mother. They were hard to hang out with because they’re mother would always make them cancel last minute for absolutely no reason. My friend got a full ride to any college in our state for being super smart, but they dropped out due to mental health issues. After they were finally away from their mother, everything kinda broke in their head, all the abuse finally got to them. They were diagnosed with PTSD, Bipolar disorder, and depression.\nThat was three years ago. They’ve moved around quite a lot, and have been trying to figure out how to live. They’re getting better and I’m very proud of them.\nNow here’s my explanation for my feelings of abandonment. \nI used to text them about everyday, with either little or no response. I branched out to messaging them on discord, tumblr and other social media. Same kind of response. Sometimes I wouldn’t hear from them for over three weeks at a time. And I felt bad for messaging them so much because they’re struggling with their mental health. But they’d always be like “I miss you so much! I’ll talk to you soon! We should talk more!” Etc. And I’m unbearably loyal so I always respond enthusiastically and then I’m left on read for weeks.\nAt this point I haven’t heard from them directly in months. I only send messages once every week or so now. I don’t get any response. I’ve been feeling more angry about it recently, as I’ve seen them almost regularly post on tumblr (with LENGTHY additions to posts) and being active in group chats that we BOTH are in, almost regularly sending messages. And yet I never hear directly from them. I feel like we’ve drifted so far apart and I’m struggling to keep the friendship and I feel it’s completely one sided. However I feel like I can’t say anything because I’m worried I’ll cause harm to their mental health or that I’ll just make them worse.\nAm I being selfish? Would I be the asshole for confronting them about my feelings? My heart aches when I look at all the unanswered messages I’ve sent.\n\nTL;DR: my friend has a lot of mental health issues, I message them, get no response for weeks. However I’ll see them posting frequently online and active in group chats we both are in. I don’t want to overstep and possibly trigger something related to their mental health, but I feel abandoned.",

This girl, she has a unique name so im gonna call her ana, we had dated for around a year, but near the six month mark, we had a fight and split up. I struggle with clinical depression as well as Post Traumatic Stress, and she was tired of dealing with my symptoms when they arose (no, i was not abusive. I just became very secluded, along with the paranoia and trust issues that came with my ptsd). We broke up, and around a week later, another girl (im gonna call her Alyssa) who had been very supportive in my life for a while, decided to tell me she had feelings for me. One thing led to another, we ended up having sex, but soon after we both agreed we were better for each other as friends. Next month comes around, Ana apologizes, we get back together, but i refrain from telling her about my encounter until a few weeks after. After that, she began cheating on me (About 5 times, 4 of which i didn't find out about until after we broke up the second time) and was generally cold and dismissive of me until we broke up the final time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

My best friend bought a PlayStation few weeks after me, with one game, but I've bought many titles I've really dreamt of playing. I don't mind sharing, but his idea of gaming is not to have own copies, he wants to rent or borrow. He's been asking me for some titles to share with him, but that's kind of a let down for me because I know how much work people put in making them, it's his mindset on this subject matter that irritates me. I even offered to buy for him, which he obviously denied. I don't earn much, the meagre amount I save, apart from other expenses, for my monthly spending is what I use to buy new games which costs nearly 20% of the savings. But he's my best friend and we often had arguments over copyright and piracy of games and other media, although he agrees it's bad, but doesn't care much. We also don't get much time to play due to work and family priorities. Still, I think if you can buy a gaming console then you should buy games as well. I don't know how to tell him No, but I also feel bad for thinking about denying his request. Am I a selfish asshole?",

I was indignant for a while because it was particularly hard on my mom but it didn't affect me personally that much because he was largely absent to begin with. One further step removed didn't change my life. We're cordial but don't see each other.

I never told him because he's not involved in my life. Last week the wife and I had our wedding anniversary and my cousin babysat for us. I learned after the fact my father was in the area and my cousin brought my son to him for a visit. They planned this in advance apparently, and my father didn't come to me directly because he thought I'd say no. And I would have. You can't forge a relationship with your grandson if you failed to with your son.\n\nI never would have found out this meeting transpired if I didn't see him in a Facebook post my cousin made with photo.

      "description": "This is my first time post on Reddit , English is not my native language and I'm on mobile, so sorry.\nI have a friend (we have been hanging out for about 2 years , she is at the same age as me(both f25) and I should say from the start that she is very spoiled. \nAnyway we used to work together so we were seeing each other daily, after a year I quit my job and since then I've seeing each other about one time per week. She used to call me all the time to meet and most of the time I was available, Everytime I couldn't meet her she was throwing a tantrum saying stuff like ' oh okay then I won't call you again we're not friends anymore' and I was feeling guilty (it's how I am as a person in general) and I called her a couple times saying I was sorry , even though I didn't do anything wrong (at least from my point of view). She was doing this repeatedly so I told her to stop cause I was feeling awful and guilty but of course she said she was joking. Everytime I called her to meet and she couldn't I was being chill and it didn't really matter to me . Anyway she found a boyfriend and now she is available only when her bf is working. She called me this week I forgot to call her back cause I was busy and then texted me. We chatted a bit and told her wanna go out for drinks? She said 'mmm don't know we'll see'. I didn't text her anything and u don't plan to. I'm really tired of this behavior. Am I the asshole or I'm just going on an endless guilt trip? \n",

I tried explaining to her that I don’t give a shit what the scale says but I’m worried about her health and it might be fun for us to workout together. I knew it may not get a great response but I didn’t expect this at all. I thought she’d see that I’m trying to help and that I care. I’m attracted to her still, I’m madly in love with her.

      "description": "My boyfriend (22 M) and I (20 F) have been together for 2 years. We're extremely emotionally intimate and very commited to each other. Yesterday we were casually discussing random porn concepts, and I said that I like the fantasy of a threesome, being dominated by 2 men, etc, etc. He asked \"how is that practical?\", referring to the positioning, so i brought up some examples. And suddenly he got super pissy, wouldn't let me touch him when I asked what's wrong, got up and left the room. I followed him, and repeated the question, and he said something along the lines of, \"How would you feel if I expressed the desire to sleep with 2 girls other than you?\" I said that he already had, and that I considered it a normal fantasy, emphasis on both \"normal\" and \"fantasy\". He said that he felt paranoid towards me now, and pictured the image and just feels grossed out. \n\nI apologized 5 or 6 times  over  the evening. I offered to cook dinner to make up for upsetting him, even unintentionally, and even though I felt he was overreacting. I hugged him, explained that it was a fantasy and did not intend to make him upset. He was cold and distant. There was a LOT of drama for the rest of the night, he brought up past fights, I cried a lot, kept apologizing but he kept his attitude. Whatever, just give him time, I thought, even though I was upset.\n\nToday we woke up, he tried to hug me and I wanted to stretch, so I momentarily denied the hug. Well, boy, did he not like that! He gave me the cold shoulder for the whole damn morning. I finally started reacting, saying that I didn't know what else to do to make this up to him, and didn't deserve this, and that he blew it out of proportion. He said I didn't try hard enough to apologize like I meant it, and I had turned away his embrace.\n\nWth? Am I in the wrong here? I know we are both possessive of each other (and currently in a stressful  LDR) so I try to be understanding, but this is too much! I am visiting for 5 days now, and it seems like they're gonna be hellish because of this stupid fight. \n\nWould you get so upset over your SO describing a threesome fantasy? What should I have done to soothe his anger?\n\nTL;DR I described a threesome fantasy to my LDR boyfriend of 2 years and he got really upset and paranoid about it, created a lot of drama. ",

      "description": "My dad comes from a very long line of sexist idiots.  If a girl is born in the family, you have nothing to do with them.  In short, girls are only good for reproduction and cleaning.  This means he can't stand me.\n\nNow aside from his distaste of me, he has been a complete douche of a person let alone a dad.  He cheated on my mom with my brother's and my babysitter.  A woman with a full grown 'stache.  Evidently she was psycho, he and her kept breaking up and he would end up with my mom again.  Then he would go back to the 'stache.  Rinse and repeat.  He finally left Groucho and went back to my mom one last time before cheating on her with his new wife.  This woman made Satan look like a cuddly teddy bear.  \n\nNow in this time, my mom has moved on and remarried.  Unfortunately, her husband eventually passed and she was a widower for some time.  Then my dad's wife passed.  And the two thought, let's get back together.  A true nightmare.  They have been back together for a couple of years now.  When I say together, I mean he moved in.  They share a bed but have NOT remarried.  He couldn't afford to live on his own.  Lucky me, I see him too often.  They are somewhat happy.  My dad has not changed.  Still a jerk.  Still doesn't like me and he's very controlling to my mom.  Which was made worse when she was diagnosed with stage 3 bone cancer.  He thinks he knows everything.  Even if it isn't what my mom should be doing for her health, he says do it.  I try to help at their house but he refuses to let me.  Currently, my mom is in the hospital in very bad shape.  She asked me to get things from her home.  Old dad wouldn't let me.  The icing on the cake, he sent my mom a text saying he prefers my brother to me.  Yes, he did this while she has cancer and in a hospital.  Fantastic guy.  She cried, of course.  \n\nMy question; since my jerk of a father wants nothing to do with me and apparently loves my brother more, WIBTA if I ask my brother what is my dad's problem?  I feel like I am not going to be able to care properly for my mom because I am being denied that and he is going to send her to her grave before she has had a chance to fight.\n\nTL;DR my \"dad\" hates girls and won't let me do what is right to take care of my mom, whom he has treated like garbage over the years because he prefers my brother to me.",

      "description": "Throw away account. Let me just start off with the obligatory formatting apology because I'm using mobile.\n\nI recently told my friend I was pregnant, at the time I was nearly 7 weeks, so I asked if she could please not tell anyone as we still were yet to have a scan. She said she was happy for me and reassured me she would not tell anyone.\n\n10 or so days later I get a message from her sister congratulating me because she had just heard the good news. I immediately message my friend telling her that I do not appreciate her telling anyone, and that I still have family to tell (my own brother doesnt even know yet, not to mention grandparents etc)\n\nShe argued that I am being unfair because I have known her sister for a long time and her sister doesnt even know my family. She said she weighed up the situation and decided that it couldn't not negatively effect me and that her sister asked how we were going with trying to conceive (side note: I never told her sister we were TTC, so obviously my friend did) and she couldn't just lie to her. So she decided it best to go ahead and tell her.\n\nI told her again that she had no right to tell her. She continued to argue that I was being irrational and unfair, that I had no right to be mad. She even asked her sister for a second opinion and her sister agreed that I was not being reasonable and even sent me a follow up message asking me not to be mad at my friend because she is just happy for me. I continued to argue that I was upset because she betrayed my trust.\n\nIn all fairness I was harsh with her - she has a history of not owning up to her mistakes and calling people unfair when they call her out.\n\nSo, am I  the a-hole?",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to let someone's child in front of me at a parade?",
      "description": "So last year I was fortunate enough to be able to visit Europe, and we stayed in Paris for a little while. We happened to be around on Bastille Day, which is equivalent to the 4th of July for Parisians. It's a huge day, and one of the coolest things about it is the Bastille Day parade. It's a military parade with tons of vehicles, military members, and political figures.\n\nMy family was really excited to watch it, and we fortunately were staying close to the parade route. We got up early and trekked out to the viewing area. We managed to get there early, and we were about 3-4 people back from the barrier. By the time the parade started, that number had risen to 15-20 people.\n\nClose to the parade starting, a family who spoke French appeared behind us with a small child. I don't remember if they had pushed their way to us, or if they were there from the start. Either way, we had been there for a while before we even saw them. The father tapped on my shoulder kind of aggressively and motioned for us to let his kid by to the front. My first response was to just say no to him in French. I understand that it's hard for kids to see parades, and that putting them on your shoulders is even worse than pushing them to the front, but we had arrived first, along with the people in front of us. This man was obviously from France, so I feel like he would have known how insane Bastille Day can be. He got pretty angry at my response, trying to forcibly push his child in front of me. I kept responding no and blocking the space between us. There were two men next to us who didn't seem to care, so they let this kid past. The man kept grumbling to his wife after this, presumably about us.\n\nAs the parade started, the kid kept coming back and forth from the front to their parents, at which point I had given up and just let them pass. Here's where my family and I acted kind of shitty. We didn't say anything, but we all kind of stuck close together so that it was hard for that man to see what was happening. He was shorter than us, so he had to kind of peer through the spaces between and around us to see. I'm not proud of it now, but at the time I was angry that we were being hassled by people who hadn't planned ahead and shown up early enough to get a good spot.\n\nI've been really conflicted if I'm the asshole in this situation. Obviously blocking that guy wasn't a good thing to do, and I feel kind of guilty that I as an American blocked this French person and his kid from seeing a parade that celebrates France. On the other hand, we knew to arrive a good amount of time before the parade started to make sure we could see.\n\nTL;DR: Attempted to stop an angry Frenchman from allowing his child to cut to the front of the viewing area for the Bastille Day parade, even though we arrived considerably before them. We then stuck close together to make it harder for him to see after he yelled at us.",

      "description": "I (27m) was out to dinner with ex girlfriend (23f) and at the end of dinner we talked about possibly going back to my place for sex and to hang out and spend the night. Only caveat was that she's an Au Pair from Brazil and her host family might not let her stay over since she had to drive the kids somewhere early in the morning. Our plan was for her to ask if she could stay over and go from there. A little more back story: we broke up about 6 weeks ago but started seeing each other again about 2 weeks ago because she wanted to have sex (and probably more) and I was on the same page.\n\nBack to our dinner on Friday night. As we're walking to my car, she tells me her host dad is very old school and how growing up he never interacted with girls much, but her mom \"was a bitch\" and had sex with a lot of guys. I asked her why she used the word bitch. And she said she didn't know, that I know what she means. I said, no I don't can you try to explain. And she aggressively told me she doesn't know how to explain and can I stop asking.\n\nAt this point, I started feeling defensive just because of the way she talks to me in this aggressive manner (and maybe this is where I went wrong, because I could've given her the benefit of the doubt still, but I kept my cool at least). I didn't think she meant it in a bad way because the context at first, but then I started recalling other times she called her host mom a bitch (just because she tried politely asking my ex to stop fucking up various things lol) and I recalled times when she told me she feels bad about having casual sex and then my anger started to build up because I was just mad that she thinks that way. So my plan was just to go home and cool off and think it over.\n\nShe asked me if I still want to go to my place as we get to my car. I say, \"actually I'm just gonna drop you off and go home by myself, I'm sorry\" trying to sound normal. And she says \"what? when were you planning on telling me this?\" and continues in her aggressive tone repeating the questions many times in rapid fashion as I respond with \"just now. I just decided\". She demands to know why and I say because how she's acting. And then she starts to lose it more and shoots off all these questions in a row until I tell her I think it was fucked up that she calls her host mom a bitch and it sounds like she thinks very negatively about girls having sex. And then she tells me of course she didn't mean it in a negative way and that she doesn't speak English that well and can't explain what she meant. Then shouts that I'm crazy like 5 times, tells me to go fuck myself, that I need to see a therapist, and idk what else for 5 minutes nonstop until we got to her place and she said \"bye forever\". And so far it has been bye forever.\n\ntl;dr: I got mad at my ex's aggressive speaking style and offensive word choice, and I wanted to go home alone instead of boink. She calls me crazy for getting upset and misunderstanding her and tells me \"bye forever\"",

      "description": "So this happened a really long time ago. I must have been 17 at the time, and I'm 29 now, but sometimes when I try to go to sleep this situation still bothers me. \n\nFlashback to when I was about 17, a friend I knew middle school sent me a message on Myspace, or something like that. She had moved about 8 hours away, but said she was coming back to my home town for a little bit and wanted to hook up. Nearly all of her messages were sexual from the start. Being single, I figured \"why not\". We dated for a few weeks in middle school, but I figured we were past that since it was kid shit anyway. Given her approach, I figured it was going to be a no-strings-attached kind of thing, since she was just visiting.\n\nShe gets here, we meet up and hook up for a couple nights. I tell her I was kinda dumb for breaking up with her in middle school, since that decision was mostly made based on the opinions of my friends at the time. I was in no way saying I wanted a relationship with her then, just kind of reflecting on how stupid I was when I was 13. \n\nSo messages me on AIM when she's supposed to go back to where she lived. She asks me where we are at, and I just say,\"What do you mean? You're going back to (place where she lives) and I'm gonna be here. I thought you just wanted to hook up, and I don't wanna be in a long distance relationship.\"\n\nIt's kinda hazey, but I think she said she was moving back to my home town and was expecting that we would be together based on the fact that we hooked up. I told her it was a misunderstanding, and that I didn't wanna be in a relationship, and then I get mutual friends calling me and saying she's crying and that I'm an asshole.\n\nIf you ask me, she tried to manipulate me into being in a relationship with her, but I still kinda feel like an asshole.",

      "title": "AITA for not greeting my family who came from Colorado for 1 week to see us in New Jersey?",
      "description": "I have social anxiety disorder and this family is super sweet. Husband, wife and 4 kids (one girl 14, one girl 16, one boy 18 and one girl 23). I miss them so much, but on the first day they came, I couldn’t get myself out of my room to speak with them. My room door was closed. I’m so shy and timid and they probably see me as an asshole. I see me as an asshole. The next day they visited, I decided to at least say hi. But I was so nervous and shy. I needed an alibi to be safe so I can get out and not get so anxious. So I shook their hands and hurried off to work I was nervous about it—my cousins are so cute and sweet, and I want to ask all about their lives, but I couldn’t do it.\n\nI had 2 other opportunities to sit with them, and I failed each one. It got so bad that my mom texted me from the living room to go out and greet them and sit with them for at least 30 minutes. I couldn’t. Again. Partly because I blew previous chances of meeting them and **it would be even more awkward to finally sit with them after they’ve been here for 5 days probably anxious to meet me**. So I failed again.\n\nThe thought of going down there gives me so much anxiety, worry and it feels increasingly awkward since I’ve been avoiding them and they have probably developed negative perceptions of me. The kid they knew, loved, and respected in the past did not even greet them when they visit for the first time in a decade—so disrespectful. I was locked in my room, door closed, didn’t even come down for dinner (didn’t eat dinner) didn’t even come down to refill my water bottle. I feel like a piece of ****.\n\nToday I had an opportunity to sit with them, I really wanted to. They are so cute and I love them. In fact the first day they shook my hand briefly, they were so smiley, cute and they all introduced me to everyone—it was so adorable. They were so happy to see me, and they were CUTE! The cuteness gets to me, it makes me cry. And I feel like I literally stabbed them all in the chest. The disappointed look on their face when I said I had to go was traumatic. I left in such a hurry that day and I had nowhere to go—I went to park my car somewhere discreet while browsing social media until they left. \n\nThey go out to the city and have dinners at restaurants and I never once went with them. The idea of eating at a restaurant in public haunts me. I feel like I can’t swallow from the anxiety and fear that I may choke, create an embarrassing scene and then die.\n\nTomorrow is my 6th and last opportunity to greet them, and I KNOW it will not happen. Even thinking of it now kills me. Add that the added awkwardness of me not greeting them for the last 5 days.  Please don’t tell me I must do this—I know I must—but I know I won’t/can’t. \n\nNo one in my family knows I have social anxiety. I’ve been good at covering it up. I am too socially anxious to seek professional help. My parents would come up and urge me to greet them and sit with them, and I would have to make a story to them about how I don’t like them and don’t want to see them and don’t feel like they should be coming to my house every day. My parents are permissive of this for some weird reason but don’t like this. None of what I said to them are true—I love that they come here everyday and I’m sad to know they are leaving soon. I love them so much and there is so much I want to know about them. \n\n**TL;DR** After 10 years, family began visited us for 1 week. I have social anxiety and could not greet them. In fact, I stayed locked in my room everyday they came and was very distant. I was so nervous, shy, and it became awkward each day to meet them;I had multiple opportunities to greet them, but failed each time.  I have another opportunity tomorrow and know it will happen again. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Obligatory on mobile, so formatting yatta yatta.\n\nFirst, a little backstory is in order. \nI am chronically ill and have several conditions that mean I have to see a lot of doctors. Yesterday I went to see my primary care (I haven't seen her in over a year, as I've been seeing specialists instead). She says its not long before one of my organs fails (without seeing any of my tests, or sees my specialists notes, she just assumes and has a bitchy attitude about it). This coupled with lack of sleep because of my job and a bunch of other stressors has left me on edge for two days. I am very volatile, and so I'm isolating myself as best I can to avoid collateral damage while I try to keep my composure. \nOne more piece of info you need is that this co-worker, (we will call him C), and I have been kind of seeing each other. None of our co-workers know, and we've both agreed nobody needs to know. We don't do anything even slightly flirty  at work to avoid arousing suspicion. He also knows I'm stressed and the other day he asked me about my past, and I told him a bunch of stuff that left me feeling very vulnerable and I'm still feeling weird about having told him about it when I know I haven't dealt with it properly.\nFast forward to just a few hours ago. At the beginning of the night, I told him point blank that I am not fit for human interaction as I am in a very bad mood and very volatile, so he was giving me a little bit of space and not engaging me in conversation (which I appreciated). About 20 minutes later, I needed to take a piece of paperwork to another co-worker (K) and with a bit of an attitude said I should make K come to me (I was still going to take K his paperwork, I was just irritable). C tries to take K's paperwork from me to take to him. I told him don't and pulled it back out of his hands. He tried a second time to take it, this time I pushed his entire arm up and away from me (without hurting him, obviously) and told him to knock it off, that I can deal with it. C sounded upset and said \"I'm just trying to help\" and left quickly. I ran to the bathroom and burst into tears before collecting myself and taking K his paperwork. I haven't spoken much to anyone all night, and I have been especially short with C since this happened. He asked if I wanted to hang out during our shift, I declined. He also apologized for \"bothering me\". I didn't respond. I know I'm too irritable to respond in an adult manner, which is why I was avoiding contact in the first place. \nStill, I feel kind of bad that I yelled at him for trying to help, but I feel like he didn't need to do that and that his actions were not work appropriate, considering our agreement. \nAm I the asshole for snapping at my coworker/guy I'm dating?",

      "title": "AITA if I suddenly move out and leave my mom with an unexpected $850 more rent?",
      "description": "In the beginning of August, me (20), my boyfriend, and my mom all moved into an apartment together to be closer to our school/her work. I had been living with just my mom before this and I didn't pay rent and she bought me clothes/groceries/anything else. I did a lot of chores whenever I was told because of course she was providing for me. Now me and my boyfriend both pay 1/3 of the rent each at this new place. My mom pays her 1/3 and the utilities. I buy all of my own clothes and groceries and anything else I want. My mom and I have a rocky relationship due to many reasons.\n\nWhen I was a kid she met a man who became my stepdad and lived with us for 10 years. He was VERY emotionally abusive. He was constantly yelling at me for everything. He would tell me I was stupid, fat, make fun of my acne and my makeup. He was always telling me my opinion didn't matter since I was not an adult. He punched a hole in my bedroom door, threw my lamp against the wall when he was mad at me, broke my phone when I didn't do my chores, I was grounded every  other week for something cleaning related. I was treated like a maid and punished if I didn't do everything after school or didn't do it good enough. One time he made me do his laundry and I got yelled at and called an idiot when I folded his pants \"wrong\". He always told me he would \"beat my ass\" if only my mom would let him. He would smoke in the car and I would get called names when I said something about the smoke blowing back into my face. I had to hear him yell at my mom every night when he got drunk and ripped her favorite purse apart, or tried to rip her wedding ring off her finger. I had to hear him beat our family dog after he ignored him asking to go outside to pee. He made me live in fear of the next time I would be punished. I still immediately shut down when I hear someone yell. Through all of this my mom stood by and watched. For 10 years. She gets annoyed when I bring up any of this. Like I'm supposed to forget about it and never mention it, just so she doesn't feel guilty for not doing anything. She gaslights me when I mention some stuff. I don't think I can ever forgive her for standing by all those years. She divorced him when I was 17. But now she is back with him, going on dates and vacations, staying over at his house. I guess I can't say I didn't expect it but it just makes me feel so bad. He texted me the other day and said him and my mom decided that \"we\" are having thanksgiving dinner at his house this year. I told him \"I can't, I'm going to \\[boyfriend's\\] parent's\", and he called me a \"fucking brat\" to my mom. She agreed with him. I'm so over being treated poorly by both of them. \n\nWhen they were broken up she would go from guy to guy and they would always be put before me. She would go stay at their houses for days when I was still in high school and lived at home. She would go to their/their family's house for every holiday and leave me alone. One time I cried and begged her to stay home and spend time with me, but she refused. This is when our relationship really began to get cold and distant. When I went to college she NEVER asked me how school was going. I would get in the car when she picked me up for weekends/breaks and she would immediately start talking about her boyfriend, what fancy place they were going to this weekend, what food her work provided for her that day. If I brought up something relating to my classes/my life she really just wasn't interested. I would see my friend's/boyfriend's parents being interested in their lives, asking about school and grades and how they were feeling. This hurt me so bad that my mom doesn't care about me like that. I struggled with some very bad depression my first years of college, and I broke down and cried and told her I was depressed and I felt like she didn't love me or care about me and I needed help. Her response was to turn it around and say pretty much \"I guess I'm a terrible mother and you hate me\". She couldn't even try to pretend like she was interested in my life. She is still this way but I have since given up any hope that she will care (I have told her more times how I felt since then and it always ends the same way) and our relationship has gotten even more cold. I got a new job a few months ago and she has seriously never once talked to me about it.\n\nWhen we all moved into this apartment I thought it would be fine. I thought we could just be roommates, whatever. Well first she claims the driveway as her own even though we pay our fair share. We are never allowed to park our car there, we have to park in the visitor lot and walk to the apartment. Okay, she pays utilities I guess. She invited my sister over to spend the night when my sister didn't have a car one time, telling her that she would drive her home the next day. So my sister, her boyfriend, and her kid come over. Her and her boyfriend make out in the living all night, they leave their trash around the apartment, they leave their dirty dishes everywhere, they eat my groceries that I pay for when I didn't expect to have guests over and I have a weekly grocery budget to stick to. The next day she doesn't want to drive them. They are here for 3 days before someone can finally drive them. And I get told that I'm selfish and treating my sister poorly for asking them to please not eat my groceries. I'm not the one who invited them over. I told my mom that I pay the rent here and I have a say in things. She pretty much told me that I don't have a say and to get over it. \n\nThat's the final straw. I thought I would finally be treated like an adult with a say in anything since we all moved in together and we are all paying rent. We yelled at each other the other day because she is trying to give me \"chores\" to do. Now, I am perfectly okay with cleaning. It's my house that I live in too, of course I'm going to clean it. But she is trying to assign me chores that she wants me to have done and I get \"in trouble\" if I don't do them. I don't want to be treated like I'm a kid who doesn't pay rent. Me and my boyfriend do a fair amount of cleaning. We both work 20-30 hours a week and have school for \\~15 hours a week. We are busy and we still do our fair amount of cleaning. \n\nAt this point I have had enough. We are constantly arguing and I'm done being treated like a kid when I pay rent and pay for all of the stuff I need. I am disgusted that she is back with the man who abused me and ruined my teen years. I barely even see her as my mom anymore. She's more like an annoying roommate. I am going to see an apartment on Saturday. I would be moving out at the beginning of December. I can't help but feel guilty though. If we move out then she would have to pay an extra $850 a month. I feel extra bad that it's around Christmas time. I know that she can afford the apartment on her own. She spends a lot of money on random things she wants, like clothes and shoes, so she would just not be living quite as comfortably. She is always shopping. I also have not even told her yet that I'm thinking about moving because I don't know how she will react. She will probably be angry and I do not want to spend the rest of my time here getting treated like shit. I don't even think she wants to live with me either since she told my (ex)stepdad that I'm an ungrateful brat and she can't wait to live alone. The money is the only thing I feel bad about. Am I the asshole for suddenly putting this on her and moving out with no notice? ",

      "description": "So I'm a bit \"rough around the edges\", but definitely not mean. If I have a good idea for a comeback or there's just an easy hit at someone (that someone is always my friend or at the very least someone I know pretty damn well), then I'll take it. Most people just laugh, say \"omg savagee\" and then go about their day. \n\nNow there's this one girl who I sit with in class. I know her pretty well, have done for several years, but wouldn't consider us close friends. Although we tend to hang around the same people. The thing is she's extra sensitive, and I'm mindful of that. I don't treat her the same way I treat everyone else but I don't want to tip-toe around her either.\n\nThe other day she said her cat was staying with her aunt for like a week or smthn bc her parents are away and she doesn't have time to take care of it, idk. But anyway I was like \"ha. I'm jealous your cat can just get away from you like that\" and then she like burst into tears. And everyone in the class looked at me like I was the world's biggest asshole. This kind of shit happens like once a week. And additionally, even when I have tried my very hardest to onLY be nice I find it really hard because she takes hits at me and I can't say anything back. Like she'll say I look fat, joke I'm gonna die alone, blah blah blah. Am I just supposed to sit there and take it just because she cries when I respond? \n\nAdditional info: Overall I'm pretty nice to this girl. I lent her my book, gave up my seat to prom so she could have it (found my own lift), stood up for her several times. Yadayadayada. ",

      "description": "Hey, sorry if this looks awful.. I’m currently on mobile reddit plus I’m pretty inexperienced on posting. Title looks bad but I’ll try my best to explain the situation. This is kind of a long one, so TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nHere’s a little background information: I’m 20 years old living with 2 brothers (18/21, I mention age so everyone knows they’re actual adults not kids) and my mother.\n\nSo, these past few years have been.. kind of turbulent for everyone. We used to live with my mothers ex for over 7 years, my best guess is he helped out economically but he was rather abusive emotionally and mentally towards her. 2 years ago, she decided that it was the right moment to end it finally and move away. Problem being, she didn’t have enough (or basically any) funds as she didn’t have a job. So,  I used all my savings to move us to another home with our grandmother. I mention our grandmother because she was the reason my mother didn’t have a job,  she had Alzheimer’s and my mother cared for her. After the move to this new place, my younger brother dropped out of high school for too many absences and he never sought looking for a job. Every single day, he would just wake up and start gaming.. even asking for money when he knew we were all struggling. A few months into the move, my mother discovered she could get paid to watch my grandmother from home so she finally started making income. The living situation starts becoming easier; my mother looks happier without the abuse (even finding a new boyfriend!) and my older brother and I don’t mind helping out with rent of course. \n\nFast forward to about 3 months ago. My grandmother passed away due to health complications. Completely distraught, my mother decides to move us closer to her boyfriend. However, she didn’t have the funds so we used my savings again (my older brother who works isn’t great with money as he would prefer to spend it on weed and other personal expenses) and so here we are at the current home. My mother somehow had a job at a local waitressing place for a month as she knew the owner (walking distance from the house) but she said she quit due to stress. So I’m left with the rent and other utility bills with my brother. This isn’t the main reason I’m planning on moving out.. I just know I won’t go anywhere in life if things stay this way. My brother is the only one with a car since the one I bought was “given” to a family member (I was under 18 so I guess it was more without my consent) and I can’t save for a car with all the economic responsibility (plus insurance would be pricey) so I had to drop out of college for them as well (transportation/job issues). \n\nAs these few weeks have passed by, my mother and brothers haven’t stepped up. My younger brother doesn’t even help around the house while I’m gone at work. He’ll sleep until noon and stay up on his computer gaming. My mother will party almost every night with her boyfriend and sleep in late to the day as well. I know I sound like I’m ranting, but I can’t specify how.. unmotivated they seem. \n\nHere’s where the move comes in. So, the opportunity I was offered by my friend (who’s military) was to move in with him and his husband and experience a whole new (European) country and eventually get a job there, school etc (basically start a new life) it would initially be rent free, and it‘ll be an escape.  I mention this because I wouldn’t want someone to be confused with me moving out of one place just to have the same responsibility in another place. While this is already all planned, I haven’t told my family yet and I’ve been thinking non-stop about the situation I would probably leave them in.. a conflict. However, my decision is  made. Probably notify them 2-3 weeks prior to my passage. \n\nNow, would I be the asshole for forcing my family to take care of themselves while I attempt to live my own life? \n\nTL;DR Family not working, rely on me and older brother for bills. I’ve planned to move away soon to leave/force them handle their own bills/get jobs. ",

      "description": "Pretty short story. This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?",

      "description": "AITA for wanting gifts on major holidays from my BF? \n\nI (26f)  got very blunt with my boyfriend (33M) recently and told him I wanted to do something for Valentine’s Day and expected a gift. I already have his gift ready and waiting (Call off Duty, he has wanted it for a few months). \n\nY’all we have been together over 18 months. He didn’t get me a present for our one year anniversary this past spring. I also didn’t receive anything for Christmas. Or Valentine’s Day last year. I actually have only gotten one gift from him in almost two years of dating. It was a little thoughtless of a gift too. \n\nI always put a Lot of thought into his gifts and get him unique things he would enjoy but not typically buy for himself. (I.e. roller skates in men’s size 15! A handmade leather whip from Mexico. Etc.) \n\nI don’t want to fight about it but it really hurts me. I feel like he couldn’t even be bothered. I honestly am SO easy to shop for and would’ve been happy with anything, didn’t have to be expensive or thoughtful. Just anything. \n\nOur financial situation is fine. We both have separate transparent finances as well as joint finances. We have a savings. We are set. He even treated himself to a new XBox One recently (clearing it with me as well) ",

      "description": "I'm outspoken, opinionated, and sometimes this gets me in hot water. My fiancee wants to get me cool, thoughtful gifts. I often state that I'm happy with generic gifts well within my taste preferences and interests. I'm also not a jerk though and am polite when anyone goes to the trouble to get me a gift.\n\nA few years ago, she got me some Beats By Dre headphones. Before she giving them, she casually brought it up in conversation and I told her that while it was a thoughtful gift, I probably wouldn't use them. I needed headphones, but I wanted something easy to conceal so I could wear them during work without showing coworkers and customers that I was ignoring them. She left the conversation deflated and I couldn't figure out why.  She later revealed that she purchased them as a Christmas gift but then regifted them after my comment. \n\nFollowing this, she started purchasing generic gifts and I enjoyed them. Gift cards, movie passes, video games, etc. \n\nThis year, she took another chance for my birthday and talked about it all week. She really hoped I'd like it, thought it was cool, thought it was unique and well within my taste. On the final day of our vacation and less than an hour away from the present, we stopped at a sporting good store to pick up a new knife. \n\nWhile walking the store, she found a wood engraved topographical map of our area and asked me what I thought. \"It's cool, I guess, but kind of stupid.\" She stopped talking. \"I mean, I like the idea, but literally everyone has this thing in their house. I think a better map would be all the dead bodies in this lake.\" She laughed with a sheepish, \"Yeah,\" and the conversation abruptly ended. \n\nWhen we got home, she waited for me to sit down and then gave me the present. I looked over the box and saw the shipper \"....topomaps.com\" and my heart just sank. I put on my best face to open the box and pulled out the topo map that I dismissed minutes ago. \n\nI thanked her and told her it was a really thoughtful gift. She wasn't buying it. I really did like the gift, but after my comments in the store, there was no  backpedaling. This began an hour-long apology that left me feeling like IATA.\n\nTl;dr: Fiancee buys thoughtful gifts and can't contain her excitement, so she casually brings it up in conversation. give an honest opinion without knowing she bought it for me and then I feel like IATA when I discover it's a gift.",

      "description": "So my boyfriend was letting me use his computer to write my paper since his laptop is a little better. I saved it on his computer and was going to send it out when I found a few pics of a mutual friend saved from fb in his downloads. They were pics of her at the beach and in a bikini and also one with her in a fancy dress. I confronted him about this and he got really angry at me, telling me that it’s just a porn folder and every guy has one of them. Probably anyone I ever dated has a porn folder with saved pics. I’m totally fine with him looking at porn but it just seems so personal to me that he’s looking at pics of someone we know. Especially since the pics aren’t really for pornographic purposes, they are just from her Facebook. Is it just porn or am I rightfully upset about this? \n\n",

      "description": "Okay, a little background. This girl and I have been seeing each other only for a couple weeks, but we’ve known each other for over a year. Over the weekend she was staying at my place and we have been having a great time. Like we’ve been making each other laugh, cooking together, did a little shopping together, it’s been a good time.\n\nFast forward to today, I have to go help setup for a holiday party that my work is sponsoring. She and I have been part of the planning committee, so we both are helping to set up for the party. Her and I start decorating one room, while other folks on the planning committee are decorating the other rooms. Once we’re all done, her and I get into her car and she says, “I need to go get gas!” I’m just like okay, yeah that’s fine.\n\nOn our way to the gas station we stop at a stoplight and we’re just joking around with each other. Some music is playing and the lyrics said “fuck you thought,” so I repeated it and she said, “What?” I just smiled and said, “Nothing!” Then she laughed and said “Get out.” From there we just joked about me actually getting out, walking away, never to be seen again.\n\nAs we pull into the gas station a minute later, she looks at me and says, “Okay, get out.” And I thought she was continuing the joke from earlier so I just smiled and said “No.” Then she sat there making funny faces for 30 seconds and she repeated, “Get out.” I leaned my seat back and said “No” (playfully) again. \n\nAfter that we just sat there in silence in the car for about 2 minutes before she said, “No seriously. Are we gonna do this or what?” I was confused because I’ve been waiting on her to get out of her car and get gas, so what was it that we were doing? I asked, “What are we doing?” And she responded with, “You need to get out and pump my gas.” I was kind of taken aback to be honest because it’s her car. We’ve only been hanging out as “more than friends” for like 2 weeks. Why would I pump your gas? So I said, “What? No, it’s your car.” Then she responded with, “Oh, so it’s like that.”\n\nAnd she immediately got out after saying that and started to fill up her car. I was honestly confused because I couldn’t tell if she was joking with me or not.. Then she got in the car and she wouldn’t really talk to me. So, it was a silent ride home, she pulled up to my place, dropped me off, and said, “See you tomorrow.” (We work together..) No goodbye kiss/hug/wave. Pure cold shoulder.\n\nAm I the asshole for not pumping this girls’ gas? She didn’t even ask nicely, just kind of demanded that I do it..",

This translates to seeing most of my friends two to three times a month max, so when we get the opportunity to hang out I solely spend my time with them. This is not the case with my girlfriend of two years. I spend most of my week with her, whether it be in school, lunch, after class, whenever; my only reprieve is when she works over the weekend.\nSince we get so much time together I don't invite her out with me when I'm with friends. This turned into an argument today, and I don't feel I am in the wrong. She complains about not knowing my pals, but her classes have my people in them. My girlfriend sees most of my friends in school more often than I do. She knows them all and talks to them often, while I'm stuck seeing them the occasional weekend or break. \nAm I wrong for not ever inviting my girlfriend to hang out with me and my friends?",

Yet he also has a crazy image of himself as a badass who can do almost anything.\n\nIm all for confidence but we will be watching a ufc match and he will legit say \"Man that guy sucks, I bet I could beat his ass.\"\n\nHes dead serious. He has no athletic background and no fighting training yet he thinks he can beat up a pro fighter with 15 years of training.\n\nIll tell him how im progressing on my sprinting and instead of saying \"good job man\" he'll say \"thats cool dude, i can do that too\". After i trained for 4 months every day.\n\nI challenge him to a sprint, I dominate him. He says the only reason i won is because i avoided a puddle and he didnt. Its the most annoying shit. Like why make excuses? Just accept the loss.\n\nRecently hes been having issues with a guy we both know, whose current military and has been for almost 20 years. He starts telling me how he could destroy this guy. I reply that he couldnt, that the guy has literally killed people, then he retorts that in the past he beat up a marine. He has NEVER mentioned this before.\n\nLike why cant you just admit youre not bruce lee? Like whats wrong with being normal?\n\nSo i tell him that hes bullshitting, that he couldn't do the things hes saying, and that he doesnt have to lie to impress me and that its weird.

      "description": "I'll add some background information so that you may know where I'm coming from. \n\nMy mum (38) separated from my dad (49) 2 years ago. The thing is that he married her when she was really young (18), so she never got the chance to travel alone. \nI'm not mad at her for travelling alone, I encouraged her to do it. The problem is that she spent an extraordinarily amount of money in that vacation. She stayed in a hotel that charged her $257 dollars per night. She stayed there 10 days. That's not counting what she spent in the plane tickets, food, transportation,etc. So in total, she spent what she earns in a whole month in that vacation.\n\n I know that what she does with her money is not my business but, she literally doesn't have any money saved. She doesn't even have health insurance. She doesn't have a good credit score because she was a house wife for a good chunk of her youth. I think that it's an incredible stupid decision on her part to spend all her money like that. \n\nI tried to be gentle while telling her that I don't like with the way she spent her money, but she told me that I had nothing to worry about. That she had everything under control and that she needed to find herself, so that's why she had to travel alone. And that this won't be her last alone vacation. That she plans to do it at least once a year. \n\nI know that she doesn't have everything under control. But I don't know what to do. It's not my place to control her, and I sure as hell don't want to. But I want her to be able to peacefully retire. I want her to be able to pay for my sister's (5) education. I want her to be able to have her own house and her own car. But she doesn't know how to save money, and that makes me angry and sad.\n\nI'm sorry that this is too long, and I understand that I may be an asshole for being mad at her for enjoying what she couldn't have when she was really younger. \n\n",

I'm asleep because my sleep schedule is fucked and my meds knock me out for a minimum 12 hours and make me feel pretty groggy when I wake up, so my Mum wakes me up and politely tells me lunch is ready.\n\nNo problem, I get up, put some clothes on, and feeling groggy and gross, go to join them for lunch. Unfortunately they are playing Christmas carols REALLY LOUD, to the point where you have to shout just to have a conversation over lunch. Now, I'm not a fan of Christmas, I feel like it's just a capitalist scheme to make you buy shit, but whatever, I still think it's valuable for time spent with family etc... I politely ask them to turn it down (not off) because I like to be able to actually hear people during a meal. And my brother says \"BUT IT'S CHRISTMAS\" to which I angrily respond \"I DON'T CARE\" - this makes my Mum turn away and start crying (maybe because I was an asshole, maybe because of the deterioration of my mental health, I don't know). My brother said something like \"good one, idiot\". I didn't apologise but I feel we ended up having an okay-ish meal.\n\nAITA? Even though I was in a fairly shitty state and didn't want to interact with people, I feel I was doing my best and I didn't think it was unreasonable to turn the headache-inducing (in my groggy state) music down so that I could have an audible conversation over lunch, especially since there were only three of us having a quiet meal, so it's not like I was killing a family party. While I do think I maybe responded a little strongly, I don't think it was to the point of being an asshole. What do you think?",

      "description": "My mom invited my sister (19) from out of state to stay with us in our home since my sister is unemployed and my mom pays her rent, but now my mom is running out of money and my sister refuses to either move somewhere cheaper or move in with us. So my mom thought that by flying her down for a week, we could convince her that this city is a nice place to live and it wouldn't be that bad to either move into our house or get a cheaper apartment here.\n\nAs we're showing her around the city, my sister says that she won’t move into our house, but that she'll get an apartment here only if she can have a roommate who she already knows, but doesn't know anyone here. I (20F) offer to get a job and be her roommate, but she refuses until I prove to her that I can hold a job for more than 3 months. Now this makes me angry because I have held two jobs for 3 and 1/2 months and 6 months respectively while I was in high school. I have had a string of jobs in college but was never put on the schedules enough to pay my own rent. So I moved into my parent’s home while I tried to find better work.\n\nShortly after I moved in my dad started sexually abusing me (which he had been doing since I was little), so my mom and I fled to the state we currently live in to get away from him. My mom now has significantly less money without my dad's income and I briefly worked down here to help her out, but my mom insists that it’s fine if I don’t work since the stress of school, work, and dealing with the trauma of my dad’s abuse can be overwhelming sometimes. My sister knows all of this - about my father abusing me, my mom having less money, and how I've already held shitty jobs for longer than 3 months.\n\nWhen we get home from showing my sister around the city, she goes outside for a smoke and my mom and I take the opportunity to discuss whether or not my mom could even afford to pay my sister's rent for 3 more months while I prove to her that I can keep a job for that long. As we're discussing it, I add that I'm pretty angry my sister is even making me do this since she is also unemployed and has never held jobs for very long either. Just when I get done saying this, she walks into the room, clearly having heard everything. Apparently she had come back inside the house and my mom and I never even heard her. So now she's pissed at me and I feel like an asshole. I do understand that it's shitty of me to talk about these things behind her back instead of bringing my concerns to her, and I do understand why she would want me to get a job first before she makes the commitment to having me as her roommate. But my mom and I were planning on telling her these things anyway when she came back inside the house, and I feel like we were justified in what we were saying, even if it wasn't to her face. Idk. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I live in a fairly rural area but we have a 4 town joint facebook group for buying, selling, and trading items-similar to a widespread online yard sale or a local craigslist. When buying items you meet up in personal in public places and trade the cash for the item.\n\nTonight a woman, let's call her Sherry, hosted a sale post for a figurine from a limited edition, no longer purchasable McFarlane collection. It appears to be in very good condition in the photos and could easily be resold for upwards of 150$ or more. She then hosted ANOTHER one from the same set, and both figures she's only asking 20$ each. \n\nI requested to buy the first figure, and to be honest I don't plan to resell it. I want it for my house. That being said, the lady was very clearly unaware of what she has and doesn't even know the name of the figurine since it is no longer in the box. Although it was her choice to price it as she did and not do further research, I feel a bit guilty and almost like I am exploiting her lack of knowledge of the item. \n\nShould I offer her a little more money for it? Should I tell her what it's really worth? Or should I just take that she posted it for 20$ and pay exactly that? I'm probably really overthinking it, but I know if it was me making a sale on an item and accidentally priced it way too low I'd be very upset later. \n\nTL;DR: A woman is offering to sell me a ~150+$ figurine from McFarlane co. for 20$, WIBTA for not telling her it's true worth?",

He was freaking out and I find that absolutely hilarious, hopefully it will make him think twice about sending his wrinkly mole to strangers again. \n\nNow for my part - over the years I've been sent many unsolicited dick pics via FB &amp; the gram from strangers and people I actually know irl.

I used to have a thing for Amy when we first met, but nothing ever really came of it and we became really good friends. \n\nBetty and I dated for about half a year about four years ago, and separated due to her moving away to another state. We got back together about two years ago, and have since gotten married and had a beautiful son together.\n\nEver since Betty and I had gotten back together I don't really talk to Amy anymore. We maybe text each other a few times a month just to kinda keep in touch. Amy also lives in a different state than us.\n\nMy wife has always had a grudge against Amy even before we started dating though. They know each other, and Amy wasn't always the nicest person to my wife. Me and Amy remained close over the years. I even went to visit her a few times over the years when Betty and I weren't together. Amy and I also got matching tattoos together one of the times that I went to visit her.\n\nMy wife has said that she was okay with me talking to her now, but in the past she didn't want me to talk to her at all. I've always respected her opinion and always wanted to put our relationship first. I still feel she is uneasy about any communication I have with Amy, due to the fact that I had strong feelings for Amy in the past, and that we remained close all these years even when me and Betty weren't together.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "Hey, first time posting in this subreddit. Bear with me if I do anything wrong!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm in colorguard/ winterguard, which is a team activity that requires us to perform at competitions every Saturday against others in our division. Because it's so performance-based, every teammate plays a role in the show. I don't have any solos or anything, but if I'm not there, the drill (where everyone is supposed to be and move to, etc. etc. Think of marching band formations i guess?) can get messed up and the judges will see that someone is missing. Thing is, the judges might also think that we simply don't know where we're supposed to be going and dock points from our final score.\n\nAside from that, I've also missed a ton of practices this season already due to the fact that I've got an immune system as strong as a house of cards and depression that's been flaring up bad these past few months. So I'm basically already the team's weakest link.  \n\n\nNow, as the title says, the reason why I would be missing competition is because my grandpa is currently in the hospital and I don't think I'd be able to focus well during our performance because I'd be worrying about him. Apparently, he's been vomiting so badly that he passes out and his heart stops beating for a few seconds. HOWEVER, my mom (who flew back to China yesterday to be with my grandpa) says that he's currently doing okay. My dad is pretty certain my grandpa will be fine. So really, there's not much reason for me to be missing competition, especially because this is our penultimate comp.  \n\n\nI'll be honest, here. I hate colorguard this season. Part of the reason I think I'm so depressed is because I absolutely despise my teammates because they're all so mean to each other and they treat me like I'm garbage for missing practice. I am crazy worried about my grandpa, but deep down, I think I'm eager to be missing competition because I just don't want to go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends all say I'm justified regardless because my teammates suck and because it's not healthy for me to deal with so much stress, but I'm just not sure. I feel like my reasons are so skewed.  \n\n\nSo... am I the asshole?   \n",

      "description": "So I don't have many talents, but gaming happens to be one of them. Video games, board games, even trivia games I'm all above average at. My girlfriend also enjoys games, particularly video games, but isn't as skilled with them as I am. This is truly not a brag, it's relevant.\n\nMy girlfriend is also the competitive sort. She frequently challenges me to different games and I almost always beat her. Out of 100 games, she might win 5 or 10 regardless of the type of game. This ends with her getting very angry, storming off or giving me the silent treatment for awhile.\n\nI understand it's frustrating to lose that often especially when you're a competitive person, so I've suggested that we just don't play against each other. She didn't like that idea. I've offered to help her practice so she could improve, but she felt that was insulting. I've tried to purposely play less than my ability, but she noticed and that made her even more mad.\n\nIt's at the point now where gaming with her isn't even fun for me, because I know I'll win and she'll get a chip on her shoulder. It also seems to be less about having fun with me and more about being able to beat me for her which upsets me. \n\nWhen we do activities that she's good at (paintball, various sports, artistic things) she blows me out of the water. It doesn't upset me, I'm proud of her. She's more educated than me, has a higher paying job than me and is objectively more socially successful and attractive than me. It's not like I overshadow her in all walks of life, so I don't understand where her need to win is coming from.\n\nI've been called an asshole more times than I can count for repeatedly beating her when we play games. Not looking for validation, but honestly wondering what I'm doing wrong. Am I The Asshole for winning?",

For the past 2 years I consistantly see all of them together at someone's house without mentioning anything to me. At the beginning I just assumed they forgot about me, but obviously not after 2 years. Whenever I join the discord and they are talking about hanging out, they all go silent. One of my friends let it slip that they have a whole group chat to plan when they hang out and I'm obviously not in it. The thing is we already have a group chat so they went through the effort of making a new one with everyone else but me in it. The thing is I don't even see a reason for them pretending to be my friend. Some are in my classes at school and I help them out and share homework, but some aren't even in any classes of mine. Am I over reacting or is it time to find new friends? Wow I feel much better after typing this rant. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

Almost right after lunch, as I'm getting my stuff to leave school. My friend comes up to me with her and says, \"Bro, cut that shit out.\" \"It's not funny.\" I had to lie and say that I was kidding and it was a joke. AITA?\n\nTLTR: My ex broke up with me. Dated two of my friends. Confronted me about calling her a thot. I liked and said it was a joke.",

The waitress who served me was quite cute; I chatted her up a bit and found her pleasant and easy to talk to. I realize (moreso now) that this is her job, obviously, but it had some effect on me. It occurred to me to ask her out. So, after I'd paid up and was making my exit, I caught her in an idle moment and asked her if she'd like to have coffee with me sometime. She said yes, and we exchanged numbers. \n\nSo, post game analysis time... I dunno how it didn't occur to me at the time, but I've realized that this might have been a shitty thing to do. A customer making a come-on, *while you're at work* - not cool in the least, right? Now I'm thinking she just said yes to get this weirdo out of her hair while she's on her shift. \n\nAITA?

      "description": "Back story: love my mom (I'm F early 20's). She's a great person, maybe not a great mom. She's an alcoholic, but is so positive and upbeat. My step dad passed away June 2018 from cancer. He's been in my life for more than half of it, Idk my bio dad irl. My mom went through some rough shit with that. They had JUST moved down south when he was diagnosed, so she never had any familial support, or friends really. Her whole existence was caring for my step dad. Him and I didn't really get along when I was growing up, I moved out at 16. He was also an alcoholic, but mean. As I grew older and didn't have rely on them, the three of us we're able to mend our relationship, to a point, and have good memories. I would never wish pancreatic cancer on my worst enemy. Watching him go through that really changed my perspective on all of my relationships, and how I handle conflict. \n\nMy mom said she was going to stay down south, much to me and my family's grumblings (we're in NY). About 4months after his death, mom starts talking about these new drinking buddies. Slowly she starts talking more about this guy Randy. \n\nSide story: when I was 10 I asked Mom for my bio dad's name. Panicking, she told me a random name. \"Randy\". I've never met a Randy my whole life. So from 10-18 I believed my bio dad's name was Randy. And then my 18th birthday comes and my mom gives me two (real) names that could be my bio dad, so I can find him if I ever wanted to (I did, haven't met). So 10-18 years old I truly believed my dad's name out there was Randy. The day I found out it wasn't, I think traumatized me more than my mom realized...\n\nSo of course I was like wtf universe. Well, over the last couple months mom has stopped going to counseling, she is day drinking, and any time I ask her what she's up to it's always oh we're going to Randy's show (he's an open mic-er) or Randy's cooking dinner (I think he's living in her apartment), it's ALL about Randy. She's not doing stuff for HER. She hasn't unpacked boxes or done important paper work regarding my step dad's death. She's not eating healthy and is drinking/high 100% of the time when she's not working. She has some money from my step dad's death and I'm afraid this guy is using her. He's younger than her. Idk you guys can tell me if I'm an asshole making assumptions too. \n\nANYWAYS. Recently I've been getting on my streaming accounts and seeing that stuff I KNOW my mom wouldn't watch is in my \"keep watching\". I pay for Hulu and Netflix (she pays for the HBO add on). \n\nAITA for thinking about asking my mom to start paying for at least one of the services if Randy is going to use it? Like I said I think he's living with her, and I know people grieve in all sorts of ways and I literally cannot judge her for anything she does bc it's not my job to tell Mom she can't have a young bf after a tragedy BUT I just want her to be happy and healthy and this guy ain't it sis.",

He tells me we’ll be fine money wise.\n\nOn the way, we park in the free parking(Further walking) and walk along the Hoover Dam.\n\nWe get to Vegas, of course there is a lot of walking. Surprisingly, my feet don't hurt, only my calves. Tylenol only if necessary because I have high liver enzymes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe take our daughter to the Midway for 2 days, but those two days are spent with my bf telling me we're running low on money and will not be able to go to the places we want until Friday, payday. I suspect it's because he's been playing the slots and smoking every chance he gets, which is while we're getting ready in the morning or after dinner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriday morning comes and he comes out of the bathroom, tells me he got a room at Excalibur.\n\nNo complaints about my feet. But on the 3rd day as we're checking in, I just want to get in the room and relax.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we're standing in line, he tells me to go sit down while he waits to check us in. I tell him I'm fine and can wait with him. We go through the same conversation a 2nd time and he tells me \"I can tell you're annoyed, just go sit down.\" I tell him I can be annoyed if I want to. Then he starts speaking louder about how I'm always this way and how I'm going to ruin his night. So I walk away. He calls and tells me to come and get the luggage. \"No, I'm sitting down.\" He then says, \"I should've left you the first time, you will never change.\" We had reconciled a month earlier and everything was good and in his words, could tell I was really trying to make it work. I started seeing a therapist and learning new ways to cope and communicate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after this, we argue and he keeps mentioning he regrets staying. So I tell him, I'm going home then. I want my car keys and debit card, which he kept. At this point he starts apologizing and telling me he didn't mean any of it. That he doesn't want me to be annoyed because I'm depressed and drag him down with me. Let's not forget Vegas was his idea. He's a heavy gambler and smoker. I've been trying to make it work between us, keeping him happy at home and doing all I can to keep us together as a family. I work 60 hours a week too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut am I the asshole for being worried about money while in Vegas and the one time my feet hurt while standing, I told him I can deal with it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR In Vegas for a couple nights at Circus Circus, bf ends up reserving a room at Excalibur for the 3rd night without telling me. I have Plantar Fasciitis. Walked a lot for 3 days. Didn't complain until 3rd day and was about my calves being sore. Because I didn't want to sit down, I'm ruining his night and he should've left me. The one argument we've had since reconciling a month ago and he's talking to me this way. Couldn't get it out of my head the next day and told him how I felt after breakfast. He in turn put all the blame on me -----",

      "description": "It’s my best friends birthday today, we also live together. It’s a milestone birthday and so I went all out in getting her a number of gifts, all wrapped separately and thrown into a large gift bag. \n\nThere were two main gifts: Top quality wrist guards for skating and a very expensive mascara that she’s wanted for some time (and honestly it’s a really good brand, I’ve also really wanted it but would never spend that much on myself). \n\nWe had plans to go out for dinner to celebrate her birthday so naturally I got ready and waited at home for her to finish work and then go for a quick skate with friends. Presumably, she’d be back home at around 7pm and we’d go out and have a few drinks and a nice meal.\n\nAlthough the time flicked past 9pm and she still hadn’t returned, a quick text confirmed that she was still out skating and forgot to let me know that she was staying out late and flaking on dinner. I decided what the heck, I REALLY like that mascara and she has a load of other still really good gifts from me. \n\nI felt like shit because I’d ensured I’d be in town tonight for her birthday and dodged other plans to make myself available. Taking the mascara felt good at the time and as a little bit of justice, but in reflection it’s a pretty shitty act. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for likening my wasted time to an expensive bottle of mascara? Or should I have just given it to her and presumed she’d make it up to me at a later date? ",

      "description": "This is kind of a long one so buckle up.\n\nI live in residence at my university.\n2 days ago my room mate approached me and asked if I would be willing to switch rooms with one of his friends down the hall. My room mate would get up at 7 each morning for class, and 2 nights out of the week I would come home late due to uni related events. He said it wasn’t anything personal, but that our schedules don’t match up and he wanted to live with his friend. I didn’t think much of it, and so I said yeah I’ll meet with the other room mate (I’ll call him K) and see what it’s like.\n\nI chat with K who would become my new room mate, and he seems like a normal enough guy. Same faculty as me, all he mentioned was that he liked the windows open cause he didn’t do well with the cold. Fair enough. I tell my current roommate that it should be fine and I’m down to switch.\n\nSo the next day I meet the guy I’d be switching with (I’ll call him E). He seemed nice too, and we went about moving our clothes and bedsheets from one room to the other. Once we’re done moving everything, E says to me “oh by the way, K likes to sleep with a light on”. I was kind of surprised but figured he meant a small night light or something, but E had a blindfold so that was kind of sketching me out. I asked to borrow the blindfold just in case, but figured the light couldn’t have been that bad. I asked if there was anything else I should know and he said no, and so we went to sign the papers because at this point I figured there wasn’t anything too bad.\n\nFast forward to last night. I get back to my new room with K at about 12. I had a midterm the next day, so I wanted to get to sleep around 12:30. I asked him if I could shut the lights out to go to sleep, and he said he likes to keep his half of the room on while he stays up doing homework on his computer (why he needs lights on for his computer I’ll never know. The lights are also super bright-the entire room may as well be on). I was pretty taken aback, but didn’t want to start an argument the first night so I tried to sleep with my blindfold. It was impossible. And the window being closed made it boiling hot. To top it all off, he was on the phone with family at around 1 in the morning talking. I finally got to sleep at around 3 am when he went to sleep himself and I was able to talk him into turning the lights off.\n\nI woke up at 7 AM the next morning to his alarm, which is totally fine, he has class. But he flicked on the lights. So now I was awake and not happy. I kept it together and asked what he was doing; long story short, he claims he absolutely needs the lights on to get dressed. At this point I’m aware I’m screwed and need my old room back, cause I’m now dealing with a room mate who;\n- is up until 3 every night and wakes up at 7\n-talks on the phone at 1 am\n-doesn’t let me turn off the lights to go to sleep and wakes me up in the morning by turning them on \n-never opens the window and refuses to let me open it\n\n\n\nA few hours later (couldn’t get back to sleep) I go to have a talk with E about switching back to my old room. I tell him that he didn’t disclose what the situation was like and I feel like I was put in an unfair situation. He said that he thinks he told me and that he also didn’t have time to tell me about it, which is definitely bs because it took like 40 minutes to switch our stuff around. I told him that I only switched because I thought my room mate wanted the switch, as that’s what I was told, and that he (E) purposefully withheld info and lied about his intentions to switch so that I’d agree. He denied this, and then said that it’s more my fault than his, because I didn’t ask (I did) and he isn’t really to blame here, and I am in the wrong.  That shocked me quite a bit and I couldn’t wrap my head around how he thinks I am in the wrong as opposed to himself, and he is now refusing to switch back rooms and I can’t do anything about it without his permission (I have tried). \n\nSo, AITA for wanting to switch back into my old room, after the guy I switched with didn’t disclose what the room mate was like? \n\nJust trying to see if E is right and I’m actually being an asshole or if I’m correct in feeling he is.\n",

It’s really sweet that she always wants to think of me and do something cute but I’m trying to make myself better and she’s not helping. Everytime I ask her not to do it she says, “You’re not even fat” and does it anyway. The only reason I’m not grossly overweight is that I play 3 sports and I’m always in the gym, even then I have a dad bod. She got me a basket for my birthday, two for Halloween, one for Christmas, one for New Years, and two for Valentine’s Day. \n\nWhen she came over yesterday she saw that I hadn’t touched the candy in my basket. She was upset that I didn’t appreciate her basket so I was sarcastic and told her, “It’s not like I told you 5 or 6 times that I didn’t want junk food”. She got mad at me and it was the first time she’s ever been mad at me for more than a day or two after a year of dating. It’s not threatening to our relationship but I think I hurt her feelings. \n\nI would’ve just thrown it away without telling her but I don’t want her to waste money on candy that im not gonna eat",

Today i got an email from a small liberal arts college i’ve applied to saying that i’m being considered for a scholarship program that’s worth up to 34k a year. which i know is a lot of money for a college student to be making. thing is, there’s a lot about this school that i don’t really like. it’s very much a safety for me, it’s in the middle of nowhere, it isn’t known for what i want to study. basically everything about it screams “you will have a shitty time here.” but at the same time, this is a lot of money i could potentially be getting. \n\nTL;DR A college I don’t want to go to is offering me a lot of money to go there.

      "description": "Listen I'm all for guys having confidence in themselves and going after girls that they are attracted to. But after so much rejection and everything else, isn't it a saying that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result?\n\nCouple things going against my friend:\n\nHe just turned 27 and he is a virgin. Now there's nothing wrong with that but he's never even kissed a girl in all 27 years, never had a GF or anything close to it. \n\nMy friend is very short (5'3\") and he is not in shape. He wants to get in shape and goes to the gym but his diet is terrible. He eats the same thing everyday: cheese quesadilla for breakfast, tequito's or pizza rolls for dinner, whatever fast food he can find for lunch. He's afraid of trying new things and is just very awkward around women. \n\nHe keeps developing crushes on these girls that he has no shot with and then gets frustrated when they \"friendzone\" him. He likes going after extraverted, party girls who like clubbing and going to bars and I told him, he's not the type of guy these girls are looking for. \n\nSo I told him, if you aren't blessed to be born tall (or even average height) and handsome you need to be at least 2 of the following three: \n\n1. Good looking \n2. Great personality\n3. Successful in your career \n\nNow good looking is something you can't help sometimes but at least be in shape. Great personality means you can make girls laugh or you're a great conversationalist or easy to get along with. Successful doesn't mean rich but at least have a stable job and the ability to provide and pay your own bills. \n\nI told him if you aren't any of the above 3 then why would any of these girls want to date you? He needs to lower his standards but he got all pissy when I said that, saying \"I'm not gonna lower my standards like these girls are better than me\". Blah blah\n\nAm I the asshole for trying to be real with him? ",

      "description": "So, I've been friends with this dude for a while. We would message a lot, He's like an older brother to me.\n\nMid last year my mental health was deteriorating *fast.* And it still is pretty downhill. The dude would frequently ignore my messages despite being online (which is a big trigger for my anxiety and can cause bad episodes.) and then appear again talking about how he's such a bad friend and it won't happen again. I'm very aware that no one needs to spend 100% of their time on me but it would go on for months at a time where he'd actively ignore my messages.\n\nDuring one of those periods he, out of no where, sent me an image saying he had just overdosed and was being taken to hospital. Now, being who I am with my mental health, I'm very easily triggered. It triggered me so bad that I had to be removed from class and couldn't focus in any of my others. He didn't send anything else and to my memory didn't talk to me for a while after that either. \nFinally at some point, I was sick of being ignored and just dropped him. Removed him from all my social media and didn't talk to him for a while.\n\nThat is, until I opened my school email a couple months ago during the summer holidays. I had a message one of my school accounts for some website we were using in one of my classes a couple years ago. It was a message from him. I reconnected and we seem okay now.\n\nI'm disturbed that he searched all around the internet and messaged my school account just to get to me. I dropped him for my own health, as my safety came first to me and being actively ignored or possibly triggered was a big thing keeping me from being safe. Again, things seem okay now, we're friends again I guess but I still lay awake at night wondering if what I did was wrong or not.\n\nIn hindsight, the way I dropped him was a bit scary in his shoes. I think he though I had gone and offed myself, which wasn't an unlikely possibly at the time.\n\nSo, *am* I in the wrong, if it was to keep myself safe?",

      "description": "Throwaway account for reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my (27F) boyfriend (28 M) and I have been in an open relationship ever since we met and are getting married in a couple months. We both do not believe in monogamy and are cool with each other having fwbs and casual dates. Trust, honesty and openness has been a major part of our relationship. We tell each other everything including about our dates and the extent to which it goes. We are genuinely happy for each other. I must note that I when we met, I had severe communication and trust issues due to a lot of childhood abuse and had to work a lot to overcome them. He's been the best thing to ever happen to me and has helped me become a much better person. He feels the same way about me too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe has had a few fwbs in the past year and I've had just one fwb whom I share a very good connection with. I had to work a lot to improve my communication but now I've reached a point where I can be incredibly vulnerable with him and share every single detail with him. He says it's the same for him too. So, here's the issue.. Recently he went on a date(?) with one of his good friends who is in a rocky monogamous relationship that might end anytime. After the date, he told me he had a great time and they got to know each other a lot more but it didnt go anywhere physically with her. I was happy that he had a great time but confused a bit coz she's still in the monogamous relationship. Anyway its been a few days now and today while we were talking, he tells me that she was heavily flirting with him on the date and when he went in for a kiss, she rejected it. The reason he didn't tell me earlier is coz he felt extremely embarrassed from the rejection and felt bad for putting someone in an awkward situation. I told him I'm hurt and need time to process. He feels horrible for hurting me and says he just needed time to get over the awkwardness before telling me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for feeling like  a) He hid it from me and it's not fair ? I had to work through severe communication issues to be vulnerable with him and it feels like he shouldn't have hidden it from me. b) Trying to kiss her even though she's still in the relationship? I know she's super interested in my boyfriend but he should be more responsible? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or am I overreacting? I really need help understanding. Any input is appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTldr: In an open relationship. Boyfriend went on a date and hid the details of it from me for a few days. AITA for being upset or should I stop bothering about trivial things?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I decided to open it later on my own and just sit and talk to her.\n\nI don't know why but I shared some \"what if\" thoughts with her about breaking up and how our relationship is not necessarily rock-solid from my point of view.\n\nShe obviously was sad and she was speaking in a less-exciting-than-usual tone, I assured her that these are just thought I wanted to share and I'm definitely not thinking about leaving her.\n\nafter a while, she went to her class and I went to my car and decided to open the gift; the gift is a bunch of pictures and probs that represent our memories and some of my favorite things and hobbies; like a movie clapper board with my name written on it because my dream job is to become a director, an owl toy because it's my favorite animal, and a bunch of other stuff and love letters that made me feel like such an asshole, But my intention was never to make her sad, I just wanted to share these thoughts with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I an asshole or is it just a very bad coincidence?",

She would try to play with their hands, ask them to “carry her” , dance with them, throughout the amusement park etc. She even made her friend  Ashley (who she brought from school) sit by strangers on the rides at the amusement park in order to sit with one of my guy friends and hold their hands, and even forgot about her! \n  Now she is planning events with ONLY my guy friends, and invites me along to attend her flirt-fest. I find it kind of weird and it makes me feel uncomfortable but does it make me an asshole? Idk. \n I miss it being the two of us, but now every time we hang out she invites them and it makes me feel like she is just using me to get attention from guys that I’m friends with. \nAITA?

      "title": "AITA for getting pissed at my friend and his family in their house?",
      "description": "A few important things first, I live on my friend's couch right now because it was that or end up homeless. He was kind enough to allow me to sleep on his couch rent free until I'm able to afford an apartment myself. I'm extremely grateful for it, and plan on paying him back when able.\n\nThe rules laid down for me were that I must find a job (already done) and I must help his wife around the house with chores and their kids. It was all good at first, and my friend and I were excited to be best friends again after years of not seeing each other. I'd been warned their kids were wild, but I'm ok with wild.\n\nHowever, upon moving in, I started to notice they don't really parent their kids much. No times outs, never take things away, and they rarely ever spank them. I wouldn't care if it weren't for the fact they are EXTREMELY destructive, violent and overall undisciplined. They haven't even put their oldest in school yet (he's 6 turning 7 soon).\n\nAn example of things I get mad over is when the kids destroyed my JoyCons for my Switch (which were thankfully a different color, as they have a Switch as well). When I confronted them, they both shrugged their shoulders and said \"Well you shouldn't have left it in their reach,\" with the wife following up saying \"I thought they were ours because you leave yours up.\" While true, I was a little thrown off by how \"F*** it\" they were about it, not even offering to pay for part of a new set. I left it alone, since I'm living there rent free, but I was still pissed about it.\n\nLater that night, my friend brought up going grocery shopping, reminding me to do it as if I didn't already go with them weekly. Mind you, as part of helping take care of their kids, I also buy them food whenever I get myself some, so as not to just eat in front of them (This is on top of the shopping I already do). I was a bit thrown off he approached me about it like that. I think he did it because that week I hadn't gone shopping with them (I work graveyard shifts, so I was asleep when they left. They didn't tell me they were going/wake me up). I brought it up to him a few days later, saying I didn't appreciate that he talked to me like I'm one of his children, and that I don't need to be reminded of stuff I'm already doing. He again brushed it off, saying that I must have taken it the wrong way. Since we were best friends, I took him at face value and left it at that. I also generally know where he's coming from, as the last dude who lived with them was apparently a nightmare, and I think they're trying to prevent me from being like him.\n\nToday, after feeding my cat, his wife had decided to bring the cats in. I'm never too fond of this, as I have to sit next to my cat when they come in to make sure she gets enough to eat. I ran out to my car to grab something, and when I came back, their cat was standing over my cat's food while the wife gently pulls the cat away. This was doing nothing, as he'd walk right back thinking she was petting him. When I vocalized that I was sick of having to watch my cat eat, she immediately got pissy and said how her cats never get to come in because of my cat (found out she isn't good with other animals when we moved in), and that she doesn't like my that she can't have her kids at the table to eat because \"you said your cat will eat their food.\" This is not true, as my cat has never eaten human food, or even shown interest, and I angrily corrected her, saying I'd never said that. At this point, I'd decided to just leave for work 2 hours early, and now I'm posting this on Reddit.\n\nThere is more, and I'd be happy to clarify/elaborate on anything. Where my AITA question comes in is that I know when I get off work today, my friend is going to be having a conversation again about me disrespecting them in their house. I'm not going to pretend that I've never gotten angry at them, but at this point I feel like it's rational that I'm angry, and that I myself am also being disrespected. I don't think it's fair they allow past roommates to influence how they act towards me, as they've known me long enough to know I don't do any of the stuff they're worried about. On top of that, they already know based on my actions that since I'm living rent free, I'm willing to pay them back as they see fit (which for now they've decided my labor and grocery shopping will suffice). I've helped fix up their yard that their dog dug up, I've been cleaning up after their kids, and I've done everything I can to help out. AITA here for getting pissed off at them?",

      "description": "Requesting that only people who have been in similar situations respond (obviously for those who have no gang affiliated family the answer would likely be NTA).\n\n**Background:** I (F25) love my cousin (M26). We're extremely close and he's basically a brother. He grew up with a hard life. He had a single mother who has mental issues where she treats him horribly. She used to leave him alone so often that he joined the Bloods and was even shot at one point before he was 10 years old. Eventually he was taken away from her in his early teens and moved in with my dad's brother. He was the bad apple of the family from there on out. He used to take a lot of drugs, sell drugs, steal from houses and family, fight etc. Most of my family stopped associating with him after he was 18 because he stole from family.\n\nAround that age I was interested in smoking weed so we connected at some point and became pretty close doing things we're not supposed to. There were times where he went to jail and I'd help him three-way his mom or son (he was never okay with being deadbeat). He would help me out by giving me things, giving me advice, generally being supportive - it was in no way a one sided relationship. Eventually he ended up going to prison for 2 years and lost everything. Since he's gotten out we've only gotten closer and instead of an enabling type friendship - we've started encouraging each other to be better people. He talks about how he regrets how he was when he was younger all the time and that the culture shock of coming from a broken home was a big factor.\n\n**Summary:** While he continually fucks up - I do genuinely believe he wants to turn his life around. The issue is that he wants to turn his life around HIS way. He still has a street mentality (ex. he loves posting pictures of his money, still claims Blood and says it's impossible for him not to be, he always seems to find the crowd that's up to no good). He says he's saving to enroll in cooking school (this is true), but hustling in the meantime.\n\nTBH I'm pretty tired of being emotionally invested in him turning things around if he's still going to be stupid in so many ways. After his last FB posts making blatant references to illegal activity &amp; gang affiliation - I just randomly blocked him. Now he's texting me asking why he's blocked and how dare I block him without having talked about things. We've talked about it multiple times and he continues to do things that could get him in trouble. Especially when he's not completely broke anymore - At some point not getting a real job is a choice, no?\n\nI'm open to explaining myself, but ultimately I realize that I'm the one that has the problem with how he's doing things. We don't even see each other regularly now, but just seeing what he's up to pisses me off. AITA for wanting to cut ties even though he hasn't directly done anything to me (recently)?",

This dude started to grind on me while laughing with his friends, about 2 minutes of him doing this I pushed him down and started to scream and \"punch\" him (it was really light).

      "description": "One of my little sisters (14F) has sort of gone off the rails— sneaking out to smoke weed and have sex with much older guys, juuling constantly to the point of addiction, being a total bitch to my parents, etc. I’m currently in college so I can’t be at home to talk to her or deal with her behavior directly, and my other sister (16F) is being very enabling of her behavior and refuses to do anything about it out of fear of betraying her trust. \n\nI know I should let my sisters make their own mistakes, and this would be a lot different if she was 16 or 17 (I’d probably just give her a little advisory talk and leave it alone), but I feel like 14 is way too young to be getting into this stuff and her grades, friendships, family relationships etc (the important things in my view) are suffering because of it. She gets very defensive and angry if I try to talk to her about her behavior (says I’m acting condescending or like I’m better than her), so long story short I’ve ended up just telling my mom everything she’s been up to. \n\nMy parents are fairly overprotective, so this resulted in her phone being taken away permanently, her being grounded indefinitely, my parents regularly drug testing her, and a huge loss of trust between her and my parents, not to mention her and me, as well as my other sister disapproving. It seems like nobody can get through to her, and I am afraid for her health and safety if it continues, so I felt like my only option was to be the narc. Did I overreact? AITA? ",

There was no traumatic event or anything leading up to this but i just couldn't function anymore. \n\nSo i didn't notice it immediately because i told myself it's just a stupid phase that'll stop soon .\n\nIt didn't .\n\nI had some really close friends who i wanted to move in with and everything was fine at first .After i realised that no it wasn't just a phase i told them that i was struggling and that i was really sorry if i acted unkindly which they denied and told me everything's fine don't worry. Then i had an accident which i'm still recovering from and was even more depressed than before. I couldn't move in with them .\n\nI was super depressed but i still answered their messages and explained my situation again and again . \n\nSuddenly they told me that someone wanted to crash in our place for a while and if that's okay with me .\n\nI told them it was fine because i didn't wanted to be the dick in the situation.   \nThen fast forward they wanted to meet me and talk and I was like \"oh no\" \n\nThey told me they don't want me there anymore because they thought i don't feel included . \n\nBefore they the talk our contact became more and more sparse and I repeatedly asked  them what's wrong but they never gave me an answer.\n\nThen one of them told me that's i should have told them sooner that i was depressed because they feeled i was lying to them and that they wanted a notice beforehand .\n\nBUT i did as soon as i realised that i was feeling shite i told them and apologized. \n\nI told them that i wasn't planning on being depressed and certainly didn't know how to deal with that.\n\nIn the end they blamed me for everything but didn't aknowledge their own mistakes like they wanted me to reach out all the time -which i did - but they never did - The wanted me to visit them i did that too -they never did - . In their eyes i was supposed to tell them everything of course they never told me that and they never asked . SO AITA ",

      "description": "So this Is a little complicated, but it’s been playing on my mind so I thought I’d ask the expanse of the internet.\nA friend of mine Allie* (21F) has been my (21F) best friend since we were 14 at high school. \nShe’s always been a little competetive with me for whatever reason, and thankfully competing with me for a guy hasn’t cropped up. Til now. \nMany many months ago I left my abusive ex, and my glorious rebound was a friend from Uni, who had been my lab partner. \nHe wanted to date, I didn’t, but fwb was sweet. All good on both sides. He then met Allie*. \nHe then tried (and failed) to have a threesome with the two of us, and then proceeded to move on from this idea to just wanted fwb with me. I still felt a little weird but sure. \nBoth of them told me off their own backs that neither of them wanted just each other (I.e wouldn’t screw each other behind my back).\nWell oops what do you know, little me finds out they screwed. Less than 6 hours before he and I did later that night.\nNeither bothered to tell me, and when I did find out, they both said ‘we just didn’t want to tell you’.\nOkay.\nSure. Move on with life, not my boyfriend. But as I’m not happy with sharing, I move on and stop sleeping with him.\nI was then told they had stopped sleeping with each other, and he wanted me. I naively said I would think about it.\nSo I did, decided I was free enough from the ex that I could tentatively date and told him so.\nHe was being super weird and I thought it was weird, but whatever.\nFind out they had started dating, and once again neither decided to tell me (also weird as she tells me everything, always), but now he wanted to date the both of us.\nUm. No thank you. I told him as such, and moved on with life. \nHis main explanation was that she was cute, and that I wasn’t enough for him.\n\nStart seeing current boyfriend, all is happy, yay.\nGet a message from Rebound saying that he didn’t know why I was dating anyone when he knew I wanted him (nope) and that I loved him (whatever bud) and that seeing someone else was my futile attempt to distract myself.\n\nI then went overseas, and Allie decided that she would be picking me up from the airport when I got back. Sure, okay.\nWhile I’m away, boyfriend asked if he could meet me at the airport too. Yay, be good to see him, two of my favourite people both meeting me. \nShe proceeded to have the largest tantrum I’ve seen in recent times, saying I broke her heart, no one else even misses me, how dare I hurt her, my boyfriend doesn’t deserve me, how could I do this.\nRebound then messages me saying I was a horrible person who breaks promises, and I was stabbing her in the back just like I had my ex (ya know, the abusive one. He knew the details about that.) and that I was a cuck, and if I had any human decency I would let her do as she pleases. Also told me I was a master manipulator and to pull my head in. \nSo back I come, after organising another ride home from the airport (because fuck that), and she proceeds to tell me she ‘won’ the Rebound. \nHe insults me around her (sources confirm) and she agrees. Calls me a bitch, she agrees. But whenever she needs something I’m the first person she runs to.\n\nI just dont know what to do. WIBTA to just cut my losses? I’ve tried just seeing her but she ‘surprises’ me by bringing him. \nSorry for the wall of text, I will happily clarify anything.\nTldr I have no idea what to do.\n",

      "description": "First of all, I'm 25, and I live with my mother. We're not American, and culturally, it's the appropriate/expected living arrangement. Just to clear up any potential misunderstanding that I'm some kind of lazy freeloader.\n\nSo basically, I'm on a diet. This morning, I asked my mother, who was running some errands, to pick up some additional bananas to make banana bread for everyone. She declined, so I said sure, I'll just make for myself. I proceed to put an enormous effort researching, adapting, and logging in every single pinch that went into that bread to make sure it adapts to my diet. \n\nSome friends of my mother come over, and she asks me 'Could I serve them banana bread?' I'm not too excited about this, and mention it, but ultimately say 'Sure, I can spare a couple pieces.' I try to get the pieces out and manage to take out two, since it's fresh out of the oven, they start falling apart. I tell her this, and give her the two pieces, and say 'This is the best I can do, they're falling apart'. I turn around to grab some water, and she's helping herself to another piece, wrecking the entire goddamn thing in the process.\n\nSo I tell her \"Seriously, you couldn't have asked? I worked so hard for this and now it's ruined. Can't I ever enjoy something I made without you prioritizing someone else?\"\n\nHer response was not to say sorry, but to roll her eyes, raise her eyebrows, purse her lips, and sloooowly put the broken pieces of banana bread back to make a point. This made me so angry because fuck, can you just say sorry and move the fuck on?\n\nSo I tell her \"You know, it's really hurtful and not productive to the conversation for you to make all these passive-aggressive faces. There's a conflict and you and I should talk and resolve this, instead of you mocking me for my feelings, which I think are VERY valid.\" \n\nHer answer? \"Well, I can't control how you interpret things. It's not my fault.\" And she rushed out to give the banana bread to her guests.\n\nI know I made a big deal out of this but to be honest, it's kind of the straw that broke the camel's back. She's constantly putting me last for everything after she makes sure all her guests and everyone she knows are happy, and I'm honestly sick of it. I know it's JUST a dessert, but it feels to me like she's constantly disrespecting my efforts. Am I an asshole for speaking out or should I just chill?",

      "description": "So on Thursday my mother calls me asking me to do her a favor and pay the water bill on her house because the township has put a lien on the property. She wasn't able to go to the municipal building and do it that day before it closed. I have no idea why she didn't do it earlier (We live with my step-dad but she still owns our original house from many years ago)\n\nI say yes and she transfers money into my bank account so I can go ahead do it. Bad timing: snow storm hits the area and I'm unable to do it that day. That night my boyfriend's grandfather passed away suffering from cancer, and Friday morning I rush over to his house to be there for him. I text my mom that I might not be able to pay the bill because of the passing, and she could take it out of my account to pay it, to which her response basically is: \"But did you do the thing yet? I can't do it because of work! Oof think about your poor mother first.\" \n\nAt this point I don't want to deal with her bullshit and lie to her that I did. I planned to do it for Monday and proceed to help with the grieving, the funeral, etc. this weekend. She wakes me up at 5:45 this morning (Monday) and tells me that she noticed my bank account still has the money in it, that Friday was the last day to pay it and that we're gonna lose the house. She wants a picture of the supposed receipt from Friday.\n\nI don't buy it but I still feel iffy. I lied to her and said I had a receipt from the clerk; I'm planning to go later today to pay the bill if I can. I'm still tired from the funeral and she woke me up knowing I have insomnia and I came home late last night.\n\nAlso for context: I'm 18. I'm in college. She's always been financially irresponsible. She also had many opportunities to pay the bill before the lien. She's not lacking the funds to do so, and if she is that's her own damn fault for spending money on throwing parties and other useless shit. I just know she's gonna blame it on me if we do actually lose the house.",

      "description": "My sister got a new dog today and called the family out to see him. I chose not to meet him.\n\nThe issue i am having is my sister is never home, her 3 kids are at our mothers house after school till bed time and weekends. \n\nShe already has my 2 cats (I had to move in with mom) and is not taking care of them and another dog that spends all day in a crate. The dog she already has is still not properly house broken because its home alone all day and nobody walks it.\n\nThe 3 kids have no sense of responsibility and don't care to walk the dog they already have let alone a full sized boxer.\n\nMy worry is the dog will be neglected OR will be put on my mother who during all of this is trying to take care of our grandparents who are almost 90 and will most likely not make it to the end if the year.\n\nI understand that this is a small part of a bigger picture but i'm not sure if i want to be attached to this new dog.\n\nSo Reddit, the golden question is Am I the Asshole?",

So he tried to offer that we both go. Friend says \"I don't want to go with her\" alongside saying he will feel like a 3rd wheel (age difference???? hello?) and that I will cause a fight with my bf because I don't feel like I'm getting enough attention. I know that I'm there to listen to music and probably get drunk before. Not to be an attention whore. I never am, and NEVER will be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome background info: I was in the hospital for a suicide attempt, and my bf decided to spend his time with aforementioned friend without me knowing, because he knew it would make me upset. But he did it for his own good reasons, again, not the asshole. But the friend (40's) of his did it knowingly that it would hurt me, and doesn't care. He tells my boyfriend to break up with me constantly, and he used to do the same to him (tell me to break up with him). The guy is a total prick, has brain issues and memory issues. Can't hold a job because he will snap because of some anger issue/mental disorder that  he has admitted to killing people before because of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want my BF to go alone, because this friend will spend a lot of the time bitching about me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I the asshole? Typing this fast because this JUST happened less than 5 minutes ago, but I will clear up any confusion with an edit or answering questions in the comments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hello everyone, a few months ago a new mall opened in my city and it has very narrow parking spots. Even if you park perfectly you can barely get out of your car. Just for the record i have a Audi A4 from 2008 so its not a big car.\n\nAlmost every time i went there i could barely get in my car when i wanted to leave, I would usually have to get through the other side of the car because everyone is parking in such a way that the driver side has a lot of room. Sometimes even that side was thight and my girlfriend who is thinner had to get in and pull the car a bit so i can get in and drive.\n\nLast week while coming out of a movie i saw a dent on the drivers door, its not a big dent about 5-10 cm long. Most likely someone tried to park and it was too narrow and they hit it and left. Tried to talk to the people from security but they said they don't have cameras looking towards the parking.\n\nMy friends and family are split between \"F**k it just park on two spaces there from now on.\" and \"Yeah the spots are a bit thight and people often park like morons but only assholes park on two spaces.\"\n\nSo would i be an asshole if i started parking on two spaces from now on given that its likely people will hit my car again in the future and also every time i want to leave and get a feeling of dread going to the car thinking \"Would i be able to leave today?\".",

      "description": "I’ve been dating this guy for a couple weeks and started having some symptoms, so I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with chlamydia. I haven’t had sex with anyone else in almost a year and was tested 6 months ago, so I know it came from him. I let him know and things were fine for a few days.\n\nHe got tested and was put on antibiotics and we talked about it. Then he deleted me on Facebook and Snapchat without saying anything about it. I texted him because I still hadn’t heard about his test results and I felt it was important to know. He told me he “freaked out” and didn’t have the results yet.\n\nSince this whole thing started, I’ve been really supportive of him. I asked him how he was feeling, apologized numerous times for being the bearer of bad news, and tried to give him whatever he needed. He never once asked me if I was ok or apologized for giving me an std. This guy is 28 years old and tried to ghost me after *he* gave *me* an std. It’s clear from the tone of his messages that he thinks this is much more difficult for him than it is for me.\n\nWIBTA if I told him that he hurt me with how he handled the situation? I want him to know because he’s going around sleeping with women and shouldn’t be making them feel like garbage over the normal consequences of sex. He gave me an std and made me feel like it was my fault, and I think I’m the future he should be aware of how to better handle the situation if he ends up here again. WIBTA for telling him that?",

I had no idea how to express myself or talk to girls or anything, and they sure as hell wouldn't approach me. Since I turned 18 though, I've really turned my life around. I've lost 20 pounds, and learned to take care of myself and dress nice. The added confidence has made me a lot more flirtatious and successful with girls, and I've kinda taken advantage of that to trade nudes a lot. On one hand, I realize it's totally normal to be sexually active. On the other, though, a lot of them end up crushing on me and it makes me feel bad knowing I only feel for them on a physical level. I worry about this a lot, and I'm really hoping you all can help me figure out where to go from here. (for numbers, I'd say I'm sending with maybe 15 girls currently, and flirt back and forth with upwards of 50.)",

      "description": "I don't want to give out many personal details, and this drama has spanned so many years that a full retelling would take hours to type, so I'll try and summarize as best I can.\n\nSuffice it to say, I'm the eldest of three siblings, and we have never been close. I haven't spoken to my sister since 2014 when she said she wanted nothing to do with my parents and cut all ties with us. I haven't seen my brother, since a series of events that started with him convincing his entire high school class that my parents were abusing him, and ended with him in prison after literally robbing my parents on Christmas.\n\nThis left me as the only child around to help when my parents both had major surgery, when my dad's sister died. I essentially put my life on hold for a year while I did anything I could to ease the burden on my parents. I passed up a lot of opportunities trying to be the good son, and I'll admit I'm still kinda bitter about that fact.\n\nFast forward to January of this year. I've since moved across the country, and met my amazing boyfriend whom I'm trying to build a life with. I'd had no contact with either of my siblings, which suited me just fine. Now, out of the blue I get a call from my mom about how my sister is talking to her again, and how she's got this amazing fiancé and how wonderful it would be if I'd call and congratulate her on the engagement. \n\nSo I act like a good son, and I text my sister. I say all the things my mom wants me to. I try to be civil. Which brings us to today, when I received an invitation to my sister's wedding in Hawaii. \n\nTo be clear, I don't care if my parents have a relationship with my siblings. I understand why it's important to them in order to have a relationship with their grandchildren, and I'm happy that they have that opportunity. I just want no part of it. I'm not interested in having any sort of relationship with either of my siblings, nor in acting like everything is suddenly ok now after everything they put my parents through. And I especially don't want to inflict all this shit on my boyfriend. Not to mention the financial burden of flying to Hawaii in July. \n\nAm I being unreasonable for trying to distance myself from all this? Or should I just suck it up and go because it will make my parents happy?\n\n",

      "description": "Now, I realize how it sounds - and it's really not good.\n\nI've been with my boyfriend for about 6 months now, however we've been friends for nearly 3 years before any romance started. He knows who I'm friends with, he's met them, and even was in a groupchat with all of us for a while.\n\nInitially, I was really excited to have him there; I wanted him to meet the people I've held close for nearly a decade, and wanted to see them all get along and have fun together. He was with us for around three months, and it progressed to us kicking him out and not wanting him back in.\n\nFirst of all, he never talked. Not to me, not to them, when he was the one that asked to join. He would go in group calls if I was in there, but he still wouldn't talk, or even listen to us. I ended up talking to him about that, and I told him that if he didn't wanna be there then he didn't have to be. He insisted that he wanted to, to which I just let it go.\n\nIf I was texting them before him, he'd get upset. If I talked about games he didn't play that they did, he'd get upset. It got to the point where, if I was discussing what characters of mine to put in a certain house, he'd text me privately and talk about how upset he was that he wasn't included in that house. To me, it felt a bit... Out of line - though I didn't wanna make him feel silly for feeling bad, so I just tried my best to comfort him with the fact that he was elsewhere in my game.\n\nIt feels like now, if he's there, he's just there to watch what I do - he once openly admitted that he didn't even like any of my friends, and that he didn't much care to be around them. While that stung, you really can't make someone like your friends, and that's fair. But now, he's mad that we don't want him in the same group. I don't feel it's right to insist on being around them despite the fact that you don't like them.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I have a friend that was going to buy four concert tickets for a group of us.  She was supposed to buy them several weeks before the event. Everytime I followed up with her (did you buy them yet? How much do I owe you?) She had not purchased them and just kept saying she would get to it.\n\nThe day before the event she messaged me , \"hey, are you still coming?\". Me, \"um I haven't heard back from you so I made other plans.\" Her, \"oh yeah, I forgot to tell you that I got the tickets\". So at this point I cannot go but I tell her that since I did tell her to get me a ticket I would still give her the money. Approx $75. \n\nShe says she will try to find someone else to take it so I won't have to pay. Ok that would be fine. \n\nAbout an hour before the event she messaged me \"Ok,  I am going to ask a friend of mine if she wants to go. She can’t afford to buy it but at least it won’t be wasted. She has 6 boys. \"\n\nNow she expects me to give her the money for it. I can see not wanting to \"waste\" the ticket.  But AITA for feeling like if she wanted her other friend to go then she should pay for it?  ",

I'm doing pretty well in finance and mathematics and those are topics i never cheat in because they require i use my logic, not my memory. But when i have to deal with 250+ power point slides of outdated theory I have to know by heart in order to get the maximum points in that specific exam, I just... put together a document with the info i need that i later upload on my phone. I've never been caught and i don't think i ever will be. I'm never reckless or too greedy with the attention i'm paying to my lap LOL.\n\nI have tried memorizing, but i'm finding no logic chain that i can follow in the text and i eventually get bored/distracted/annoyed and drop it. I am currently working in the business field and never have i needed something they teached in those thousands of slides. I reached up to my superiors and asked them how much did college info help them in terms of knowledge and handling situations. \n\nNot at all.\n\nSo why should i sacrifice time if it brings me absolutely nothing?\n\nWhat makes me wonder if i'm an asshole is the fact that i am getting a scholarship out of this. I'm not the only one who finds our school system and the theory irrelevant, but there's nothing i can do right now to change it, so i'm operating against it. Am i an asshole for perhaps depriving someone (that actually learns everything, knows it's just a bunch of crap, but doesn't have the nerve to cheat) of a scholarship?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I have always been so kind to my housekeeper - who helps clean the house and prepare dinner for my parents. I come home almost every weekend to see my parents or even just to have one dinner with them.\n\nSo as my housekeeper was preparing tonight’s dinner, I was combing my dog’s hair, squatting on the floor near the dinner table. My housekeeper said “don’t comb here, it’s too close to the food” and grabbed me off the floor as she was saying this, and pushed me to the other side. I was astonished that she would push me like that. I asked my sister if I should say anything but my sister just said she’s always been rude and that’s just how she is. \n\nSo I go on to eat dinner, and my parents come home around this time with 2 guests: my moms friend who we haven’t seen in 5 years and my grandma who just flew in yesterday.\n\nMy dog ate half a cup of dog food - she hadn’t eaten all day until we were finally home since she only likes eating when people are around. I realized a bit later she had finished the half so I go to put another half cup of dog food in her bowl.\n\nHousekeeper: Don’t give her anymore food. She already ate. \n\nMe: I only gave her 1/2 a bowl more because she hasn’t eaten all day.\n\nHousekeeper: Your dog is so fat. Stop feeding her so much.\n\n(** my dog is not fat at all, she is healthy and on a regular normal diet)\n\nAt this point, I just exploded and yelled “DON’T TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY DOG. SHE’S MY DOG NOT YOURS”\n\nAnd everyone went silent and was shocked as I never really raise my voice at anyone. My mom said “Calm down, why are you so mad?”\n\nI responded, “She (housekeeper) pushed me” and left the room.\n\nI heard my mom ask her “did you push her?” And my housekeeper said no. \n\nMy sister said I could have handled things differently and not in front of everyone. Think I just exploded in the moment but I feel bad now.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This was a few months ago, for context, I’m a student in high school, attending a boarding school here in my hometown.\n\nI didn't connect with anyone, everyone just kinda steered clear of me, and I did the same. The exception being three girls, let's call them Louise, Victoria, and Danielle. It was lunch one day when they approached, and sat down next to me. They tried to get a conversation going with me, and surprisingly enough I actually enjoyed talking to them. Later they asked for my Instagram, and requested to follow me later that day. I figured they were nice enough and accepted the request. We hung out a couple times after that and I really appreciated having some friends. To show them my appreciation I asked my mom to swing by with a Pizza if I payed, because parents and guardians were allowed to drop things off. I gave them the Pizza which they insisted we split four ways out in a public area. This cycle continued for a while with me getting something for them since my parents lived in town and them being very appreciative, at times even returning with a gesture of their own.\n\nHowever, about a month into the school year, the girls started changing. They started demanding/expecting things instead of me doing them to be nice. They stopped insisting on sharing, and later asked for me to bring things to their room (boys are prohibited inside a female room) so I couldn't talk or anything. If I got them one pizza, they'd guilt trip me over not buying two. I felt less like a friend being kind, and more like the intern running around getting things for the boss. Like I was bending over backwards for these people I didn't even like anymore. The straw that broke the camel's back finally hit when the girls wanted pizza, but I was out of cash. My family had been going through a rough time and there was far less money to go around so naturally I had less money than normal. Instead of understanding. I got called a “broke ass nigga,” was called a “fake friend,” and was told by Louise to unfollow her or she'd block me.\n\n\nFlash forward to mid October, and my family's financial situation has gotten better. I had some cash, and tired of the, at this point, outrageous demands, I decided to take the initiative to give them something they didn't ask for. A chocolate bar, the World's hottest chocolate bar (which is 1,000 times hotter than a Jalapeno, and almost 4 times hotter than a Carolina Reaper). My mom had a friend who owns a novelty gift shop here in town so my mom bought three bars and dropped them off for me. I unwrapped them so they couldn't tell it was anything other than regular chocolate, threw them into their own ziploc bags, and dropped by their room with the chocolate. \n\nI had just returned to my room when my phone started going off like crazy. I had a ton of DM's from Victoria asking what the hell was in the chocolate. I told her, and she lost her shit. Texting in all caps about how they all ate their bar in one bite. Danielle texted me a while later bitching at me for “setting her mouth on fire,” and all 3 promptly blocked me on Instagram.\n\nSince then, all three of them have both unblocked me and requested to follow me, and have mellowed out. They've quit demanding things, and I've sure as shit quit offering them things.\n\nTL;DR I gave some girls a Pizza among other things to be nice, they started taking advantage of me and demanded more than I could give, getting angry when I didn't deliver, so I got them back with some “sweet” revenge. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": " \n\nThere is a random collection of mugs in the breakroom at my office. They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar '16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis. \n\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot. \n\nThis morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said \"World's Greatest Dad\" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I  thought \"that's weird,\" filled it up, and went back to my office. \n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like \"Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad.\" \n\nHe asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee. \n\nHe left, and came back with a new mug that said \"Happy Birthday.\" He told me to pour my coffee in the \"happy birthday\" mug, so he could take the \"World's Greatest Dad Mug.\" \n\nI said \"No, you're being weird.\" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today. \n\nI told him \"I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done.\" \n\nI didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?",

I am deff the type of person that doesn't care what others think of me. \n\nI've been to a few parties and he basically told me that i cant act like my usual self because of what his family might think. I really hate editing myself and end up just not talking the entire time because i have no idea what is \"appropriate\" in his eyes. His entire family is also EXTREMELY superficial like all about appearances, money, etc. Basically 1000% not my thing. So, i try to avoid every family gathering with him and he is always extremely hurt. \n\nI love him so much and literally every other situation i am a free bird.

      "description": "As always, there’s more to the story than the title. Throwaway ti protect my main Reddit but I could give two fucks if someone I know reads this. \n\nSome background info: I’ve listened to this coworker bitch and moan endlessly for months. She always wants to bitch to me about something and even times when I felt like her poor attitude was too much, I pretended to listen. This coworker is 10 years older than me and constantly preaches this false positivity crap that even she doesn’t practice. When I had a severe bacterial respiratory infection, she told me taking medicine was unnecessary and I’d have gotten better if I’d just envisioned being healthy / pretended not to be sick. Meanwhile, she went to the emergency room for a cold that she convinced herself was heart problems. I’ve had to play cheerleader to push her not to quit this job for months. \n\n I recently found out that one of my immediate family members has cancer. It’s very serious. I feel devastated by this news, and on top of that, I’m in the middle of contract to work 5000 miles away at this time so I can’t exactly pop in to visit. Among other things going on in my life right now, this topped all of it and pushed me over my limit stress wise. Thinking about one of your loved ones being incredibly sick and having the chance of losing them to their illness does not leave you in a good place. It takes time to work through those emotions and get to a point where you can accept it, even more so when you’re not able to psychically see them to make it feel real. \n\nEveryone at my work knew because I missed the first day I’ve missed in the entire time of my working there despite several rough illnesses. I’ve received a lot of “if you ever need anything, please reach out” including from my coworker. \n\nMy coworker sent me inspirational memes, whined to me about work, and let me vent on three different days. 6 days after I got this news, she tells me that everyone dies at some point anyways and I’m choosing to feel sad / dwell on this. I politely disagreed and walked away to cry in private. \n\nShe then avoided me for a week. Today I received a message from her telling me that I’m too much of a burden to her. I told her that she’s expected more compassion for having a cold than she’s given me in all of this and that I hoped she’d have a better friend than her if she’s ever in my shoes. She responded by calling me toxic and draining. I lost my patience at this point and told her the space she’s given me has allowed me to see how our friendship is a one way street that’s only available when she can benefit and that she’s incredibly narcissistic. \n\nIdk I’m awestruck as to how I could be the asshole in her mind with what was said and how she avoided me like a kid that’s destroyed their mom’s favorite lamp.  Would love to hear some opinions from some fellow asshole connoisseurs. ",

They blamed us for not telling them to bring money (who tf shows up at someones house expecting food and doesnt bring any money.) they then tried to guilt me into giving them some by saying that their parents paid for our food before. I wasnt having any of their shit and ate all the food i payed for. We actually ended up giving them some of our cinnamon twists.

I always carry poop bags, and always make sure to pick up after her. The issue is, if we are only 20 minutes into an hour walk, I will throw the poop bag into a trashcan. The neighborhoods we run through all have those large green rolling trashcans, and most people keep them outside. I'll pick up the poop, and toss it in the next trashcan I see. I don't imagine I use the same trashcan more than once every few weeks. \n\nToday, while out for a walk, someone came out of their house yelling at me. I stopped, and he told me I was \"un-cool\" for using his trash, and to piss off, saying he had me on  camera. I admit, being taken aback, I told him \"fine, next time if she poops in your yard, I'll just leave it there\" and walked off. Now, I'll never do this, and I'll skip his house if I ever need to toss a poop bag, but the question is, am I an asshole for throwing away these small bags into someone else's trash?",

      "description": "I was at the grocery store earlier and a man approached me. He was of Asian descent and spoke with what sounded like a thick Vietnamese accent. He looked like he was in his forties. The man stared at me with a \"Have we met?\" face before the following conversation ensued. Note that I do not recall our encounter word-for-word but it went something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMan: \"Are you Asian?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes.\"\n\nMan (grinned with a sense of comfort): \"Where are you from? Are you Vietnamese?\"\n\nMe: \"No, I'm Filipino.\"\n\nMan: \"Ohhh okay. Hey I was wondering if you could help me.\"\n\nMe: \"What happened?\"\n\nMan: \"Can you give me some gas for my car? It's out of fuel and it will get towed if I don't move it. I forgot my wallet at home and my wife isn't picking up the phone. I have twenty minutes before it gets towed.\"\n\nMe: \"So you want me to drive you to a gas station?\"\n\nMan: \"No you don't have to drive! I can walk. I just need some cash. I live all the way in Lakeville.\" (He pulls his ID out of his pocket to point at his home address to verify. Lakeville is probably at least half an hour away from the store).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pause for a bit before replying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Sorry I can't.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe then walks away and I do not see him again. I was trying to weigh the situation before I rejected him. His reasoning was suspicious to me but I wasn't sure if it was because of the language barrier. I understand he probably approached me because I was also Asian but I did not see him talk to anyone else. I didn't have cash on me but I wasn't sure if he sincerely only wanted cash because he didn't want to trouble me to drive him, or if he was just lying about the whole situation. I did think it was weird that he had his ID but not his wallet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here for not giving him the benefit of the doubt? It's also around 4 degrees outside. ",

      "description": "So, for context. A few friends and I are in a D&amp;D campaign that my boyfriend is the DM for. We've been playing off and on for about three years, and since we're all full-time students it's very hard to get us all free and in the same location for any amount of time. As anyone does, sometimes we'll check our phones during a game and get distracted. But certain members of my party, lets call them friends A and B, were on their phones constantly. Because they were distracted so often, it became that much harder to focus on the game and enjoy each others company.\n\nTime went on and eventually, my boyfriend, another party member and I came up with what we thought was a good solution: a phone bin. Everyone would agree to put their phones away and not touch them during the game, except if really needed.\n\nI don't recall the first time we used it, but no one said anything against it at the time. And from our point of view, it worked. People didn't use their phones nearly as much, and seemed much more engaged in the game. We also started using a phone bin at dinner theaters, events we hosted with our friends that were essentially group improv/casual escape room.\n\nLater on when my boyfriend, friends A and B and I were talking, A and B expressed that they were super upset about the phone bin concept. They were mad that we hadn't asked them beforehand, that it was 'suddenly everywhere', and that they weren't being respected. They said that we assumed they needed supervision and couldn't focus if they had their phones. It was mostly coming from A. Friend A admitted that she doesn't even really enjoy D&amp;D and those type of things anymore. My response was that if she didn't like it, no one was forcing her to stay. Friend A took issue with that. She said she felt as if we were expecting her to stay and do these things she didn't enjoy.\n\nI feel really bad that we made our friends upset, but I genuinely don't see why they have a problem with the phone bin idea. I also don't see why Friend A would have a problem with me telling her that she doesn't have to play with us.\n\nSo, am I an asshole here? I really don't think I'm in the wrong, but I would like a third opinion here. Thanks if you've read this far or decide to comment.",

      "description": "This happened over a year ago, but it is still brought up to me by my friends and by my boyfriend sometimes so I thought I would ask here. My boyfriend (I'll just call him Cole) had a 300+ day streak with his ex girlfriend (I'll call her Allie). It continued after they broke up because they were friends and I was fine with it. After about a month of Cole and I dating, Allie started saying things to me like \"He always makes you look bad,\" and just generally negative things about our relationship. I saw that this was bad and I distanced myself from her. About 2 weeks later, Allie began to tell people that Cole was flirting with her (asking for nudes, etc.). Cole confronted her and told her to stop and that he was happy with me, and she did. Cole saw this as being the end, and that there would be peace between us. I, however, knew that she would probably try something like this again and asked him to stop talking to her. In real life, and on social media. He told me that I was being controlling and that they were friends and I should respect that. Eventually he saw that I was very upset about the whole situation, and stopped their streak. He complained about it for a while, and his friends told me that I was being a dick and that he had that streak before we were dating, so I shouldn't tell him to stop it. This has been following me for a while now, but I don't think that I'm in the wrong. AITA?",

      "description": "Okay so first some backstory when my friend (let's just call him Jake) and I were still in the same school. He would slap my ass real hard everytime I had his back faced to him. In the toilet. Refilling my water. Even walking up the stairs. Not only that sometimes he would just jab my asshole real hard for no reason and not just me to some of our classmates as well. Can you imagine this? Not being able to use the urinal properly. Heck even if we go into the cubical he would threaten to climb over the walls to peek. I got some form of PTSD when I got into a new school because of this and had a tendency to look back just to make sure my new friends weren't up to no good even though they were minding their own business.  I even helped him go from a subpar math student to an 'A' student by teaching him when he needed help, introducing him to the tuition I go to and whatnot. Last year before my friend moved house, I would regularly go over to his house to study, eat dinner with him and play sports together and stay over sometimes. One time, we went to eat dinner together but he wanted to settle some stuff with his new tablet of his. I idled around with him for 30 minutes staying by him to do something I don't even benefit from. Jake used my phone to contact his parents for advice about it and blah blah. Simply put he wasted my time and this happened a number of times. It was automatically assumed that I would go to his house regularly during the weekends to study together. But on two occasions (both this year), I turned up and he just told me \"Sorry we didn't plan\". I had to waste time to go back home as a result. Even worse, at one point he started trying to charge me for going to study with him. Not even asking for his help. $2 per session with him. Of course, after the second time he canceled out on me this year, I gave up, I stop making plans with him for a long time and I got some sort of hatred towards him. \n\n  \nNow a few days back, Jake and I made plans for me to stay over at his house. He needed my metal detector for some installation of a TV of some sort at his house and needed to know where the metal supports in the wall were. I agreed since it has been a long time we've hung out together and wanted to study for our exams together. I told him to remind me to bring my metal detector along as one does not simply bring a metal detector out regularly and also to meet halfway since his house was pretty far from mine. We made promises to stay over and do some stuff together blah blah. I think at this point he still thinks that there's no bad blood between us but I still held a grudge for making me waste so much of my time  \n\n\nSo the day comes, Jake didn't remind me about it and being the forgetful person, I forgot to bring it along too. I told him when I was on the way to his house and he got kinda pissed at me? Not too sure but when I reached his stop alone, he made me wait there for a solid 20minutes before turning up to meet me. Next, we went to get lunch nearby and he told me he didn't have money and naturally, lent him some money. His meal was $3.10 but he only passed me $2.00 as that's all he had now and said, \"It's only $1 right? No big deal about it.\" I just gave him a shake of my head and sighed but he ignored it. I do not get a lot of pocket money from my parents and he knows it too.  \n\n\nNow at this period of time, I was texting this girl that he knew nothing about and he wanted to know who it was. I told him no because first of all I told him before and second of all, knowing him, he was bound to ask for a pic of her and judge her appearance, compare it to my ex-girlfriend just because his current girlfriend were besties with my ex.  I also had a new phone and requested for his Wifi password but he was like \"Tell me who the girl is first.\" Not wanting to tell him I just sighed again and remained silent. Keep in mind we had been friends for 3 years before this happened. We then had lunch and started studying. Knowing that we were gonna study the same subjects together, I didn't bring my own lecture notes thinking I could borrow his set of notes to read from. I asked for it only to receive a sarcastic \"Oh I don't have it in my house.\" I just proceeded to start packing my things and told him I was gonna leave if he didn't want to share it with me. No actions from him trying to stop me so I just left his house.   \n\n\nA few minutes later he sent me his notes on WA telling me to come back and I told him no. He started cussing me over text, calling me a fake friend, saying about how I promised the metal detector, claiming I used him as a friend, calling me dog blah blah. I told him I have tolerated his nonsense from him for 3 years now and he just said my limits were shallow??   \n\n\nAm I really the asshole here for leaving his house? Sure I broke a promise but knowing how I would be treated at his house I dreaded staying over that day.  Knowing this, I sent him that one quote from the peep show.   \n \"**Hitler promised not to invade Czechoslovakia, Jeremy. Welcome to the real world.** \"\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/2hlok5/you\\_promised\\_not\\_to\\_tell\\_hitler\\_promised\\_not\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/2hlok5/you_promised_not_to_tell_hitler_promised_not_to/)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I (20M) stay in my GF's (21F) house most nights. Recently, between 2 warm bodies living in her small house, and her depression, the house has gotten very messy. Of course, this hasn't helped her depression at all.\n\nI've made it a top priority of mine to clean up her house to make her feel better. She knows this, and has known since Thursday I wanted to spend all of (or most of) today (Saturday) cleaning up, putting up posters &amp; paintings, organizing new items from her old place, etc etc etc. However, we didn't get started cleaning until late in the day (about 8:00 PM).\n\nShe's been wanting to have sex, and I've told her I really don't want to have sex until this house is clean. I probably wouldn't even be able to enjoy it because I'd be so concerned with time and cleanliness of the house. This has made her upset and I've had to redirect her advances. She knows why.\n\nI don't have OCD, but I believe a clean house is a NECESSITY for someone suffering depression, and a proper adult should have a clean house to come back to at the end of the day. It also produces a more productive work environment, which we both need to do homework.\n\nAITA for this? Sorry if anything about this post is weird or wrong in formatting - first post here.",

We're near the end of class and everyone is just ready to leave. I'm wearing a hat which is important soon. These Seniors are next to me and one of them, I have been very vocal, telling him to leave me alone when he follows me around and annoys me during phys Ed. This particular kid, let's call him B, takes my hat.\n\nI reach for the hat but I'm really short so I can't get to it. I then say \"Hey, asshole, give it back!\" As I reach again. \n\nA teacher saw this all happen and only did something when I opened my mouth. She yelled at me until the bell rang, like 3 minutes, and she told B to keep his hands to himself, nothing else. On top of that I had to apologise to him at the end. \n\nI really don't understand that when I'm being harassed, nothing is being done but as soon as I say something the teachers have echolocation and turn into fucking apes. I still don't know if she's gonna tell the principal or my teacher (he was absent, this teacher I'm talking about teaches weight training) and if she does, I don't know if I'll be in the wrong. \n\nAITA Reddit?",

As in, a lot of her texting feels robotic; less like a conversation between two friends (or in this case, a couple) and more like a conversation between business partners who organize meetings from time to time.  As a whole it's pretty annoying, but by far the worst part is when she texts me \"K\".  For example, I might text her that I'm on my way to pick her up for a date or whatever, and she'll respond \"K\".\n\nSomehow she's apparently missed the memo that sending \"K\" is kind of a passive aggressive way of saying \"I really don't give a shit about whatever it was you just said.\"  I know she doesn't mean it that way at all, and she's not cold in our face-to-face interactions, but it *is* kind of annoying, especially combined with her poor texting habits in general.\n\nI want to bring it up with her, but on the other hand I'm worried that I'm just being petty.

      "description": "This is going to be a bit of a long story because I'm fairly anxious about the whole thing and probably rambling on for a lot of it, so sorry in advance. \n\nOkay SO just a few things for context.\n\nMe (22F) and my friend (25F, let's call her Mary) have been friends for years. We lived together during college and know everything about eachother, we were like sisters (well I thought so anyway loll).\n\nThings were great with us when I was single in 1st and 2nd year of college. I was out clubbing most nights with the girls, life was one big party it was litttt, especially because I was friends with a lot of the club owners around the city so they'd always sort us out with guestlists, free drinks and vip treatment (No, nobody sucked dick for guestlist lol, I worked part-time in a phone company for business owners so these guys were always trying to get early upgrades by being nice.)\n\nIt was in 3rd year when I started noticing things going downhill between me and Mary. She broke up with her boyfriend after cheating on him but told him she did it because she wanted to be single (That's when I was like daaaammnn girly you shady). \nMy life was starting to go in a completely different direction to hers, I met my current boyfriend, I started to excel at college and work. The better I was doing academically, the less I wanted to go out drinking and be hungover and sick the next day.\n\nSo one night I was in bed early, exhausted from a day of mindless pipetting. Mary was going clubbing that night, and before she left the house she came into my room and straight up asked me to sort her and her friends out with guestlist and free drinks at the club. Most of those girls, I had never even met before. Like I said, the times we'd get into clubs for free was because the bouncers or club owners were  being nice, I felt really awkward asking for guest list for a bunch of strangers. So I explained that to her and I thought she was cool with it. \n\nA few hours later, I'm sound asleep resting up for my daily dose of mental exhaustion in the lab - and my phone starts ringing. It was a friend of mine who worked at the club calling to say Mary was kicking off at the bouncer going batshit crazy about how if they don't let her and her friends in, I'd hear about it and make a complaint to the club owner and make sure the bouncer got fired. LIKE THAT'S AWFUL. I have worked in retail, and so I feel like anyone involved in dealing with the public as a job deserves a medal, I could never speak to anyone like that. So of course I apologise and go and pick her up because she's acting all crazy continuing to make threats and make a show of herself. So I get there and instead of getting the fuck into the car to go home, she's trying to get a group of randomers into my car and another group of randomers to follow in a taxi for a house party. After a lot of arguing, finally managed to bring her home and put her to bed. \n\nSo that was the start of it, but fast forward to now. \n\nI got my BSc, I'm working as a clinical microbiologist, living with my boyfriend and we're hoping to move to the Netherlands at the end of the year. \nMary graduated too and is also working but she's on the other side of the country, we would talk every day but just didn't have the time to meet (Isn't that what adulting is? A constant state of clashing schedules). \n\nTo catch up we decided to book a weekend away abroad, it was great to see her after so long! On the Friday we had the best day, loads of adventuring. It was a bit annoying how now and again she would just zone out on tinder but I got over that. We decided to go for a few cocktails and straight away she wanted to leave and go somewhere else because in her words \"there's no talent here, like there's legit  nobody looking at me it's a waste of this outfit and my makeup, the boys here are rotten\". So I was like \"Mean but ya sure we won't stay in the same place anyway we'll go suss the town out.\" \n\nAt the end of the night we decided to go to the club, it was super super busy and there was a lot of pushing and shoving and a few of us ended up falling over and a group of boys helped me up and then helped her up straight away (thanks boys appreciate it, you the real MVPs), this is the part that I was like wtf - she literally started SCREAMING crying. I got so worried I thought maybe she got hurt from the fall or something. I brought her to the bathroom and tried to calm her down but she just turned on me, calling me an attention seeker, saying that everyone rushed to help me first and left her there (which was not true). She started shouting telling me to tell her she looks unreal, I was kind of scared tbh she was acting crazy. She just kept screaming \"DON'T I LOOK UNREAL?!!!!\" She literally only calmed down when agreed to tell her what she wanted to hear. I was genuinely scared. So we leave the bathroom and sit down and she starts randomly telling me that because she's my best friend, she would never let me sleep with anyone else BUT making out with other men doesn't count as cheating on my boyfriend and that I should go wild with other men in the club because I'm \"too young to settle for one boy\"- those were her exact words. I was so shocked, she knows how happy I am with my boyfriend, and sorry but that's bullshit. Yes it is cheating, in my eyes if you're even sending really flirty texts to someone you're half way to cheating so making out is definitely cheating ffs. She kept trying to get me to cheat and I was so pissed off at her at this stage I wanted to go back to the hotel room.\n\nDecided to call it a night, and went to get food after the club and two boys came in to the fast food place and she turned to me straight away and said \"Don't forget you have a boyfriend, don't say hi back. Literally nobody has given me any attention tonight don't take this away from me.\" \nI literally ignored the lot of them and was happy out eating my chicken nuggets. \n\nThe next day I felt really sick, Idk if it was the food or being hungover or what but I needed to sleep in for a while longer. She literally physically shook me to wake me up and said \"Who tf is going to take insta pics of me if you're sleeping in, you're being such a selfish bitch rn\" \n\n....\n\nSo I told her I'd meet her at the restaurant near by after I slept in, which I did but she just wanted to keep drinking cocktails all day. I decided I didn't want to drink that day because our flight was at 5am the next morning and I felt sick enough as it was. She just kept giving me dirty looks telling me how she should have just brought a tinder match with her instead because they'd be so much more fun and up for drinking. I just kept quiet because I really hate confrontation and conflict. Then she said \"Right I'm going off on my own for a while because we've been here 2 days and I still haven't gotten the ride, if I was here with any of the other girls they'd be up for bringing a party back to the hotel or drinking or having fun with boys\" so we walked back to the hotel, she got dressed up and then she slammed the door as she left. I was quiet the whole time but as soon as she slammed the door I burst into tears. I just don't understand what I had done to make her so so so mad. I felt so embarrassed and humiliated at the way she yelled that at me in a restaurant full of people. I couldn't understand why I had made her so angry. \n\nThe next day we had to leave early for our flight, the hotel staff were so kind and told me they'd serve breakfast for us earlier than they usually do so we could eat before leaving. When we finished breakfast I was clearing the table because it was a self service buffet system, Mary belittled me for cleaning up and told me to leave the mess there because that's their job. I just ignored her and once we got to the airport there was complete silence unless she made a comment now and then about how it was such a waste of a trip. I was just too shocked to say anything. When we landed home, my boyfriend came to collect me and she had another tinder match waiting to pick her up from the airport. As soon as I got in the car I couldn't stop crying. \n\nI'm a really anxious person but I really try to be kind and do my best to not make life difficult for anyone because life is hard enough as it is. This was 2 weeks ago, and I'm still so upset about it because I saw such a mean side of her and we haven't spoken since, it's crazy because we used to be such good friends. I just feel like she couldn't care less if we stopped talking. So AITA if I drift from her? \n\nSorry again for how long this was, it felt kind of good to let it out though, thanks for reading x",

      "description": "So I met this girl a couple of weeks ago, super bubbly, weird and scatterbrained but in a cute way. We started talking this past weekend, really hit it off, and ended up having sex tonight. There's a lot of baggage that comes with her which I don't usually have a problem with, but she also kept saying how she really doesn't want a relationship right now because she's trying to focus on getting out of poverty but also really likes me wants to make something work. I ran with it because things change and you can figure things out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to after sex, we go to the corner store so she can pay rent and just starts acting super weird. Like a combination of drunk/high but saying she was super tired. It really started freaking me out because I didn't know if this was her normally or she took something or what. Either way, she's the one driving and sort of randomly decides to go to the bar around the corner. Literally just a passenger at this point. I didn't feel like drinking that much so I just get water and she orders a shot and a whiskey coke, takes the shot and then decides that she doesn't want the whiskey coke at all anymore so I end up just drinking it and we leave. Head back to her place, her driving is scaring me. She notices a cop in front of us when we get near her house and pretty much has a panic attack and just froze once she parked the car, just smoking a cigarette and saying how she doesn't want to go back to jail. Eventually she relaxed and we went back inside and I said I had to go home and let my dog out so I kissed her goodbye and left. I'm definitely not going to keep seeing this girl. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really know what the fuck happened tonight, but I don't really want any part of it anymore. But WIBTA if I broke it off tomorrow and look like the guy that got laid and then bounced? Or WIBTA more if I sat on it a day? I'm still trying to process what the hell just happened tonight. ",

The right lane would be completely empty THREE intersections away because everyone wanted to prematurely merge so they weren't that guy trying to \"cut\" people off. Meanwhile traffic would back up on the whole street and make a terrible commute worse. If people just used the right lane and merged when appropriate then you could fit double the amount of cars on that section of the road and there would be less backups all around. \n\nI of course would ride the right lane until the merge point at which time I would turn on my blinker and merge over. Without fail I would get death stares, middle fingers, and the ol' I own the road in front of me and there's no way you are getting past. \n\nAm I part of the problem or part of the solution for taking the right lane?*...cue \"Go your own way\" \\~Fleetwood Mac*",

I am a fairly depressed individual and so was she, however she was also fairly abusive and the only reason, towards the last third of the relationship, of me sticking around was to try to make sure she didn't hurt herself. So when I left it was because I couldn't handle her being emotionally manipulative any longer and I needed to support myself. \n\nAnyways I would say about a month after the breakup me and a buddy are playing MTG at local games store and I get a text from her asking to talk to me. I agree and we begin to text again, and after some small talk I ask her the reason for her texting me again. She reveals to me that she has a tumor that they found out to be a malignant form of Melanoma. Of course I feel bad about this but I'm still in a place where I feel I can't get close to her so I tell her I'm sorry to hear that and I hope she gets better.\n\nWell other mutual friends hear about this and since I didn't offer any emotional assistance, not trying to be more there for her or anything I am in the wrong. She ended up getting it removed and it was all fine so at least that turned out well. So am reaching out to see what you guys think, was I the asshole?",

      "description": "I (36M) was married to my wife (same age) for 6 years until she passed away in March 2016. Quick backstory - we met while I was deployed to Iraq in 2008 (former USMC, she was with an NGO), and it just sort of happened. It was a pretty intense time in both our lives, and we didn't intend to stay together after all was said-and-done, but I couldn't let it go. After the tour was over, I took leave, went to Belgium (where she's from) and basically said I loved her and wanted to make it work. We got married the next year, and we have a daughter (8F).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took it hard when she passed away from pancreatic cancer. I've been through a fair bit in life, haven't had issues with PTSD from my time in the service (somehow), but when she died I just lost it. Lost a ton of weight, quit exercising, drank a lot. It went on like that for a year, until my parents and friends basically were like, \"Ok, JetBlueWaffle, time to get your shit together and move on.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer sister (33F) moved to the US, and is staying in our house. She just started a new job, and I offered her the room so she could save more money before she got her own place. We get along really well. She (as well as that entire side of the family) was really supportive when my wife passed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, a few nights ago, we had sex. I didn't really intend on it, but we'd been having a lot of wine, etc... She was complaining about her boyfriend back home, I was talking about how it's hard to date and manage work, and we did it. All things considered, it was enjoyable. She had to travel for work, and we haven't talked or texted in the past few days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe honest Reddit - AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for kicking my roommate out and putting all his shit to the street while he is in the hospital?",
      "description": "My roommate moved in my house with my husband and I. My husband was the manager of a pizza restaurant and he was one of the employees. He was living with his girlfriend's parents so they kicked him out when they broke up. In November of 2018. In December my husband passed away so now it is just the two of us.\n\nI agreed initially to take his rent in two payments $175 every two weeks. He paid me $175 for the first half of December. But has not paid me sense. I had gotten a bit of sympathy money from family, my job, etc after my husband passed so when the roommate came to me in early January saying he was having money troubles I initially said it was okay and he just needs to get it to me as soon as he can.  \n\nTurns out his \"money troubles\" were that he is talking to his ex-girlfriend again and he is giving his money to her. I talked to him about the money issue again on the 15th stating that he is officially a month behind. He placed a call to his dad and his grandma. They told him to \"not worry about rent the next few months since you just lost your best friend and your girlfriend. We will take care of it.\" So supposedly his grandma Fedexed a check the next day (why she didn't just mail it like a normal person, I have no idea.) The check never came. That was at this point 8 days ago.\n\nSo Saturday my roommate goes to the ER because he got his contact stuck in his eye. He ended up needing emergency surgery. He texted me from the hospital saying he would be admitted for a week because they have to check the eye every 30 minutes otherwise he would lose it. He also tells me his dad was on his way to the hospital and would get me the rent that day. That was Saturday. Never heard from him since.\n\nHe texts me yesterday saying he is being transferred to another hospital even further. His girlfriend is bringing him home to get his Switch. His grandma is meeting him at the house and she will give me the check. I get home. He's not there. I text him, he says he is at his girlfriend's house and his grandma didn't make it to town. I don't hear from him at all the rest of the night.\n\nI text him this morning asking him to give me his grandmother or his father's phone number so I can speak to them myself because I am sick of the runaround. He is officially 7 weeks behind at this point. I sent that text around 9:00 and he simply hasn't responded.\n\nToday is the 24th. I am going to give him until the 1st, hospital or not and if I don't get my money I plan on bringing all his shit to the dumpster. I have already placed an ad online for the room. I want to throw away his shit as \"payback\" for living in my house for several weeks rent free, spending all his pizza paychecks on his ex girlfriend and drugs, while he knows I am struggling to make ends meet because my husband just died. \n\nI can't tell if he is just bullshitting me or if his family is bullshiting him. Regardless, I am not getting the money and I know he is giving his GF money for like...existing and continueing to fuck him??? \n\n\nTLDR: Roommate moves in with my husband and I. My husband dies. My roommate spends all his spending money on his gf/drugs and has been giving me the run around for several weeks saying his family will pay his portion of the rent.\n",

      "description": "A bit of backstory I’ve always loved natural disasters. When the tsunami in japan happened I watched all the YouTube videos of the tsunami devouring the city’s and country areas. During hurricane katrina I watched the news coverage as much as possible. I’ve always wanted to see a tsunami like that, a hurricane like that, a 8.0+ magnitude earthquake, an F 5 tornado, a volcano erupt, I wanna see all these amazing things in person. \n\nI told my friend that I hope a hurricane or tsunami hits us and she told me I was an asshole for wanting people to lose their families as well as their belongings all so I can see a natural disaster. Now. I have no control over the weather also I live in a state that is one of the very few states that would have better luck having someone win the lottery 5x in a row then us get hit with ANY natural disaster. So why am I the asshole for wanting something to happen that we all know never will?",

They reminded me of this event and I didn't know where to post it until now.)\n\nSo my 18th birthday was last Thursday, January 31st. And I come from a somewhat well-off family. \n\nFor my sister's 16th birthday a few years back, she got a $1,200 purebred Dachsund and a used Pontiac G6 GT for $8,000. \n\nBeing the youngest child, it's no surprise I got everything last, so I was expecting at least one gift.\n\nDidn't get one. Not from my parents at least. Instead my brother went to the surplus store and got me a knockoff $20 taser. Which stopped charging the day I got it so it doesn't work anymore.\n\nNot gonna lie, I felt angry at first but now I'm being more concious to the fact that I sound like a spoiled little bitch and I really don't wanna coome off that way.

      "description": "- On Instagram i generally get into a lot of debates in my spare time for some fun and to help my english and stat work since theres usually alot of homework involved \n- i go onto Tessas post, its a comic panel conveying equality between both men and women. Seems good enough, its a movement i am involved in -- egalitarianism. Equality for both genders. Theres a ton of whiteknights and alot of bashing on men for being weak or whatever. \n- i decide enough is enough and partake in an argument since its a good break from my studying for my Physics mocks. \n- \"funny how men take that as being hated\" i disagree by saying that in the comments at the very least theres a ton of guys whiteknighting and how the schema of third wave feminism (which i cleared up as feminazism to avoid linking it to actual feminism which i support and advocate for) is bashing on men and that the comments dont really decline that fact. \n- someone replies by saying that thats the vocal minority, i agree and that it should not be correlated at all to feminism. \n- whiteknight (whos apparently joking comes in) \"we're fragile\" theres a ton of comments like this that are genuine so i did not understand its satire. I respond by saying thats not true and that it only should reference men who dislike feminism and say that its cancerous and whatnot, he then stays persistent in that point even after saying it was a joke and that how me calling him a whiteknight proves his point despite the fact that i said it does basically parallel his behaviour and if he is offended \"im sorry but its true\" \n- continues persistency. \n☆2☆ \n- a chinese game dev says he isnt good at making lovestories because he never fell in love and only faced rejection yet he'll try harder to make better games. \n- someone comments that hes a niceguy and a neckbeard, i argue it isnt and completely deconstruct what he is saying to disprove her point. \n- she resorts to calling me a niceguy and using r/iamverysmart. While i am left confused. \nHelp me out here, did i come off as sexist or insulting? \nIf so that wasnt my intention and i will try to correct it. ",

      "title": "AITA for sleeping with my best friends ex gf?",
      "description": "So my bestfriend/roomate was dating this girl that he met from our job (we both work at the same UPS hub). He works the evening shift, while I work the graveyard shift and there's this girl I saw that I was really attracted to. I was reluctant to approach her because I am her indirect supervisor ( She wasn't my dedicated employee but I would frequently cover for her supervisor or relay directions to her group for operational purposes)\n\nFast forward they have been dating for a year or more. One day he ends the relationship and they go their separate ways. He didn't feel the same way about her that she did towards him. I made no effort to talk to her whatsoever. \n\nFast forward again about a year and a half later he has a new gf that he's really serious about. One day his ex reaches out to me to buy some weed from me (I was growing at the time and would post pictures om my snapchat). I met up with her to sell her some bud and she asked me to hangout for a little bit and I agreed. I had absolutely no intention of hooking up with her, because of her history with my roommate, but one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together. It happened several more times after this mainly because I felt very comfortable around her and enjoyed her company. \n\nOne day I decided to tell him what was going on, because I don't like to keep secrets from my close friends. Initially he just brushed it off, but the next day he told me he felt like I betrayed him and it was fucked up that I had hooked up with her on several different occasions. \n\nFor me I feel like I did nothing wrong because i didn't initiate or seek her out, but also because he was the one who broke up with her and on top of that it has been well over a year AND he has a new gf who he is in love with. He said he still has strong feelings for her and if that's true than why did you end the relationship? He told me to promise him that I would never see her again and I agreed.\n\nAm I wrong for wanting to be around someone that makes me feel like I am cared about eventhough they have history with a very close friend of mine? I didn't want to get inimate with her, she initiated it and I didn't stop her because it felt right and I was very lonely. Is it more important that I keep him happy or pursue my own happiness? \n\nTLDR; my roommate broke up with his gf a year and a half ago and currently has a new gf. His ex contacted me and we ended up getting intimate with eachother unintentionally (at least on my behalf I can't speak for her intentions). I felt the need to confess this to him and he feels like I betrayed our friendship and wants me to promise never to talk to her again. He feels like he can't trust me anymore. \n\n",

We'll call her Bee. She's been dating a man for about 6-8 months now, and living with her pretty much the entire time they've been dating.\n\nLast night, I went over to Bees house to bullshit as we often do on Friday nights (video games, weed, booze, anime, food, or all of the above) After she lets me in both of her daughters (4/5 and 7) started screaming that I was there, giving hugs, asking for me to do things for/with them, normal kid shit. So, making a little small talk with the girls (Oh Really? You'll have to ask your momma about that... You know, stuff like that, the generic response to excited kids), I make the way to my to Bees room, where we usually do most of our hanging.\n\nI haven't even turned away from Bee or her kids, taken my jacket or messenger bag off, and Bee's boyfriend pops off from behind me,\n\n\"You just gonna walk in to someone's crib and not greet them? Seriously?\"\n\nNow, at first, I assume he's joking, but when I turn around he's seriously pissed. I scoff and start to take my messenger bag off and put it in the usual spot (I'm a bit ocd-ish at times), and say\n\n\"You saw me and saw I was saying hello to everyone. It's not like I was ignoring you\nBut you can say hello to me, you know.\"\n\nMore, what he said really pissed me off, because this isn't his place. His name ain't on the lease, his name ain't on the car, and he doednt pay 50% of any bills (except party favors)\n\nAfter a few moments he replied \"Nah\" with a fucked up look on his face.\n\nHe proceeds to sit in the room when us for 1.5 hours, refusing to speak or acknowledge either of us for the majority of the night, unless it was his turn in rotation for weed, and then only sometimes, skipping some hits then acting pissy if we assumed he wanted skipped.. He pulls her off to smoke a cigarette, they talk for a sec, and then he returns. I go outside to smoke with Bee a d ask her if I should go. She says no, but I still end up leaving shortly afterwards cause I feel awkward af at this point.\n\n\nSo, AITA for not greeting my friends BF before her kids? Or not apologizing to the man who loves in but does not own the place for not paying him enough respect? ",

      "description": "TL;DR: Best friend's gf plans to break up with him and tells me so over a phone call. I'm lonely and have a nice chat with her. Says she may like me very much. Me is mostly thinking about sex, for the sake of friendship (?), no relationship. AITA for technically flirting with a girl in a failed relationship? \n\n\n\nOn mobile, kinda worried/confused and no native English speaker, so sorry for spelling errors and grammatical mistakes.\n\n\nSo, my best friend of about 5 years and his gf have been together for about 1,5 months. His gf, whom I've met once with him and then once alone, also somehow has become a friend of mine, at least a likeable person, I'd say.\n\nThey really look cute and all, being the new, young couple freshly and deeply in love....however,just a few hours ago, his gf called me (we've become hodd and trustable friends over the time. And, since she happens to love cuddles, we've been pretty touchy, too; only with the consent of my best friend, tho, of course) and admittedly told me she was thinking about and actually considering breaking up with my friend.\n\nAround that time, I've been feeling a little lonely, so I tried to keep the talk as long as possible, asking her out on her motives, if it maybe was just a phase etc. (it isn't. Honestly doesn't feel love for him anymore, thinks he is too clingy, plans on talking to him this week...) and then....after some time, a few puns and giggles and sort of serious talks here and there, I've asked her about her thoughts on me only to find out she thinks I'm kind of a weirdo, but in a cute and irritating. Didn't really feel bad at actually trying to flirt with her in some way...\n\nIt went on for about 3 to 4 hours, us only ending it  because she felt tired. In the end, I found out she may start developing a crush on me, and me.....telling her I would rather prefer just a one night stand as being in a relationship with her would be weird, regarding my buddy... I don't know.\n\n\nSo, what do you all think? Am I overreacting? Exaggerating? AITA? Have been a lurker until now and I'm really....uhh...confused? Is that the word?\n\nAnyway, please just tell me how badly I effed up. ",

      "description": "Hi guys so quick background My GF and I have been dating for 2.5 years now, and everything is going great, we're happy together, love each other all that good stuff. We're both at the Same University and both 3rd years. My 1st year I got together with some friends of mine and started a comedy improv team, and we've grown from 2 members to 20 since then, and we have tryouts every semester.\n\nYesterday, my GF tells me she's going to try out for the team, which I really dont want to happen. However, its her prerogative and im not going to tell her what to do, or what not to do. Basically, I dont want her to because it's \"my thing\" and she comes around  the shows a lot and shes always more than welcome when we throw parties or get dinner together, which I like bc I love her and all, but if she's on the team it'll become \"our thing\" and there really wont be anything I do that shes not a part of. She's often busy during these parties/dinner so she comes when she can, but it's still mostly me and my friends. She also joined my professional org early last semester, which I was happy with because it was cool to her have around at the dumb events I hate, but improv is different. I feel like this is the last thing I have that I can do and just do alone. \n\nThe thing is I do thing im being impartial here, if the same thing I wouldn't be enthused about it. I dont think we should ever tell someone to not tryout, of course, but I think it can only do bad things. If She doesn't make it, it'll seem like my friends dont like her, and, on the flip side, my friends will be more inclined to put her on the team because shes a friend and they like her. If she gets on the team and we break up, that's 2.5 years of baggage that wont just go away, and could mess up the troupe. \n\nLast note: I did tell her I didn't want her to, but I wouldn't stop her from doing it, and she said she is sad we disagree but will do it anyway.\n\nThanks, all\n\ntl;dr My girlfriend wants to try out for my improv team but I feel like its 'my thing' ",

Along the road since we come from conservative cultures her parents found out that she was texting me late at night when we were 17 and her parents basically told her to dump and never talk to me again. But we continued to do so in secret.  Ever since, our relationship has been on the down low and not in the public.\n\nFast forward to now, my GF and I meet every week and we’re pretty happy together and relationship is still on the DL. We figured we’d tell our parents that we want to get married when we’re well established in Our lives; finish school, have a job, etc.\n\n Now the issue at hand, I’ve always wanted to go somewhere for the day and spend a day or two outside the city. But recently me and her had a fight because I kept telling her that I wanted to do something with her and take a trip somewhere, and she basically said that she’s not comfortable with going anywhere with me and that we don’t need to make memories by going anywhere, and that all that matters in the end is that I have her by my side.  She further stated that, asking her to go somewhere with me shows that I value “making memories and sharing adventures” more than I value her.. and that if I want to go with her somewhere I should wait until we’re married which could be another 4-5 years..\n\nTL;DR: Am I the asshole for wanting to go somewhere with my GF because I want to spend time, share an adventure, and make memories with her? \n\nSorry for the grammar, typing this on my phone. \n",

Without going into too much detail, I have a very rare condition that started 5 years ago and has been getting increasingly worse the past 2 years. I'm in a lot of pain and on bad days its quite debilitating and affects my quality of life greatly. In addition if untreated it can result in potentially life threatening issues (blood clots leading to stroke, heart attack etc.) My boyfriend has watched me suffer with this condition through our relationship and go from doctor to doctor looking for help, without much success (due to my disease being very rare). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally got an appointment at a renowned research hospital that specializes in this disease. I would have to be there for 3-4 days and it involves a 4 hour flight from our home city. The hospital recommends someone accompaniy me since  I would have to cease taking my medication for multiple days before the flight/appointment and will be in need of assistance due to increased physical symptoms.\n\nI don't really  have anyone else to go with meme. I don't have many friends in the area, my father isn't really in the picture and my mother will not be able to to get time off work to go with me, so it only leaves my boyfriend. He initially offered to go since he's in tech and can work remotely, and he has flight credits to use for the flight there.\n\nHowever, now his roommate announced he's moving out at the end of April and my bf will need to find a new roommate.\n\nHe says he will be too stressed with finding a roommate and can't leave in April for multiple days (my appointment is April 16th). He asked me to move the appointment and I told him I will have to go back on a 6-12 month waitlist if I cancel, but he insisted having a good roommate is important to him and April will be busy with interviewing roommates. He seems to very concerned he will have to pay rent on his own for a month if he doesn't find someone. However, we live in a large tech heavy city with people always looking for rooms and he has a decent apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for thinking he's being incredibly selfish considering how much of an impact this disease has on my life?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for everyone's advice!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I realise the title reads like something you would expect in a school playground but hear me out. \n\nDue to certain circumstances during the holidays when my fiancée and I are home from University, we both stay at her family's house with her brother and mother. Her brother is, to put it simply, a bit of a dick. He walks over his sister and mother constantly with no repercussions and generally lacks any respect for anyone. The only thing that has any influence on him is the fact that his mother pays all of his phone/gym/general bills, despite the fact that he works a full-time job and pays no rent. \n\nAnyway, onto the assholery. Under no circumstances will his mother let him have friends over, mainly because most of them smoke weed and she can't trust any of them. Obviously he doesn't take any notice of this. She tends to go away for several days at a time which coincidentally means he has friends round *every* night. They're ridiculously loud and it basically means we're both unable to sleep until they're gone which is usually at 1am. Every time this happens I politely message him asking them to all be quiet as I'm struggling to sleep, this is always met with cackles from downstairs and they then get louder. This has happened a few nights in a row now with me constantly asking them to be quiet. So last night I went for the only thing I could do to give me a chance of sleep, which was to snitch to his mother that he's had mates round constantly and it's impossible for us to sleep. \n\nHe quickly found out and has proceeded to call me every name under the sun for ratting him out and seems to think I am an asshole for blowing the whistle. I'm not entirely sure what else he expected to happen, I imagine he was shocked that someone actually called him out for once. This is all relatively fresh and his mother hasn't even seen the message yet, but I imagine there's a good chance he's going to lose a lot of the money he gets for his stuff. \n\nSo AITA Reddit? I'm predicting ESH, but to be honest if I could go back in time I would do it again. \n\nNote: I would have no issue with him having mates round if they were actually quiet. But they're very loud and stomp up and down the stairs regularly. He's had plenty of messages begging for peace and quiet and hasn't responded to any of them so I saw this is my only option. ",

I put out the idea of going in August, it’s still winter time for us and it’s a fair bit away so we have time to save and all that, and we all agreed on that without much discussion.\n\nAbout a week or two after initially talking about M thought of going for her birthday instead which is in late June, but only discussed it with C and not me. We have decided on what days we are gonna go but after that we haven’t organised anything. I have tried a couple times to organise accommodation but they just leave me on read or just not read it at all.\n\nSo my question is would I be the asshole if I book flights when I want to go, which would be mid July, without asking them and then just telling them if they want to come they can?",

      "description": "So this literally just happened/is happening.  For context, we're both males if that makes any difference.\n\nMy boyfriend is the type of guy who likes to do surprises.  Now I've no issue with being bought a surprise gift or having a surprise dinner made for me or anything like that, but I do have an issue when it comes to a surprise that involves a trip away/night away/holiday/weekend break or anything of that sort.\n\nBackstory as to why this is an issue.  A few years ago I was diagnosed officially with epilepsy, \n\nAround a year after this had happened, after struggling through severe daily anxiety, not sleeping, eating properly waking up every morning and being physically sick because I had to leave the house I was signed off work.  I was then diagnosed with severe GAD, PTSD (From the seizures) and agoraphobia.  I didn't want to be left alone and I didn't want to leave the house, I was signed off for a year, put on meds, had therapy and eventually got hypnotherapy which got me back to work in December 2017.  2018 was pretty good, I've improved so much, got back to work, got a promotion, I still had anxiety, still don't really like being out but most days its bearable and I've learned how to cope.  One thing I don't cope very well with is new places, my own town/city I'm cool with because I know where I am and it's just that comfort.  \n\nI've told this to my boyfriend multiple times, please let me know if he wants to \"surprise\" me with a trip away or something because chances are I'll need to prepare myself.\n\nSo I get a call just now asking if I'm okay to do something monday night, I'm like, what? He says he's not telling me and I'm like well if you don't tell me what I'm not going to agree to it.  And he just huffs off the phone saying \"it doesn't matter\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI text him and ask him to please tell me what he wanted to do, he tells me and said he booked a nice hotel away for the night on Monday, and although this is super sweet of him to do he KNOWS that it's an issue to me and I really cannot afford to relapse.  I text him back reminding what I've said before and I appreciate the sentiment.  He just says \"It's not that far away, I'm going to lose the deposit now but doesn't matter\".  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like shit now but why should I have to feel like shit when I've asked so many times?! Just because outwardly I may appear to be doing OK, he knows what's going on inside and knows I still wouldn't be comfortable with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

My whole thing is that his foot almost kicked her head back and with how fragile her neck is right now....and I get I shouldn’t have gone that far but he would have hurt her cuz of how fast he was going \n\nHe told my stepmom (his grandma) and she came out pissed at me and my niece. And she didn’t ask for specifics just asked what we said. It took my niece going in and telling her grandma just how close he was to knocking my daughters head back for her to realize we were just trying to get him to realize how bad he could have hurt her.  He was literally maybe an inch and a half away from her chin and she was laying down. \n\nI understand he’s young but he kept saying he wasn’t close to hurting my daughter. ",

      "description": "My mother remarried when I was 18 after being a single mother for years. I'm 32 now.\n\nRecently my mother decided that my choice of spouse and my spouse's religion did not align with her expectations, so she cut me out of her life last winter.\n\nFwiw, she's sent a few texts saying she loves me, but also refuses to apologize for her actions. She also thinks I'm being disrespectful for standing up for my partner's freedom to believe what she will. \n\nThe only reason I ever talked to her husband is that I'd go visit every few months. When I was younger he asked me to go hunting with him, but I didn't really enjoy it. \n\nHis mother passed away a few years ago and he asked me to attend the funeral. I did - I even filled in as a pallbearer because one dude had a back injury.  I felt super uncomfortable doing that because I had never met his mother. And now I'm a pallbearer at her  funeral. Apparently he insisted to his brothers that I do it because he saw me as “her grandson.” I didn't want to make a fuss at this poor woman's funeral, so I went along with it.\n\nNow that my mother disowned me, I haven't visited or contacted him. He texted asking if he had done something wrong to make me push him away, and I basically told him what I'm writing here now. He's an okay dude, but we don't really have anything in common.  And with my mother freezing me out, I don't feel like navigating the complicated politics of him, her, and me. Even if we keep our contacts brief and relatively discreet. Ain't got time for that lol.\n\nI felt bad about it, but I've been reflecting on just how much I've bent backwards to accommodate his “son I never had” fantasy. I've no interest in a surrogate father figure, and I've no interest in helping him live out his fatherhood fantasies. He has a daughter - age 36 - that he never really spent time with either and never fully acknowledged.  \n\nPlus, he once tried to extort my mother out of $100,000. He asked for a divorce and said $100,000 would get him to go away quietly. This was years ago an apparently they figured it out. But still, once bitten twice why, right?\n\nSo. AITA?",

      "description": "Mobile so pls excuse my formatting.\n\nI strongly believe my boyfriend is addicted to porn. He has thousands of pictures of hentai in his gallery and always has at least 20 pornhub, brazzers, or other porn tabs open on his phone for him to come back to. Sometimes he saves porn he finds aesthetically pleasing or well drawn, with no intention to get off to it. \n\nWhile this is all fine, maybe a little out of the ordinary, it puts me over the line when he uses porn during sex with me. At first he claimed it was just derogatory to me, which he finds hot and I did too until we tried having sex without it and he was unable to climax. About 70% of the time we have any form of intercourse (blowjob, handjob, or even actual sex) he uses porn to get off.\n\nI'm an extremely anxious overthinker and I've started to believe it's just because I'm doing something wrong or I'm not physically attractive enough for him to be able to have sex with me and get off. It's getting to the point where I catch myself thinking that it's normal and every couple experiences this, but I have never experienced it in any of my past relationships. While I respect his right to use porn to masturbate to when I'm not around it has started making me feel really insecure so I just confronted him about it over text. I told him how insecure it was making me and if he could just try to lay off the porn a little. He mostly shrugged it off and didn't seem very concerned about it. I got more serious and told him he needed to be more mature about this discussion and at that point he just stopped responding. \n\nHe has continued to download more porn and has made no visible effort to change his behavior since our one-sided conversation, even though it has caused me to break down into tears several times. He says I'm just being silly and overreacting and it's not that big of a deal. \n\nAm I missing something? Am I approaching this the wrong way? AITA?",

In the beginning it was cute she had a lot of problems and I was her \"savior.\" I admit I may have made her more reliant on me than was necessary. She hated the school she was going to and complained that her life sucked and \"nothing ever works out for her.\" Me being an eternal optimist decided to take up the challenge and see what I could do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, things were good for a while but with each problem that was solved, a new one appeared to surface. Her childhood didn't help either since apparently she was bullied and her dad cheated on her mom. However, other than that she had a financially stable and secure household with her parents providing her whatever she needed - perhaps she was even a bit spoiled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw a couple warning signs in the beginning which can be summed up to an entitled attitude e.g. if we went on vacation the hotel that I booked was maybe not fancy enough, I attributed these feelings to her well-off upbringing and hoped with time, reality and expectations would converge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter college, she couldn't get a job at desired location and was pretty sad about that for a while. She did get in the following year with that hiring cycle. After starting to work, she complained that she is naturally slow (which I admit) and her superiors want her to work faster so hence she would be reprimanded. So from now, not having a job in her desired location she goes from having that not to not liking it since she's yelled at for not being efficient enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout all this, she says she doesn't like her career field and would like to switch, when asked what she wants to do instead she's pretty lost and unsure. Currently, she's working in an Asian country were work is demanding and believes going to the US would make her life easier. As a caveat, I'm American and agree her work environment sucks and would be better in the US (less yelling/demanding) but am afraid after this is solved, some other problem will come up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree years isn't a short time, the intent was to marry but I feel her consistent depressive attitude may make me very unhappy in the future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Eternal optimist dating serial pessimist, AITA for wanting to break-up after three years for failing to \"make her happy.\"",

His response was just that he didn't mean it to be rude, he just thought since we were close he could.  Even though we don't \"joke\" back.\n\nBut there was a part where he crossed a line for me.\n\nI work with kids, so naturally he thinks it's funny to call me a pedophile.  Not only to other friends, one who also works with me, but his online friends (he games)  that I've never met.  I tell him to not do that, and he persists.\n\nI'm also very close to someone with a kid.  And one night I was playing with the child, in front of the friend.  The child wanted to play foot doctor and asked me to take off my shoe and sock.  I thought I was cute so I recorded the interaction and put it on a social media story.\n\nHe then puts me in a group chat with a friend of ours, and then goes on ask me why I have videos of little girls playing with my feet.  And saying that he thought it was creepy.  He knows that girl and my relation to the mother and that's where I drew the line.\n\nI told him to go fuck himself and have yet to talk to him again.  I've let other people know that I'm currently not on good terms with him and they have essentially said \"that's just how he jokes\" and made me out to be the bad guy for being stuck up and sensitive about it.\n\nI don't think it's personally funny, especially when it's the child of a very good friend of mine.\n\nAITA?\n",

After I tell her, she promises to not tell her. She then ask me my opinion on X (My ex). I said she sometimes does stuff for attention and can’t always control her emotions (she acts different in front of others, we seemed to kind of like eachother again but then called me a thing in front of others etc.). She then asks why do you hate my friends. I reply with that I don’t hate them but you asked for my opinion. She then asks why am I talking shit. I reply with you asked for my opinion on them. She then facetimes me and what a surprise, they are all at a sleepover. I immediately hang up as I don’t want to get into more drama.\n\nShe (Brenna) then messages me hahahahha and says everyone hates me. I then call her a snake, a liar, and a bad friend (or something similar). She then says it was a joke, but by then I was on the verge of crying. I say that she is an asshole and shouldn’t have done that. She then says I am playing the victim, and that I got payback. She then says it’s hard to pity me, but later says she apoligized even though she didn’t.  She then gets her friends to say that’s uncool of me, and to stop playing the victim. They then say “sorry” but then say they aren’t sorry and that I should’ve lied. I explain that it was Danielle’s question and I answered truthfully. I explain more on how messed up what they all did was They all block me and I go to bed.\n\nSo my question is, AITA in the end of this?\n\n",

      "description": "Okay so there is a lot of backstory and nuance to this, but I'll try to explain it as easy as possible. A few details are changed or excluded for anonymity purposes. \n\nI dated a guy for about a year and a half and throughout the relationship, he became more and more emotionally abusive. It had a really negative toll on my emotional state so I broke it off about around the beginning of 2018. I spent the 2018 summer getting over the whole ordeal and trying to regain my self confidence and stop doubting everything. \n\nNow, of course the relationship wasn't all bad and I wasnt some kind of perfect angel that was just a niave victim of it all. We both made mistakes as people do in life. The problem was, this guy didn't see his mistakes as mistakes - rather a process of \"fixing\" me. There's a lot there. \n\nI dropped all contact from him and tried to get as much distance as possible to get over the break up and move on. Because of this, I also became a bit of a recluse for awhile, since we ran in the same circles. Recently though, I've been rekindling some of those friendships (mind you, it's been awhile since the break up), which requires that my ex sometimes needs to be around me when we both happen to be invited to things. \n\nI thought that it was okay enough between us that we could have short conversations and occupy the same space at the very least. I definitely was not/am not looking to be his friend. Not after all the shit he pulled. But he messaged me recently about wanting to be friends and settling the rift between us. Call me cynical, but that is not going to happen. For my own mental health, I will not allow that. \n\nHere's where I think I might be the asshole. See, I've moved on. He hasn't delt with the emotional repercussions of the break up. Its effecting me trying to regain my friendships because he cannot resist vilifying almost everything I do and talking a lot of trash on me. I told him he needs to deal with that and he said that I should help. I told him no, but I wished him luck, albeit passive ageessively. \n\nAm I the asshole for not holding a grown man's hand through the process of healing? Am I an asshole for seeing it like that? I know I'm not obligated to help him through that, but am I the asshole for not wanting to or even caring? \n\nTl;dr:  Ex has not personally delt with the emotional repercussions of a break up and its effecting friendships we share with others. He wants \"help\" to fix his baggage, but I dont think I should baby him. It's been months since we broke up. ",

When we got to the till he tried to use apple pay but it was not working and he had no other form of payment. He looked really sad and embarrassed. I totally get it, I would feel the same way too. I turned around and looked at my tip pile that had around $10 in it and contemplated just spending the 7 bucks. But I didnt and just stood there awkwardly waiting for the customer to say something. He was not mean or anything, he was actually quite nice. Then a customer who was sitting down got up and offered to buy his food and she did. It all went through and he was grateful and walked off. I'm just curious to know if I'm an asshole for not just being a little generous and giving up the 7 dollars. I could have even done an employee discount and gotten it to be $3.50 at a small risk of getting in trouble. I kinda felt bad afterwards and I am not sure if I should be. ",

      "description": "I'm kinda angry, and I do feel like I am in the right side of the story, but I'd like to hear other perceptions and write what happened down so I can stress down a bit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go to a very small gym and always make sure to go in early hours so that it's not full. Today I arrived and there was just one guy in a bench, and so I took one of the remaining four there were around. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was just finishing the first series when another person joined the gym. Let's call him Jim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I had finished, I stood up to move my stuff to another place that I would need to do my series, which he was using. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI approached to the point where he inevitably saw me and asked \"Hey man, could you intercalate?\" to which he agreed, but took the first turn of the machine. As he was doing it, he said to me \"Out of all the exercises, is this the one you HAVE to do?\". I thought he was being friendly, and so I kinda answered thinking it was just that. I said yes, but it won't take long, since I know I'm not the only one using it.   \n\n\nJim exhaled loudly and rolled his eyes telling me that I would mess his circuit if I used the machine, and that he always arrives at this time of the day so that the gym is empty. I was a bit confused, but just repeated that I won't take long in there. It was weird mainly since I thought he was just being friendly, as I said. And to suddenly receive that comment was a shocker. \n\n  \nIn my turn, as I was half-way there and he was doing another exercise, he drops the weights he was using and just tells me \"See? It's all messed up now, thanks.\" while pointing at me with his palm as if I had just said something he didn't understand to later walk off with his hands on his waist, shaking his head.   \n\n\nAt this point, I didn't answer. As I finished I just moved to a different machine and decided to shift my routine a bit so that I could let him work. I was pissed, but I didn't want to get a trouble with Jim.   \n\n\nNow I was in the last series just finishing, and Jim approaches me to tell that he was finished and that I could use it now. After around 20 minutes. I just replied with a nod and a thumbs up since, well, the gesture was done. I had to re-do all my routine just so that he doesn't tantrum.   \n\n\nNow guys, we're both customers paying for the same service, we both arrive at the same hour to have the gym empty, we both were in chest day. Doesn't it makes sense to share the machines we are using? Isn't that what most gyms encourage? Like, yeah I get it; I would mess up with his routine, BUT he would mess with mine too, which is what happened. Wouldn't it have been better to just take turns on there, even if it means taking longer pauses?   \n\n\nI really cannot agree with him in just keeping a machine for himself, while there might be someone else that needs it. I don't know why he felt entitled to it, even if, with his logic, HE arrived after me. \n\nI didn't want to add this part since it doesn't contribute anything, but he is one of those guys that goes to the gym almost naked. Shorts with 5/6 thigh uncovered, and small sport that shows his nipples from time to time. Small mohawk haircut; this is why I was a bit intimidated to reply back, and so decided to not push it further.   \n\n\nAm I the asshole, guys? ",

      "description": "Throwaway. Mobile, sorry for formatting.\nAround a year ago, a cousin of mine went missing. I have a huge family so when my mom and dad found out and told me and my siblings, I didn’t even know who they were talking about. Even when I saw pictures of him, he just did not look familiar at all. It’s the case with a lot of cousins of mine, I barely know a good chunk of my family. \nSo my family searched for him, filed a missing report, etc. They found him, dead. \nWe still don’t know the details of his death and might never know. My mom was absolutely distraught and heartbroken. She compared it as if my niece, who I lived with for 2 years and see her frequently, had gone missing and was found dead. I sympathized with her. But I felt...nothing. I felt bad somebody died, obviously. But I didn’t grieve as if he was a family member. Honestly? He was a total stranger. A big part of that might be because he mostly spoke spanish and I can barely greet people in spanish, which is the case for most of my family. \nSo yeah. we had his funeral last year around this time. And my aunt, The mother of my late cousin, is having a thing where family comes over and prays for him and just seeing each other again. I remember last year visiting them so often and a bunch of family came because it was the first death in the family in awhile. \nIt’s happening this Saturday. And I’m dreading it. I really don’t want to go. I’m not that religious in my family and I can’t admit that to my family yet. Plus, my aunt lives so far away. I think it’s a 2-4 hour drive but i can’t remember. All I remember is that it takes at least 2 hours. We have to leave at 4pm, and we’re gonna be there the whole evening. I really don’t want to spend my time praying and staying on the couch not talking to family because I literally cannot understand them. I would honestly rather stay home. \nWould I be the asshole if I told my family I don’t want to go? And, am I the asshole for not grieving my late cousin’s death? The last one is just something I want to know, since it’s been bugging me for awhile.\n",

      "description": "Am I the asshole \n\nSo to give some context my parents before meeting and having me had kids. My mom had two daughters and my dad had three sons then they got divorced met each other and had me.\n\nMy father passed away when I was nine he fought with an illness for a long time. My mother was physically disabled, she was in a wheelchair so growing up I was her caregiver, she was abusive and we lived on disability. Growing up my siblings have always lived on the other side of the country along with the rest of my distant family so I feel disconnected from them, there is roughly an 20year age gap between me and them. \nIn grade nine our house was destroyed by a storm and lack of upkeep so it was deemed unlivable. We were homeless for a while until an organization simmilar habitat for humanity offered to build us a house. Their main goal was that I would have a place to live, which is why so many people donated. During the build my mom got sicker, we lived in the house for two months before she passed away. None of them came to the funeral or to visit when she was dying one only came afterwards to go through stuff and take what they wanted. In the will my siblings got a little bit of money(not that much since we were broke) and the house was suppose to go to me since it was built for me and my mom. Since I was not done high school I didn't want to live by myself so I rented out the place to someone with a disability since it was designed for wheelchairs. And I used the funds to help pay for my education, even though it took a long time I am now a proud RN. The person who was suppose to take care of the will died so the house never got put into my name. \n\nIt's now been five years during that time my siblings never said anything about it. I'm done school and I feel ready for the responsibility of the house. So in December I told them that I was working towards getting the house transferred into my name as it should have been done, and they are furious at me saying that it should be divided amongst all of us. One of my brothers is even calling me an awful person, saying that I'm being manipulative and \"how could I betray them like this\". Apparently my mom lied and said that the house would be divided equally amongst the siblings but then wrote that only I would get it in the will, which doesn't surprise me as she was a horrible person. I'm the type of person who hates confrontation and this situation is stressing me out. Even though I dont really know them I dont want them to hate me. \n\nAm I the asshole for trying to get what's written as mine in the will? \n\nTldr; my mom died 5 years ago and my siblings are all 20ish years older than me got little in the will and are mad that I'm trying to claim the house that is written to go to me.

      "description": "So a little history, My brother and I were both born in the same year, him in January and I in December. We grew up doing the whole best buds thing, but during middle school we started to fight and argue more and more. After high school tho, i don't think of him as a brother, he was more worried about himself and how he appeared to his friends to really care how he was with me. He would sooner throw me under the bus to save his own skin then to try and help me out. \n\nMy dad on the other hand, has tried his heart out to try and bring us all together again. We never really saw eye to eye on how things were in the house. He argues that he treats all his kids the same, but growing up and only seeing my dad 2 times a week, and how all my brothers get new and improved things while i got nothing but second stuff from my eldest brother, I beg to differ. We were by no means rich, i knew that and understood that. I hardly asked for anything new because i always knew it would be a no. I knew tho my dad would do anything for us and try to make us happy the best he can. He also used to spank and discipline us, but now doesnt even try to discipline my youngest brother.\n\nA few weeks ago, after leaving the local electrician union  and going back to my local community college, my old ford focus, needed to be either repaired or replaced. Now i only work at Walmart and my brother and dad both work in a local carpenter union, I make like 650+ a paycheck while they make what i make in one week and get paid more frequently.  Now not wanting to drop a large amount of money on a car that has 250000+ miles, i went with a replacement car. During all of this I bring the idea to my dad, he came up with an idea that helps us both, we go 50/50 on it. Not wanting to go into crippling debt I go with it. We go to the dealership, I realize how real this was getting, credit check, pay stub check and all that stuff (never dealt with a dealership before). We find a car that is decent but a little pricey, i didn't want to go that high but it was my dad putting the money down but i was using my credit and trading in my old car, it wasn't even but it wasn't one sided. After all the paper work is signed ( I signed everything, he wasn't a co signer) I get to drive my \"new\" used car home. It was a breathe of fresh air, power steering worked, heating worked, it was amazing.\n\nToday, now I made it clear to my dad that i didn't want anyone driving our car, if it wasn't one of us doing the driving. He agrees and seems to understand the points i was making. I wake up, to a phone call from my brother explaining that the car was with him and that he was just dropping off our little brother, and explains that he needs the car today to do laundry and says he'll do mine, I groan and say sure, since that would make today a lot easier. After hanging up i realize my clothes are still in my room, i check his room and his clothes are still there too. Now i waited a good chuck of time before i asked for my car back, no response. I get upset and text him saying, i don't want him to use my car without asking and how he didn't put anything down to help with the car. Now i know my brother like the back of my hand, if its not one thing its something that makes it impossible to do the simple task he was given. Now after i send that, he responds like grease lightening, \"chill\". Ummmmmmm you take my car without asking, you've lied about where you were going before, you've smoked in my car before (made it 100% clear that smoking in my car isn't going to happen). I go off and tell him that hes full of shit if he thinks i'm going to roll over with my car like i did with my things when we were growing up, he explains that dad let him use it and how i'm a heartless fuck head for not letting him use it. After that i left him on read and I text my dad saying how amazing he is for letting other people use our car without even saying anything to me (hes let my other siblings, who are all not on the insurance, use it) and how when he wants help with something, to go to my brother since he wants to bend over backwards to make him happy.\n\nI feel like shit for all of this but i hate when they step all over me to do what ever they want. Am I the asshole for telling my brother and dad off? or Am i just blowing this up for no reason?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I apologize as this may be a long one.\n\nSo this past year I (24M) moved in with my brother (26M) and things have been slightly rocky. For context his previous roommate bailed on him after his 1 year lease was up, and he had no one to live with him. I was living in some tough conditions and figured that with my new job I could afford to live someplace better, and we agreed to move in together.\n\nMe and him get along great normally, we both love the same shows, movies, games and we grew up together so we are fairly used to living with one another. The only problem is that he doesn't have a car or his license and relies on the bus or his own two feet to get him around.\n\nFeeling generous I gave him a ride into work a few times, and a ride to school here and there if he was late, but his requests started getting more and more frequent.. We would often get groceries together as the car is easier to transport food in, or he would ask me to drive him across town to get his medication, if hes going out drinking to be picked up, and the list goes on.\n\nHere is where it started to annoy me. He refuses to get a license cause he doesn't want to \"drag people around town\" and that hes \"scared of driving\". Also whenever I ask for gas money he says I'm crazy and that if were going to the same place it doesn't take up any extra gas so he doesn't owe me anything, or a myriad of other excuses. The main part that annoys me is when I say no to driving him he gets mad and demands a reason why I can't stop watching a movie/show/game to get him someplace. Sometimes I'm just not feeling like it, and that drives him mad because clearly I'm not busy so I'm doing it out of spite. \n\nHe also doesn't do any groceries or laundry unless I do them anymore, just so he doesn't have to walk or bus. This leads to him getting mad if I don't need groceries or have clean clothes, as now hes stranded and I'm screwing him over. I always ask him how he did anything before we moved in together and he plays victim and says that his life was hell, and how his feet hurt from walking, and how I'm being stupid. \n\nWe have started getting into actual fights over it and now it's driving me insane. I honestly don't mind doing favours for people, but when suddenly it becomes my responsibility to do all those favours I'm done.\n\nMaybe I should have been more firm from the start, or maybe I'm overreacting over nothing.. Honestly I don't know, but AITA?",

      "description": "My friends and I have had a small discord chat for almost 2 years now. For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.

      "description": "My (22) boyfriend and I (22) have a games night with our friends on the weekends every once in a while, and I planned a Christmas dinner/games night with them all for this Sunday.  It’ll be at his dads place, which is new and fairly roomy. His dad is never there, so we take care of the house (2 story, basement, 3 bathroom, 4 bedroom) just us two. \n\nI planned to cook an entire meal for everyone (11 people including us) , being a couple of beef roasts, mashed potatoes, veggies, desserts..etc. We’ve yet to get groceries/decorations because we’ve both had a busy work week. I talked with him loosely about going out tonight to get groceries after he’s done helping a buddy with some body work on his car. Early today we talked about seeing eachother tonight still. \n\nHe was seeing a different buddy (a long time friend, one who will be at the party on Sunday) tomorrow just to hangout for half the day, but not long ago today he asked if it was alright if he could sleepover at his place tonight.  It stressed me out (I have a serious anxiety disorder) because I was expecting one thing and he kind of surprised me by changing the plans around that I had set in my head. I told him we had a lot to do still to prepare for Sunday, and he said okay and that he had canceled the plans, but I knew I upset him by the way the tone of his messages changed. \nI got even more stressed and upset because I knew I upset him and I felt like an asshole for seemingly “making” him do this all with me. \nHe was supposed to hangout with his friend for a bit tomorrow(Saturday), while I would bake cookies and start preparing. So, it’s hard for me to understand why I am such a bad guy here. I get that he sees this friend often during our game nights, but not just the two of them alone, so he was looking forward to that.. but why couldn’t he just see him tomorrow? Maybe when I was upset, it upset him, like the way I felt?.. I don’t know. He shuts down when we fight, and needs space while I just want to resolve things and feel better ASAP.  We are trying to work on our communication, because it’s not the best. \n\nI’m very stressed about doing all the preparing for myself now. I don’t have a car to get around places.  We ended up having a fight, and I feel horrible about it all. \n\nMaybe I can’t see what I’m doing wrong. AITA?\n",

During the summer my  girlfriend's mom passed away from sickness and I've been trying to support her any way I can through the mourning process. In the fall season, one of our good friend's father passed away as well from old age and my friend is in the grieving process now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore his father passed, some friends and I went to visit a few times at the hospital, and after the funeral my friend flew out to spend Christmas with his brother's family. When he came back, we held a get together of sorts as many of us didnt have the time over the holidays to just chill and catch up. My friend is there at the gathering and initially we ask him how he's coping and how he's doing, but mostly we just get 1 word answers and no follow up and a lot of silence, which is fine and I understand, maybe he hasn't enough time to process everything or he doesn't feel up to sharing right now. So the rest of us gather that he's not ready yet/ this might not be the time and place so we go back to talking about other stuff. Towards the end of the night, some of us ask him if theres anything he wants to say, to which he says no and kind of excuses himself from the evening early. Keep in mind that everything up to this point is completely understandable to us, everyone grieves a bit differently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's where things get a bit frustrating. My friend and my girlfriend has been reaching out to my friend for a while because they're empathetic about each other's situation. After the gathering, I get a message from my girlfriend asking if anything went down that night, because my friend messaged her saying that we were being very surface level and haven't been very supportive of him since his father's passing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm a bit mad cause some of us have actually been reaching out to him for a while (like inviting him over dinner, etc) but every time he just seems to close up . The only people he does talk to are some of my friends who have experienced some kind of loss, and I'm starting to think he's in a very \"you can't understand what I'm going through\" mindset, which admittedly no, some of us really can't, but that doesn't mean we don't care. And it makes me a bit angry when he paints that picture to our other friends. I made a small argument with my girlfriend: she says we're not being supportive enough, I think we're doing our best and our friend is going around our backs saying we're shitty friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that he's going through a lot. To make matters worse, his company is downsizing and his work hours are downright insane, and he's spent the last few years taking care of his dad and now he lives alone at home. I'm really frustrated at the whole shitty situation, and he's normally a really great friend who is like a brother to me, but TBH this attitude is really not helping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Friend is grieving, we try to reach out, he thinks we're not and being a bunch of uncaring jerks and tells some of our other friends. So now I'm a little on edge and tbh a bit fed up.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my poor and disabled MIL to live with me?",
      "description": " My  MIL has several chronic illnesses. She is about 70, and it's getting  harder for her to get around. I think she is  probably \"ok\" to live on her own for a few more months, but the other  shoe is going to drop, and it's going to drop soon. I know she is going  to ask to move in with us. I am dreading this, because I can't imagine  anything worse. Am I just a selfish asshole?\n\nBack  Story: My MIL is single and lives alone because my husband's father was  a crazy jerk who abandoned his family. They are legally married, but  separated, and he squandered ALL their money. Now she has zero money to  her name, except her social security check.  As a result, she won't be able to pay for any sort of assisted living  or nursing home care when the time comes. She is going to need to apply  for a public nursing home, or live with one of her kids. I doubt her  kids will want her in a shitty home, so I think option 2 is going to  happen.\n\nWhenever  she visits us, she comes for the weekend. Although she can absolutely  walk (though with some discomfort); when she visits, she sits in a  recliner for 12 hours a day and asks for all her food and stuff to be  brought to her. Plus she is starting to develop bad body  odor. On top of all of this physical stuff, she drives me crazy with her  constant talking; she tells the same stories over and over again, talks  way too loudly all the time, and does this little \"act\", where she  feigns stupidity about tons of stuff. She is a 70-year-old woman and she  acts like a Valley Girl half the time. If she was there all the time, I  think I would seriously lose my mind.\n\nI  think she thinks she can live with us since we have a spare  bedroom/bathroom suite in our finished basement (that we use as a playroom for our kids) and we have  the biggest house of all her kids. But, we also have the most children--three kids  under the age of four. I am so incredibly  busy that I only get 6 hours of sleep each night. On weekends when she  visits, it's like adding another child to the mix. Also, I am in no way equipped to help with bathing or toileting, if it  comes to that. And I don't think she would want my husband to do it  either.\n\nShe has three other kids . All  of them are married. Two couples have 1 child each, and the third couple  are childless. The wives are all nurses, and would be much better  equipped to take care of her. However, they all have smaller houses that  she wouldn't want to stay in as much.\n\nThe  thing that makes me think I might be an asshole is that there isn't  anything overtly \"wrong\" with my MIL. I don't hate her (yet, lol), and  she isn't a bad person. She isn't even mean, she is just incredibly  needy and lacks the self-awareness to know when she is being obnoxious. \n\ntldr:  Am I the asshole if I tell my husband I don't want his mom to live with  us and then she might have to go to a nursing home?",

      "title": "AITA for lying to my son's girlfriend's parents?",
      "description": "My son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I’m walking both my dogs on a semi-urban sidewalk when two cyclists approach me from the opposite direction.  It’s a couple and they’re towing a child in a wagon trailer.  They’re taking up the entire sidewalk and approaching at a fairly rapid pace.  \n\nNormally, I would happily yield the right-of-way, but in this case there is a dedicated bike path literally five feet to my left.  I’m not talking about bike lanes painted on the existing road.  This is a dedicated bike path completely separate from the road.  If were talking about a painted bike lane that shares the street with vehicular traffic, I would understand the desire to ride with their child on the sidewalk, but that’s not the case here. \n\nResidents of this city requested tax dollars be spent to construct and maintain this path, yet this couple feels they are entitled to fly down the pedestrian sidewalk and have everyone make way.  Never mind that pedestrians always have the legal right-of-way, in my opinion this is just being a selfish dick\n\nUnsurprisingly, the husband barks at me for not making room and I point to the bike lane and tell him to use that if he’s unhappy.  \n\nHis spouse then tries playing the,  ‘We’re a nice family trying to enjoy our day and you’re being a jerk’ card, to which I reply, ‘I may be jerk, but you’re clearly illiterate and point to a sign saying cyclists should use the dedicated lane.’ \n\nDumbass husband then assumes a ‘come at me, bro’ posture and starts walking aggressively towards me.   Of course,  this immediately causes my dogs to go into ultra-protective mode, especially my German Shepard.  \n\nI’m backing up and also holding onto both dogs.  Wife starts screaming the top of her lungs what an asshole I am.  I reply, ‘And I’m not going to be able to keep these dogs from tearing you open a new asshole if you and your dumbass husband keep approaching me.’ \n\nAt this point, I do feel quite badly because their little kid is also freaking out, but don’t feel as if it’s my fault ay all.   Okay, perhaps I could have responded a bit more diplomatically at first, but that’s it.\n\n",

It wasn't until several minutes into the attack that he came out and struggled to get his dog off my dog. My dog's under arm muscle was ripped. The vet bills were $800 but I have pet insurance so they covered all but $280.

I grew up here and like it a lot. I am firmly middle class so while this event as been emotionally and mentally taxing it hasn't hurt me financially. The other guy might be struggling (I have no proof of what he can and cannot afford. This is all in my head (anxious mind)). \n\nAITA for asking for reimbursement, behavior classes, and a fenced in yard? \n\nI just think he needs to be a more responsible pet owner and the dog just needs proper training and a fenced in yard so he can continue to play.

      "description": "My husband's brother got married overseas a few years ago (bride was from there). Only his immediate family went and his groomsmen. I accompanied my husband; we were a married couple for a few years by then.\n\nI was excluded from a lot of the events. Whenever they wanted to take family photos I was asked to sit in the corner by myself or in the van (arranged transport for family members) by myself for a couple of hours. I know no one in the bride's side of the family was treated like this because I was in the van by myself. There was another event when they suddenly remembered that I was present and told me I had to come immediately, but I knew I couldn't make it in time, so didn't go.\n\nDespite being treated like this, I remained cordial and didn't complain then, nor the years after. I figured our flights were paid for and it wasn't like I really wanted to be in the bride and groom's photos anyway. I can't remember anymore whether I was upset at the time, I just let it go.\n\nRecently, I brought all this up for the first time when my husband complained about spending too much time at my family's gathering - where he was included, offered beer and was having a good time. His immediate response was to call me a selfish drama queen, said the wedding wasn't all about me, etc. Over the following days he complained to his family about me. They had excuses for everything and the general consensus was that I'm just being self centered.",

During the first year of James and Ann's relationship, I was under the assumption he was being faithful, but this was also during a time where we didn't hang out as much due to conflicting schedules. It was after Ann had gotten pregnant that I finally started being able to spend time with James and heard rumors about him sleeping around and even saw some pretty blatant behavior as such on his part.\n\nOne friends night out, James started making passes at a mutual friend he had an ongoing affair with and Ann almost caught him. It was getting messy so I went outside, but Ann came out to smoke a cigarette. She began to ask me questions like \"He wouldn't cheat on me right?\" and I felt paralyzed. I was a drunk myself and eventually my dumbass came out with an answer that was essentially \"I don't want to get involved.\" Which she took as absolute confirmation which then led into a crying, drunken screaming match at the bar.\n\nSuffice to say there was ALOT of fallout from this that largely resulted in most people going \"You shouldn't have said anything\", \"It wasn't your place\", etc. After a couple of months things seemed to blow over. Ann and James were still together and most of our friends had stopped caring about the incident. James and I eventually got on good terms and began to hang out sporadically. I had never stopped hearing rumors and when we started hanging out again he did the same unfaithful BS. I felt bad for Ann, but was afraid to speak up and eventually drifted away from this entire group of people.\n\nAfter I found out about the accident, I thought about Ann and texted her that if she needed any help to let me know. She thanked me and a few days later asked to talk on the phone.\n\nShe had caught James cheating again and just wanted to know if there was anything else she had been missing over the years because she was so paranoid and tired. I told her that I had seen a lot of seemingly unfaithful behavior and had heard rumors of even more and apologized for not saying something sooner. She was upset, but said she also felt relieved. Apparently my confirmation of her fears was the final push she needed and she would be talking to a divorce attorney.\n\nSo my question is: Am I the asshole for confirming all of her worst fears about her marriage after being a coward for so long?",

      "description": "So, some background. I have the top tier Netflix package for 4K streaming. I have it logged in on my iPhone, my SO’s iPhone, the iPad our two kids share, our smart TV and two xBox’s. last year, a close relative to mine was donating an organ so that another relative of ours could receive a donated organ as well, it resulted in lots of travelling and hotel/hospital stays for my relative, so I gave them my Netflix credentials, which they logged in on an iPad and a set top box. As of that point, I’ve never had issues accessing Netflix because too many people are watching. Recently, we were visiting my mom (who lives 5 hours away) and we wanted to watch Netflix, so I logged in on their TV. My mom isn’t too tech savvy, so I left it logged in. She ends up really liking it, and asks for my credentials so her boyfriend can put it on their tablet for when they travel. Within the week, I’ve received emails from Netflix that my credentials have been logged in on an additional TV to the one I put it on, a laptop, a fire stick, 2 tablets, a phone, and most recently, a set top box at an address way far away, where her boyfriends son lives. I still haven’t been kicked off for too many people being on the account, but I feel it’s going to happen soon. WIBTA if I just change the pw now? Should I wait until it inconveniences me? My mom and her bf are semi retired, so they aren’t flush with cash, but they aren’t broke either. ",

      "description": "So I recently became close friends (best friends, even) with a girl. I had seen her around my school for some time then we ended up sitting next to one another in a class. I was straightforward and told her I thought she was very pretty and if we could go out on a date. She had a boyfriend at the time and declined, but they broke up a couple weeks after I met her ( due to his infidelity) and we began to talk more. In the month and a half since we have become very close, I’ve been over to her house and met her family on multiple occasions, and she is going to meet my family for the first time this weekend. She’s even asked to go on vacation with us and wants me to take her with me on a trip to New York (without the family, just us).\n\nWe are always together and I’m getting (what I interpret to be) mixed signals (I was told by a friend of hers that she’s just “friendly”, she’s like this with a lot of guys, and I shouldn’t read into it). I let her know that I’ve started to develop feelings for her, and she told me 1) that I’m just horny and essentially my feelings aren’t real, and 2) she just got out of a relationship, she needs time.  I fully understand and respect her decision, and I said I’m fine with being friends with her.\n\nHowever,  I’m beginning to have second thoughts. The amount of time I spend with her daily, in school, out of school, and at work ( she got me a job at the same establishment she works at), will only increase my feelings for her. I already told her I wouldn’t feel comfortable being around her if she started talking to (as in Romantically) another guy or hooks up with someone, but I’m just wondering if I would be the asshole in a situation where she gets involved with another guy and I cut her off or distance myself to a point where our friendship sputters out.\n\nI’m just trying to keep myself from suffering unnecessarily by having to watch someone that I have feelings for be with someone else, especially considering how close she and I are. \n\nTL;DR I like a girl a lot and we have become close friends but I am thinking of cutting her off if she becomes romantically involved with someone else.",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together a year and have a wonderful relationship. I could not be happier. \n\nI’m planning on going travelling with 3 friends soon but my GF doesn’t know that two of them I’ve actually got with before. Let’s call them Rachel and Holly. \n\nHolly and I had a very brief kiss on a very drunken night out three years ago (brief because it felt weird). We talked about it later and agreed that we’re great as friends and should defo remain platonic. \n\nRachel and I made out on three consecutive nights out about two years ago, but it never came to anything. She met her now boyfriend soon after and any feelings I had went away. We’ve been completely platonic since.\n\nI’ve never slept with either of them, and see them both as just friends. We are part of the same group of friends and get along well together. My GF knows them and gets on with them well but isn’t in that friendship group.\n\nI’ve never told my girlfriend about it. She almost never asks me about past relationships/crushes/flings, so I never had the opportunity. There were times when I thought I should tell her, just because I didn’t want to hide anything from her but time went by and I never knew how to initiate that conversation. Wouldn’t it be weird if your SO sat you down and was like, “hey btw, I’ve made out with two of my friends”? \n\nSo now I’m wondering if I’m an asshole for not telling my GF. It almost feels like by bringing it up I’m making it a big deal. This all happened long before I even met my GF. I have zero interest in either of them now...and yet I have this slight feeling that it’s shady if I don’t tell her. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My son is currently 2 but the story starts 4 years ago when I dropped out of college and moved back in with my mom and stepfather. When I first moved back in was looking at a mountain of debt from my credit card and student loans and I was unemployed. To make matters worse I had been arrested earlier that same month and I was in the process of hiring a lawyer to help get the charges expunged.\n\nThroughout college I continuously abused alcohol and that abuse only got worse. I routinely drank throughout the day and began to experiment with recreational drugs. I managed to get a shitty job making 7.25 an hour at a movie theatre where I met the future mother of my kid, we’ll call her Jill.\n\nJill was fun and she and entered a casual sexual relationship. She was in her late 20s (I was in my early 20s) and also lived with her parents. We’d get drunk and fuck after work and maybe hangout here and there but it was nothing serious. 8 months into the relationship she told that she was pregnant.\n\nNow I want to make this very clear. The moment she told that she was pregnant I told her that it was her body and that it was her choice but if she kept the baby I’d have nothing to do with either of them. Throughout the pregnancy I tried to come around to the idea of co-parenting but I just couldn’t get my head around it. She told me that if I didn’t want to be apart of his life that that would be fine and she wouldn’t come after me for child support but that I shouldn’t expect any favors in terms of visitation or custody agreements should I change my mind down the road.\n\nI had always been on the fence about marriage and kids but I knew 100% that I didn’t want any of that with her. I was a college dropout making minimum with a criminal record. I was also going to court mandated therapy to deal with my alcoholism .I wasn’t in a position to support myself let alone another human being.\n\nFast forward to the present day and the situation hasn’t gotten any better. My mom (who is active in my sons life and in the moms) kicked me out of the house. I got sober for a few months but when I relapsed my mom had had enough. He’s 2 now and I haven’t been to either of his birthdays and I’ve only seen him may 4-5 times. Her family hates me and wants nothing to do with while members of my own family have distanced themselves from. On my last birthday all I got was a text from my mom.\n\nI currently live with my grandmother in a rural town several hours away from my son and his mom. We’ve blocked each other on all social media and she has my number blocked. We haven’t spoken in over a year. I’ve got a decent paying job and I’ve been able to pay off my credit cards. I feel as though my life is slowly turning around and I’m relatively unbothered by not being on my sons life.",

      "description": "I'm the front desk person at a small tech company. I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. \n\nSome of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says \"Oh, that's... cute.\" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.\n\nHere's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.\n\nShe looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, \"You cut your own hair?\"\n\nI said \"Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it.\" \n\nShe snorted and said \"A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.\"\n\nHere's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, \"$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?\"\n\nShe got that tightlipped smile again and said \"Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.\"\n\nI said \"$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!\" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. \n\nApparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. \n\nI've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said \"Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*.\" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed. \n\nSooo... did I really fuck up? Am I the asshole?",

So, 2ish weeks ago, a former acquaintance of mine who I met at a convention (does not go to my school or live near me) started to contact me again, and we instantly started chatting over the course of the next couple of days. Over time, I felt like the conversation was getting a tad more flirty (keep in mind, I could totally be misinterpreting signals here), and she started asking me if I wanted to meet her to go to a movie some time or hang out at her house. I started talking with my close friends about it, and they all agreed with the possibility she could be hitting on me. I declined most of the invites she sent me due to extenuating (and real) circumstances, and she kept on chatting with me or trying to reschedule. I talked about this with my friends some more, and one of them brought up the idea of asking her from her account if she was hitting on me. She did, and the girl flat out denied it, saying she was just trying to “hang out because that’s what friends do”. Ever since then, she hasn’t responded to my casual messages from a previous conversation we had, and I feel very guilty for putting her and my friend into that situation. What’s the verdict?",

      "description": "     Middle school was rough for me because I was an overweight kid growing up in the 90s. I now teach middle school and have a firsthand look at how cruel today’s kids can be. \n\n     My mom was skinny and didn’t understand the struggle, and never really taught me anything about being healthy. Instead, she would let my skinny little brother eat anything he wanted, and withheld food from me. I finally figured it out after high school and joined the gym, but to this day (I’m 32) I still battle with overeating and probably always will. I love to exercise, but since I struggle with my food intake, I am still an overweight person, but a physically strong one, and I do have an unhealthy addiction to weighing myself on the scale. \n\n     Recently, I started involving my daughter in my home workouts, and I’ve been showing her how to make healthy choices. We go for light jogs together, or she will ride her bike with me while I jog at my pace, and we do step workouts to music and we play just dance on the switch. We do one of these activities every weeknight, and have been for about a month now. \n\n     Today she asked me if she could get on the scale to see how much she weighs. I explained to her that it’s not about a number on the scale, but how you feel when your body can do things that you didn’t think it could do (even though I admittedly don’t take my own advice when it comes to this). She still wanted to weigh in. I let her. I’m worried that she will develop an unhealthy scale addiction like I have. I don’t want her to go through what I did, and I want her to be healthy. I know that it’s up to me to lay that foundation for her. I’m just unsure if I’m doing it in the right way. ",

      "description": "My best friend Jason has been in a relationship with his gf Tessa for about 2 years.  She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?",

      "description": "Before me an my SO got together I was working for one of the world biggest pharmaceutical companies in IT. The pay was great and involved a little travel here and there to Europe. A year later I was asked to take on the lead for local IT aspects of a global project for a huge global regulatory system. This was ground floor in one of the biggest changes in pharmaceutical regulations in history, and effects every company everywhere.\n\nA few months later a vendor for the software (the only supplier in Europe) asked me to join them full time. Being fresh with the company and enjoying my time I said no. About a year later I was asked again by a manager of the vendor, but my dad was sick so I refused to go as had to look after him. 4 months later he died, and my world went to shit including my job and relationship. We split for a while, and I was offered a year abroad working for the vendor which I took as a fresh start and something for me after doing so much for many people for many years (another story) .\n\nBefore I left, me and the SO reconciled and decided to do long distance whilst I lived in Ireland. Before my contract living in ireland was up, I was offered a subcontract working from home for 8 months, which was extended to 15 in total. During this time I did my share of the housework, drive her to and from work (she dosent drive), the kids to and from school (not biologicaly mine, but mine in my heart) and generally doing anything needed in the house and relationship like every good partner should. \n\nThis month my subcontract is over and I need to go back on the road travelling for work, which means working away Monday-Friday. The Mrs has taken this really badly, citing she understands its my job and I had it before we got together, but I feel like crap and like I should quit my job to be part of the \"nuclear family\" idea she has. Whilst not saying it out loud, she's acting so down, making a big scene about travel to and from work (she can't drive), explaining to the kids how I'll only be around for Sundays from now (kids dad takes them on friday+Saturday) and generally making me feel shitty. \n\nMy job has excellent pay, full private healthcare for the family, company car, mobile, bonuses etc but she is really anti-materilistic so it all means nothing to her. My dad was everything to me, and his job meant working away from home so growing up this was all normal for me, only seeing him on the weekend. We had a fantastic relationship so I really don't get the issue of me being away from home. \n\nTl;dr\n\nJob means I have to work away from home, Mrs is making me feel like crap for going, AITA?\n\nNB - I'm probably just being overly sensitive, and feel shitty for posting this but need an outlet somehow before I lose my mind.

We live kinda far and rarely do much on the weekends. It seemed too pricey to spend on something I may not use with my current financial situation. I explained this and he understood. Then my friend suggested seeing Wicked next weekend. I was so excited as I've always wanted to see it. It costs around the same amount and I told my bf I was thinking about going. He got upset because he thought I was too broke to get the passes for Knotts. He said \"you didn't have the money to go to Knotts but suddenly you have the money when it's something YOU want.\" I didn't know what to say. I didn't ask him to go as I know he doesn't like musicals and I'm okay with going with just my friends. I haven't confirmed that I want to go yet.

      "description": "Hey all. Around July/August, my boyfriend of around two years broke up with me. It was after a series of toxic fights, my own insecurity, his gaslighting, and him throwing furniture. I was planning on breaking up with him, but he managed to “beat me to the punch” so to speak, and did it over text message.\n\nAt the time, I was relieved because neither of us were happy. I was insecure over him with other girls (something I ended up talking to someone for), and he is also depressed/has anxiety.  He tried reaching out to me a few times around the time of the initial break up, and always brought it back to things I did wrong/starting a fight. If I didn’t respond, he would keep blowing up my phone until I did - and would then start a fight.\n\nFast forward to now, I’m now dating someone else (and have been for three months) and am incredibly happy. Yesterday, my ex reached out to me - first asking about how my job is going.\n\nTo be honest, I was weirded out him reaching out and responded only vaguely in one word answers. I didn’t want any sort of fight to start, so I thought answering (but only vaguely) would be a happy medium.\n\nWell, he was pissed about that and began saying things like “I guess you’d rather not talk, I’ll just go fuck myself then”. After that, I didn’t respond at all, which only made him mad. He starts going on about “how could I move on so quick” and if he meant anything to me, I’d help him get closure. I didn’t respond to anything.\n\nToday, a mutual friend of ours who lives out of state texted me. He began by making small talk and then said that I need to talk to my ex because his anxiety and depression has been really bad and I owe it to him.\n\nI really don’t want to, because it always ends up in a fight. But they make me feel like it’s my fault because he has a mental illness.\n\nAITA?",

When I tell them I’m at school my boss starts to get angry saying it was spring break and that these dates were blacked out for taking time off. I tried explaining about how my school had Spring break last week and I wasn’t aware that my schedule had changed. He then seemed to not believe me when I said I was at school and said he’s treating today like a last second call out when I told him I can’t leave school for my shift. \n\nSo am I the Asshole for not showing up to a shift scheduled outside of my availability ? \n\n\n(First post sorry for formatting) ",

      "title": "AITA for calling out another dog walker?",
      "description": "A little background: So I live in a small English village which has a dog population that's about as large as its human one, so your guaranteed to meet at least a few while you're out walking. Now, I walk my neighbour's three dogs, always separately as a pair and a single so that I'm not overwhelmed by them (these are strong dogs that are used to long-distance running so they pull quite a lot.) They aren't violent but they can get anxious if other dogs get close, usually causing them to bark and sometimes lash out, only once ending in a slight scrap (another dog got way too close and ended up locked around my dog's neck). For this reason, they are kept on leads at all times. I, as well as a lot of my neighbour's walk our dogs around a crop field which is almost always seeded, meaning it's not advised to walk *through* the field, just around it. The path that surrounds it is a public footpath which is quite narrow, so if I come into contact with another dog walker I will pull my dogs aside and let the other walker through to avoid any potential conflict.\n\nSO here is the crux of my story. There's another walker, let's call him DG (Dog Guy). He walks what is essentially a dog pack; 4 Labrador's and a smaller dog. Now, the dog's themselves don't seem violent but they are certainly protective. As soon as my dog's are within smelling distance, they're pretty much trained on us, and once we're in range of DG they're on the approach and trying to drive us away by barking and encircling us. This freaks my dog's out in a big way (unsurprisingly). Another important detail here is that DG is quite happy to let them do this unleashed. The field itself is not in the sticks, it's surrounded by busy main roads that most responsible dog owners would not let their dogs free around.\n\nThis routine has happened at least 4 or 5 times: approach dog owner, dog's freak out, have to walk through muddy fields just to avoid confrontation. This is the ONLY person I have this issue with. Every other dog walker is responsible enough to keep their dogs leashed. Cut to today. This scenario plays out as predictably as ever, getting barked into a field, only this time I'm greeted by a chirpy \"Alright!\" from DG. The English among you might know that this greeting has several connotations, but in the moment I took it as \"Are you alright?\" Which led to the following conversation:\n\nMe: \"Where are their leashes, mate?\"\n\nDG: \"In my pocket\"\n\nMe: \"Why aren't they leashed?\" \n\nDG: \"Oh, they're not gonna' hurt anyone\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not worried about *your* dogs, I'm worried about mine\"\n\nDG: \"Well if they're vicious, they *should* be kept on leashes\"\n\nMe: \"I have to deal with your dogs all the time, what the fuck is this?\" \n\nAt this point he's pretty grumpy, not making eye contact with me.\n\nDG: \"You better walk ahead then\"\n\nMe: \"What?\"\n\nHe repeated himself as I left, muttering \"Cunt\" under my breath, something that I've often said upon seeing him from a distance, but never up close (it was quite a thrill.) Anyway, I felt pretty good about actually saying something for once instead of just living with it, even if it wasn't a particularly cohesive or productive confrontation. So back to my initial question; AITA for calling him out on his shit? And I guess, is there anything I could or should do to stop him from continuing ? (Apologies if this was quite long-winded.)",

      "description": "So I'm going to preface this post by saying that I love dogs and have a dog of my own (corgi).\n\nI have been noticing over the past few years that more people have been moving into my apartment complex with pit bulls, pitt bull mixes, staffordshire terriers, and german shepherds. However, our lease explicitly calls out these breeds and mixes of these breeds as restricted. I am assuming the owners never reported that they own these dogs or that they lied about their dogs breed when filling out their lease.\n\nMy dilemma is that some of these dogs are genuinely very nice, However there are also some that are plain mean/aggressive. In the past year I've even had two of them run up to me unleashed and bark at me which scared me shitless.\n\nMy dog was attacked unprovoked by one of these staffordshire terrier/pitt bull mixes last year. There are a lot of small dogs that live in the apartment complex and I don't want them having to deal with what I went through. However, I feel like if I report that there are dogs that violate the breed restriction then they'll crack down on the people with the nice dogs.\n\nWould I be the asshole?\n",

I decided to have my sister take my picture so I could post it to Instagram, which I did.\n\nWell, about five minutes after posting, two comments were on my picture, both posted about 30 seconds apart: \"You done look like a sped\" and \"You been look like a sped\". By the way, sped is slang for special education child.\n\nI confronted the two guys about it (they will be T and K) and K said \"Well, it's true\". I told them I didn't like being called a \"sped\" and it's not funny. T responded \"It is to us\". (Which kind of sounds like bullying but whatever) They began calling me dramatic and continued calling me other terms, including such creative words as:\n\n-Gay  \n-Queer  \n-My name but part of it replaced with queer  \n-\"Omega peen Lord\" (lol)\n\nIt bothered me to be called what they did. I'm not gay in any way, nor am I diagnosed with a disability, but I'm very self conscious about myself and I feel that them continuing to make fun of me was a bad move.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Yesterday was my grandpa's birthday, and we were having it about an hour away from where my sis and I live. A week ago, I had asked her if she was planning on going, and she was still unsure. The day before, I get a text from her asking if I wanted to drive up with her. I said sure, and we agreed to meet at her place around 1 (party starts at 2). She had a meeting until then and would be home shortly after.\n\nFor some context, I work third shift hours, and usually go to sleep around 4 or 5pm. This means when we have family gatherings like this, I'm working on limited time, especially with an hour drive.\n\nI get a text from her a couple of hours before we agreed to meet, saying she still needed to grab a present and that we would need to stop someplace on the way up. I said alright. She then followed that up saying she was taking a friend home from the meeting. I was less happy about this, but said ok.\n\nI get to her place a little after 1. Half an hour passes. I get a text from her saying she had to drop a second person off and then she'd be on her way back. I'm thinking that with the time it takes her to drop another person off and then the time we would have to take to shop, we were looking at another half an hour of wasted time. I text her and ask if she's close by, and if not, that I was leaving. She said about 10 mins. I left anyway. \n\nI get to the party, and she shows up about 40 mins later. She's giving me the silent treatment, but I overhear her talking to mom about how her car has been having trouble and she's going to be taking it in on Monday. So the real motivation behind her initial text was she wanted a lift instead of having to drive her car.\n\nIt's not a big deal, but these kinds of things happen all the time with her. She has little respect for me or my time, and she often hides her true intentions about why she wants to spend time with me. This time I got fed up, and chose more time with the rest of the family over her. She's still giving me the silent treatment, and I don't think I owe her an apology. Am I in the wrong here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: We agreed on a time, she was super late and unprepared, I was working on limited time and chose to leave rather than wait for her.",

      "description": "So this actually happened to my wife (who doesn't have a Reddit) and this is her telling of what went down: She was at Target just doing some shopping not hurting any children or puppies. She was drawn to the Magnolia collection, obviously, and got sucked into their clearance section. She was so taken back by the door busting deals that she didn't realize she had left her shopping cart blocking the aisle. Things got spicy when she heard someone make one of those remarks that's meant for you to hear but they're too big a poons to actually say it to your face. The wife turned, grabbed the cart and told them all they had to do was say excuse me and not be dicks about it. They then traded a few verbal jabs with them thinking my wife is the asshole for blocking the aisle and my wife thinking they are the assholes for the way they went about trying to get through. She came to me for assurance that she wasn't in the wrong and although I see her point I personally hate people that block aisles in stores so I'm a bit torn. I love my wife and would drag my nutsack across the surface of a thousand suns for her but I will also let her know when I think she's wrong. This is a toughie for me so I'm turning to you fine people. Judge at will.",

      "description": "Not sure if the title sounds bait-y but my parents had good intentions while planning this trip. They had lived in London for 10 years before moving to Singapore and since my Model UN competition is taking place in Paris, they decided to take a few extra days to show me around. Also, they’re still protective of me and felt that it would be best that they accompany me(I’m 18 btw).\n\nBut as the title says, my main reasoning for going was to win an award at a Model UN happening there.\n\nThe issue appeared as I noted in my family’s Whatsapp group that my dad was taking about 11 days of leave from work. This was really odd as it wasn’t communicated to me previously how long we’d be there and it was a really long time(For reference, getting to Paris, going for my MUN and getting back home is estimated to be 6 days).\n\nAlso, this trip which was starting to become more of a holiday would clash with my other responsibilities and commitments in Singapore. I’ve got an event I need to oversee operations for and another MUN I want to attend(FYI: I don’t think my parents know too well about this. As much as I love them, they sometimes only care or are proud about these things on a surface level and don’t realise how busy I am or how much effort this all takes).\n\nI eventually discussed with them about this and I would say they seemed pretty disheartened that I didn’t want to go on a holiday. They scheduled it so that I could spend 2 days in London and another 2 days in Paris to sightsee(Also, they haven’t paid for anything).\n\nObjectively, I’d like to thing that there’s NAH as I think my parents only wanted me to enjoy myself and they didn’t realise how busy I was while I should have communicated this better. But at the same time, I’m wondering if AITA for asking them to change their plans they are making plus they are also spending money on this trip.\n\nTl;dr: Wanted to go overseas for competition. Parents decided to come and show me around. Trip was too long and I asked them to shorten the trip. I feel bad for asking them to change their plans plus they are also paying for everything.",

      "title": "AITA For refusing to watch a Vegan documentary just because my friend asked?",
      "description": "First off: I have no problem with Vegans or vegetarians as I have a lot of friends who eat that way and I love how happy it makes them and how they have introduced me to lots of new foods and flavours. I will respect anyone's diet as long as they respect mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt started a few months back, my Vegan friend Ruby (alias) was crying to me over messenger about an argument she was having with our mutual friend who is am omnivore. I was comforting her and she was showing me the messages, most of it was more of a discussion about Veganism but there was one comment from Ruby that stated how she likened people who eat meat to animal abusers as they support an abusive industry. I called her out on this and her response was basically \"well it's true!\" and I was simply trying to say that you just can't say that to your friends even if you truly believe it. We stopped the discussion there because it was close to a massive deadline and we thought it better to focus and discuss it face to face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths went by, the animal abuse comment was stuck in my head but we all got on and everything was fine for the most part until 2 months ago. Ruby watched this documentary showing the horrors of the meat and dairy industry called \"Dominion\". She sent me the link and asked me to watch it, she did say she would even give me the 80p it would cost to rent but it was 2 hours long. I watched the trailer and got the gist about what it was trying to show. I could have lied and said \"yes\" knowing full well I wouldn't and I was also really pissed about the animal abuse comment that I genuinely felt like I was being bombarded by her views and if I had a different view point then she would blow up at me. It almost felt like she was putting conditions on the friendship: I turn Vegan/vegetarian or I am a horrible person who she doesn't want to be friends with. So that is why I said no and it started an argument. I listened to her viewpoints and even spent a good few hours researching it all myself to get a rounded view and came to the conclusion that we should be more careful about where meat comes from but to me the answer isn't for the world to immediately switch to a vegetarian diet (I can update with my list of reasons if anyone is that concerned). I managed to calm her but then said that she shouldn't expect people to watch a 2 hour documentary just because she asked and I called her approach aggressive which to me it was. She blew up again and started shouting a lot of things at me over messenger. I simply tried to apologise for offending her while also defending my stance to which her final comments were along the lines of \"You should be the one apologising because you are an animal abuser!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have had no contact since, I am unsure how much I want to save the friendship but what I do care about is not being able to see the rest of my friends in the friendship group because she will be there. I also felt like some of my friends didn't give me much sympathy making me think I was actually in the wrong and should have just watched the documentary. If I did that then I would still be reeling over the animal abuse comment and nothing would have changed. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hello all. This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???",

      "description": "My boyfriend (now-ex) called me last night saying that we had fundamental differences that would make the relationship not work out in the future. One of his daughters brought up recently that she wanted to go to church and he decided he wants to do so again. He wants someone who will go hand in hand with him with religion. I told him that I've been religious before and I never stopped believing in God so I'll give it a shot for him and all I'll ask is that he keep an open mind for discussions since he said he doesn't believe in homosexuality or evolution and I do believe in those and I'm bisexual which he knew going into the relationship. \n\nI called him today to break things off another giving it a lot of thought. He always texts me good morning. Today, it was silence. I got the feeling that he didn't want this relationship. Will, on the phone he said that he loves me and wants to stay friends and see how things end up. I feel like he's giving mixed signals to me. He also said he had a long conversation with someone recently about this who told him to bring this up with me. I've noticed him being distant with me lately and was going to bring it up but it made sense when he told me all this. \n\nHe said he's going to miss me everyday and it'll take him years to move on. I think he knows he's making the biggest mistake of his life considering his exes all cheated on him and I'm as loyal as they come. We went from wanting build a future and being in love to this in a week. I don't know how to feel or what to think anymore. I'm having a hard time distracting myself and a part of me feels like I'm giving up on a relationship wuthour fighting for it. He's the best boyfriend I've ever had who's treated me better than any other guy. I just don't know where to go with all this.\n\nTl;Dr\nMy boyfriend decided he wants to rekindle his religion to the extreme bible thumper kind and that I don't fit in the picture even though he claims he loves me and will miss me everyday. I broke it off after sleeping on it because the way he says things makes me feel unwanted.",

      "description": "Backstory: My mother died of a relapse of leukaemia not long ago. Prior to her relapse, she had a run in with this cousin at another family members wake. This cousin was rude, verbally and emotionally abusive and caused my mother no amount of hurt, she embarrassed her in front of the mourners and belittled her to the point where mammy had to leave. \nIn the past, this cousin also verbally and physically publically attacked my father in an attempt to defame and slander him, she emotionally abused my mother and accused her of theft and attempted to chastise child me for not speaking to her when she knew that I knew all this had been going on. \n\nMy mother passed away recently after a relatively short but absolutely brutal relapse of leaukaemia that no one saw coming. On the first night of her wake, I knew this particular cousin would show, so I sent word round the men that she was not to be let in. \nNo one in the family can stand her for all the lies she has told over the years, her general behaviour and a load more indecent incidents that I wont list here; so there were no shortage of volunteers for the task. \n\nWell I was proven right, she showed up with her sisters in tow and was politely told at the front gate that she wasn't welcome. \nHer sister asked if it was all of their family, to which she was told no, just THAT cousin. \nThis went down quite badly, and long story short, they stormed off. \nWhen I carried my mother's coffin to the car, my 80 year old grandfather seen that cousins brother and put his hand out for a handshake (which was difficult as he is very weak) ...cousins brother never took it, kept his hand in his pocket and just looked at my grandfather. My grandfather is 80, has become very frail over the years and was burying his only child. \n\nI've had no dealings with any of them since. \n\nNow some months have passed and some of the family have said i was too harsh and should have allowed that cousin to pay her \"respects\". But for the life if me I cant see how! My mammy didn't like her; for good reason, and would have turned in her coffin at the thought of that cow gawking at her, spinning her lies and trying to emotionally manipulate people into 'donating' to her fund to send her away for 'special treatment' for her 'terminal tumour'...(its been going on so long the fucking thing could have gotten its national insurance number years back!) \nIt wouldn't be the first time she has done this at the wake of a cancer victim and I'd be damned if she was pulling it at my mams! \n\nSo there we have it. Was I the asshole? Should I have allowed her to 'say goodbye'? ",

He was a major stoner in his early twenties and has never tried anything else. He is a very paranoid person and has night terrors several times a week (and a whole lot of sleep talking) which I suspect could have been aggravated more by smoking weed all day for years. \n\nHe has approached me telling me he wants to try mushrooms for weeks now to apparently improve himself (anecdotal evidence supposedly) and even slipped out he might do LSD this weekend. He can't explain where he has found this new motivation for taking drugs but I am 100% against it. \n\nI have flat out told him no, he can't take them, and I worry that anything new he might have might affect him poorly as he can't predict what's going to happen. I don't want him to think I am open minded in allowing him to try one drug just for him to eventually downward spiral into trying a whole lot of other drugs.\n\nI feel like there's no room to compromise on the topic of drugs if the other half says no.

      "description": "Me and E were friends from 16, until I went to uni. We fell out of contact but met up whenever I was back home. We had a close group of friends, 5 of us. E and one of the guys in this group - J, started a relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect, E and J eventually broke up, and I gathered it could be the nail in the coffin for the group, and an opportunity to grow up and leave teen drama behind. I remained amicable with everyone individually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to meet up with E once I’d moved home from uni this past summer, but only got “I’ll see my work rota” the three times I attempted to make plans. So, I kind of assumed she’d moved on and I decided to do so as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met up with J and A (another girl from the group) over Xmas and was told a lot about E - basically why the relationship with J ended. It confirmed to me that my decision to move on from my friendship with E was best for me and my mental health.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had an amazing time with J and A, and we organised plans the first moment we discussed it - a stark contrast to my situation with E.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now. E messages to tell me my sister’s fiancée was in a nightclub she was at. I didn’t bother replying, I felt no need. Couple hours later I get a message saying “are you not talking to me or something?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh. I decide to just be upfront and tell E that I hope she’s doing okay and that I was disappointed our plans to meet up never really came to fruition. I told her I felt I’d moved on and wished her the best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe replies and says I jumped to conclusions, thought the worst, and could have said something sooner. I clarified that I didn’t feel respected, and got the impression she’d moved on (she now has a new boyfriend, who I mentioned I’d like to meet, and found out she had already introduced him to me as her \"gay friend\" - a lie).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe accused me of playing the victim, and rattled off a laundry list of difficult family issues she’s been dealing with, quick to mention that she “hopes I never have to experience it.” She’s right, the issues are awful and I feel sorry for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I feel she has only mentioned these things as a sheild for valid concerns and the way I feel. Either way, I sent her my condolences, and mentioned that it was probably for the best for both of us to leave the conversation there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet to receive a response but I’m curious as to whether I’m being too blunt here? Our friendship was a bit superficial (in contrast to my friendship with J and A which feels genuine)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've reflected on our friendship a lot; I was always beneath her. Any problem I had, she had one x10 harder. She never listened to \"whatever I was upset about.\" She'd mock my music taste, interests, education choices. I think she has some narcissistic tendencies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve moved on and I want little more to do with her - AITA for not giving her an opportunity to make amends when I know they’d be futile?",

      "description": "First of all you'll need to know all that I have planned in the days running up to new years eve.\n\nSo my girlfriend lives a couple of hours from me and for the past year we have been making it work long distance. This Christmas I have bought a train ticket to go and stay with her for two nights, which will be 2 months from when I last saw her. My train home departs at 7 pm and is due back in the city near where I live at 10.30 pm, which leaves time before I leave for a dinner which her Mother is going to prepare for her extended family (Cousins, Aunts and Uncles), and me -It might also be worth adding that her family have all been wanting to meet me for several months now. The day after I get back I have to go to work from \\~9.30 am until 6.30 pm, and then I will be going straight to a birthday celebration with my close friend which is already pre-booked and paid for, and I'd be getting home fairly late from that as well. The following day is new years eve. I will need to revise a lot during the day to make up for the lack over the days before as I have exams beginning the first week of January, and then I had planned on going out with friends for at least part of the night (although nothing specific yet). **My parents knew about all of the plans I had made**.\n\nSome time in the last couple of weeks, well after all of those plans had been made my parents invited my Aunt, Uncle and Cousin to stay with us, arriving on the day I am due to come back from my girlfriend's, and leaving two nights later before new years eve. My parents are trying to make me change my train time and leave several hours earlier so that I will be home in the early evening, missing the dinner my girlfriends Mother is planning, and losing hours of time together that really is precious to both me and her because we get so little of it at the moment. I thought about it and offered to move the train 1 or 2 hours earlier which would mean I would miss some or all of the dinner but would be home with enough time to spend some with my family that night, but my parents still insist they want me to leave much earlier, around mid day or early afternoon, missing the meaningful majority of a day that I planned to spend with my girlfriend and her family. I thought about it some more and decided that would not rearrange plans I had made months before that are so important to me for the sake of one evening with my aunt and uncle when they are staying with us for more than one night. Surely the plans I committed to first, which my parents were well aware of, get to take priority?\n\nAITA for not wanting to leave early? I thought that maybe I was for not wanting to spend more time with my own family who unfortunately will see little of me while they are here because of all the things I have going on. I think it would be unfortunate that they wont see me much, but it isn't my fault because all of this was planned first. What do you guys think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "We have three cats, one is 9 years old, and the other two are 1 and a bit, siblings. The youngest and smallest (already very little and super weak) has been sick this week, at the vet (at great expense) on a drip and kept over night because of some nasty bacteria in his guts. Husband took Monday morning off to help with the vet etc, but since has been working full time. I've taken  almost 4 days off my work to look after the sick cat, vet check ups and visits daily, pills, ear drops, monitor it, etc. I love the cat. He is everything. \n So, tonight, as the sick cat was crossing a pillow, (that the cat was clearly crossing, not settling at all)  my husband suddenly wrenched the pillow out from under the cat, letting it fall and flail. I said \"oh my gosh, don't do that! He isn't well! What's wrong with you?!\"... He said \"well he is a cat, he should get used to it\" !.... \nIm furious. \n\nIn anger, I said that the next vet visit for the cat should be by him, since he has time to shove sick animals, and has zero respect for the animal or myself for the hours of visits, waiting, wrestling, Stress... Etc. The next visit it tomorrow, and I'm sleeping in the spare room tonight. Should I be this pissed off or am I being melodramatic and the asshole?",

      "description": "(Background) I have a lot of half siblings, but I didn’t grow up with any of them. \n\nRecently one of my older siblings (OS) came back into the family. OS is 10+ years older than me, knew I was alive and told my dad they didn’t want to be apart of the family and lived with their mother. Their reason was because of my dad, but they never once made an effort to have a relationship with me or even talk to me. My dad is old and sick and now OS wants to be in the family. My dad asked me to make an effort to include OS and I have; I have visited OS multiple times, called OS to talk and get to know each other and tried to form a relationship. But every time it was always me reaching out to OS, never the other way around. The only time OS comes to see us, is when my dad is paying for it. Anytime he doesn’t pay, OS declines the trip (OS lives in another state). \n\n(Now)\nI never wanted to attend my graduation, but my parents asked me too. I agreed to do it for them but I told them I didn’t want it to be a big deal. They asked me who I wanted to be present and I said “my parents and two of my siblings” the two being the only ones that make an effort to have a relationship with me. My parents agreed and it was all set. \n\nFast forward to a month before graduation, my dad asks me “how would you feel if I flew down OS for your graduation as a surprise” I said I wouldn’t like that. I didn’t give my reasons but they are: he can’t afford to keep spending money on OS, I have ZERO relationship with them and I already asked for this to not be a big deal. I also was starting to suspect the only reason OS was talking to us was money. It pissed me off that my graduation would become an “all-expenses paid trip” for them. I also didn’t want the day to turn into all about OS and welcoming OS and making OS feel good about themselves. If OS really wanted to attend my graduation, they would of paid for themselves and came or even asked ME if they could come. They never once said a word to me about my upcoming graduation. \n\nMy dad was furious with me. He picked a fight with me everyday during the week leading up to it and finally he told me that I was selfish for not wanting OS there. He said “how dare you reject my child”. I retorted that he was the one being selfish and thinking of himself and OS when it was MY graduation. \n\nThis has been a subject of tension for a while. Apparently he had told OS to come to my graduation and then had to tell OS they couldn’t come. He says I was a selfish asshole when honestly I don’t think I was. It’s not my fault he promised OS something before asking me. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? \n\nIf you’ve gotten this far, thanks for reading. \n\nTLDR: half sibling I have no relationship with, that turned up into my life 8 months prior to graduation, was promised a free trip to my graduation by my dad. I told my dad I didn’t want them there, and he called me a selfish asshole. \n",

I’m going to give the girl (16F) a made up name of Jasmine.\n I (15M) take debate in high school and am extremely competitive, and in my debate team is a girl (16F) who is good in her own respective right at debate. In my debate team we all share a group chat in which we discuss about things related to Debate or sometimes talk about other things which are not related. So basically this is how it played out, one day the girl let’s say Jasmine kicked one of my friends out of the group chat simply because she got pissed about a joke he made. She proceeded to tell everyone not to add him back, so I obviously added him back and removed her. Jasmine ends up rejoining a hour later through an invite from one of her friends and goes complete bonkers. She starts talking trash about me and my friend and says that we are “pussies” and that we shouldn’t mess with her. I then proceed to write a comeback which I’ll admit was a bit mean typing, “Pfft you fighting me, if you even move one step the whole building will collapse.” Obviously Jasmine who was overweight got really upset over this and started crying, all the people in the chat then proceeded to rant about how much of a dick I was and how I went too far.\nI honestly don’t know if I’m the asshole or if she is I know I may have gone too far with the whole overweight joke but still she did a lot of shit too.

      "description": "First post here! I apologize for any spelling errors/length of this post. I’m typing on my phone!\n\nSome backstory - this girl was my close friend in high school. We had a falling out towards the end of high school.\nFast forward a few years later, we had made up and everything was cool between us. At this point, I had been working retail for a company we both love for about a year (I’m not sure I can say as I don’t want to risk getting in trouble - I’ll say that it’s a store that can be seen as a children’s store.. this is important). We both had loved this company since children and it was one of the things that always bonded us. She really hated her current job at the time, and I decided to help out since she always said she would love to work there.\n\nI told her to apply, and told my manager about her and how I felt she’d be a good fit for the store. I hyped her up for the interview, and she got it! We were both really excited and I was really happy for her as she did seem genuinely excited.\n\nFast forward 2 months later and pretty much all of our coworkers dislike her and complain to me about her. They all say that she complains constantly, is too slow on cash, comes in late or misses shifts altogether. She also complains about how “far away” she lives from the store (20 minute bus ride..) which doesn’t make sense to me since she knew where she was applying. I keep telling them to speak with management if they really are so upset, as there’s nothing I can do (they probably just want to rant without actually causing a problem).\n\nNow I’ve been in the hot seat before with management and know that it isn’t fun. She tends to get nervous in those situations so I decided to talk about it with her, but toned it down very much. I essentially just told her that we work in an environment in which we need to be very cheerful, so you can’t really go around joking about killing yourself. This prompted her to start crying about how everyone in the store is working against her, and now she doesn’t get praised for doing things right.\n\nShes now been working there for 6 months, management has cut her hours due to her behaviour at work (which has of course made her complain). I feel bad since I’m the one who recommended her, despite my manager telling me he picked her to interview before my recommendation.\n\nAITA for kind of wanting her to get fired at this point? ",

      "description": "So right now in California it is rainy like crazy. It normally doesn't rain this much and so a lot of drivers are very comfortable in the rain and accidents increase like crazy. I was sitting at a red light creeping out to make a right turn. The intersection I was at is at the bottom of a hill with the cars going down the hill with the green light. \n\n\nI'm trying to be cautious because I can't afford an accident and accident sucks so I'm slowly peaking out. I didn't want to go unless I know it's 100% clear because the roads are slippery, these cars are coming down the hill, and my car doesn't accelerate fast. There were a few cars that made a turn instead of going straight at the light, but they didn't turn on their signal so I didn't want to chance. As I'm watching another car come down the hill and make a turn without a signal, the car behinds me honk. It's been a long day and I'm annoyed so my petty ass decided to sit at the light until I had an actual green light. This angered the guy as he tried to creep up to scare me into going, but I'm stubborn and so I sat there until the light changed. We turned, he got really close, flipped me off and sped off (to another red light LOL). \n\nI know I shouldn't engage with people who are road raging and I'm sure it's petty but does that make me an asshole?\n ",

      "description": "Got married 6 years ago. Love marriage and all. Everything seemed perfect. 3 months into the marriage, we found out that my wife was pregnant. We were elated.\n\nAt 8 months of pregnancy, we discovered some complications. We were forced to fly back home where more complications were discovered, and we were told our child would only survive a few hours.\n\nOur daughter turned 5 (years old) a few months back. She suffers from a rare genetic disorder which translates into various mental and physical anomalies.\n\nThe first 2 years was spent keeping her alive with minimal intervention. We burned through all our savings. I stopped working &amp; became her primary caretaker. Our marriage took a hit since we both were still reeling from the whole situation.\n\nThe past 3 years, our daughter has been relatively stable. We've been fixing our marriage &amp; I've started working part time. We're slowly &amp; steadily building up savings.\n\nThree years ago, my wife started talking about having a second child. I told her it wasn't the best time since we were still trying to ascertain the syndrome our daughter suffered from through genetic testing. The results would help us ascertain the probability of the second child suffering the same. That due to logistical reasons only got done partially &amp; hit the back burner.\n\nA year later, my wife brought up the topic again &amp; I said it would make sense once we got healthier. Both of us had gained 10 kilos due to improper sleep &amp; stress related binge eating. Our knees had started to hurt. Both of us failed to lose any weight.\n\nSo last year the topic was brought up again &amp; we decided we'd start planning once our savings hit a certain point. We reached that point in Jan this year. Perfect you'd think. Nope. My wife was handed a 40% pay cut in Feb which literally wipes out the money we were saving every month. Last month was the first time our expenses were greater than our income.\n\nMy wife believes she can quit her job &amp; freelance. She believes that together we’d be able to make more than we are right now. I completely agree but I’m afraid of the risks of it not working out. Additionally, we get health insurance through my wife’s company. If we were to get insurance on our own, we’d be paying a premium which would be at least 5 times higher. That single cost would wipe out 30% of our savings.\n\nSo, the plan in my head is to stick to what we are doing &amp; find ways of reducing our expenses.\n\nMy wife thinks I’m a coward.\n\nShe thinks I worry too much &amp; that things will fall into place. That a second child would be good for us &amp; maybe bring some normalcy in our life.\n\nI’d love a second child, but I don’t want it to be at the cost of our daughter's comfort. I know I spend too much time worrying about our daughter, but I’m afraid she’d out live us.\n\nAITA?\n\n**TL; DR: Trying to control our marriage because I’m worried we're not doing enough for the future of our handicapped daughter.**",

She was telling my brother about how he has no dreams anymore and how great that was. The worst part is, my little brother was agreeing with her because he spends a lot of time with her and he's pretty young, so very impressionable.\n\nAfter listening to this for a while, I snapped and told her how upset I was that she thinks someone's life and dream goals being ruined was \"funny\" and \"deserving\".

      "description": "So about a year and a half ago, I moved to a new town to get an apartment with my best friend. A bit of background, my friend (let’s call him Phil) and I met in our first year of high school and have been really close since then. \n\nIn our High school years Phil began to date a  girl at our school (let’s call her Mandy). Phil and Mandy were always very private and didn’t seem to have much interest in anyone else when they were around each other and while I felt that I was very close to Phil, I really knew next to nothing about Mandy. \n\nSo after we graduated I left the state for school and Phil began at a state university, we still Skype and play video games and I hang out with him whenever I’m home on break.\n\n After my sophomore year I decided I missed my home state and my friends and I begin to make plans to transfer to Phil’s school. After we’ve moved in together it’s great, but I still feel awkward around Mandy. \n\nIn the time that we’ve now lived together I feel like it’s become more of an underlying issue. Mandy lives about two and half hours away and Phil texts and Skyped with her daily and drives to see her every other weekend (I have no problems with this, he’s got his own life)  Now What has started to get under my skin is that when Mandy is over at our apartment, I feel like we’re back in high school and I’m not even there. I absolutely think they deserve their privacy and I don’t feel like I need to be a part of what they are doing but I hoped that maybe we could be over the high school bullshit and that after all these years they can’t manage to make the effort to acknowledge my existence really stings.\n Phil will now try to invite me along if they are going out to eat but I’ve started declining after we did that and Mandy didn’t say anything the whole time and I felt that I spoiled the mood. \n\nOver this past Valentine’s Day Phil proposed while visiting Mandy, something he’d told me he’s been planning on doing for some time. Phil has talked to me about being his best man and while the idea of being there for him is something that’s important to me, the idea of being at a wedding where I probably won’t be acknowledged by half the couple sounds like hell.

      "description": "Boyfriend living with me. When his 7yo son comes over, he does nothing but watch TV and play video games. He arrives and immediately walks over and turns the TV on. It then stays on until he goes to bed at 10pm (which I think is late for his age). He wakes up in the morning and, before even going to the bathroom, walks out and turns the TV on. And it stays on literally until 10pm. We live in an apartment, so having that on all the time is really intrusive. I have to encourage/nag my boyfriend to have anything else happen like go outside, color or play games/toys. I've expressed my frustration and concern, and suggested 'family' reading time, but my boyfriend said he thinks that the mental skills his son is learning playing video games is more important than books that are going away because of technology. His son is almost impossible to get to do anything else; he never wants to go and gets grumpy. (Which is another issue- I believe it's a parent's job to give kids as many experiences as possible. But he always asks his son. Occasional choices are good IMO, but letting a child decide everything I just don't get. And the son always says no.) Even trying to watch a kids movie if he's not interested in it, he wants his cell phone. Am I the asshole for wanting to have some peace and quiet and other activities than video games and TV?",

      "description": " Some background information to start off with. My (23M) sister (30F) got really sick while abroad and ended up in hospital for just under a year. This resulted in her losing some memory of parts of her life, but she still remembers the basics like herself, people she knows, etc. It’s also slightly affected her short term memory and she sometimes struggles to form sentences. She also suffers from seizures a couple times a week, varying in intensity. She lives a slightly less than normal lifestyle due to her condition.\n\nOur mum believes in using Chinese medicine to help her condition improve. I do not believe in the benefits of using that medication (I wouldn’t even use the word medicine to be honest) and think it is a waste of money (Around £30 a day). My sister does still use normal western medication.\n\nMy problem is that when the Chinese medicine is brewed, it produces an extremely potent smell that is not at all pleasant. This smell spreads through the house if the extractor fan is not on and some windows are not opened. I’ve repeatedly asked my mum and my sister to at least keep the kitchen doors closed so the smell isn’t too strong around the house. The smell also gets into my clothes, especially if they are hanging to dry. \n\nAm I overreacting here? Should I accept this happening?",

Being a bunch of teenage boys, you can imagine what this bot is used for. Prior to dating my girlfriend I used this bot to post some NSFW images to the channel. The issue here is that I picked the subreddit r/redheads. After I began dating my girlfriend I didn't use this feature in our discord. So a few months go by and my friend decided to give my girlfriend access to the chat this bot was in. She looked at what I had posted and got upset with me (she is blonde). Since then for the past several months, my girlfriend, most days, messages me constantly saying that I don't find her attractive. Whenever I try to compliment her or say that I do find her attractive she always says something along the lines of \"N o, you like gingers.\" I constantly reassure her and attempt to compliment her as much as I can.

AMTA for walking away?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat happened was we went out to dinner (he paid) then we got a few drinks then went to his place. We started watching Dumb and Dumber, but shortly after started the movie I got sleepy and rolled over. He, annoyed, said, \"I turned on a movie and you're not going to watch it?\" I replied with \"I'm kind sleepy but I'm still listening to it\" He shuts it off and starts playing music pretty loudly on his phone. We've had a few issues within the past couple of weeks and this made me really upset. I'm so mad, that lieu of telling him how I feel, or asking him to turn the music down I calmly say, tell him I'm going to sleep downstairs.  I go to the couch and get comfy, he comes downstairs three times and wakes me up. I say, I don't think it's the best idea to talk about this when we've both been drinking and that yes, I am upset but I'd like to get some sleep and talk about it in the morning.  He says that's not acceptable. How dare I have him pay for dinner and then treat him like that. Why am I creating a problem instead of just talking to him? Then, after him waking me up for the third time I snapped at him, I say, I know that playing music isn't a big deal but I'm so mad at you I don't want to get into it at 2:30 in the morning when we've both been drinking! I just want to get some sleep! Took an Uber home. AMTA?",

      "description": "This happened a while ago but I’ve always been curious.\n\nBackstory: I’m female and bisexual and my friend “Jen” is female and pansexual. I went to college far from home and met Jen and we instantly clicked. She was actually near where I’m from so I found comfort in her. It wasn’t until college and until I hung out with Jen more and more that I realized that I was bisexual. I developed a crush on her and although I never explicitly told her, she knew. We cuddled a lot and some people even mistook us as a couple sometimes but we never even kissed or anything. I think we both knew it was a bad idea to possibly jeopardize our friendship by getting together. Either way, I lost feelings for her toward the end when we had a falling out and I realized that I liked the idea of her but  I didn’t like HER (if that makes sense). We made up eventually and planned to move into an apartment together and were gonna share a room for our sophomore year of college. We also planned to share my queen size bed together since it was too much of a hassle for her to buy her own when she didn’t have a car and my car wouldn’t fit a mattress or bed frame (my parents drove up the queen size bed for me).\n\nAnyway I start dating a girl, “Ann,” over the summer and things are great and steady. I had told Ann everything about Jen after some time and although she was surprised at first (she had heard of Jen as my best friend but not as my past crush), she didn’t seem to make a big deal of it. After about three months, I had to go back to school (which would make us long distance). I told Ann that Jen and I were going share a bed throughout the year and she didn’t say much about it. She seemed to understand my reasoning about why, so we never discussed it further.\n\nI ended up casually telling one of my friends about my living situation (sharing a bed) and he was surprised and said it was weird. He told me to change the genders of the situation, “Imagine if you were a guy and sharing a bed with a previous crush—isn’t that messed up for your gf?” But Ann never said anything about it and she actually met Jen and they got along (at some point the three of us ended up sharing the bed because Ann slept over a few times), so I don’t think it’s a big deal.

      "description": "First-time poster here but I watch tons of reads of this and other subs so here goes. Ex-friend will be referred to T.\n\nSo about a year ago, me, T, and a few mutual friends met in an MMO where we all hung out and roleplayed our characters. T knew a couple friends longer and I had brought two of my friends in the game and we all clicked well. We had fun rping and creating stories but the longer it went on, the more T started to act depressed and all 'everybody ignores me', when they had someone basically at their call since I didn't want to see T upset. At first we all tried to reassure T, telling her that they had us so they weren't getting ignored. \n\nMore on T's character- their character had a condition that in the game should have left their character in a wheelchair in assisted living(Confirmed by a mutual friend from T's side, who played a Doctor). T didn't play their character like this, though, insisting on playing their character with the condition and getting them into fights and dangerous adventures. When their character got injured(Because the condition would cripple them after a bit of time in a fight), T would whine about having to NPC their own healing, claiming nobody cared about their character until a player Doctor decided to tend their character, though they would start it all back up as soon as the doctor tried to move on to other injured characters.\n\nAll the while this was going on, I was basically their 'therapy friend' since I like to let my friends vent to me to get stuff off their chest, but T took advantage of this. It eventually came to a point where I had enough of how T acted and told them in brutal honesty: \"I get that you don't want to be ignored, but you can't have everyone on your character's ass 24/7 and you can't expect everyone to like you or them. You're a good friend, but you gotta work on that if you wanna make it in life.\" Next time I tried contacting T to check in and see if they were okay, I found myself blocked.",

      "description": "My EX (F22) and I (M24) are in the process of fully breaking up, and we're talking about how we want to go about the trips we planned and paid for. Among them is a trip to Europe. I had originally brought it up as a solo trip, but she argued that she really want to go. So I relented thinking it would still be an awesome couples experience. But now we're talking about breaking up, so I would like to go alone. I'm going to explain further, and I will leave out a lot of details because this isn't the sub to go over it all. I'll do my best to be short and concise. \n\n\nWe have tried our hardest to keep our relationship going despite all the major differences we have. We were able to overcome most of them, but one term of the relationship just ate away at my sense of self. What I have come to believe is that most of my problems are coming from the fact that I am very sheltered and inexperienced. I'm insecure about who I am. I don't know myself well enough to be intrinsically happy. She agrees. Thus, that term was a constant perceived threat to my happiness. I don't like that, but I love her and she loves me dearly. We just want me to overcome that hurdle.\n\n\n\nSo the recent conclusion was made that we need to allow each other to grow and experience life individually while still being in love. I let her know I was accepting of her own trips with her best friend. She had already went to Miami and was talking about visiting Bolivia with her, but that one ended up being impossible to do for now. Regardless, I gave no fuss about any of it. However, I have still been resentful over things about this relationship. This is partly because I didn't have anything planned for myself and felt like I was stuck feeling those negative emotions while she got to escape and grow. That's when I brought up this trip. She didn't approve. She expressed how it wasn't fair (and safe) that I would go to a foreign country alone. She was implying that she wouldnt approve unless she went. I didn't like the idea of going on this trip if she would be unhappy at home the whole time, and I also had that reasoning stated above in my head. \n\n\n\nLike I said, I relented. I paid for everything except for her plane ticket, but there's insurance on it so she can get a refund. Now that we're talking about breaking up, I want to go on this trip solo so that I can begin my moving on process and find myself. However, she argues that it's wrong of me to take this away from her when she already had her expectations. So am I the asshole for this? I already understand that there are other parts to this relationship that are questionable. I'm already thinking that I am the asshole for many aspects of this relationship. I just don't know about this one...",

      "description": "One of my roommates is addicted to TV; by addicted, I mean she will sit on there from 9 am - 9 pm on weekends, and as soon as she gets home from work it’s TV until bedtime. She gets angsty if she doesn’t get to watch at least a couple episodes a day. She tells me that TV is her “escape from reality” since her real life sucks.\n\nI tell her that I’m concerned about her health and that she should go and do something else just for a little bit like you know, clean the apartment you share with 3 other girls (me and the two other girls are the only ones who clean, she has never touched cleaning supplies during the entire two years I’ve lived with her).\n\nShe responds that she would go out and hang out with friends, but I never want to. I ask her, “why don’t you go out by yourself?” Her response is that she’s awkward and can’t talk when she’s by herself. Tbh, if I were to go with her, I’d be doing 90% of the socializing anyways. \n\nI try and tell her she needs to push herself out of her comfort zone, don’t rely on me. I’m sorry I’m not the “go out and party” type. I go home a lot on the weekends, and I often go visit my boyfriend, so she’s alone and “forced to watch TV all day.”\n\nAs a result of being “confined” in the apartment everyday, she has no interaction with boys, and complains that she wants a boyfriend. I encourage her to get bumble, tinder, go outside and talk, but she’s not having it. I’m guessing she randomly wants a hot stranger to come up and talk to her?\n\nShe is a little clingy and overbearing, and sometimes I try to keep her company while she watches TV because I feel bad if she’s just sitting there all alone. I’ll do my work on my laptop while a show is on, or I’ll get up randomly during the show to clean dishes or something.\n\nBut anyways, it’s my fault apparently that she doesn’t have a lot of friends or a boyfriend, and it’s my fault that we never go out since once I get home from work, I want to relax a bit and clean the mess that accumulates around the apartment. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to hang out with her more and getting her to socialize with others? I feel like I could be doing more to get her out into the real world, but I have my own shit to do and other friends and family to be with as well.",

And dude broke up with her. \n\n(He doesn't get on social media very much. And one of his buddies see this and I guess tells him or something because they're commenting on it too)\n\nSo she comes back to me about how I ruined her relationship and how pretty much her friends are commenting and blaming her and removing themselves from her life and media page.\n\nSo am I the asshole for calling her out after trying to help her. I know I didn't have to post anything, but every time I removed her she finds me in public and goes on about how I abandon her. And to shut her up I have to unblock her and readd her to stop her shit. \n\nShe on disability for her weight.  She function normally, she just plays the fat card and acts like she has problems when they call her in to check to see if she not mentally fit. \n\nI've hidden her shit before, but my family and some friends always gets a hold of me and says she needs to talk to me. Which brings it back to the top. Asking if I have money, which I always tell her no. Because I'm part time and have rent. My guy lost his job so it's been hard last few months. ",

      "description": "My best friend and I have been close for 5 years now and for the past 2 we've been apart due to going to different schools and such but we still talk on a daily basis. She's my best friend for good reasons but she's also known for being extremely blunt and somewhat rude at times, and she has a history of hardcore judging the guys in my life. She's deemed every one of my exes to be \"ugly\" and even bashes on my celebrity crushes by picking out  details that she doesn't like about their physical appearance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo recently I met this guy who I'm really interested in after being single for almost a year and forgetting about how she reacts to these situations. Naturally I got quite excited and mentioned his name to her and she IMMEDIATELY took to Facebook and found him shortly after even though I didn't even tell her his last name, and I didn't even friend request him so we have no mutuals. This freaked me out and made me extremely uncomfortable. She sent me his profile pictures and such and demanded to know if it was him and I told her \"no\" even though it was, because I freaked out and I wasn't ready for her to completely rip him apart with words lol. She then kept sending me more of his pictures and digging way into his old pictures and it just made me so uncomfortable that I changed the subject.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery time she's said shit about a guy that I was with/took interest in, I would always remind her that she was being rude for no reason and that it actually stings me too because she's basically taking a fat shit on my taste in people but she just doesn't seem to see it that way and continues to do it so I don't know if I'm being the asshole by lying to her. Virtually nothing is going on between me and this boy, I'm just interested, and I would definitely tell her that I lied if things actually start happening between us but for now am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My girlfriend has been wanting to go to pharm school ever since she started college. She has taken all the courses she needs but unfortunately didn't realize that the application for fall 2019 semester opens almost a year before the semester starts.  Two months ago she began applying and getting everything she needs. Her GPA is high and is loved by many professors so she has gotten letters of recommendations . All she needed was the PCAT test (test required to apply to pharmacy school) which the latest test she could take the test was January 4th, that will be the score eligible to apply to schools. She only had 4 weeks to prepare for the test and she wanted to opt out of applying for fall 2019 and wait till the next cycle which is in fall 2020. She would be out of school for a whole year if she were to wait and not take this test. I urged her to doing it because waiting a year will really set her back and I told her she can do it. She spent countless hours studying. She wanted help on math which i helped three days before the test. Spending hours with her on math. I gave her everything she needed to make sure shes comfortable and has a good mindset(I got her a spa day, had her hair dyed and done, got her gifts and food). When it was time for the test she didn't score as high as she wanted and actually scored slightly below average. I re assured her everything will be okay and she has everything else schools look for and it was good to take a chance. I even offered to pay for all the application fees. That's when things took a turn she began to yell and cry at me saying its my fault for pushing her and that she knew she should have waited until next year and that all this was for nothing and that I made her gamble and lost. I told her that even if the schools don't accept you which I'm sure atleast one or two will at least you took the chance to go for it even if you fail. Failure isn't a bad thing and at least you have the experience from the test to re take the test later and still apply for next year. Colleges look at the highest grade for PCAT and it doesn't make a difference. Its better to try now than to wait a year and maybe even get the same result because you don't have that experience.  Now she isn't talking to me and says that I put her through so much pain because i pushed her to take it and now everything \"collapsed\". AITA for pushing her to have the chance to get into school and not letting her wait a full year?",

That meme was really funny, so me and my friends have spent a few months making memes out of this guy. We're an edgy bunch, so yes, some of it was porn with him shopped in or generally really offensive, but we didn't think he minded, since he is even more edgy + generally messed up. \n\nMost of the memes didn't even have his face in them, just us poking fun at the fact that he's basically a bitter incel, which is true. Anyway, yesterday he got really upset and told us he hated the memes, and is thinking of blocking all of us and never speaking to us again. Am I and the others the assholes here?

      "description": "The faculty in my high school here in Canada was extremely corrupt. The first official action of the new head of school was to hire her husband as university counselor, and his incompetence was ridiculous. He used disproved personality tests, fell asleep while teaching and really obviously had no clue what he was talking about... and the school board didn't care because they have no anti-nepotism or conflict of interest policy (they only employ the HOS, and she employs everybody else). So, when the **assistant** head of school nominated her daughter, who was my classmate, for best in class, 3 $100 000 scholarships (one of which she wasn't even eligible for), an accelerated med school program, and a summer internship, none of the higher up faculty gave a shit. And when I approached the school about my mental health issues I was experiencing, I had the assistant head of school act as a qualified counselor, even though she isn't, and make the problem worse. And when a girl in 10th grade reported that her parents wouldn't take her to the doctor, this same woman didn't undertake her legal responsibility as an adult to report any at-risk youth to CPS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason I didn't report this was by the end of last year, when I graduated, I had panic attacks once a day or more, so I declined the offers of admission for several programs in favor of taking a mental health year. I couldn't handle the thought of having anything to do with that school anymore. But now that I've been in therapy and working really hard to restore my mental health for months, am I the asshole for not reporting it to the ministry of education? Could doing so permanently give me a reputation as someone litigious?",

Zan is doing a horrible job at disciplining her so the commands to stop are pretty much ignored. Whenever we're in bed the dog wants to be right there laying between us and Zan just encourages it by saying \"my sweet baby, my sweet girl\" etc. If Zan and I are doing anything like talking, watching tv, etc, and the dog comes around her attention shifts 100% to the dog.

      "description": "A few months ago my friend had been trying various ways to quit smoking and he was desperate. He had tried everything for several months, patch, vaping, support programs, and was able to quit for a few weeks at most but always gave in. So I helped him by looking up new ideas. We found one idea where he would give me money to hold and he had to not smoke for 2 months, if he made it I would give his money back, if not I get to keep it. However he asked me not to tell his SO (for reasons I will not divulge, in case someone we know sees this.)\n\nSo fast forward a few weeks and I run into him and he is smoking. He looks like a deer in the headlights and at first tries to hide it from me. Neither of us bring up the money and I offer him sympathy and empathy, he decides he is going to keep trying.\n\nFast forward to the end of the 2 month period and he asks me to give him his money back.  I tell him no bro, you lost the bet. He starts to get upset and says he was still trying so I should give him the money, he lists other reasons he needs it. I ask him why did he bother giving me money he couldn't afford for a bet he had total control over? We got into a big fight and didn't talk for a while.\n\nA bit later I am contacted by his SO and she is furious at me that I \"took his money\" and am refusing to give it back at a time he needs it.  I tell her she doesn't have the full story, I didn't take anything and he gave it to me. She says she isn't interested in debating over who is right (it is quite obvious she doesn't believe me) and starts talking about how much they need the money, for those reasons I hinted at earlier. So I agreed. (Side note, these are very legit reasons.)\n\nI contacted my friend, arranged to give him his money. I tried to chat with him after that and he was acting cold, I asked if he needed me for something and he started going off about how our friendship was \"irreparably damaged\" (his words) because I wasn't there for him in his time of need, especially since it was his own money, and also he was upset I hadn't apologized. I got pissed at this point and responded that this wasn't his money, I had won a bet which was intended to help him, and the money I had just given him was a gift.\n\nNow we are back to not speaking, and I feel kind of shitty because of how much stress he is under. I am thinking about calling him up and apologizing but first I would like someone removed from the situation to assess. AITA?",

      "description": "Bit of backstory to start: I’m currently in high school and over the summer while volunteering,  I met this other kid that goes to my school who I’ll call S. I knew S didn’t have lots of friends so I tried to be friendly towards him and at the end he asked for my phone number in case we had the same classes next year so we could help each other with homework and stuff. It seemed pretty harmless so I said yes. Eventually school starts and we have a few classes together, and all seems pretty normal. That lasted about a week. In classes, he constantly sits on the desks and always make noise. Either doing some fortnite dance or tapping the pencil or playing music on his phone through the speakers. He only yells in class, and I don’t think he showers regularly. He also always wants to see my phone, what I’m working on , reading, etc. Whenever the teacher says we can move around the room, he always rushes to my table despite me making it clear I like to work by myself. He says he just wants to help, but he’ll end up doing something completely unrelated. I could get through this, but he constantly blows up my phone. 1/10 of the time it’s homework, but the other 9/10 of the time it’s for no real reason. An actual text he sent me was just a 26 times. I tell him to stop in classes and to stop spamming my phone but then he becomes really apologetic saying that he didn’t mean to annoy me and that he just wants to be close because he doesn’t have many friends. Am I right for not wanting to be his friend and for him to stop contacting me, or am I just overreacting to the whole situation and being an asshole?",

My mom and I live out of the country and would have to fly for the funeral in order to attend. I hate funerals, hate flying (I don't really take holidays unless I can drive, but with my work I don't really take holidays at all). \n\n\nMy brother and dad are alive and well, both able to go but have said no. My dad lives in the country with me, but my brother actually lives in the country the funeral is being held in. It's important to note that throughout the year I do a LOT for my mom and she generally still has a lot of complaints. My brother and dad aren't great with her, they don't help her or do much for her or with her. She has an idyllic dream of a movie style family, and our family dynamics are much more strained than that. She often vents about it, and because I'm the only one that will listen I always get the brunt of it. When she complains to me I try and tell her \"I hate when you keep complaining about it, it's not fair to complain about 'your family not caring about you' to me... when I'm the one that's literally here listening and doing things for you and with you.\" I go for dinner etc, help her move furniture, all sorts but it's never good enough and she lets me know. She'll thank me usually in the moment, but then complain later on about something else. It's just frustrating that I end up having to do the work of what should be multiple people, I go over to her house and let her rant about work and support her but I feel like I'm having to be a husband, sons, and daughter to her (she often complains she wished she'd had girls as they would care about her more than I do). \n\n\nI don't want to say she's full on narcissistic as she isn't. But I guess I just get fed up of the back and forth always happening, so when it comes to doing something for her I really don't want to do (fly/go to a funeral) I just don't want to do it. \n\n\nAITA?

      "description": "I feel like an asshole. But, I don’t know and have to know! So, hear me out.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been living together for two years.  I’m naturally a homebody. But, when we first stated dating, I kind of had a drinking problem. After moving in together, I was still  wrestling with alcoholism and stayed out a handful of times (about five times in a year) until 3AM. Frequently, I’d irresponsibly allow my phone to die while I continued drinking. Initially, I didn’t understand how problematic it was  because I wasn’t cheating and I was literally half a block away from our apartment and in the same bar that I went to every each time. Every time, my boyfriend expressed that he hated this. He hated the staying out late and he hated the dead phone. He told me it was unacceptable. Eventually, it seemed like such a big deal to my boyfriend that I just sucked it up, stopped staying out late, and stopped drinking. \n\nFast forward the now. My boyfriend got a new set of friends every weekend and usually stays out until 3-5am. I don’t ask who’s he’s with or what he’s doing before he leaves. I don’t bother him while he’s out. I want him to have his space because humans deserve that. But, it still bothers me that he’s late only because of the double standard that he’s set in our relationship.  He says that he deserves the benefit of the doubt because “he’ll respond to a call or text at any time”. But, as I stated previously, I almost never call while he’s out unless it’s an emergency because we live together.\n\nAt first, it pissed me off. Then, I thought I should just calmly explain to him why I disagree with his actions.  But, after almost a year, he still does it. He tells me he’ll be home by a certain time and doesn’t make it. When I him out on how he treats me for coming home late, he backpedals. I’m tired of wasting my breath. So, tonight when he left at midnight, I made a proposition. If either one us aren’t home 4am, we have to give the other $50 and no one can be angry. \n\nMy reasoning is that he’s either going to tire of paying the $50 and come home on time or afford me the same level of understanding for occasionally staying out until the bars close. \n\nAm I the asshole? Is he? Are we both assholes? ",

      "description": "So my boyfriend and I had sort of a weird argument last night. We were watching Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless mind. If you've never seen it, it's a movie about a man gets his memory erased in order to forget his ex girlfriend. During the procedure, Kirsten Dunst's character is overwhelmed by her feelings for her boss, grabs his face, and kisses him. At this point, my bf says \"Wow, she just committed sexual assault\". I quickly disagreed with him. Inappropriate in the work place, yes. Sexual harassment, maybe, but it was (in her mind) a one time incident which she quickly recoiled from once she realized he did not (appear to) share her feelings. BF says none of this matters. \"She grabbed his face and forced him into a kiss. If it was a man, she would have been charged with sexual assault\" While I agree that men have been too frequently looked over when it comes to sexual assault, harassment, and how there can be often gender bias in these situations, I still don't think what her character did would fall under sexual assault for a man OR woman. Am I the asshole? If so, how can I better understand the lines where sexual assault begins and being awkward ends? If I'm not the asshole, how can I help my BF better understand? I know this is a tricky one, so thanks in advance reddit. :-) ",

      "description": "  My dog was a gift from my MIL to help cope with the absence of my BF, her son (now my husband) when he left for boot camp. I absolutely love my dog and did nearly everything with her like take her hiking, to pet stores to pick out her own toys, and to doggie play dates with friends. Wherever I went she was always by my side. I lived with my in laws for a while since I had no where to go and needed a place to stay before I moved out with my husband overseas where we got stationed.  While I lived there I payed for dog food and groceries for the house. \n    \n  My MIL  told me not to take my dog with me even though I really wanted to bring her when I left and said she’d take care of her so I can worry about just moving out there and focusing on my marriage that is just starting out. This really relieved me knowing my dog would be safe in the mean time while my husband and I save up the money to get our dog out here with us since we miss her so much. \n  \n   My MIL has two other dogs that live with her besides my dog. My brother in law and his GF also have a dog of their own that comes over on the weekends to visit my bro in law since he still lives at home with his mom. His GF also lives at home with her parents, neither of them pay bills or really ever help out, they just work and get to use the money they make to have fun. My MIL now wants for me and my husband who are trying to save up money for things like furniture, a car, etc. that you need when you’re first starting out on your own and don’t think it’s fair that we have to buy two bags of dog food every other month and bro in law and his GF (who practically lives at the house) don’t take care of their dog and help pay for food since it eats it as well. I love my MIL but she said that she’d take care of my dog so we wouldn’t have to worry about it until we get her out here. I’m okay with sucking it up and buying the dog food if I really have to  because I love my dog and would do anything for her  but my husband doesn’t want to since it’s not fair since we wouldn’t be paying just for our dog to eat and I agree that it isn’t fair.\n  \n   WIBTA for telling my MIL that we don’t want to pay for dog food since she said she’d take care of her for us on her own originally?\n  \n  \n\n  \n    Note: my husband and I are 20 and his brother and his girlfriend are close to 30, it’s going to be thousands of dollars to bring our dog overseas so we have to be pretty frugal right now to save enough and get groceries and of course all the other things we need. \n    ",

      "description": "My husband and I recently had our first baby, a son. He’s 7 months old and has probably only seen his one set of grandparents (my in laws) maybe half a dozen times and they are IMPOSSIBLE to make plans with... for background...\n\nThe dynamics of my husbands family are so hard to explain. Throughout his childhood they were always somewhat poor, his dad could never commit to a 9-5 type job so he tried unsuccessfully to run a couple businesses but ultimately could never motivate himself to work so his businesses failed. My husband said even back then they were just really lazy about things, even things that didn’t cost money.\n\nThey’ve always been thoughtless. I understand that money is tight, but they put zero effort into ANYTHING. They don’t know either of their sons at all (foods they like, hobbies, etc). My husband has always had a strange relationship with them, very distant &amp; guarded, does not act like himself AT ALL with them. He says it isn’t worth being disappointed by their lack of interest. They put zero thought into gifts or getting together as a family. They’ve bought my son girl clothes because I think they just don’t take the effort to look at them. \n\nThey hate making plans. The problem is, we’re 2 hours away with a 7 month old. We can’t just stop by unannounced. It takes a lot of coordination and planning to see anyone. We’ll tell them we’re coming down a certain weekend, what we have planned, and when we’re available. They’ll say that “sounds great” but won’t commit to a specific day/time. I’ll ask several times and they just ignore me. I tried once giving them a plan like “Okay we’ll come by ___” but then that day they had decided instead to stop by a neighbors house and were a bit irritated we couldn’t just stop by the next day when we already had plans. They’ve commented they never know when we’ll be around.... which makes me feel bad but also SO FRUSTRATED because when I try to make plans they won’t commit to anything, so yes, we do get busy and spend time with other relatives. I haven’t been willing at this point to sit around my parents house all weekend just waiting for the exact right moment they decide they’re in the mood for a visit. \n\nWe’ve now been down twice in a row to visit my parents and haven’t seen his at all. The weirder thing is, our parents live not even a mile apart, so we’re just down the road hanging out with my parents for 1-2 days and not even seeing them.\n\nI feel like I t’s very hard to explain. They don’t do ANYTHING out of maliciousness, they just seem lazy and thoughtless. \n\nI’m afraid our negative feelings towards them are going to ruin our sons chance of having a relationship with them... they are probably not going to change who they are for my son, and he will ultimately probably wonder why they don’t ‘care’ enough to make plans or spend time with him... but I feel like I should be trying harder to give them a chance... am I the asshole?",

We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married.

She’s not the best when it comes to writing and asks me, her younger sister, for help on assignments and things and other work she has. I’ll usually help her with homework, group projects, and writing assignments when she has a lot of work going on or she doesn’t really know what to wrote. I don’t mind doing this because I just want her to do her best and I know she also has to work and an internship. \n\nLast night she asked me for help again and kept having me look over an online presentation and help her do it since she’d never used that certain program before. She’d ask me for help every five or so minutes and had already asked me lots of times in the past week to help her with her with the same presentation, even though I myself have a lot of school work going on as well.\n\nFinally I told her she was old enough to do her own work and that she had even had a family guest help her (who we had just met the day before) do the same project. She got mad at me and told me that life was a collaborative task and that she would get input and help when she was working so it was no different. She told me age has nothing to do with it and that I made her feel like crap.\n\nI apologized and told my sister I wasn’t angry for helping her, just told her that she should put the effort in to do things by herself whenever possible.\n\nShe ended up telling our mom what I had said and my mom got angry at me as well telling me that I had no right to make her feel like shit and that I just wanted to be better than everybody. She cursed me out and told me I was a spoiled brat and should help her when she needs it and told me that I should never ask for help with anything if I was going to behave like that. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA in this situation?",

      "description": "I am 26 and gf is 24. \n\nMy friends and I have a yearly trip to Texas to get together and have fun (1 friend lives there now). I also have family in Texas and visit them them too. I've done this every spring since 2016 and it is the only time I get to spend with my closest friends since we live all over. Its also a chance to visit family I dont see often.\n\nThe first year of me and my gf dating (2017), we both had a one week vacation that coincided so no prob there. The 2nd year I talked to her about coming with me for 1 week to stay with family and then the 2nd week just I would stay with my friends. She did not like this and thought i wasn't considering her when making my plans to go. \n\nAfter a lot of consideration and talking through it, she was right. It wasn't intentional but was still on me. We talked it out and I apologized. I should have involved her earlier in the process and asked what she thought about the trip before taking the time off of work and buying the tickets.\n\nIt was too late to change and she couldn't get the time off. Since I already had booked the flights/time off and my friends and family were expecting me, I ended up going on the trip myself. Usually it is only 1 week so 2 was a lot of time. I  had fun but i realized how I had been wrong and wanted to include my girlfriend on my next trip to Texas. \n\nThis year in Jan I brought up doing the trip with her. I made it a point to ask her what she thought and her thoughts on flying down - she doesnt care to travel much and gets anxious about meeting new people so she seemed reserved. I told her that my idea was to go for a week and spend the first half of the vacation with her and my family, and for her to meet my friends and spend a day with us - but that the second half of vacation (2-3 days) I just wanted to spend with my friends. \n\nShe did NOT like this because she thought I was \"abandoning her\" and \"making her fly alone\". She said that I clearly hadn't learned from last year and that I was being selfish. \n\nI gave it some thought and I think she is partially right - I am being selfish in wanting to spend 2-3 days with just my friends and not considering how flying alone is scary for her. \n\nWhat I am hung up on is that I never get to see these friends and this is the only time I get to hang out with them. We do stuff she doesn't like to do (e.g. go to breweries, go hiking, play video games) so I'm afraid of a 5th wheel situation too. I want to work something out with her where I can spend time with my friends but also so she doesnt feel left out or anything. She has all of her friends within a 15 minute drive of where we live in MA, but all my friends live in different states and I dont get the same option she has to spend quality \"just friends\" time wit them. I have tried to ask her how we can handle this but she is very absolute in that IF I do any part of the trip just by myself that I am wrong.",

Everyone is having a good time and socializing, drinking, etc. \n\nA few hours into the party, my dad calls me into the next room. Let's just say my name is John. He says \"John, I got that stomach medicine you wanted\" while he tries to hand me two pill bottles. Keep in mind, my date is sitting in the next room around the corner, probably 15 feet away at most. \n\nI do the polite thing and say \"Oh, no thanks, I don't want it right now\" but he just wouldn't take a hint. He goes \"No John I got that stomach medicine you wanted, see?\" And again offers me the pill bottles. Like I'm supposed to just put them in my pocket and carry on. Maybe that's what I should have done.\n\n Instead I went \"Dad I'm with a girl\" and the room's volume immediately went down. The group of nearby people who were talking got quiet for a split second. Pretty sure I said it louder than I meant to. The entire energy of the room went down in that moment and I could feel the cringe running through my body (cringe and diarrhea, hence the stomach medicine).\n\nAnyway, the girl might not have heard, because she didn't ever bring it up. Maybe she was being polite. The room picked up in energy after a half second. Should I have just taken the medicine and shut up? I would have felt weird walking around with diahhrea medicine in my pocket, they were pretty big bottles and you could hear the pills jiggling in the bottle.",

      "description": "Throw away because my husband knows my account name.\n\nFor a little background, about 2 months ago, my husband was put on a series of medication (depression, insomnia) that interacted very poorly with each other. It made him insanely tired, have double vision, and making it very hard for him to concentrate. During that time of trying to figure out medication, he missed about 1.5 weeks worth of work. He is currently on ADA through May, so he’s not in danger of losing his job. The medication issue was corrected, and while he’s doing much better, he still has days where he can’t focus his vision or concentrate if he has had enough sleep.\n\nInfo on me, we decided that between the cost of childcare and gas to get to work, I was basically working for free. So now I’m a SAHM. This is until our youngest (who is a little over 1) starts school and childcare costs won’t be as bad. And for additional context, we do live with his parents for the time being.\n\nI’ve been trying my best to be a supportive wife, and it really hurts to see him in such misery and not be able to do anything to help. But I’m also not blind to how much of a rift this causes between him and his parents, as he still misses 1-2 days a week and they’re not shy about being vocal on it. I’m also not blind that this has massively impacted his paychecks and makes it really touch and go to pay for bills and necessities.\n\nWhich brings me to today. He fell asleep very late last night and had to be up for work early today. He tells me that he’s not going in and that it’s his own fault he can’t focus his eyes. Guys, something in me snapped and I told him that while I wasn’t mad at him, his parents are going to have some shit to say about it. Note this was said in a calm tone, not angry or accusatory. That was a very low blow on my part, and normally I’m not that reactive. Needless to say he went on to work incredibly angry at me. I can’t blame him and my choice of words was horrendous, but I can’t help but feel I’m not completely in the wrong about this. \n\nI need your verdict here Reddit, AITA?",

If I am sick or uncomfortable enough to let people around me hear my coughs and groans of pain the last thing on my mind is sex. I have told him this many times before.

      "description": "My boyfriend hasn’t met most of the family yet, and I didn’t feel like this was the correct setting to introduce him so we agreed he didn’t need to go.\n\nAfter a very long and emotionally draining day, I let him know I was about to head home. About half an hour before he had just let me know he was gonna head home from work too.\n\nIn the car ride home I couldn’t help but start crying. I texted him again so he knows I was on the way and he called me. I figured maybe since he knew how my day went, he was just calling to check on me and see when I was getting back... Instead he says he’s at a bar with a mutual friend and asked if I wanted to go join. I didn’t want to go out after this kind of day, and with tears streaming down my face. \n\nSo he casually says okay, see you later then! Never asking once how I was or anything else. I text him that it had been obviously a very long day and that I thought he was already going home so I didn’t realize he’d be at a restaurant. He tells me I’m being petty and jealous because he’s with a girl, and that he shouldn’t have to explain every move he makes (such as deciding he didn’t want to go home after all) without me getting upset! Even said well that’s why I called you to come too, because I missed you and wanted to see you.\n\nI tried to explain that’s not why I was mad. It’s not that he’s with a girl, it’s that I was a complete afterthought! He didn’t want to “see me” if he called me after he had already gotten there asking if I ALSO wanted to join. Even if he usually doesn’t have the most empathy, how could he not understand I just had a difficult day and needed my boyfriend to be there for me??\n\nTo make matters worse, I call him because this made me upset. And he totally pretends to just laugh it off and HANGS UP ON ME because he didn’t want anyone else there to know what was going on. Then gets mad at me for starting an argument over nothing.  \n\nI know maybe I’m just emotional over everything else and maybe it all feels heightened, but I completely feel like it was valid for me to be upset!\n\n\n\nTL;DR: on the way home from a funeral, my boyfriend blows me off while I’m crying on the phone because he’s at a bar even though he told me he was going home.

      "description": " Alright sounds bad right? Also on mobile so maybe a few spelling mistakes but you should get the gist, it's also on the long side.  So I'm 17 I go to an alternative school that's very independent based and you can basically do 3 hours a week if you want (you got to go 3 days a week and if you come early, you can get out within the hour ). There are 4 teachers there plus a curriculum leader. Anyway, this semester there's a bit of a group starting (yay I have friends now) but there's also this kid who's kinda weird and while I'll talk to him, he kind of doesn't understand social cues,  keeps talking about his Internet girlfriend and talks about his mom as this monster (which I don't believe because apperwntly she works for children's aid, I'm pretty sure they are checked out plus he's told some really convaluted stories that don't really make sense, he also regularly talks about stiff you shouldn't talk about  and makes everyone super uncomfortable on a semi regular basis (at least once a week). Anyway, today he calls his mom in the middle of school (ehile the osslt test is going on and it's a small school, there are also no phone calls allowed because it is disruptive to everyone) . He starts swearing and yelling at his mom, while there are about 7 of us in the conference room ND we all know him relatively well and we are kind of in shock. One of the girls decides to film it (I'm not impressed with her on this part but she does not have a filter, she understands social cues bit she doesn't really care). It's about 10 minutes worth of him screaming at his mom, swearing at her and threatening to hurt her and after a few minutes, after the girl loses it laughing everyone including me stiffles back laughter and eventually loses it(I feel pretty bad but there is a time and a place and it was r/public freak out material). After a bit, this girl comes in and explains that she would never talk to her mom like this, he's being terrible to her, he just screams at her and she keeps on talking and telling him he's being an asshole and disrupting everyone. He throws a box of tissues at her head, throws his phone at the window and the curriculum teacher finally comes. I feel bad for being a bystander but there's also a time and a place to do this and he was saying some really awful yet ridiculous stuff (at one point he said he was doing this because he needed witnesses that she was being abusve, we couldn't really hear her because he was so loud but he said that she put us in shock when we were laughing) I'm suprised it took the curriculum teacher as long as it did but she was busy with getting a student registered but she eventually came and sorta calmed him down. After a video was made with he footage which was admittedly funny and involved syncing his screams to jurassic park, as well as capturing some of the reactions of people(I had no part in it but it was funny). Am I the asshole here?",

Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend.

      "description": " \n\nHello Reddit. My Sister prompted me to write this. This is a long one, so I'll provide a bit of information about who is who before I start.\n\n*Names have been changed*\n\n* Shannon - My sister\n* Eric - My aunt's son; my cousin\n* Hannah - My aunt's daughter; my cousin\n* Jessie - My aunt's daughter; my cousin\n* Shayna - Eric's girlfriend  \n\n\nAround May 2018, my cousin Eric met his girlfriend Shayna. Me and my family were very close with my aunt and cousins at this point, so we would often see Shayna and Eric. From the first time we met Shayna, she always acted toxic to all of us. She'd frequently talk about all of us, including Eric's mum, would always have something negative to say whenever she was around us and just acted like an all round cunt.\n\nOne day when we were at my aunt's, Shayna was acting more obnoxiously around the house than usual, leaving messes everywhere, swearing around my cousin's 3 year old son, playing loud music as if it were own house. My aunt then berated Shayna in front of her, then told her to leave.\n\nShayna then starts screaming at my aunt, calling her all kinds of things and then wished that my aunt had died when she was in hospital. My aunt had breast cancer and there were times when we thought she wouldn't make it, but she is alive and well today.\n\nShayna then left, slamming my aunt's door which actually broke it, and despite all this, Eric still went running after her and stayed with her, completely cutting off his own mother and sisters. He then 'moved out' and went to live with Shayna, which he was until last week, but I'll get to that.\n\nAfter a month of no contact with Eric or Shayna, Shayna started obsessively writing Facebook statuses about my aunt. She would write paragraphs and paragraphs about how she was a bad mother, it was her fault her child died (she had a daughter who was hit by a car and died), she's a frequent drug user and should have her kids taken away (which isn't true).\n\nMy sister and my aunt have a very close relationship, so my sister messaged Shayna and pretty much told her to leave our family alone or 'face the consequences'.\n\nShayna then messaged all of us abuse, saying things similar to what she wrote in her Facebook statuses, threatened us with physical violence, then started making claims that we threatened to kill her and that she was going to call the police on us.\n\nShayna continued writing these statuses and messaging us daily, but then she called the police on us a few times claiming we were using and growing drugs in our homes. She also called CPS on my sister, saying that my sister beats her 1 year old son in public. CPS had to do an investigation because of the type of claim, causing us all stress for weeks as they had to make sure my sister wasn't actually beating her child.\n\nThese things continued until about August 2018, where Eric was still living with Shayna but Shayna had stopped the silly updates on Facebook about something we'd done or something someone had said. None of us had spoken to Eric or Shayna since that point, until about two weeks ago.\n\nI was talking to my cousin Jessie and she mentioned that Eric was coming to move back into their house. I started questioning her about it, asking how they could allow him to come back after he stuck with Shayna despite everything she had done, but she told me it was none of my business so I left it at that.\n\nObviously my mum and my sister were annoyed about it, but he wasn't near us so it wasn't our problem. It then became our problem when Shayna sends 5 messages to my sister, threatening to slit her throat, saying she's going to her house and sent her full address to her, she was threatening to kill my sister's child as well as myself and my mum.\n\nMy sister then decides to call my aunt asking why she can allow Eric to move back in despite still being with Shayna and seeing her regularly? My aunt started shouting down the phone at my sister, something she's never done as they've always been so close. My sister hung up but my cousin Hannah immediately started calling my sister again, messaging her abuse and continuously trying to call her.\n\nMy sister then went to my aunt's house and starts shouting at my aunt and cousins, which blew up into a giant argument between me, my sister, my aunt and cousins. The cousins and aunt blocked us both on all social media and we haven't spoken since.\n\nAt this point, I'm happy that I don't have to deal with them any more. The problem is, my mum is supposed to be going on vacation with my aunt and their mum. My mum doesn't know all the details of what's going on between us all, but my aunt is now refusing to go away with my mum unless me and my sister apologise to all of them. I was happy to just do that and get it out of the way, knowing I'd never have to have contact with them again, but my sister was straight up refusing, saying that if anything, Eric needed to apologise to us for the abuse we received for months.\n\nThis blew up into another argument between us, which resulted in my aunt now refusing to go away with my mum at all. This was a very expensive month long holiday they had been planning, and cancelling at this point would have meant they'd lose the majority of their money, which they have all been collectively saving together for this vacation.\n\nMe and my sister both want to cut off the whole part of this family now, but my mum doesn't want to. We have tried urging her to cut off from them considering how many threats were made towards her, but she can't becaus e 'at the end of the day, they're still our family'.\n\n**Are we the assholes if we persuade my mum to cut off all contact to my aunt and cousins?**\n\nTL;DR - My cousin's girlfriend verbally abused me, my mum and my sister, cousin and aunt's stuck up for their behaviour. Me and sister want to cut off contact but mum doesn't want to as they're still family.",

      "description": "My cousin is a pretty talented artist, but he's also autistic. I work in the animation industry and his mom is pressuring me to give him a recommendation as a character artist. \n\nNow, my cousin's autism is very high functioning. The only thing is he's incredibly emotionally sensitive, and the industry I work in is incredibly high pressure. When he's stressed, he shuts down and can't communicate what's wrong because he's too distraught. He also has mild paranoia issues where he thinks everyone is making fun of him, a symptom of his low self esteem.\n\nOn top of it all, he was partially raised in the United States and partially raised in an Asian country. He doesn't have a ton of social awareness and that can result in him being a little culturally insensitive. He casually asked the whole family \"did God bless black people to be really talented because they used to be slaves.\"\n\nHe meant well, he is not racist. He just doesn't know any better and lacks the social skills to realize it. We had to gently tell him that's just not something you ask. \n\nRegardless, his aunt is really getting on my case for not giving him  recommendation, my family is sort of pressuring me too. They're guilt tripping me because I have such a cool job, and I'm not doing more to help the family. It's just... Itll be on me if he freaks out at work, or says something seemingly racist, because he's my cousin and I would have recommended him. \n\nIf I did recommend him, there is a high chance he wouldn't be hired, but he would be guaranteed an interview, and even that would be a lot of hassle. \n\nI don't know.

She was in and out as a kid and I was raised by my dad but I would spend summers with her as a kid and always stayed in some kind of contact when she wasn't on a bender. There have been a bunch of lies and situations of her stealing from people but what made me cut off communication with her was one major incident. My little brother joined the Army. She told me he had been deployed to Iraq and hit with an IED and was in a hospital in Germany. She needed 500 dollars to help cover expenses to go see him. I gladly gave it to her then didn't hear anything for almost a year. Finally my little sister got in contact with me through FB and informed me that my brother never even made it out of basic training and she used the money to move to Alaska. That really pissed me off and I have had zero contact with my mother since giving her the money. My fiance thinks I should contact her but I see no reason why I should. \n\nTL;DR I haven't spoke to my mother in over 10 years because she lied to me about my brother almost dying so she could get 500 dollars from me.

      "description": "This is long, sorry in advance.\n\nSo, I grew up with my friend M. We drifted apart as we aged, but reconnected about three years ago and got fairly close. For reference, she is 25 and I am 23.\n\nSince we reconnected, she helped me through a bad breakup, only to throw it back in my face as \"being annoying\" and \"being hung up about it\" and \"needing to get over it.\"\n\nThere have been a set group of topics of conversation for the past three years: how much M hates her job, how much she hates her body, how mad she is at her sex life with her boyfriend for not being great, and how mad she is that she's never been with a girl, the last of which was coupled by making weird drunken passes at me in the form of getting mad when I don't agree that I'd be DTF if she was single.\n\nI tried to help her with her weight by inviting her to the gym with me and helping her construct a meal plan with healthy food (she and her boyfriend eat nothing but fast food) and by helping her with her portfolio so she can quit her job that she hates. She did it for a day, and then made it clear that she resents me for being in shape.\n\nWhen my long-distance boyfriend moved to my town, she lectured me on making sure I still make her a priority even though my boyfriend would be in town. She made it clear that she expected me to still spend almost all of my free time with her.\n\nShe constantly makes our friendship sound like a trial run, like \"I'm still waiting to make sure you're a good best friend\" and I felt like I was auditioning for a role in her life from all the comments she made. If I ever did anything wrong in our friendship, she acted like we had to start from scratch and I had to re-prove myself to her, even if it was a small thing like not replying to a text immediately.\n\nI worked with all of this, listened to her, made time to hang out with her, and tried as hard as I could to be a good friend.\n\nLast August, I began graduate school. Needless to say, I'm insanely busy. I take classes and I work at my university, I basically live there at this point, so the only time I could spare was to hang out with M about once a month. I tried to get back to her and text her every other week at the minimum. In the meantime, I'm living in an apartment and paying bills for the first time, I'm in the first serious relationship I've ever been in, and I'm practically living at school, not to mention helping said boyfriend move and getting adjusted to grad school.\n\nOver the holidays, I was spending time with my family when M called me and reamed me out for being a bad friend and not spending enough time with her (continued to do this even when I told her I was with family). I told her I barely had any time to even text boyfriend, and when I get home I just sleep if I'm not doing homework. She said \"well it sounds like you're still texting boyfriend then. You're finding time for him.\" We had just hung out less than a month ago, and I tried to explain how busy I was and how time moved crazy quickly but she wouldn't hear it and just kept yelling at me for being such a bad friend and then said \"we can talk about this more next time we hang out, but I need you to make me more of a priority.\"\n\nI didn't talk to her for most of the rest of the holiday break, trying to figure out how to respond. I finally text her this: \"I'm going to be honest with you. I feel extremely disrespected by our phone call and I've been taking time to figure out how to reply to you. I have been as good of a friend to you as I can. I'm not lying when I say I gave you all the time I could this past semester. I was in graduate school, adulting for the first time, paying bills, and navigating a long distance relationship. I did not have much time at all, but I still made you a priority and gave you as much time as I could. But honestly, I don't like reaching out to you any more because I know I'll get lectured about being a shitty friend, and I honestly don't deserve that. I've done the best I can with what time I have, and I feel like none of that has ever been good enough for you. I shouldn't have to prove myself to you over and over and over, and I don't deserve to keep getting reamed out for being a shitty friend. I really care about you, but if you can't take me at my word that I've done the best I can to make you a priority during this incredibly busy time of change in my life, then I just can't be the friend you want me to be. But I'm not going to let myself keep getting reamed out for something I don't deserve. I would love to still be friends, but I need you to meet me in the middle and try to give me the benefit of the doubt instead of just saying I'm a shitty friend all of the time, because I'm not.\"\n\nWe agreed to talk on the phone about it, but then Christmas and New Year's and all that happened, and now I'm back in school and we still haven't talked. I honestly don't want to reach out to her at all, and I feel no desire to fix this friendship because she has chewed me out multiple times for not giving her enough attention and I just feel like she doesn't understand where I'm at in life and doesn't respect me at all. I still care about her, but I just don't see it happening. But am I the asshole for not reaching out to her at this point?",

Well, she gets mad, saying she has a bad teeth(side note: the bus wasn't going in the direction of a dentist cabinet, but in the residential area). Well, I just yelled: \"get a car if you want AC\". That's all, everyone agreed with me and she kept her mouth shut. After 1 minute she started mumbling and kept going for quite some time. One man closed the window and signed me something like: \"let her, we can't fight her\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told this story to a friend.

      "description": "Hello! I'm gonna try and keep this short. \n\nI am a 20 year old full time college student.  My fiance is 21 years old, works full time, and attends college part time. We live with his family (grandmother [70sF], bio mother(40sF), aunt(50sF), and uncle(??M)). Grandmother owns the house, and currently the entire family is trying to find a new place to live, and kick out the aunt and uncle. Just thought I'd let y'all know what her relationship is like with the rest of them.\n\nMe and the fiance were trying to get our puppy to poop before we took her to her puppy class. Aunt is also trying to get one of the other older dogs to go to the bathroom. She spots a pizza box near the side of the backyard. (Note: me and fiance DID have pizza the other day, but we both put it straight into the trash bin, still no idea how it got there) Now, this was earlier today and I have a bad memory (multiple tbis that make being 'normal' difficult), so I'll try to be as neutral as possible, but here's the conversation:\n\nA = Aunt    R = Me     F = Fiance\n\nA: Why is there a pizza box out here?\n\nF and R: No idea.\n\nA: Well, whoever it belongs to needs to pick it up.\n\nR: Okay. *starts walking over to it since I genuinly have no clue and don't really care*\n\nA: I just can't keep up with everyone-\n\nR: *interrupting* Okay. *immediatly walks back inside*\n\n\nNot a great response, I know. But here is me and the aunts relationship. She has repeatedly stated that I \"need to help more around the house\", despite the fact that when I moved in, I was working full time and attending full time, and only quit my job due to multiple breakdowns and almost failing out of school. She has continued this, and I genuinley understand where she's coming from. \n\nBut, due to my tbis and possibly my PTSD, if you want/need me to do something, you have to write it down or I will completely forget about it. She has repeatedly not done this very simple request that both I and fiance asked. She has stated, to my fucking face, that I \"can't pull the brain damage card\" and tried to help 'fix' my mental health issues with supplements and, to be honest, incredibley condescending advice to exercise more. \n\nAlong with all that, she has tried to blame all the dirty dishes that get made on us, BEHIND OUR BACKS. We eat out 99% of the time, and the aunt and uncle are the ONLY people who cook consistently each night. There is honestly more, but the rest is more about her tone and general behavior towards everyone else who lives there (despite not paying rent, and being threatened with being kicked out before due to her behavior).\n\nMy fiance agrees with me that he does not appreciate how condescending and passive-aggresive she is, and when asked said that my response was totally appropriate. \n\nBut I'm still kinda feeling guilty about it, so lemme know reddit, AITA?\n",

      "description": "To preface, this is something I've been wanting to get off my chest for a while. I carry no emotional attachment whatsoever to my ex, I just simply feel bad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little bit of context: I met my ex in college about 3 years ago. We dated for just less than a year. We had a few fights, but for the most part it was fine. I felt myself falling out of love with her for a while. During the summer, she went back home after the semester.  I got a job and met this other girl, who I just considered a work friend. A couple of months pass, I can tell I'm not being fair to my ex and I'm seeming distant, and she can tell too. This girl at work had been showing signs she was in to me, and aside from hanging out once I didn't act on them. But I couldn't change how I was feeling, and I didn't think it was fair to my ex to fake it for a couple of more months, so I called her and broke it off. It was really rough, for her at least. I feel really bad about it, but I was fine. I felt like I had already moved on emotionally. It was also her brother's birthday, which made things worse for her and her family I'm sure, but I just feel like I couldn't lie anymore. I didn't want to wait. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ended up going out with the girl I met at work not long after, and we're very in love. We have been dating since. I did move very fast after. Sometimes I think about how I ended it with my ex though, and feel bad. I'm sure she has since moved on, as have I. Maybe it's just selfish of me to think about it and maybe I'm bothered with the image of myself being an asshole, rather than the actual thing I did... I'm not very sure. All I know is I feel bad about how I did it, but not sure what else I could have done. Maybe waited a day? Probably. But it's in the past now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, thanks for listening to my rant. AITA?",

      "description": "So context to the story is several college friends of mine were eating together and one, who is a special education major, was telling us how it was offensive to refer to an epileptic person as an \"epileptic person\" rather than a \"person with epilepsy\" as the former is defining a person by their disability. I didn't think the slight change in semantics was really much of a difference and felt like both phrases had just about the same connotation, neither of which was negative. I said both ways of describing someone with epilepsy were basically the same thing and I didn't think someone with epilepsy would really be offended by being called an epileptic person as long as it was relevant to the sentence. I didn't think much of what I said but she was extremely upset I disagreed with her and has been telling everyone we had a huge falling out. She didn't actually respond to what I said, and I didn't think anything of it until later when I found out she thought of it as a \"huge falling out\" so am I wrong to describe people with epilepsy as \"epileptic people\"?",

      "description": "Title is a little harsh. \n\nI have a close friend and roommate of 7 years (living together for 2). As time has gone on I've realized just how codependent they've become on me. They moved here under my suggestion from the west coast (we're in Atlanta) because they begged me for a change. I happily obliged and let them in my life. He's always been funny and I've loved our time together. However since he's moved here, he doesn't have a single friend outside of my friend group. I invite him to my family gatherings, even some of my dates with my girlfriend because after 2 years he doesn't know anyone besides me and people I've introduced him to. \n\n\nThis wouildn't be such a problem except it's become apparent he's jealous. I can't talk about my new relationship because he's \"lonely\" and doesn't \"like to hear it.\" My girlfriend has been so sweet to him and cooks for him and tries to include him on dates I'd rather just be us. \nHe also took classes at the same university I did when he moved here in the same major. I've excelled in my field and I'm proud of mysef, but if someone asks us about it I feel like I have to downplay how good I am not to hurt his feelings. \n\n\nAnd that's really how this starts. I have to downplay my relationship because he's single and mentioning someone wonderful my girlfriend did or how I think I'm falling in love makes him feel lonely. Playing my instruments well in front of others makes him upset. I feel like I have to talk about how \"hard\" our shared major is because he's worse at it than I am. Even the friends we've made here at the same time only text me and I'm closer too. I'm more outgoing and social than he is, so I feel like this is natural. \n\nAm I the asshole for beginning to resent him? I feel myself making myself smaller to benefit him and now after 2 years I'm beginning to realize how I'm not becoming my best self. He's involved in literally everything I do since he moved here, and through my pushing has yet to seriously date someone, make his own friends, pick up his own hobby, or do anything that doesn't involve me. And since he's come I've become afraid to talk about my accomplishments to others (if he's standing there) or even practice what I'm already good at because he's spiteful. Am I delusional? ",

      "description": "I met this friend in uni about one year ago, we instantly hit it off and right now I consider her my closest friend and I often vent to her about things. \n\nHowever she has the tendency to be a victim blamer. I tell her a guy was behaving in a creepy fashion, she blames me for “not defending myself enough” and even occasionally claims that I was asking for it.\n\nShe can also be very unkind to me and claim that “it’s true” and that makes it okay for her to say. I think the worst case of this ever happened after a relative died and I opened up about it only for her to tell me that I deserved to know what it feels like. She called me losing my cat “karma”. She also frequently goes on rants about the LGBT community and when I tell her it’s upsetting me and ask her to stop, she will not listen until I literally burst into tears.\n\nI explained to her that just because something is true, doesn’t mean it’s appropriate to say and she apologised but I still worry that if I ever vent to her that she will just make things worse.\n\nI work at a local Primary school and I am very careful about what information I share (half because I signed a contract saying I would respect confidentiality and half because I simply don’t like mixing my private life with my work life). \nI mentioned to my friend that at work something happened that could have put the people in the school in serious danger and that I put my foot down and yelled at the man responsible after preventing him from doing what he was doing (I have extreme social anxiety and I was so proud of myself for standing up for myself).\nShe asked for more information and I told her I didn’t really want to go into further details (secretly because I was worried that she would downplay my accomplishment if I told her details) and was simply just proud of myself for putting my foot down.\n\nShe aggressively asked for details and asked why I wouldn’t share and I explained I didn’t want to go into detail and that I don’t have to have a conversation I don’t want to.\n\nShe implied I was a liar and continued to hound me. I responded that she could think that but I don’t want to continue on this subject.\n\nShe continued. When I told her to stop she blamed me for bringing it up.\n\nI don’t know, I feel like I’m in the wrong for not expecting her to ask questions.\n\nTL;DR : I have trust issues and don’t like sharing specifics with this friend, she doesn’t know respect that and I feel like I’m inviting this happen by continuing to be vague.\n",

We are in college and have been dating for 3 months but friends for 3 year before that. In those 3 months he hasn’t taken me on a single date. We have movie nights that I’d kinda count as a date because we’ve both been broke as hell but I am still paying for everything that him and I want to do and we had a talk recently about him looking for jobs so we can go out and not every little thing would have to come out of my pocket. But last night as we were going to bed he told me his dad said he shouldn’t get a job because they support him financially and he needs to focus of school. I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT! But they won’t pay for our dates which is also more than fair, however this means that only I can take us out and only I can pay for us. I feel like an asshole but I financially support myself and have bills/loans/ insurance to pay. So it really stresses me out that if I want a night out then it will always be from my pocket. I fee like he shouldn’t have told me when I was half away and that he should’ve stood up to his dad about it.

He told me, “Oh you better not do drugs or you’ll end up getting expelled” (or something along those lines) and I told him not to joke about that, because I knew the kid and he was nice. He said that he wasn’t talking about that, and if the kid had an addiction he deserved to be expelled, so I told him he shouldn’t assume that the kid was addicted to anything. He then said that I was “being rude” and “using him as the family punching bag” and now we’re going home without going to the movies. Am I in the wrong here?

      "description": "I will try to get to the point. Our cat recently began peeing outside it's litter box, smelling horrible despite bathing her, vet check up has been the same things - just 'elderness' which I get is obviously normal. She is deaf and I'm pretty sure she is now blind, and she howls and yelps in the mornings and late nights, keeping up my father/ mother and irritating them to the point of my father raging. \n\n\nMy GF and I have a 2 year old beagle that she keeps at her place but I care for it for a couple hours a day until she returns,and we do not live together at the moment until about another year. He is not an issue whatsoever, but having to come back to my parents house and be the one that actually has feelings and cares for the cat puts a stress on me because of the way she is treated there. My dad will kick, yell, start taking anger out on everyone else when she howls, and it is a pretty loud and crazy howl, And it has started taking a toll on him I can tell. He works early mornings in his at home office, so her howling is an issue for him, which I can get. Then she has started to keep us up all night and I am the only one who runs to her attention when everyone starts yelling about her meowing.\n\n\nWe are now in the process of moving new houses and they have kept her there until the moving process is done, but I don't even want to know how worse the situation is going to be. She smells horrible no matter what we do (sorry if that sounds mean, but it's just the truth), she's ill, she has become a burden to my other family members, and I feel like she's going to be treated even worse at our new place. It sucks because I know animals are a huge responsibility and I have done my absolute all for her throughout my life, but at this point I am a college student graduating in June, I work mainly full time, I care for my dog and am the main $ maker in my relationship helping my GF with finances as well, and coming home every single day to care for my family's cat has began to take a huge strain on myself and my family. I will be moving into my own place after graduation and I don't want to leave knowing my cat is in bad hands. My parents aren't bad people, they are just getting older and being home for most their time, they have to deal with this cat every single day and is putting a strain on them.\n\n\n\nYes, I know, \"you're going to put the cat down because it's inconvenient now?\" Comments may occur, but it is much more than that.\n\n\nI'd rather her be put to sleep in peace and remembered for the amazing cat she was, than become even more abused and neglected at our new house. \n\n\nWould I be the asshole if I put my cat down peacefully for the sake of my family?",

Obviously this kind of made me think of the money she owed me so I messaged her today asking for it back she messaged me with a vaguely aggressive paragraph basically saying that I didn’t need the money and making me out to be rude for asking. She then uninvited me from her party tomorrow. I then tried to call her then but she didn’t answer. \n\nI then sent a message to the group chat that say I wasn’t coming to the party anymore, obviously people asked why so I was up front and said I was uninvited. I then left the chat but have seen since that she called me selfish in the chat.\n\nI then messaged our mutual friend who basically said she didn’t like the way I was treating Pebble early and called me pathetic.\n\nI’ve ask some people and most have said that I’m not in the wrong.

      "description": "I live with two guys.  One is 25 and the other is 21.  The younger guy decided that he’s moving out early and is gonna break the lease, but the other roommate and I have to both sign off on him removing himself from the lease, and he has to find someone else to take over his section.\n\nYesterday he scheduled someone to come over and see the house.  I made sure I would be home so I could meet him.  I have two pets and wanted to make sure they would get along with the guy.  \n\nWhen the guy showed up though, I got a weird feeling in my gut.  There was nothing really in particular, but if you’re a woman, you like know that gut feeling.  The “this man makes me uncomfortable but I don’t know why” feeling.  That’s what I got off of him.  I keep going in and out of the kitchen because that’s where they are and I’m trying to monitor and the guy mentioned that his 26 year old son lives nearby.  When I heard that I knew I didn’t wanna live with him.  Had I known I would end up living with a 40+ year old man, I never would have signed the lease here.  I feel like it might be hard to any guys reading to understand, but I’m hoping that any women reading this can get why I, a 22 year old gay woman, wouldn’t want to live with a man twice my age.  I had friends over at the time, but after the guy left, I went to my bedroom and just laid down and cried for a bit.  I just got a bad gut feeling and, as I told my friends later, am not sure that I would feel comfortable home alone with him.  I also think I’m entitled to want to live with people somewhere in my age range.\n\nI told my roommate that I’m not signing off on him living with us, but my roommate thinks I’m being unfair because he “works to pay the bills like any of us.”  From his perspective, my roommate just wants to get out of the lease and it’s kind of an asshole move to hold him to the lease.  However, my roommate isn’t the one that will be living with whoever he finds so I think it’s inconsiderate to not even try to consider what the house dynamics will be like after he leaves.  I think my roommate also already told the other guy he could have the room if he passes the background check.  If this person moves in then I’m going to probably try to move so I can live with people closer in age. \n\nSo anyway AITA for not wanting to live with him and not signing off on adding him to the lease?  I feel like maybe I’m holding my roommate hostage, but I also feel like I’m entitled to comfort in my own home.\n\n",

      "description": "When I was a baby, my dad passed away, and my grandad filled that place for most of my life. When I was 15, I was told that he had lung cancer, but he was fighting it. He also had dementia and he would forget a lot of things when I talked to him, ie, he’d repeat the same couple of stories every time I called him, but I didn’t mind and never told him.\n\nI’d last seen him in person at my uncles wedding, as he married a horrible woman that had done horrible things to her children, so I never liked him. She also never liked that he spoilt me as he was spending money that I’m presuming she wanted to. He bought her expensive jewellery and everything else she wanted, so I never went round to the house to see them.\n\nThe last time I spoke to him, he told me the same stories and told me he was feeling okay and that he would last a while yet, so to not worry. I believed this, then when I said goodbye and went to hang up the phone, I heard him say to his wife “who was that?” It completely broke me as it was the first real time he had forgotten me, but it scared me and I put off calling him for a few weeks. Something told me I should call but I was in complete fear he’d forgotten me so just kept telling myself to do it in a few days. \n\nAbout 7 weeks after I’d last phoned him, my auntie told me he’d passed away. I felt terrible that I hadn’t called and that the last words I heard him say were “who was that?” I’m 20 now and it haunts me to this day.

      "description": "AITA for evicting my tenant for complaining about noise?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live in a 10-unit building in Miami Beach.  I love it here, and me and my family own the building jointly.  I have a neighbor named \"J.\"  J has been our tenant for about 5 years.  J looks EXACTLY like Clint Howard and lives in a studio with his girlfriend.  My 2-2 is right next to his studio, and we share a wall.  When I moved in, he complained on the very first day about the noise my dog made as it barked at people passing by our window.  The first time he complained, he didn't even bother to introduce himself and talked directly to my perplexed mother (joint owner of the building) to complain about me.  I was right next to him and he wouldn't even address my presence.  He only started addressing me directly when I came around to collect his rent check for the first time.\n\nRegardless of his manner, I thought it was a reasonable enough complaint, so I ordered window inserts to try and improve the sound proofing of the apartment (also was quite drafty due to jalousie windows).  One month later he complained even more severely that the noise from my dog was beginning to become an intolerable nuisance.  At this point, my dog had gotten used to the apartment and he only ever barked once every hour or so for about a minute whenever he heard a particularly loud motorcycle drive by or the Amazon guy knocking at my apartment.  Getting a little annoyed this time, I tried to empathize with the man.  So I try again to accommodate J.\n\nI start locking my dog in the bedroom (which is on the opposite side of the apartment than J) if I know I am not going to be back before 8pm.  I leave plenty of food, water, talk radio, and and open window for him.  Well, today he just complained AGAIN that the dog was waking him up.  The thing is, it was only 2pm when the dog \"woke him up.\"  \n\nApparently, J is demanding total silence at every hour of the day, not just at night.  Generally, he has been pretty rude.  But this last time he complained he was basically talking down to me.  I went into his apartment myself (he invited me in to inspect the noise) and I was totally shocked.  You can barely hear anything.  The guy's bedroom is quieter than mine (my bedroom is on the corner of the building, his is in the middle: so I hear a shit-load more street noise than him).\n\nHe is insisting that I lock my dog in my bedroom whenever I leave the apartment, regardless of the time of day or even noise laws (that allow for my dog to legally bark as much as he wants between specific hours), and gave me an incredulous look when I told him that the dog had free range in there whenever it way daytime.  I can't lie: that look pissed me off incredibly and its the last straw.\n\nMy options are to get a rice-paper door that separates my bedroom and office from my living room (giving the dog a little more space and it would only be a minimal cost), or just evict this guy.  I'm actually leaning towards the latter because he's such a giant dickhead to me.  Also, he's a tenant at-will, so I can evict him for literally any or no reason.\n\nSo what do you guys think: AITA for preparing to evict this guy?",

TL:DR at bottom\n\nMy girlfriend (30) and her childhood friend (both Irish) went on long weekend to Scotland to celebrate friends 30th bday (just the two of them) As you can imagine the weekend involved copious amounts of alcohol and I was updated of their activities via Snap/Insta/FB.\n\nOn the final night of the trip and her bday they had been drinking most of the day,went home to freshen up before going out in town for the night. They got the bus in and were obviously drunk in videos they sent me. Its midnight and I get a voice note on whatapp from GF, they are in a quite pub with only few people in it. Says the friend has pulled and is kissing a lad while my gf is talking to his father of all people (got sent a funny pic of father watch his son). GF wants to go home at this stage. Father leaves. GF sitting in quite pub with no one to talk to with friend happy out with new lad. GF befriends few American girls that enter pub. Get sent video of all of them in pub and friend in corner with guy. \n\n2am and I get phone call from GF. Friend has left her in the pub, sent her a text that's she's on some street a ten minute walk away. Gf has no idea where she is, where they are staying (her fault for not paying attention, friend booked it) doesn't have a key either. I text friend asking why she abandoned her, what's the address. Said she was on her way back to Airbnb, that she wasn't drunk and gf wanted to stay with Americans and they agreed to go home separate while at the same time saying that she couldn't find gf to bring her home. Pub was tiny.  \n\nGf in her drunken stupidity starts walking solo in no particular direction instead of trying to get a cab.( No Uber on her phone, streets super quite) Both girls say they have tried ringing each other without any luck so I'm middle man. Tell my now very upset and lost gf to give me the street names she sees and stay put. Send it to friend. Friend calls me screaming down the phone from an Uber that her friend wasn't her responsibility and that she had to pay for this Uber now etc. I stay calm and only respond by asking does cabbie know the street she's on. 3am they find her safe.\n\nGet this text off friend 3:20am \"\nYa know what? How fucking DARE ye both accuse me of abandoning her when me and her VERBALLY SAID FACE TO FACE. From here on what happens, ill leaves the keys in the vase outside the apartment and that be that. She fucked off with a bunch of randomers not me. I tried to figure out where she was when she disappeared, couldn’t find her. I am RAGING that on my birthday her boyfriend is ringing and texting me to see where she is when she wandered off. I’m NOBODY’S fucking keeper ESPECIALLY WHEN WE AGREED ILL DO THIS YOU DO THAT AND WE MEET AT HOME. \nHOW VERY DARE YOU RING ME WORRYING ABOUT HER WHEN SHE PUT HERSELF INTO THAT SITUATION WILLINGLY. I DID MY BEST TO GET HER HOME BUT SHE FUCKED OFF HAMMERED AND YET I AM THE FUCKING VILLIAN. \nnot a fucking chance am I taking this easily don't reply I'm blocking ye both.\n\nShe blocked me in every way possible. Only way I got in contact with her was via revoult app when I sent her cash for the cab and thanking her for getting my gf home safe. Found out day after that lad she brought home was in cab and paid for it and she blames me for ruining her bday and shaming her for bringing guy home. I didn't care about that. All I cared about was my GFs safety\n\n\n",

      "description": "My dog is a lab and a very good dog, I love her and so does my wife and kids but she doesn't get a lot of attention. \n\n My brother and his wife had a dog, also a lab that just recently died unexpectedly and they spoiled that dog like crazy because they considered it their child because they have no real children. Needless to say they were devastated, and about a week later my wife mentioned to my brother that he could have our dog (they have met our dog and love her) and he said absolutely they'd love to have her.\n\nI was kind of shocked because she didn't talk to me about it first and i immediately said no i wanted to keep her and that was the end of that. \n\nNow that i think about it, i know my dog would be happier there, and  get a lot more attention and affection.   \n\nSo i guess what im asking is, AITA for wanting to keep her? Or should i do what is in the best interest for my dog and give her better \"parents\"? ",

      "description": "I've been with my husband for three years now. When I first met his dad he immediately called me a spawn of satan and wanted my husband (boyfriend at the time) to leave me. For the first year of our relationship I had done everything to make him like me. Talk to him, give him a ride when his drunk ass needed beer, lend him money, use my SUV to pick up a TV he wanted, and many other things that made me super uncomfortable and was really nice to normal people. \n\nWell not only was he attempting to convince my husband to leave me everytime he gets drunk, he talks shit behind my back calling me fat, ugly, a liar (no idea why), and a succubus. \n\nHe had then ruined my husbands credit by using his name for things then not paying for them. He ruins all of the peoples lives around him with his alcohol addiction and accusations. I really didn't need that in my life.\n\nWell I stopped trying for his approval a while ago so I've been not wanting to attend my husbands family get togethers, because I dont want his dad doing his basic shit nor do I want to see him.\n\nMy husband doesn't want to go to his family get togethers without me so he is calling me controlling for not going because of my hatred for his dad. \n\nKeep this in mind I am not telling him he can't go or he can't see him, I just want don't want be around him. Also, I can't just go, it is way too stressful on me and makes me have horrid anxiety. I have a bad eye twitch that happens when I get anxious and when his dad noticed it he made fun of me saying I \"psycho\" and needed the squad cars to take me in. \n\nMy husband says I'm the asshole for not going and tbh he makes me feel really bad about it so am I the asshole? \n\n(Apologies this is my first long post)",

      "description": "Going to try to condense this as much as possible. So I'll be leaving out a lot. \n\nI've never had a great relationship with my mother, she belongs somewhere in r/entitledparents. But that's a story for another day. \n\nEither way, my son is autistic. He'll be 6 this year. Back in Sept of 2016, I was struggling with my own mental illness, and I reached out for some help. Up to that point, I'd been using the ignore it and it'll go away method. It was not working. So after some fighting, my mom agreed to take care of my son for a few weeks, so I could figure shit out.\n\nA few weeks went by, and *insert long list of reasons*, she pitched this idea to give her custody of him on paper. It was all about the money for her, I see that now. But at the time, I thought she was trying to help me. \n\nFast forward a few more weeks, and I was starting to do better. My son would spend weekends at my house, and weekdays at my moms house.\n\nThen she stopped picking him up, weeks went by, medication not taken. I started to go back down, and in Aug I went to the psyc ward for 7 weeks to get help. \n\nWhen I got out, she refused to let me see my son. Dec rolled around and I still hadn't seen him. I get a message from her saying that she had applied for disability for him, and it was approved with back pay. She asked me to check if I was getting it.\n\nThat's weird I thought, considering it was 13 months since I legally had him, and she did all the leg work. But I checked and sure enough, I was getting just shy of 4 grand. \n\nWe talked about it, and I was under the impression that it was all of the back pay, and I agreed to split it with her. Upon looking into it further later, I realized that the amount was wrong. She had given me the date from where the back pay started, as well as the monthly amount, and it was short. 13 months short. \n\nRealizing what she did, I messaged her again. Knowing from her history that it was intentional, but not wanting to upset her, I said something to effect of \"Oh hey, mines short, you should check your account, there should be another ~1700 dollars you're getting, isn't that great!\".\n\nDoes she take the out? No, she doubles down. With the 'ol, yeah I knew that, but I deserve half of yours anyway. \n\nI don't even know what to say, after everything, long list of things she's done/said over the last 4 years, and she somehow felt entitled to money that was by all right, mine. She said I was disrespectful and selfish for not giving it to her, and questioning her about it. And how dare I accuse her of lying, she never lied to me. \n\nTo make a long story short, I didn't give her the money. She tells friends and family that I abandoned my son, and I don't want him back, when she's refusing to let me see him because I wouldn't give her the money. Now I have to take my own mother to court, and with the court date looming, I've gotta know.. am I the asshole for not giving her that money? \n\n",

      "description": "I dated this girl for a few years in college, she was my first real serious girlfriend. We got along great, lived together, and even talked about getting married after we were able to get our respective careers established.\n\nThat is until my best friend confessed to me that he and my girlfriend had slept together while drunk and she was attempting to make it a fwb thing with him. I confronted her and she told me she loved me and did want to marry eventually but she wanted an open relationship until after college. I told her I didn't want that and that she should have gone about all of that in a different way and I moved out.\n\nSo in one fell swoop I lost a relationship with my girlfriend and my best friend and a place to live.\n\nWhat followed was several years of poor decisions - drug use, promiscuity, generally abused my body. 22 y.o. me blamed my ex and ex best friend for my tailspin. After a few years of that I was able to recover and get back on the right track. I made myself take full credit for my poor life choices and forgave the people that hurt me. I still didn't have contact with them but I resolved the feelings of hatred I had for them and forgave them.\n\nI don't use social media so I'm sort of insulated from knowing what goes on in the lives of the people I don't associate with regularly and I hadn't heard anything about my ex or ex best friend for many years and had honestly put them out of my mind.\n\nAll was well until I ran into a friend of mine from college and he told me my ex was struggling. She had recently been arrested for OUI (driving drunk) with her small children in the vehicle and she lost her professional license (she works in a medical field). She is having a really hard time, her marriage is on the rocks, and she basically lost her career.\n\nFor some reason being presented with this information has dredged up all sorts of feelings I thought I had dealt with and put behind me already.\n\n1) AITA for feeling like this is karma and what she deserves. Obviously I did not and will not be making these feelings known to anyone but this is how I feel about it internally.\n\n2) AITA for not helping her in some way. Without going into detail there are things I could do to help her pull herself out of this rut but I really don't feel like she deserves my assistance.\n\nReally struggling with this and feeling pretty guilty as I've never wished ill on anyone before.",

This happened over the weekend.  \nMy step-sister got engaged to this dude about a year ago and most, if not all, of the family really does not like him, at least not personally. Most of the family understands that he pays the bills as best as he can, and provides for my step-sister and their two kids. He works full time doing manual labor, and does piecework on the weekends if he's able to.  \nI used to go with him when he found piecework, I was in college and sorely needed the extra cash. We eventually got somewhat close, and he started confessing things to me, crazy things that put him in an insanely different light.\n\nHe told me about his violent past and, most importantly, his felony kidnapping charge. The story, according to him, is that he broke into his ex-wife's apartment while she was nodding off on heroin, took his kid, and went on the run. He ended up doing a few years behind bars. He's told me about some pretty blatantly racist and violent stories, about mexicans on construction sites, african-americans while in prison, etc. He also told me that no one but my step-sister knows about these things.\n\nFast forward to Saturday night, during the wedding reception. All of us guys are drinking a bit, and the government shutdown gets brought up. To make a long story short, it ends up getting pretty heated between he, my step-dad, and I. Eventually, he ends up loudly saying something about how the influx of illegal immigrants directly fucks with his job prospects, and I respond with something along the lines of \"no, mexicans aren't fucking you over, your felony is fucking you over.\" He kinda laughs it off and asks me what the fuck I'm talking about. So I begin to tell the table what he told me. The rest of what happened was a bit of a blur, considering how drunk I was.\n\nEventually, my step-sister left the wedding alone. I've tried talking to her, but she's ignoring me. The rest of the family is... I don't know. Most are staying quiet, but I've talked in depth to my brother and his fiance (who is hispanic) about it. He says that it was dumb to do it at the wedding, but he's pretty glad that I outed it to him and has said that he won't spend any time with him or our step-sister anymore. Haven't talked to anyone else yet. I'll probably text my mom today about it.\n\nAnyway, yeah. I have no idea what to expect. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "TL:DR at bottom\n\nI share my dorm apartment with another guy.\n\nI feel morally obligated to deal with the stack of dishes that is on the kitchen counter, but they are not mine. Before I start eating my meal I will clean up and put away (either into the dishwasher or drying rack) the things I dirtied, such as the pot or pan, spatula, etc. After I am done eating I will clean the plate/bowl/cup/glass and put it into the dishwasher and then put the dry pot/pan back into the drawer. I do this because it becomes harder once the food sticks to the plate/bowl/etc, and it is faster to clean and put away 4 things instead of 20 things. \n\nMy roommate chooses to put whatever he has used into the sink/onto the countertop until he cleans them up at a later time. This often ends up with lots of dramatic sighs/huffs of annoyance from him, due to having to clean a large amount of kitchenware. I help out the odd time when it gets to be a large mess, it it is primarily him cleaning these large sink messes.\n\nI do an objectively equal share of the emptying of recycling/garbage (I use less waste because I buy food in bulk and cook it), shoveling the sidewalk, buying necessities (detergent, toilet paper).\n\nI am I the asshole here?\n\nTL;DR - I do hare of chores except when it comes to dishes. I immediately put away my dishes while my roommate piles his up. Am I the asshole for not cleaning his pile up?",

      "description": "My boyfriend’s older sister’s birthday is today and I didn’t go. This morning his sister let me know (my boyfriends owns the house, his sister rents from him) that she planned on going to an arcade/bar type of place and I said I might go. \nI consider myself introverted and all day I was pretty much psyching myself up to go to this dark bar for a couple hours, play a couple games, and most likely sit and watch my boyfriend and his sister play against their younger brothers. Instead, 30 minutes before we were supposed to go, she texts us that the bar is closed on mondays and they’re heading to a restaurant instead.\nI immediately said no. I was not expecting to have to sit down with people in a loud, bright restaurant with food I cannot eat because everything on the menu contains either cheese or meat. Not only that but the last time I went out to a birthday dinner with his family (boyfriends birthday), I spent the whole 4 hours being ignored. And when I say ignored I mean they specifically direct their conversations at certain people and the only person who spoke to me was their mother, who is not there tonight.\nSo AITA? I know sometimes I can be dramatic but I feel my reasoning is pretty solid. When my boyfriend called his sister to tell her his order because he was late she didn’t ask for mine either so I feel like I wasn’t expected to come anyways ",

I watched him turn from a teenage apprentice to a head chef to business owner and back to sous chef after losing it all through stupid mistakes (drugs) hes now 26 this year , lives in a shithole home with his parents and 4 younger brothers (nothing wrong with the structure or the parents they just never clean up after themselves) he met a girl about 6 months ago and they are officially in a relationship. Hes changed (obviously) so now I don't see him as much and when I do it with his gf .. again not a problem she's actually quite nice.  Just in that 21 year old \"let's party\" frame of mind constantly .. anyway... \n\nThe last 3 or 4 times I saw him he was asking me a lot of questions about kids (having had my own son at 26 under very different circumstances eg my own place in a relationship for 6 years etc etc ) so I out right asked him if his gf was pregnant he said \"no but we are going to start trying soon\" \n\nI told him straight \"You aren't ready for a child , you need your own space, you are in massive debt, you have only been with your gf 6 months you still have so much to learn about each other, you work like 100 hour weeks, how are you going to do that with a baby keeping you up all night \" he told me I don't know what I'm talking about  and if I can do it at 26 so can he. \n\nI've had to bail him out 3 times in his life due to him jumping the gun to early and I feel like hes using the thought of a baby to distract him from his current problems \n\nI'm just trying to protect him but I know he took it the wrong way and didn't really get where I was coming from. \n\nSo reddit.. am I the asshole?

I am not a particularly emotional person but this always bothers me.

As it always had happened, he started getting frustrated with me when I tried to explain to him that the sun is the same size at all times in the day, and on a flat earth this would not be possible. Things started to get really heated and that is when I told him I would not talk about this topic or anything that had to do with it anymore.\n\nHe got upset with me and told me that I was just thinking of myself and that I was treating him wrong by assuming he wasn't going to change.

      "description": "So a few years ago I had a long distance relationship with the person I thought was \"the one\". I mean it. We Skyped everyday, called each other when we weren't Skyping, sent gifts, taught her how to play a few strategy games so we could play together. Hell, we were even engaged for a while. Lets call her Tae to keep her name out of it. Unfortunately, I live in Ohio right and she lived in Arizona. Our loving relationship had passed the honeymoon stage and was into the second year when problems arrived. Having Skyped with Tae everyday I also spoke to her younger and older sister and a few of her friends on occasion. I was part of their lives for more than a year. However, one day a mutual friend hit me up on Skype after she had gone to bed. He told me about and showed screenshots of how she was flirting with and trading nudes with some guy in her town. A person, who she told me used to sexually harass her in school before she was pulled out. So the next day I hit up the guy and he confirmed it. I confronted her and she went through the whole \"I'm sorry, I'm stupid, I have no self control\" stuff.\n\nI was in love with her, so instead of ending it and canceling plans to see her the next year I forgave her and asked her to keep away from him. Her parents &amp; sisters hated him because he was the local dealer in a really poor area. She agreed, but things went downhill slowly from there. She got more distant and combative. I eventually was messaged by the guy again. With nudes of her. Furious, I blocked him and called her and demanded an explanation. She gave the same act. I still couldn't let go and I told her we were on thin ice, which legit upset her more than I had ever seen. Her tears may have been sincere but her heart wasn't. The year went on with little fights and petty gripes and my constant anxiety that the woman I loved was lying. But a WEEK before our 3 year anniversary she broke up with me, began dating the guy who used to harass her and even told me he let him take her virginity.\n\nThey fucked on Friday she was dumped on Sunday. PUMPED AND DUMPED in a week. That entire week she harassed me saying I was a terrible person, he was better than me in every way and so on. She came to me after it happened; crying in tears about how she was wrong to hurt me, and still cared about me but just didn't know if she loved me or would hurt me again if went back. But I still held out hope that we could. So for the next four months she acted like she was mine. In that time I found out she began dating two other guys. ONE WAS THE SAME GUY! Except this time she was dating him and another guy at the same time. So I went into my messages, my pics and logs. Took screenshots and waited until she had some post about one of either of them. And then I just spammed everything I had. I dug up their identities and did the same thing in pms. Then I told her parents her, friends, anyone I knew she knew and blasted her with her constant fucking lies!",

      "description": "I recently moved out of my apartment once the lease was up. My roommate elected to stay and got a new roommate to replace me. The energy bill was in my name and I warned her that the last bill will be owed after I move out. I told her when I expected to receive it and said I would contact her once I know her share. I just contacted her about her share and two weeks later she informed me that she is retroactively charging me for damages my dog caused to her personal property while I was living with her. She estimates that her damages cost more than the utility bill and we should just call it even out of the goodness of her heart. I think that the appropriate time to charge me for damages would have been at the time the damages occurred and I have no intention of paying for those damages now. Especially not at the full retail price she is quoting. Additionally, she has full access to my security deposit and will be getting my money once she moves. AITA for insisting that my ex roommate pay her portion of the utility bill? ",

Like all normal friendships we vent to each other and bitch about some people (some times people are in our friend group), typical teenager drama. \n\nWe all got really drunk last week and then started talking about life. Everyone was crying about peer pressure, shitty parents and how hard their degrees are. When it came to my turn I just said that I don't have anything to complain about. They got really offended and kept telling me to take my holier than thou attitude somewhere else. The thing is I really don't have anything to complain about??? My parents pay my tuition, my degree is pretty easy if you study regularly and I've come to enjoy it. My boyfriend and I stopped having problems years ago. I'm actually really grateful for everything and everyone in my life. Idk  student life seems like the easiest and nicest phase of life to me. All I really have to do is try to understand a few lectures at the end of the semester.\n\nI tried talking to my friends but they were being really passive agressive all week. Do you guys think I was an asshole for ruining the mood that night? I'm a little afraid I'm coming off as trying too hard to be edgy and someone who thinks they're superior :/",

      "description": "Ex and I had been together 4 years. I got deployed.  Two months into the deployment Ex calls \"it's not you, it's me\" and suddenly we are not together anymore. Life goes 100to0 real quick. We had still been talking since the breakup. It is hard to cut out the primary person in your life for the last 4 years. During conversations it has come up she is dating someone since the breakup, not something that she can't do. It still stings like though since I am still deployed.  The whole time she held a notion that things could line up for us sometime later in life. The other day Ex's new boyfriend broke up with her. I was there to comfort her. Before you jump to conclusions, I already told her we're not getting back together since she started dating someone else. It just felt nice to be leaned on after doing so much leaning.  We were still trying to be friends, but the next conversation was shitty. I told her I wouldn't hang up no matter what she told me, I did not hang up.  Long story short, She cheated on me, didn't plan on telling me, lied for 2 months and is now sorry.\n\nI am fucked up about this now. I am still talking to her and trying to not lash out.  I am emotionally confused, she has been my stability for the deployment, I still care for her.  Her life is a wreck now and I am trying to help her as well. I should cut ties, but she \\*\\*was\\*\\* my best friend and I do my best to stick by friends. Ex is 100% guilty on all charges and has plead as such, but I am not going to just watch a person jump off a cliff even after they stab me in the back.\n\nAITA part: Ex's roommates are pretty much her only friends.  I have heard the gossip on them.They are not that great of friends. I was texting one of these friends (W) before I found out the \"big news\" to make sure Ex was still eating and not hurting herself. I found out that over the last 3ish months, these friends had known and largely fed into her delusion and in general are just pushing her to go out and drink a lot. So, being in the emotional/angry state that I was in after I found out, I texted W saying they were bad friends for sitting back and watching Ex fuck her life up, lie and feed her delusion, unfuck yourselves and help her.   (text was long AF, only swore 1 more time, personally attacked no one)\n\nW's response \"I'm a great friend to Ex, always have been, and will continue to be.This text was rude and uncalled for. Please don't message me again.\"\n\nI thought her response was comical because I know just how often my Ex's friends bail on treat her with complete disregard, but I didn't text W. Yes her friends are not responsible for her actions, but they did encourage things working out later and I feel slighted because I was lied to a lot. Now my ex is telling me her roommates are all pissed about the text I sent and extremely offended. I feel like the only reason they should feel offended is if any of the text struck home for them. AITA",

It’s quite a long story, English is not my native language, bear with me please.\n\nI’ll call my former friend “Z”. \n\nZ and I became friends when we were 12 or 13. We were in the same grade and bonded during a school trip. She was friends with another girl, let’s call her J. Z, J and I were best friends. We spent all of our breaks together and both accepted me in their 2-person friend group. \n\nAt this time I was all about anime and Creepypasta and of course I told my friends about it. Z started liking those things as well and we watched a lot of videos and anime after school together. I was really happy to finally have a friend to share my interests with and to hang out with all the time. I had another hobby at that time, gaming. She didn’t enjoy it that much but I remember that we played lots of Smash Bros. on a N64, but I rather played on PC. I had a lot of male online  friends because well, I was a girl playing video games. (I became best friends with a boy living 3h away from me, let’s call him M. We met online when I was 11 and were best online friends ever since. He was 3 years older than me. He is important to the story.)  \n\nAnyways, I talked to M a lot via Skype and even sometimes when Z was around. They didn’t really like each other. At that time I had a fight with another online friend and M got involved as well. Both were jealous of each other because of me. I was really sad that they fought and Z wanted to get involved to settle it. Nice intentions, right? Wrong. After Z got involved, M blocked me everywhere. I didn’t know why. I was hurt, because I trusted him and loved him as a friend so much. He then unblocked me and told me that Z was way better than me and I should go for the other guy I didn’t even like. I got confused. Z stole my best friend. At school she told me that she and M talked for hours that night and how tired she is. I was so hurt and angry. How evil to you have to be to tell your BEST FRIEND you talked to the guy she LOST AS FRIEND BECAUSE SHE STOLE HIM?\n\nA few weeks later and I still haven’t heard anything from M. Z told me he wanted her to write him sex-related stories. He asked me the same before but I declined because I was 13. She delivered. I got so pissed. I hated her but we were still friends, because J and her were the only people that talked to me and didn’t bully me at school. \n\nI came up with a plan to text M via an alternate account. I wrote a heartful text about our long friendship and how he could give it up and how mean Z is to me and how she hurt me and how evil she is. I somehow convinced him to become my best friend again because I loved him so much and losing him was (at that age and time) the most hurtful thing ever. He then started to turn his back on Z and ended things with her and started insulting her (I didn’t want it but it kinda felt good at that time). She came to me and was so confused as to why that happened. I acted like I didn’t know. She still doesn’t know until this day and I got quite some satisfaction out of it.\n\n(M and I ended our friendship some years later because he was a nice guy but that is for another story.)\n\nAnyways. Z did some more things other than that and I will just list them. Please have in mind, that is just my side of the story, but I was always a loyal friend to her after that first incident. \n\n1. She copied everything I did. I was happy that I developed my own individual personality and interests at that age (13) and she copied all of it. My clothing style, the way I talked, my drawing style. She even saw me drawing something in class and then drew the exact same thing and presented it as if it was her own idea. She was not an individual, she was me. That pissed me off so badly.\n\n2. M was a bad person and he pressured me into cutting myself (again, how he did that is another story). I always tried to hide it because I was so ashamed of myself but she saw it. A few days later she had cuts as well but didn’t hide it and showed it around.  I still don’t understand why someone would to that. To this day I am still ashamed of my scars.\n\n3. At another school trip we were sleeping in a tent together. It was a canoe trip and I only packed one bra and that bra ripped so I had to wear my bikini top. One night she unhooked it and I told her to stop it, she then caressed my hip and belly and talked in a voice that I think was supposed to be somewhat seductive. I got creeped out and told her to re-do my top and to stop touching me. She didn’t stop until I began to talk more loudly. \n\n4. When I was 16 my bf broke up with me, so Z, J and me got super drunk. We were in my room and Z kissed me and touched me between my legs, J watched. I left the bed and went to sleep on the floor because she wouldn’t stop again. Z and J made out. After that night Z confessed she had a crush on me but I turned her down since we were best friends. \n\n5. Same year. She dated a guy (G) for some months, he broke up with her. He then dated her cousin and Z got jealous (that’s understandable). G introduced me to weed and we smoked together because we were friends, kind of. Z heard of it and wanted to try as well so we smoked together. (She never inhaled it, she just had the smoke in her mouth and pretended to be high, I always watched her). We smoked and drank some time and I got sick. The sun burned my head, I was high as a kite and kinda tipsy. I had to throw up. (I have some kind of phobia of throwing up so this was horrible). She never came to help me, I got vomit all over my hair and hands and shoes and she just sat there and watched and didn’t move to take care of me, even though she always claimed she would. I cried and shivered and just wanted to walk home (5 minute walk). She claimed she wasn’t able to help me because she was so stoned (yeah right). In reality she wanted to sit next to G and take advantage of him being high because he would get kind of touchy when he was. She wanted to get revenge on her cousin for “stealing” her bf. \n\n6. She always followed me around in school even though I told her to stop because we both have other friends and I wanted to talk to them (they weren’t her friends as well) and she could talk to hers. I often snapped at her and became really mean because I just wanted to be left alone. \n\n7. Before she left school, she didn't get any grades due to her being ill. We had to do a group project in one class and I was sick when they were making groups. She pushed me out of my standard group for doing projects and later left a voice mail talking about the day and just laughing about how I was placed in a group wth the worst students of this class and my worst enemy. (She could be part of another AITA)\n\nShe recently had to leave school due to depression.(I still think she enjoyed the attention of her being the main role in a play, a girl with depression and she got into the role a bit too deep, resulting in that depressive phase, but I guess I am waaaay wrong with that). I talked a lot of shit about her to my friends at that time and I kinda feel sorry for that but I just had to vent to someone because otherwise I would have snapped at Z and that would hurt her even more. \n\nShe never said bye to any of her friends. I was going through a tough part in life as well. My bf broke up, my cat died, a year later my parents told me they are getting a divorce. So yeah, I didn’t have much time beside school to deal with her. She was out of school, going to therapy and I was in school, dealing with exams, my social anxiety and depression. In the end I was just giving and forgiving her for all those things she has done to me. I never got anything in return. She was always in a mood, being bitchy when she liked and overall not the best friend. I had lots of friends that I had already helped over the years, including my ex-bf of 1,5 years,  but she wasn’t really there for me when I was down, it could have been due to her depression. She made everything about herself and all those things I listed made me dislike her even more. I kinda think this friendship was quite toxic from the beginning on both sides. At the end I just stopped caring because I kind of got numb to all of this and her bullshit. She tried to reach out to me some weeks ago but I ignored it. \n\nWhat do you think? AITA for “leaving” her in her worst phase in life?",

      "description": "First off, I don't think I am the asshole here. I think my husband is acting like a child, but I want to make sure that I am not being insensitive because of how hurt I am.\n\nMy kids have a banquet on Sunday and it is Harry Potter themed. He found a cool way to make robes and I was going to knit or crotchet a scarf in Gryffindor colors (as it is their favorite house). The problem is the scarfs weren't coming out the way I wanted them to and were taking a lot of time. So I had the thought of crocheting a tie in the same colors. I figured it was more practical as it would be hot with a scarf on and the students in the movies all wear ties as part of the uniform. I whipped one up quickly and it looks good. I was finishing it up and my husband came downstairs and was really rude.\n\nHe says it is horrible because it isn't what we discussed. He says that we agreed on the scarfs and if I had just done them the way he thought I should do them I would he done (he doesn't get why it wasn't working). I know he is stressed out from work and so I ask him what is really bothering him. He tells me I changed the plan without bothering to tell him. I explain that I was just trying something to see if it would work. He claims that it is awful because no one wears a knit tie and it would look like bad cos play. Our kids are 6 ans 4. This isn't some fancy thing. I really think it would look cute. I still do. We usually have great communication, but he is being a complete prick. I am also not in the best headspace. I am in a lot of pain and currently at the doctor's waiting to see if it is more likely kidney stones or pancreatitis. I am trying to be patient, but I am just done. \n\nShould I have mentioned the change before trying it out?",

During a spinning class, the instructor came up to me and, without asking me, put his hand on my back to correct my posture. I immediately shook his hand off and told him \"Please, no touching. Thanks.\" He looked irritated but left me alone. He never came to my bike again during the session. In a different class, a female instructor pushed my legs up during crunches, when I physically couldn't pull them up further. I simply let my legs fall and waved a hand to signal \"leave me alone.\" Every time I do this, the trainers look so defeated and almost sad. I get that their job is to make sure everybody gets the most out of the training, but I really dislike being touched by strangers, and even more so when I am sweaty and feel somewhat vulnerable. \n\nStill I can't help feeling that I'm being childish, since nobody else seems to mind the trainers correcting them.

      "description": "Hey arbiters of assholiness!\n\nI've lived with my roommate for just about two years now. His previous roommate moved out and I signed a new lease with him. That new lease expired about 10 months ago and since it expired, we've just been living month-to-month with no lease. This was my roommate's idea because the landlord didn't really care and without a new lease, the landlord wasn't going to increase the rent. I didn't love the idea at the time for reasons I'll get into in a bit, but I agreed to it anyway.\n\nRecently, my girlfriend and I decided to move in together. While we are looking at other apartments in the area, the apartment I'm currently in fits the bill of what we're looking for perfectly and there hasn't been on a lease for a while, so I reached out to my landlord and offered to sign a new lease with just myself and my girlfriend (several months from now, wanted to give plenty of notice). Before doing any of this, I sat down with my roommate, explained the situation, and encouraged him to also reach out to the landlord with the same offer if he's also interested in snagging the apartment himself and we'll just leave the decision in the hands of our landlord.\n\nInitially he seemed cool with this but last night, he confronted me and tried to guilt/pressure me into rescinding my interest in the place and just move out, saying that he's been in the apartment for longer (only by a couple months), I'm the one who moved in, etc, so he should get to keep it. There is one other element of this worth mentioning:\n\nIn the last month of our previous lease (so around 10 months ago), his girlfriend moved out of her apartment and moved in \"with her parents\". In reality, she started spending 7 nights/week at our place and has lived here full time since then without paying rent. He did not ask me if I was okay with this, said that it would be temporary, and his timing was impeccable as the terms of our lease (which was about to expire) VERY clearly stated it was for two tenants and anyone who spends more than 10 nights per month in the apartment is considered a tenant. However, with the lease expired, I didn't want to make any waves since the landlord knows him better and I couldn't afford to potentially get kicked out and replaced by his girlfriend for bringing it up. \n\nThe way I see it, I'm giving both roommates/couples equal footing to vie for the apartment. Yes, I'm the one disrupting the status quo here, but the status quo was an unfair situation that was taking advantage of me and my financial inability to escape it. The way he sees it, its not my apartment to vie for and he should get to keep it without involving the landlord by virtue of being here first.\n\nAm I the dick here, is he, or are we both two assholes who deserve each other?",

      "description": "So basically I’m on a d.c.field trip and this waiter is being rude to me, and I’ll tell you what happened leading up to me fucking up the table. So it was my first time going to this mid evil style restaurant and he asks me for my table card, I didn’t here him so he asks me again and then I give it to him, he walks away saying are you deaf man in a somewhat annoyed tone of voice. Then he brings us garlic bread and he gives me the worst one. He even said he’s going to give me the worst piece because I didn’t cheer for him enough(this was because at the restaurant I go to is mid evil themed and they do tournaments there and the waiter was also a helper of the knight on our team.  So I’m getting a tad bit of annoyed at this point because I haven’t had to deal with a situation like this. Now I get served chicken and he gives me the biggest piece, his reason for this is because he exclaims I am the biggest chicken he ever met, of course my classmates laugh at this but thankfully I never cried or anything like that. Now when he is serving us potatoes and corn the king was announcing birthdays of people in the crowd he said the whole crowd wasn’t cheering enough, the waiter hearing this while walking to our table decides to shout my name, i know he shouted it because I didn’t cheer for him enough as I stated before.  So then when the fights were almost over he started to hand out wet wipes for us to wipe our hands with, what this dude decided to do was have two of them in his hand he hands me one and I take it, when I look at it while grabbing it he throws it at my face with about as much force you would throw a toy for your dog. So I’m like pissed of but I’m not showing it so I think to myself that I need to get some revenge, I end up decided to unscrew the salt shakers and flip the soda bottle on it’s opened lid so that it will make a big mess when picked up.\n\nAfter I left I call my sister and tell her what happened, she tells me I should’ve told him to stop and that it’s his job to entertain people.  I don’t know if I should’ve told him to stop but I just wanted to get this off my chest. \n( please when reading this keep keep in mind that I’m on the bus going to the hotel and I’m kind of cranky and tired from walk-in all day and having to deal with this waiter.) thanks for reading.",

      "description": "Every week my friend and I go to the cinema to see the latest film, we have done this for years. Recently though whenever there is a big block buster my girlfriend insists on coming along. I've said to her that I am happy to see a film again on the weekend as it gives me a chance to catch some parts I may have missed. She doesn't want to do that though and immediately gets annoyed by me not wanting to take her and thinks I'm embarrassed to introduce them together. They've met multiple times and there is no problem there.\n\nUsually though the cinema is a chance to have a chat with one of my oldest friends about life and problems and it's easier for both of us to do that if she is not there. She doesn't seem to understand that though even after explanation. ",

      "description": "I was casually seeing this girl for about 2 months. She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?",

      "description": "I (25F) have a family friend Mike (49M). He was friends with my mom in high school and I've known him since birth. I only saw him rarely but used to chat with him on the phone every now and then. \n\nMy mom has narcissistic tendencies and once I became a teen I used to talk to Mike for advice whenever he called. I noticed that Mike is a bit of a pathological liar and that he slowly took more and more liberties with the truth as time went on. Eventually he started to claim that I was his daughter. He tells people that he has a daughter and shows them my picture. He asked my mom if he could adopt me. He told me that he added me to his USAA insurance as his daughter. I don't really feel comfortable with this but he has always been there to give advice and at this point it would seem pretty ungrateful if I were to set him completely straight, he seems to have lost grip with the reality of our friendship. I've also always felt that he has unrequited feelings for my mom, which could be why he clings onto me so much. \n\nLast month, Mike mentioned that he'd be in town and we made arrangements to get dinner. This involved me pushing for details as he claimed he could meet me \"whenever\", but later revealed that we would be meeting on the evening he flew in and he would be coming straight to the restaurant from the airport. Once I knew that I planned accordingly to give him enough time. \n\nThe dinner was terrible. He was more than an hour late, insisting the whole time he would be there soon. He brought a friend with him who bogarted the conversation by bragging about his life. My mom attended dinner and Mike kept making gross jokes - for example, my mom said there was a line for the bathroom and Mike cupped his hands in front of him and said \"here.\" Since Mike and his friend were so late, we went ahead and ordered our entrees - but when they arrived, they ate our food instead of ordering their own. \n\nI couldn't believe how Mike could claim to see me as a daughter and then act that way. Since we only speak a couple times a month, I decided to just not respond. Since then he has tried to contact me four times and I have ignored his attempts. I know if I told him why I was upset he'd just give me excuses for why everything was justified. I'm not really interested in that, but I'm starting to feel guilty since he probably doesn't see that he did anything wrong. AITA?\n\nTL'DR: My family friend is a pathological liar and claims to see me as his daughter. After reaching out to meet up for dinner, he ended up being over an hour late, brought a friend I didn't really know, ate my food instead of ordering his own, and made gross jokes to flirt with my mom.

      "description": "We’re a group of six girls who’ve known each other about 2 years. I also have a group of guy friends who I’m closer with who I’ve known for about 5 years. Recently two of the girls in my girl group started going out with two of the guy group. Predictably, we started hanging out as couples, and I kept doing girls only activities for the other girls.\n\nOne of the girls, Gabi, has been getting angry and upset because we haven’t been including her in any of the boyfriend/girlfriend activities (or including ourselves in boyfriend/girlfriend situations with her and her bf), but... her boyfriend is an enormous asshole and a bully. He’s told me to kill myself, that I’m a trash human being, that I’m an ungrateful pig, etc. All because I tried defending a friend he was bullying ONCE. Ever since then, he’s been verbally abusive to me in a couple other situations.\n\nSo I don’t really want to make an effort to include him, and even if he’d make an effort to apologize or try to get along (which he hasn’t and likely won’t) I still wouldn’t include him. She excuses his behavior and blames ME for not being mature enough, saying that I’m stuck up and want everyone to do what I say. \n\nAm I an asshole for not wanting to get NEAR a guy who acts this way? He is the same way with her and she’s constantly coming to us crying and frustrated because he is emotionally abusive to her, and I simply cannot relax and have fun with someone who is like that.",

      "description": "Okay, so here's the deal. I love my mother very much, but as a person, I can't stand her. She is very manipulative - basically an expert victim. Nothing is ever her fault. She does not ever apologize. She hit my husband - like, purposely  physically struck him - a couple Christmases ago and then had the balls to tell him \"I'm sorry you're so sensitive\" when he quite rightly flipped his shit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's not what this post is about. My twin brother (who is very low-functioning, special needs, and lives in a group home - more on this later) and I had a milestone birthday earlier this week. To commemorate, my mom put together a video slide show of family pictures ranging from when we were born to more or less the present day. She set it to music and everything. I thought it was a little bit chintzy, but basically sweet. I appreciate the effort she put into it, and told her, via text, that I liked it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently that wasn't enough. She also, as you may have gleaned from the title of this post, put the video up on Facebook. It's filled with comments from her friends that are all like \"the love you have for your family shines through!\" and \"this is so sweet, it made me cry!\" et cetera. Apparently, I was also supposed to join in on the public admiration and fawn over it, and her, for the world to see - as I found out last night after I got a bitchy, drunken text message calling me out for not acknowledging it and essentially saying that she knows I saw it because my husband \"liked\" it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, cool. I kind of see where she's coming from. She feels snubbed, and that's reasonable. But here's the thing. I want to snub her. She quit her job after my brother and I were born, because he needed full-time care, but refused to return to work even after he stopped living with us, saying that my dad owed it to her to support her \"after all she'd been through.\" My dad does not make much money, by the way. My childhood is filled with memories of extreme anxiety and financial stress, my parents screaming at and hitting each other, and me basically hiding in my room, biding my time until I turned 18 and could leave, which I promptly did. I left home over a decade ago and haven't looked back. I go home as little as possible. I haven't been home in 9 months, and the filial guilt to pay a perfunctory visit is weighing down hard, but whenever I go to book a flight, my throat tightens up and I start to have a panic attack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel awful, because I love my dad (another thing my mom resents - she turned me against him when I was growing up) and don't want to put him in the middle of this. I feel like I should just apologize, leave a pandering little comment on her post, and let it go. But I really do not fucking want to. What should I do? AITA?",

      "description": "There’s this girl I’ve been seeing (we’ll call her K) for about 6 weeks. She’s fun, sweet, and we have a lot in common. We’ve been talking and hanging out pretty frequently, and this weekend I met her mom and sisters. K is seen as very attractive, and a lot of other brothers in my fraternity tried talking to her at first before they knew about us seeing each other. This wasn’t a huge deal as we weren’t technically exclusive at the time so I didn’t want to be controlling and she just politely turned them down anyway.\n\nWell, she just told me tonight that at a recent party one of the pledges (let’s call him T) started talking her up and drinking with her. Not a big deal, I trust her and T is a new guy who didn’t know we’re together. Anyway, he texted her later telling her that he wants something more and wants to date. This was after meeting her once and chatting with her for maybe 45 minutes. I don’t think he’s the asshole here, but chill out T lol.\n\nTo my surprise, she told T that she was also looking for something more...and proceeded to ghost him. She clarified to me she never wanted to be with him in the first place, but that she feigned interest then ghosted him because she might need more wristbands (essentially entry tickets) for a huge upcoming party we’re having. This upset me, and I told her she was a snake for doing that. I kept myself in check, didn’t act super pissed or anything and she kinda brushed it off and justified it by saying something along the lines of “most guys are assholes too.” We didn’t get into an argument over it, since I was just so caught off guard and didn’t know if I was overreacting or not. The conversation quickly changed topic after that, and it didn’t come back up. She left not long after.\n\nAfter she left I had some time to process and think it over and I still think what she did was pretty fucked up—especially considering that I will be calling this guy my brother in a few weeks. I’m not really sure what to make of this or if I’m overreacting by getting upset and calling her a snake. AITA?",

      "description": "Posting from a throwaway because my real account almost certainly has references to where I live and my old job.\n\nIn my \"real\" life I'm a student at a large university, sociology major with a minor in stats. I'm active in several volunteer service groups and am treasurer of the campus version of my chosen political party. I was also working for a group that fund raises to research and advocate for things like environmental justice and modeling methods of food and water equity. \n\nAbout a month ago I showed up to work to find a pad locked door and the fact that I no longer had a job. The rumors are flying but I honestly don't know what happened. What is good is national stepped in and paid half our last months check with a promise that the other half will be paid in April so I'm glad we aren't totally high and dry. \n\nHowever I need a job. I have a few friends outside my normal social circle and one of them mentioned that he was working for a local MMA promotion and they desperately needed a ring card girl for what would have been last weekend's show. I honestly had no idea what it was so I looked it up and its defintely not my ordinary thing but it paid $200 cash for 3 hours work. The outfits were actually cute and more like a sports bra and yoga shorts than a skimpy bikini. I did the job and it was actually really fun, there were defintely \"woos and whistles\" but for the most part everyone was respectful. The two other girls were super cool and we didn't even watch the fights because we had so much getting to know each other. I got a free outfit, a free set of sweats and even free dinner and hotel room at the casino.  I got another offer to work this coming weekend in another state but I would have to do weigh ins on Friday and the event on Saturday for a total of $500. I happily agreed.\n\n\nMy social circle is apoplectic that I took this job. They think it's objectifying, degrading and violent. I told them that it was actually the opposite and one told me I was blinded by the money (which is ironic because he comes from a rich family in California). I've been told that MMA is representative of what happens in a society that doesn't strive for equity and now I'm in the thick of it. No one has said we aren't friends or anything like that but there was much coldness at one of my Monday night meetings and I wasn't invited to dinner afterwards like I have been for almost 2 years now.\n\nI feel like an asshole but am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Okay I have to admit, I feel like I'm NTA but my wife has gotten in my head and I need a third party opinion.\n\nMy wife and I are trying to buy a house. We are already qualified and are ready to make an offer. Currently with what we have and how much we make, we will have no problem affording a house, however buying down the interest rate would make our payments feel much more comfortable, but its not a necessity. \n\nSeveral years ago, my father gave $10k to my older brother to purchase a home. Armed with my knowledge of this, I asked my father for a small loan of $2,600 to help buy down our interest rate last week. Unfortunately he said no, which is whatever to me but my wife on the other hand wasn't so happy about it.\n\nNow my wife is claiming that its unfair treatment that he would help one of us siblings out but not the other. I reminded her that he had helped me out in other ways in the past, but regardless, it's a deal my dad made with my brother and as far as im concerned its absolutely none of my business. Just because my dad helped out my brother doesnt mean im entitled to any money whatsoever. \n\nI may be a little harsh but i keep telling my wife she's acting entitled and selfish to expect someone to loan us their hard earned money and now we're in a big fight over it because that type of mindset is, in my opinion, so juvenile and immature. She is claiming she's not acting entitled but she thinks its a great injustice that we aren't being gifted some money. I'm sorry but in my book, thats entitlement.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not agreeing with my wife and telling her that she (we) have no right to feel entitled to anyone's money?\n\ntl:dr- My wife feels it's unfair that my father helped my brother out financially several years ago, but wont give us a small loan to help to buy a house and I told her she's acting entitled to my fathers money.

      "description": "Here is a little background:\n\nMy coworker and I share an office that is just the two of us most days.  I try my hardest to be quiet and respectful since she is technically the office manager.  Our doors are always open and the walls are thin.  When I started here several months back things were great.  I tried to be considerate and so did she.... but she has stopped caring it seems.\n\nShe hums loudly, takes big poos in our communal bathrooom but doesn't use air freshener that's sitting beside the toilet, yells things to me when she knows I have earphones in and won't just walk to my office, cranks up her heater to an uncomfortable temperature and refuses to wear layers because \"I don't like to,\" and clears her throat every two minutes because she is drying out the air with her heater.  \n\nI have sensory sensitivity issues.  Sound, touch, and smell mostly.  I can't help it.  I've told her this and there are little things she could do to help, but she won't.  I know I can't expect everyone to accommodate me and make things completely comfortable just for me.  But I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick....  I really try to do my best at being a good office mate.\n\nAnyway, today at the end of lunch, she was humming some irritating tune of a genre of music I loathe.  She's been doing this so much along with everything else and with my anxiety, I felt like I'd had enough.  I can't focus with this going on and it makes my skin crawl.\n\nI approached things in the most light hearted way I could figure.  As she walked past my office, I said, \"Coworker, I'm so glad you love your music, but I really don't. (Chuckled here)  So could you not sing it?\"\n\nShe froze in place and just stared at me with her mouth open.  Eventually she said in a dismissive tone, \"Pffft.  Girl, I wasn't even singing that loud!\"  She went out of the building, checked the mail, then walked back in, still humming loudly.\n\nAm I the asshole?  Am I asking too much?!",

Normally I don’t get in the middle of these things...but I’ve been growing increasingly sympathetic and empathetic for his wife. I don’t know the woman, but my friend has said that this man talks highly about her and said she’s a great person but he’s not in love with her. But he won’t leave her until he has someone else to jump into it with. My friend thinks that he’s going to leave his wife for her (maybe he will). Friend says how great of a guy he is, but he’s also telling my friend all the intimate details of this poor woman’s life. The ways she’s struggling, things that she confided in her husband in her weakest moments. She’s also incredibly suspicious, but he covers all his tracks really well (seems like this isn’t his first affair honestly) and tells her that she’s crazy. This is the worst part to me. I mean, all of it is terrible. But it’s like he’s gaslighting her also, making her question her instincts. If I were in her position, I would want someone to tell me. But I know it’s not really my position...I’ve been struggling with this for months. I know I’ll be the asshole, but should I still say something? The only thing keeping me from saying something is my friend, despite this, she actually is a good person and is struggling in her own way and I think she’s being just as manipulated. But does any of this give me a right to essentially ruin people’s lives? Please be as kind as possible, this really is a difficult situation for me. ",

I've told her several times that I don't want to watch it and she just doesn't stop trying to force me to. Most recently she took away the dip for the chips we we're both eating and enjoying in an attempted to get me to give in and watch it. So I left. She's tried to blackmail me and guilt trip me in the past to watch other things she was obsessed with and I wasn't willing to entertain it tonight so I told her I was done hanging out for tonight and left.\n\nShe said that I'm being rude by leaving and that I do this all the time and she would watch whatever show to spend more time with me. I don't think that's entirely true though. I have started doing that more as I've started to value my time more but I'd happily spend time with her if it was something we both enjoyed doing. I wouldn't force anyone to do something I found fun but they didn't, I'd just find something we both wanted to do if I wanted to hangout with them.

      "title": "WIBTA if I told my cousin’s ex-boyfriend that she had his baby without telling him?",
      "description": "No matter what, this situation is going to get messy. TLDR at the bottom. \n\nFor context, my (23F) cousin (25f) has a lot of issues. She has always been a pathological liar, has trouble making decisions and being responsible, etc.\n\nAbout a year ago, my cousin was sleeping with multiple people. I have absolutely no issue with that, she was not in any official relationships. She ended up becoming more serious with one of the dudes, and became monogamous. \n\nShortly after, it was revealed that she was pregnant. Her boyfriend wanted to take responsibility, and asked her to move in and marry him. They ended up getting married near the end of her pregnancy. \n\nHere’s the tricky part. We discussed it near the middle of her pregnancy, and she told me that she had narrowed it down to 2 potential baby daddies - one of them (husband) is white, the other is Asian. She is also white. She also told me (keep in mind - pathological liar) that both guys were informed and amicable, and the hospital had done a ‘blood typing’ test but it was inconclusive because both guys have the same blood type. Firstly.. not sure that’s a thing? And secondly, they would not casually do a paternity test on a fetus, it is very dangerous. \n\nMy brand new nephew is less than a month old. When he was born, it seemed very unlikely that he was white. To be fair, all babies look like little aliens, and often skin tone changes drastically. However, we have had Japanese, Korean, and Chinese people note that he looks specifically Chinese (which is where potential baby daddy’s family is from) - I feel like folks with Asian backgrounds would be able to tell better than my white family. \n\nMy cousin’s sister, who I am very close with, and I have been very torn. We both want what’s best, and do not want to cause a divorce/etc for my cousin. However, we feel it is her husband’s right to know, as he will figure it out eventually, and it is the birth father’s right to know that he has a baby out there.\nI don’t want to betray my cousin’s trust, but at the same time I would not technically be at fault because she has explicitly told us, multiple times, that everyone is aware and amicable. I want to be proactive as I feel like the situation will get worse, the longer that time goes on and it becomes more obvious that the child is not white. I feel the bio dad is missing out on an important time in the baby’s life. If it makes a difference, I am quite confident my cousin will reach out to him for child support, if her husband leaves her. \n\nWIBTA for casually mentioning the situation in front of the husband, perhaps by noting it is admirable he has stuck around? And WIBTA for anonymously contacting the baby daddy and letting him know about the situation? \n\nTLDR: White cousin has just birthed Asian baby. Husband is white. Should I tell husband and baby daddy what’s going on? ",

      "description": "Basically he seemed pretty excited to audition for the first play we did this year, then was disappointed when he landed a role as pretty much a background extra, even though he had the option to quit, he instead chose to continue through with it, complaining the whole time, and being disrespectful to the theatre teacher. A couple of times I got annoyed with it and suggested for him to quit, as he didn't seem happy with it. He continued through with his ways and it got to the point where the theatre teacher talked to me privately about him, asking if he was okay as he always seemed to not follow the stage directions and loudly talk backstage, being rude and giving attitude to the others actors. \n\nIt all seemed to go away until recently when we we're hanging up pictures of the show and one showed a blatant sign that seemed to make a joke of the whole image. I was only a little  bit annoyed, yet our theatre teacher seemed in distress about it. I go in and see him freaking out about it like he's worried he's gonna get in trouble when he has never even been punished, as our theatre teacher is rather elderly and kind. He seems to not feel a hint of guilt about doing it, which made me lash out at him, blunting telling him to switch electives next year as with our next theatre teacher I guarantee the shit won't fly. He looks at me with a shocked face as I walked away, and later in the day refused to talk to me saying that what I said hurt his feelings and was rude. This happened a week ago, and on Monday he called me an asshole, promptly pissing me off to call him a coward for not apologizing.\n\n I've looked at this from every angle and can't see how exactly I could be the asshole, but I guess I could be wrong. Sorry for the long post.\n\nTL;DR friend was being a dick in theatre, I eventually got sick of it and told him he shouldn't be in theatre, now he won't talk to me and thinks I'm an asshole.",

      "description": "On mobile, sorry for format/spelling problems\n\nSo basically I’ve been friends with this group of people (excluding one) for about 6 years. They’re kind of the weirdo group in my school rn.  Now in my last school, I was exclusively part of this friend group, mostly because I didn’t get along with the rest of the class. Now I’ve moved into secondary school and I get along well with 75% of the people in my year but still I stuck with these friends as well as hanging around with some other people. \n\nFast forward to now: I am far more involved in some other friend groups, some of the people in OG group I dislike, others have just intensified in their weirdness and I can’t keep up. I’m going to give you a picture of this friend group. Ordering them from my favourite to least favourite:\n\n1: There’s not a lot to say about him other than he gets along well with the OG friend group and he’s gay and I’m gay too (that’s relevant later)\n\n2: This guy, this fucking guy, in the past he was fucking nuts. He slapped my ass and then couldn’t see what was wrong with it. (He’s done worse) The others knew it disgusted me and freaked me out but all told me I was overreacting. He’s calmed down recently and he’s surprisingly my second fave. \n\n3: this guy, mostly okay. talked shit about one of my friends all the time. Like, ughhhh. And he also was quite weird. Told weird lies and made weirder jokes. \n\n4: This guy, he has some mental health issues. The most concerning  being depression. at it’s worst I had many sleepless nights talking him down and after he says he’s changed his mind lying in bed hoping I’d see him in school tomorrow. He’s also super outspoken about unpopular opinions. He makes racist jokes and is always putting anti-trans memes on him snapchat story.  He also ran around town screaming racist shit on more than one occasion \n\n5: Then there’s this one, he was homophobic, always excluded me, was constantly rude and condescending but he conveniently forgot that no. 1 was bi. They all kind of vouched for him even though he said, word for word, “ This is why I’m homophobic”, the all heard but “he’s sometimes fun” even no. 1 sticks up for him. \n\nThere are some other less relevant characters in this group but there’d be no difference in our friendship if I ditched the group. I might see a little less of person 1 but I could deal with that. \n\nThere would be no grand departure, I’d just slowly phase my way out. If something went sour with the new group I’d always be welcomed back but ATM I would rather just be a loner. ",

      "description": "So, I got into Cornell last week. Honestly I think it was fluke. I’m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She’s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn’t and still don’t mind, it’s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn’t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don’t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn’t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn’t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I’m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don’t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she’s been crying and solemn and sad. She’s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She’s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn’t been herself. I haven’t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn’t get in because she didn’t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it’s Cornell. I couldn’t in a million years imagine I’d get in. I’ve been researching obsessively about it and I can’t shake the desire that if I don’t go, I’ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it’s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don’t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she’s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn’t. She’s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho.

      "description": "It's kind of a long story.\n\nMe and my friends were planning to get a shared flat together after high school ended. One of said friends ended up asking someone else(m), if he wanted to join the flat. The guy agreed. Said friend didn't ask for permission to ask and I chickened out about voicing my discomfort about that(I was against him in the flat).\n\nFast forward to me not wanting to be in the flat anymore, chickening out about saying that, getting severe depression(not just because of the flat thing) and general mental problems. Friends start pressuring me for the apartment search, I end up getting along but not going to the sighting. My sister is also in the friend group aka the flat which is going to become revelant later. Because I was the only one who worked aka wasn't supported by her parents, I asked for the smallest room, my sister would be sharing with someone and I would pay her rent for the first months till she got a job too.\n\n\nFast forward to them getting the flat, me and my sister taking longer to move in because of family issues. I go to visit the flat and discover that my room is 7m2 \"big\", and with a layout that makes even putting a bed into it dubious. Thing is, I still pay 250€ for a room that can barely fit my bed and a few clothes at most. Friends pay about 300-350 for 15-17m2 rooms. \n\nI snap and just decide fuck it, tell them I'm out and then hash out the details with them, that is still paying part of the rent (which I'm okay with, because I'm the one who pulled out and need to take responsibility and they all have their money limit already pretty stretched). Of course I tell them the reason why, with the \"I don't want the guy in the flat\" thing out. My sister still hasn't moved in because she kept procrastrinating till something important in her school came up that made her unable to move. I still pay her rent of 350 plus the added 150. Sister keeps procrastrinating till deciding that she's not going to move in, and doesn't bother getting a job and basically just fucks with me (a whole other story). So basically my friends are kind of disappointed, I made it pretty clear to them I'm not going to move in, it's been several months of me paying 500 for literally nothing. I decide fuck it, at least I want to get something out of the money and decide that I'm just going to move in despite severe discomfort. \n\nThen the guy finds a couple who would move in, I discard my \"plan\". A few days later they find out that won't move in, so basically the \"room\"(aka living room), would be free again. I decide, once again, fuck it, and this time say I would move in. The guy responds with visible bad mood and asks me why I haven't said that earlier, I tell him why. He said that I would have to either share a room with someone or use the little room.\n\n\nAITA for changing my mind about moving in? Also AITA for being kinda frustrated that I wouldn't get to move in the \"room\"/living room despite paying almost double of everyone else?",

And they wanted us to be just like them, putting us into sports, instrument lessons, reading groups, martial arts, etc. Personally, I enjoyed that busy lifestyle. But it wasn't for Caroline. She didn't like being busy, she doesn't like interacting with people, etc. She's super shy. It took a while for my parents to understand and accept that she wasn't the type. But when she had her son, let's call him Kainen, she told me she didn't want to put him in activities because she didn't want him to suffer. I pointed out some kids enjoy activities/sports/are extroverts, like me, and some people are introverts and don't like activities, like her. So she should put him in some stuff, see if he enjoys it, and act accordingly. She kind of brushed me off.\n\nIn the years since then, it's become kind of an issue between the two of us. Kainen doesn't play any sports, isn't playing any instruments, and since he was never exposed to other kids before school started, he has trouble making friends. I talk to him regularly about this, and he always says he wants friends, wants to play baseball and do swimming, and that he asks his mom but she doesn't let him.\n\nSo over the years I've really confronted her about this, but she just calls me out for 'undermining her parenting'. I just want Kainen to, y'know, be involved in activities and make friends. \n\nAita?",

      "description": "Me and my cat have been together for about 14 years. She is a really sweet thing, very smart and quite lively despite her age. She has always been an indoors cat. \n\nFirst of all, I have to clarify that the place we live is really not safe for outdoors pets as there are a lot of strays in the streets and people drive like crazy. However, she doesn’t seem to get that, and she loves exploring. She is always trying to escape when someone walks in and she even figured out how to open the door. She has succeeded a few times too, sometimes she came back, others I was looking for her for hours, got her down from trees etc. Last year when I was out of the country, my dad did not pay enough attention, she escaped and was missing for a month and a half. I was trying to cope with the loss, when out of the blue and after some funny life coincidences, I found her. The little shit had relocated to a friend’s house a few blocks away! \n\nAfter that, I took even more measures around the house to ensure she won’t escape again, locking doors, put bars at the windows etc. I am only letting her have supervised walks in the garden, but that’s not enough for her! Tried a leash too but it didn’t work out. She is always looking outside the window with a depressed look, meowing all the time and it really makes me feel like a jerk and an oppressor. People tell me that I should just let her out, that cats are supposed to roam and hunt, but I just love her too much to risk her getting hurt or losing her again.\n\nSo AITA for keeping my cat inside against her wishes?

      "description": "Stocking a shelf at work. The shelf has slots for each item and a retracting panel behind the items to automatically push them forward. They require minimal effort to push back and put an item in, but some customers refuse to do the absolute bare minimum and if the item doesn't magically push in with so little force you couldn't even knock over an empty tin can, they give up entirely.\n\n  \nA woman takes an item, taps it against the shelf with no effort, and puts it down on the shelf below, where it does not belong. I take it and put it back on the shelf.  \n\n\nI step away to stock something else, and I come back. She has another variety of the same item, taps it against the shelf with no effort again, and sets it down on the shelf.  \n\n\nNormally this shit really aggravates me because it's unacceptable laziness on the shopper's part and I consider it incredibly rude to just throw things wherever you like. Especially if I'm standing right there, trying to make the shelf look nice. Just ask if you need help, or put in the effort to put it back.  \n\n\nBut I'm trying lately to be more verbal with customers, I don't usually try to talk to them. A coworker \"messes with\" customers and they usually really go for it. These people seemed nice, so when I put the second one back, I said \"oh, you missed twice! :P\", ribbing the woman for not putting the item on the shelf, twice, and me catching her and correcting her, twice. I say this as I'm taking things to the back.\n\nShe responds \"Yep! \\*\\*Twice!\\*\\*\" in a very fierce way, and I was not looking at her but I imagine she said it with an angry stepford smile and wide eyes. Her husband immediately states behind me \"If you don't like your job, work a different one, asshole!\" which I go wide-eyed at but completely ignore and go hide in the back.\n\n  \nI think I mistook what was really \"I have no respect for other people and don't clean up after myself\" for \"oh gosh I can't get it back on the shelf, silly me\" (even though she clearly wasn't trying), and that's why they got so upset. They were being defensive.   \n\n\nIt's kind of eating at me, though. :( Is it really me who is the asshole to call someone out- even jokingly- on making the store a messier place? I mean, who does that? Just leaves things wherever they want? Do good people do that? I think it's a fair assumption that people who do that so flippantly- as to do it \\*twice\\*, in front of an employee, after already being caught doing it- are not good people, but I figured ribbing them for it might make them laugh and reconsider their behavior. Guess not...",

I can get a burger/fries for 4 bucks  on a Wednesday night (they’re already half off these nights, burgers are 14-18 bucks normally). \n\nI come after my 8pm class, so he’ll usually have one table or so left. I’ll sit either at the bar or one of his tables and he’ll grab me a drink/put my order in. That’s it though. \n\nI’ll even bus my own table at the end. He knows he doesn’t have to wait on me, I can just chill out while he works. \n\nHe says I don’t have to tip- and I know if the roles were reversed, I wouldn’t want him tipping me either. At the same time, something deep down I can’t shake is telling me I’m the asshole. If I tipped him I wouldn’t want to be cheap, and I’d tip on the full amount before the half off. Only thing is most nights I’m not prepared to spend too much on dinner by going out (I’m trying to save), and I feel weird giving him money when this has become a weekly thing. \n\nAITA for not tipping my SO when he serves me at his restaurant?

One of the guys has some anger and behavior issues, and over the years has been involved in fights with individuals from the group. To distance myself from this behavior, I stopped inviting him for activities. He obviously has some friends backing him up, but others didn’t, agreeing with my point of view. We slowly turned into a small group within a group. Last week, one of the other guys mentioned that he feels that the group is falling apart, and that it came to his ears that we have a separate chat. Though this went quit natural, I took part of the responsibility, by mentioning (outing) that I was sick of this one guys anger and behavior issues, and that as long as people don’t have any morals and values belonging to a friendship, I don’t longer see them as friends. Now I am the “pathetic, behind the back, hypocrit asshole that will have a hard time success in life” according to this one guy, and all the others don’t want to choose sides.

Particularly around 5pm when most people finish work, you could easily wait 20 minutes to fill up your car. \n\nAnyway, I waited my turn and started filling up my car. A man approaches me (Im a 23 year old female) holding one of those red gas containers that you might use to fill up a lawnmower. He explains that he’s in a hurry to fill up and get home to his kids, and would I mind filling up his container. The way he phrased it implied he wanted me to fill it up while my credit card was still loaded on the gas pump. I explained that my car takes premium gas, which is very expensive, and politely refused. He got super angry and said something along the lines of “if you can afford a car that takes premium gas, you can afford an extra gallon to fill up my tank.”\n\nAnyway, I refuse again, and then he says, “fine, I’ll just put my card in when you’re done.” However, there’s like 6 cars waiting in line to fill up. I told him he needed to wait, because there were other people in line. He was so mad and told me I was the reason he wouldn’t be able to say goodnight to his kids. \n\nI felt really bad. What he was asking seemed unfair, but maybe the expectation was that I help him out since we live in a small town? AITA?",

And I feel horrible for thinking this way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like the decision should be obvious.

At this point I’m really frustrated with the university, the professors, and most of my fellow students. The one sitting next to me knew there was an exam on Monday, we spent all class on Friday reviewing for it. We are in the 5th week of the 15 week long semester and this person, who sits next to me, is often late, has headphones in, and browses their phone/computer most of the class time. \n\nThis was our first exam and the math was very basic, but a calculator would still make it easier (only 6 math problems with 6 digit division, 20 multiple choice). I did the math part right away then went back to do the multiple choice. As I was reading the final question this kid asks to borrow my calculator and I just give a quick “no” back, turned my exam in 30 seconds later and left. \n\nSo am I the asshole? I just feel at this level college course you should be more on top of things. There’s only 4 exams, you should really know when they are. If he had asked me earlier I would have no issue letting him use the calculator, but I was pretty stressed out because I had multiple other classes to work on and had to work tonight, meaning I had less time than I had planned for my work.

      "description": "So last night I got drunk at a friends house. It was just a small group of us, around 7 people. One of the girls there is one of my close friends now. We’ve gotten closer because we’ve realized we are just a male and female version of each other. I think she’s cute but I don’t see her as anything other than one of my best friends now. She’s also a lesbian so even if I did, nothing could happen.\n\nNow last night we finally got drunk together, we were excited because we’ve talked about drinking together. We got pretty shitfaced really fast. \n\nNow I’m quite the loving guy when drunk (I always ask first if I can give a hug though, can’t be making people uncomfortable) so I was giving out hugs to all my friends last night and telling them why they’re great, including her.\n\nNow here’s where it gets to the asshole territory. We were sitting on the couch behind everyone else, talking about relationships and shit. Earlier that night when I was more sober she tried to kiss me and I was like “yooo can’t do that my dude”. \n\nSo while we were on the couch she was like “I really wanna makeout with someone” and I was like “I mean you could call (insert girls name who she has a thing with)” \n\nThen she started making out with me. I made no moves while she leaned on top of me. I felt nothing and she didn’t either, it was just the act. But I didn’t stop her despite her being drunk as well. I did end up feeling her ass though because I was curious and I did kiss her neck because she asked me if I was actually good at it. It wasn’t awkward or anything, it was just two friends seeing each other skills to be honest. We just asked each other for tips on it. \n\nBut I didn’t stop her when she made out with me even though she was drunk. am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "To preface this, I have severe depression, and have few friends, and of those friends there was only one I trusted with anything to do with my depression. The other day I was struggling with it, and texted him about it, and he told me that all I ever do is complain even though my life isnt so bad, and I'm always inconsiderate of him. I didnt respond, gave myself a few days to clear my head, and realized that I dont really want to fix a friendship with somebody who thinks that about me. Problem is I've been storing my computer at his house due to unrelated reasons, which led to this conversation\n\nMe: I'll come over sunday to get my computer\n\nHim: so you have no desire to fix our friendship\n\nMe: I think it's best for both of us if I distance myself for now\n\nHim: Distance yourself from what\nSo this says to me so this says to me that our friendship means so little to you that you have no desire to try and fix it\n\nMe: I'm trying to figure out how to explain this without hurting any feelings but dammit it's not easy. To put it bluntly you dont believe in depression, and it's impossible to make any progress with depression if your support system doesnt believe in depression\n\nHim: You're absolutely right however if you really believe I don't believe in depression then you don't know me at all and you're right we should just end this now. Goodbye Panda\n\nMe: From everything you've said it sounds like you dont, what really ended up getting me was \"your lifes not that bad\" when that really doesnt have much to do with it\n\nHim: You're right however you should also understand that I was in a pretty rough space that day and pretty angry. And I don't believe that the fates are against you however I have never said that I didn't think you were depressed I know you're depressed I've worked very hard at trying to support you and getting help. But I guess that doesn't matter\n\nMe: It's not the first time you've said something like that that's bothered me, I just kept my mouth shut because i didnt want to hurt your feelings. That being said I would be willing to be more considerate of you, but you have to put in the effort too. I know I should be considering how your doing more, that's something I need to work on, but it's up to you\n\nHim: The problem Panda is because you haven't told me when I said things that bothered you I don't know when it is so now you're going to ask me to be considerate when I don't know when it's been bothering you so then I'm going to not be considerate cuz I don't know and we're going to be right back to where we started\n\nMe: Would you like me to start pointing them out? Cause I can, I just dont like to make people feel bad about things they've said\n\nHim: Honestly at this point I don't know if this friendship is salvageable.\nThe reality of the situation to me cuz I expressed myself in a way that was a little harsh however it still holds true that I feel like you don't really care about my feelings or what's going on with me. And your response is to one put that second to your own concerns belittle me for not caring about you and then putting conditions on trying to fix our relationship\n\nMe: That's not what I was suggesting. Both issues are equally important to me, but if that's how you see it then so be it\n\nHim: I really don't think you understand what I'm saying or that you don't care to understand what I'm saying I don't know what it is.\n\nMe: Funny I'm getting the same impression from you.\n\nHim: I don't see anything funny about this\n\nMe: So nothings changed. I'll pick up my computer on sunday.\n\nHim: No something has changed I will meet you somewhere with your computer I do not want you at my house again",

Rule #3 is, no trading while on any drugs, aside from coffee. I think it's a pretty obvious rule. Don't trade stocks while you're under the influence of anything, because that has the potential to dull your judgement. \n\nSome time ago, one of my traders caught another, let's call him Victor, smoking weed in his office while trading, and came to me. I didn't want to act on word of mouth, so I had his office searched, and sure enough there was some weed there. Seeing this, I fired Victor on the spot.\n\nAfter this, Victor sends me an angry email, saying I was being a dick and unfair. That made me think, am I?

Not I volunteer for the company that organizes and runs the events and I get comped track time in return and normally I camp out to save money, and my girlfriend comes with me to hang out after and just enjoy the event.  \n\nThis particular time the event is 3 days long, friday, saturday and sunday.  This particular time some of the other volunteers and I had rented a villa at the track and split the cost (I paid for myself and my gf so ~$250 total).  SO thursday rolls around and I we usually head down together but this time, her stomach had been hurting more and more throughout the week.  \n\nSo on thursday instead of coming to meet me she goes to the emergency room and lo and behold she needs her appendix removed over the weekend, and I went to the track alone and gave her spot to a friend who didn't want to pay for the villa.  By the time I got back from the track the surgery was completed and she was picked up from the hospital by a friend.  \n\n AITA for not canceling my track day and staying with her?   I'm not just attending the event, I have to work all day for it and was expected to be there.  Also she does have celiac disease so stomache pain for her is pretty regular but I was aware she was going to need surgery before I left.  ",

      "description": "Okay, so I have been dating my girlfriend for almost 2 years now and she has always been wonderful to me. However, she is incredibly introverted and the best way to describe the situation is with the words my therapist used: \"/u/DamaruisManeti, you are someone that generally likes people until they give you a reason not to, and even then, redemption is possible. Your girlfriend is someone who generally dislikes people untill they give her a reason to like them.\"\n\nShe likes to complain fairly frequently about people she doesn't like/things that aren't going well with the people she does like and overall has a fairly negative outlook on people that began to wear on me. Even though her complaints are valid (and most of the time, professional/academic issues), they still seem like she has unrealistic expectations of proven lazy/incompetent people.\n\nOne day, she complained about how she doesn't really have good friends (except for me) and that she doesn't understand why her \"friends\" don't prioritize or realize what's going wrong when she talks to them about it. I then broke and told her that her being so negative wears on me and that her having a \"holier than thou\" attitude just because she didn't tell anyone off today is part of the reason that she doesn't have many friends and not really any close ones. She then called me \"naive\" for \"seeing sunshine and fucking rainbows in everyone.\"\n\nThings have improved but I think about it a lot and am wondering if I am in fact, the asshole.",

      "description": "I haven’t talked to this person in quite a while so I’m not sure if she or her bf use Reddit. Because of this, I’m going to try to be as vague as possible while providing the important stuff still. Sorry for how long this is!\n\nLet’s call my friend Sarah. Sarah and I met in middle school when she transferred to our school. We were both black sheep of our class, and because of that we ended up connecting. I found out that her family situation wasn’t the best, so she moved in with my family and became a full fledge member. She went to holidays with us, my extended family treated her like another grand daughter/niece, etc. My parents paid for her doctors appointments, paid to put her through sports at school, and supported her completely. This wasn’t the first time my family had taken in a friend to live with us. We’ve had a few other local kids live with us before while their own families were going through shit, so this was natural for us. \n\nAround junior year, Sarah started to hang out with me less and less. My insecurities began to sky rocket. It’s hard when you have a friend living with you, and said friend goes out to party, the beach, to hang out, etc without ever inviting you. She ofc didn’t have to invite me every time, but it was getting to the point where she was more of my roommate than my friend. Because of the sport she was in, she became more popular whereas I was left just hanging around. Later this year I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression. I was struggling a lot and I wanted to force myself to go out more and I had hoped that Sarah would want to hang out and spend time with me so that I wouldn’t want to fall into depression pits. She didn’t want to though. I don’t blame her my shit of course, but I know if I had a friend who wasn’t doing hot, I’d try to make sure they’d okay and offer to spend at least some time with them.\n\nSarah ended up dating a guy about a year and a half later. This guy was...weird. It became a situation where she saw nothing and no one but him. She spent the night at his place a lot, did a lot of underage drinking, and all that stuff. Whatever. She never really introduced us and I thought it was because she was embarrassed of me. Remember, at this point we had lived together for about 5 years. She was like a sister to me. It hurt.\n\nThe longer things went on, the creepier he got. I remember at one point she was talking to me about how this guy wanted to try anal, but she didn’t want to. He got her drunk (she was 18/19 at the time) and convinced her to do it was she was incapacitated. I was worried. This is technically rape. She said no, and he got an underage girl drunk so that he could take advantage of her. I expressed my disgust but she said it was okay and that she was wrong about saying no initially. \n\nShortly after, Sarah’s boss mentions to my dad in passing that it’s weird that my dad would be cool with Sarah dating a much older guy, considering he’s like her daughter. We were confused. We thought he was 22. We know at the end of the day it’s her decision and my dad isn’t her dad actually, but we were worried. We asked her about it and she said he was 24. Then a few weeks later, she slipped up and said he was 26. I called her out on it and she admitted he was 30. She was 18/19. This paired up with the other shitty stuff he had done made him shape up to be a real slimy bastard. I hated him. The few times she brought him around, I avoided him like the plague. \n\nIt was Sarah’s birthday and she was in her room crying because she found out from a mutual friend that he had confessed to his friends that her “pussy smelled bad”. She was insecure as hell and for him to do that made it worse. so, I did what any good friend would do. I stole my dad’s car, got friends together, took her to the beach and had a good time. She was happy, laughing, and having fun. Afterward, we went back to a friends house down the street and started to bbq and have a few drinks. It was really fun. Sarah mentions she had to run home and grab something, so we go ahead and let her. An hour passes and food is done so I go looking for her. She’s in her room getting read to go meet with her bf. I asked about the bbq, and remind her that we did all this for her and she brushes us off. \n\nA few months later she moves in with him. I cut contact with her. She ends up having a kid with him and she’s been contacting me, and my family again. She wants me back in her life and her child’s life. I’ve ignored all attempts. I’m worried that she just wants me there so I can buy her kid shit and support her when her much older bf is a shit bag. \n\nAITA For ignoring her, and for ending the friendship? Was it my place to end it over here bf being shitty, or should I have ignored it all because it’s not \\*my\\* relationship? I’ve been feeling on and off bouts of guilt, especially whenever I see a pic of her kid in passing or hear about her dming my sister in hopes of getting in contact with me.",

      "description": "At the beginning of August I moved into a house with 2 other girls. One of them is my older sister (20), and the other is a girl I’d known since middle school who is the same age as me (18). I was never really good friends with this girl, but we became better friends in high school through mutual friends and would hang out every few months or so. One time we were hanging out and figured out we were both staying in our hometown for college, so we could probably live together. Her dad’s side of the family owns a business where they rent out houses, so he found us a house nearby and became our landlord, along with his wife. This was their first time being landlords because the company was owned by my friends grandparents. So everything started almost immediately after moving in. We had to pay $400 a month, and the landlords told our friend that she doesn’t have to pay rent. Then we buy groceries and this girl starts eating all of our food with out asking. She would have people over and I’d just catch all of them eating my chips and dip or some shit. A few weeks later she texted my sister and I saying she was thinking about getting a dog, both my sister and I told her it would be a lot of work and that we should probably talk about it more. She didn’t respond to our texts, and when we got home the dog was there. This dog chewed up my sisters couch, chewed multiple pairs of our shoes, shit in my room repeatedly, etc. I asked this girl to keep more of an eye on her dog, since most of the reason this is happening is her getting high and not caring about what the dog does. She responded so shitty, and continued to let her dog do whatever she wanted. She started having parties at the house, or having people over super late with out saying anything, and my room was right in the living room so anything that was happening could be heard in my room. There was more shit that went on that was similar to this, she let our cat out and he had to stay out there all night, was always disrespectful of our stuff, and trashed the house. This was so frustrating to me because she wasn’t even paying rent there. They were pretty shitty landlords too, I had multiple things I confronted them about a few times while I was there that never got fixed. AITA for breaking my lease and moving out? ",

      "description": "AITA for leaving her when she reacts how I expect her to? I don't think she's psycho but her violent outbursts are frequent and unhinged over trivial things. Except this morning when I told her that I had sold some tree to a female (roommate was there to witness no sketch) and that I just hadn't wanted to tell her right away because of how she gets, well, the violence was almost a self fulfilled prophecy.  She didnt wait to get more details or really have any thought process at all, just immediate violence. So I called her psycho, which I shouldn't have done in the heat of the moment, and it got even more intense. But I expected her to be that way, so I delayed telling her, kinda cowardly, which in the end made it even worse, so, I kinda feel like an asshole and got what was coming to me. But I don't want to stay involved with her when she can't control her violent temper, control issues or paranoia/rage. I'm 25[M] and definitely don't want to wait optimistically for another 4 years to see if she gets a grip and stops hitting me. AITA for making it worse and/or finally giving up on her?",

They were watching me play for a good thirty minutes. Then they all go \"hey can you pause the game? We wanna go get drinks.\"\n\nSo I gladly paused the game and waited on them, leaving my door open so I didn't lock it on reflex.\n\nAn hour passes.\n\nI go to the other room to see what they're doing, and they're playing on their own tablets and watching TV. So I thought that they weren't interested anymore so I went back to my room, locked the door, and continued playing.\n\nLiterally three more hours later after dinner, one of my brothers knocked on my door saying \"we're done, can we come back in?\" He heard that I was playing the game and started saying stuff like \"why didn't you pause the game?!\"\n\nOf course I didn't let him or the other kids in because I knew they'd just leave me hanging again.\n\nSummary: AITA for kicking my brothers and cousins out of my room because they made me pause the game for an hour and then not letting them back in three hours later?\n\nInfo: my brothers and cousins are in the 7-10 range, I'm 15, and the game I was playing was Punch Out!!

Obviously I don't externalize my frustrations and I try to listen and help them the best I could but I just can't help but feeling like getting out the conversation as soon as I possibly can. Maybe its because I never open up to my friends so I don't feel like they should open up to me? I don't know. It just feels bad because I feel like its making me not help them or hear them out properly because I don't even want to in the first place\n\nAn example of this is literally just a few minutes ago, a close friend of mine messaged me out of nowhere while I was watching a show (The Sopranos, great fucking show) talking about how down she was that her partner broke up with her and how this is exacerbating her depression all I could think was why the fuck was this happening now of all times when I'm comfy as hell and the show is getting heated. Another example is every time me and my friends would drink, whenever someone gets sad alcohol sad and cries about things I usually go talk to them and try to hear them out but I just cant shake off the thought of \"why the fuck are you doing this now, drinking is supposed to be a happy thing, I'm in a good mood, why the fuck are you killing the vibe god fucking damn\"",

      "description": "I'm 23, and live in an inner-town apartment paying $250 per week rent. I only earn $35,000 a year so this is a pretty significant expenditure for me, but for various reasons it's wholly worth it.\n\nMy parents live approximately 1 hour away via public transport (I don't own a car unfortunately).\n\nDuring dinner at my parent's home a few nights ago they casually mentioned that they were going to be going on a six-week holiday soon (to visit relatives in another country). They have a small dog at home, so I asked them what they were going to do about it. This is when my dad says \"well you'll look after it of course\". I queried further how I was supposed to do that which is when I was met with a blank stare and the words \"you're obviously moving back home while we're gone\".\n\nAt this point I made the mistake of laughing and asking \"so who's going to pay my rent?\".\n\nThis started one of the biggest arguments i've ever had with my parents. In their view, they had expected me to move back to their home (whilst still paying rent for my empty apartment), with the added downside of now having to tack on at least an hour in commute every day, as a \"thank you\" to them for being my parents. This involved an argument of how they provided for me for x amount of years and \"gave me everything\" (untrue, I've been financially independent since I was old enough to work) and how me expecting them to \"pay me for helping them\" was disrespectful and sickening to them.\n\nI tried explaining that i'd basically be throwing $1,500 at a wall for 6 weeks of doing them a 'favour' whilst they were on holiday, and how that seemed somewhat unreasonable unless they potentially agreed to at least contribute to my rent payments whilst I wasn't at my own home.\n\nThis argument was met with \"but we pay a mortgage too, and we won't be home so it's the same thing\".\n\nI tried explaining how it was more about the fact that i'd be involuntarily exempting myself from a service I pay a  significant amount of money for, on the sole premise of \"helping them\".\n\nThis argument was met with \"we help you with everything and now you expect us to pay you when we ask for help\".\n\nI told them I would be happy to help in a reasonable manner but at the end of the day this would be a significant burden on me monetarily and livelihood wise, to which I was reprimanded for \"trying to do business with your own flesh and blood\".\n\nIt boiled down to them making the argument that it makes no difference where I live, i'll be paying rent regardless.\n\nI eventually gave up as they were getting more and more indignant and seemingly oblivious to my point of view. We now haven't spoken in several days following a few sarcastic quips from my dad asking me if I was going to pay him for drinking a glass of water because \"that's what (I) do\".\n\nAre they right? Should I move to their home to housesit and look after the dog whilst still paying rent for my place?",

He later confirmed to me that they really had sex. \n\nI'm not exactly religious, but he knows I have principles, and that I don't associate with cheaters is one of them, so I told him he could fuck right off.

      "description": "This is a really hectic one so forgive me if I ramble folks. I'm in my first year of college and since I've started I've made a great group of 6 friends (myself included) three lads and three girls. \n\nWhen I started college I was in a relationship and became good friends in particular with one of the girls who we'll call Trish for the sake of the post. My relationship with my ex ended at the start of February and since then me and Trish have gotten really close, and I eventually became pretty attracted to her. Naturally the people in my group started joking about it and all that and I assumed she felt the same way about me.\n\nHowever one day one of the lads told me that after talking with her she apparently did have feelings before but we're too close now, which I naturally took as a polite friend zone. I still kinda kept my hopes up but stopped looking to pursue. \n\nIt all came to a head last week when both me and her were out on the same night. I met her in the bar and said hello and all that but she seemed very content with her friends and wouldn't come sit with me so I thought that's grand and let her go. I eventually met another girl that night and went back to her's for the night. Trish also met another fella and had some fun with him.\n\nI found out about Trish and her fella the next morning and was fine with it, but when she found out later that evening that I had went home with the girl the night before she immediately changed her tone and became really off with me, and has been that way ever since.\n\nI've since really hit it off with the girl and I'm meant to have a date with her again tomorrow but Trish just messaged me tonight saying I've broke her heart and is really giving me the whole nine yards about how I'm a dick and this and that which I'm worried will ruin our friendship and the group of 6 which to be honest is the only reason I go to college.\n\nI'm really stuck between a rock and a hard place here and I'm not sure if I've done the right thing here. Being a decent lad is my whole thing and I think now no matter what I do someone is gonna get hurt. Am I the asshole here? Or have I just gotten unlucky?\n\n",

Also, typing this up for my mom because she doesn’t want a reddit account.)\n\nMy brother (46) and I (44F) grew up poor and our dad died when we were quite young. I ended up marrying a well off guy 27 years ago, and we built a good  size house in a lovely neighborhood with a guest room and a pool. \n\nMy brother went to college and became a police officer - now a Captain. He married a fellow Captain and they have 3 children. While he was at the Academy  he lived with us for the whole period even though at the time we lived in a small apartment. I didn’t mind then, and was glad to help.\n\nNowadays he lives in a small town while I live in a big city. Sometimes he has to come here for work and he will stay at our house to save the money he gets from the police department for housing. \n\nFor years I’ve been glad to do it, but this year he has to come with his wife as they both took a week long shift for the extra money and he asked to stay here. Thing is, I’ll be traveling and I really wanted our house to remain closed. I spent weeks having it cleaned and now he is going to come and mess it up. It also racks up the bills a bit. \n\nSo I really want to tell him no, not to come and get a hotel somewhere else. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: i spent years letting my brother (and his family) stay at my house for various reasons and now I don’t want to anymore.\n\n",

      "description": "I am 20F and my sister is 23F. She has been using hard drugs since she was 14, and got pregnant when she was 17 as a high school dropout. When I was in high school, I watched my niece whenever my sister went to work (30 hours/week + whenever she went out) for $20 a week. This worked out to $0.50-$1/hour for infant care. Fast forward a year into this arrangement and I was completely burnt out. When I brought up that I either A) wanted more than $20 for the babysitting a week or B) wasn’t going to do it anymore, my entire family freaked out at me that I was being selfish and greedy. My mom (who I did not live with) ended up blocking my phone and social media as a result of this and wouldn’t speak with me for months.\n\nAt this point my sister decided to move out, leaving her daughter with my dad and I. This meant I was now watching my niece from when I got home from school to when I would go to school again the next day. My sister was very absent during this time. \n\nWhen I was a senior in high school, she started to get more involved in our lives again. Unfortunately, she was still dealing with her addiction. Long story short, she took my niece and put her in an incredibly dangerous situation that ended up putting her into the CPS system. My niece has since been fostered and now adopted by a different and much better family, so none of us has any visitation rights anymore.\n\nAfter losing her daughter, my sister spiraled even more out of control. 3 wrecked cars, countless charges for possession, stealing, child endangerment, etc. At one point before I moved for college she had punched me in the face for refusing to give her a ride when I had gotten fed up with her. Anytime she called me in the past 3 years (from graduating high school to a current university student) was to beg me for money. When I stopped doing this, she would curse me out and I would get the cold shoulder from my mom who supports/enables her. My mom even paid the bill for her to go to a Rehab facility for 4 months, which of course didn’t change anything. She got right back into her bad habits straight away when she returned.\n\nNow fast forward to today. She is in jail now (for the 4th time) and has been trying to call me every couple of days. This time no one is going to post her bail. My mom and other siblings are rallying together saying that this is our chance to “bring her back into the family fold” and that we should all write her letters and call. I have not answered any of her calls or written anything as I honestly feel a lot of resentment. Looking back, I feel that I had been manipulated and taken advantage of for years by her, yet my mother and other siblings defend her no matter what she does. I’m conflicted because she’s family, though. \n\nAITA for ignoring her calls and wanting to cut her out of my life?",

He works from 3-7:30 so I was supposed to pick him up from work then take him home with me like we always do when he sleeps over. \n\nWe had spent the morning together and he took me to my doctors appointment because I needed someone to drive because anesthesia was involved. Unfortunately the appointment ran over a bit and he was slightly late for work. This was the first time hes ever been late because of me. As far as I knew our plans were still on for that night when he went to work.\n\nFast forward to about 7 and I show up at his work to pick him up. Just so you know, his work isnt around the corner from my house. It's 30 minutes away. He asks me why I came and says that he in fact does not want to sleep over because he has an early day tomorrow and does not want to risk being late for work again (he knew about the early day beforehand and it wasnt a problem then). He tells me not to get upset but I do and walk out. \n\nHere's my issue: I'm mostly upset that he did not tell me before I drove all the way there that our plans were off. I know that he had hours to send me a quick text but chose not to. This has happened several times before where he fails to tell me something's off and bails at the last second. He then acts like I dont deserve to be upset about my wasted time and gas. \n\nSecond, I had absolutely no control over when my doctors appointment ended and hes never been late strictly because of me. I've always gotten him home on time. So him saying he doesnt want to spend the night was offensive to me. \n\nAm I an asshole for being upset with him? ",

      "description": "Alright, so this happened some months ago, basically i was going through a phase of \"Hookup culture\" to the extreme. And i had commitment issues, things have changed since then, etc. However, in order to get to the point. Basically, im a 20m met with a girl F19, and we started dating, we liked eachother and we sort of clicked. We had many similar ambitions, way of thought and comedy taste. However, i wanted it to be strict FWB, mostly because i didnt have time for a relationship and i just wanted casual sex. Now, looking back at it \\[I didnt realise it at the time\\]  she looked hesitant, but she said , Alright, and okay.  Now her 20th birthday was coming up, and she was gonna host a party at her house, she is mostly upper middle class, and her family has a comfy home and backyard to say the least, so there would be a lot of people attending, when i mean a lot, i say roughly 30-40 drunk teenagers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically, she invited me to it, and i ended up sleeping with a girl there, i was half drunk and i didnt think of the consequenses. After, i brought the girl down and my FWB started arguing with me and cussing me out, crying etc, so she literally kicked me out and i had to go, i didnt want to cause a big trouble so i took the most easy solution and went away.  \n\nApperantly, from her friend, she had given me cues and had some feelings for me, and i found out that i slept with a friend of her, \\[Did not know at the time\\]  i mean the reason why im asking, is because i feel bad for doing it on her birthday party, while the other half thinks that it wasnt my fault due to us being FWB. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am i the asshole here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I host dinner for 6-8 of my friends  every 1-2 weeks. This has been going on since January. I 100% don't mind eating the cost of it, because I want to do something nice for my friends.\n\nBut I feel like one friend, Danny, takes advantage of it. Everyone else usually brings something to share - maybe a salad, dessert, wine, etc. Or I'll sometimes get asked if there is something specific they could bring. \n\nDanny has brought a 22 oz beer and a 6 pack to share. There was one time I asked him to bring tequila, but he got out of work late and didn't have time to go to the store. Another time I forgot to get limes and asked if he could pick some up. He forgot, too. My boyfriend went to get them ultimately. He has also ever messaged me to ask if there's anything he could bring. \n\nI don't mind hosting. But I feel like Danny is being an inconsiderate friend. His salary is almost x3 of mine (he knows this) so I think he should be more cognizant that I'm footing the bill to feed my friends and should be more considerate when bringing things to share. (Like, c'mon 22oz beer for 6 people?)\n\nI want to uninvite him and tell him the reason.  My boyfriend doesn't think I should in the spirit of why I decided to start doing this: to see my friends more often. I do still see him as a friend, but I guess seeing his lack of consideration for his own friends make me want to reassess my relationship with him. Do I want to care about and be generous to someone who clearly does not reciprocate?\n\nWIBTA if I uninvited him on the account that he's a stingy guest?",

      "description": "So this is not the first time this happened to me, but basically I talked to this girl online for about 7-8 months as a friend, but we both kinda knew that there is something more going on between us, i.e. we talk every day, both of us agreed to not be looking for a partner because we're happy just talking together. She even invited me as her partner for her graduation party in February, so that must mean something atleast right?! Anway fast forward I was supposed to meet her these winter holidays (around new years eve) for the first time, so I asked her what we're gonna do about that unspoken thing when we meet. Well, her reply was \"Unspoken thing? I just see you as a really good friend\". Obviously I was shocked and wondered if I'm just that naive and she was just being nice this whole time or if she is lying to me and something happened, but I said fine I'll go anyway to see her because yes she helped me when I felt down and had mental issues so, can't just ditch her because of that. Fast forward again to today- about a week later, we're having a conversation about the first meeting and stuff, and she asked me if I would still come if she \"hypothetically\" had a boyfriend. I said no, that would just be weird and awkward for both of us since I'm staying at her and her parents place for a few days right. Well, turns out she was in a relationship for a little bit, and thought I would just tell her to frig off right away if she didn't hide it from me. So  then she asks me \"So is that a no then? I still would like to see you because you mean a lot to me\". \n\nI've been single for my whole life and every time it's this scenario where I am in the first place and then the Blue Shell just comes for me and puts me right back in my place when I'm about to cross the finish line. I thought this time it would be different but I guess no, so that means something needs to change. And the only way to change something is to stop trying to please every side and tell her no because I'm simply not interested in yet another friendship in which I'll be the backup shoulder to cry on. Is it an asshole thing to do that, or am I justified after all the embaracement and disappointment I've been through. I just don't get that logic of not being with someone you like more just because he is too far away or you don't want to lose them, and instead choosing someone else. \n\ntl,dr: talked to her online for some time, there was something going on between us, now revealed to me that she was in a relationship but still wants me to visit her and be her partner for a graduation party.",

      "title": "AITA for cutting off my autistic friend?",
      "description": "So I have this one friend that I met in elementary school. I'm 19 and she's 20. I remember she was bullied a lot and I felt really bad for her so I decided to befriend her at the time. We got along fine except she acted a little strange sometimes. I found out later she was on the spectrum (high functioning autism). We weren't super close (never really hung out) but we messaged each other on MSN and talked on the phone.\n\nWe went to different middle and high schools, plus I moved to the other side of the country so we lost touch. Last year I found her fb and added her, and then she messaged me and we were just catching up, just small talk, then she suddenly dropped all her family troubles on me. I was sympathetic and was there to listen. Every week she would message me about something new concerning her family. She would also send multiple text messages at a time (like 15) and continue messaging me even if I hadn't had a chance to message back yet. I thought it was a little weird but I let it slide, esp because of her autism.\n\nSuddenly last summer she messaged me about wanting to visit my city and visit me as well since we hadn't seen each other in a while. I was kinda iffy about it in the beginning cause it was really sudden but she was reallyyy persistent. I eventually agreed and she decided to visit me during the winter break right after Christmas for a week.\n\nNow when she came, that's when I realized we were really incompatible as friends. There were a lot of things about her that worked my nerves and she has a lot of strange quirks (which I assume is due to the autism). For example she would expect me and my family to wait on her. She never even did as much as take her dirty plates to the sink. Never helped out with anything. She asked my 10 yr old sister to make her breakfast once. She also had this really weird habit of going outside in the middle of the damn night and just walking outside (knowing damn well she didn't know any part of my neighbourhood). Usually I wouldn't really care, since she's a grown person but it was literally -40 celsius outside then (I live in Canada it's cold af here). I would tell her that she should take her plates back, how to make her own breakfast, that’s its not a good idea to go outside in such cold weather but she basically just did what she wanted.\n\nShe would also act really needy all the time and I felt like I always had to entertain her, which was annoying for me considering she essentially invited herself. I didn't mind touring her around the city but she wanted to go outside ALL the time (which is why she would walk around in the middle of the night). She also acted selfish and inconsiderate at times, for example she had us take an entire walk around downtown on one of the coldest days of the week, and I ended up getting mild frostbite on my fingers. She didn't really care much and still wanted to walk around. Having her around was like having a young kid around. There was no way I could introduce her to any of my other friends cause they wouldn't get along AT ALL. She acted like a 5 year old. Even my little sister was more mature.\n\nThere came a point where I was really annoyed to have her at my place. I couldn't wait for her to leave. I'm the type of person that hates excessive clinginess and neediness so I couldn't stand it any longer. My family started to get annoyed by her as well. \n\nSo when she went back home I decided there's really no way we could continue being friends. She's been trying to message me lately (she said before she went back that she wanted to visit my city again in the summer) and I ignored her calls and texts and eventually blocked her. I know it was rude to block her but I couldn’t deal with it anymore. I feel like she was expecting me to be someone I couldn’t. I’m not her mom.\n\nAITA? ",

I have no idea what influence it has on him tbh, but he seemed pretty normal (except for being quite quiet) so I never treated him differently.\n\nSo I saw the open spot, put my stuff there and installed myself. About 20 minutes later the co-worker arrived and saw me at \"his\" place.

Then some of the people in around us accused me of being insensitive and that I should have given that place because he's autistic and can't go well with \"changes\".

The irony is the wife is really bothered by any mould spots on the ceiling paint so my job is to prevent it. So.... AITA for making my wife shower with the window open to let the steam out as its made to prevent mould, if it makes her cold? Personally it doesnt affect me as I get really hot from the water and then if its cold as I get dry I manage until I leave and then get dressed elsewhere.

      "description": "First time posting on this sub so I apologize in advance for the format (also using my phone to type this) TL;DR at the bottom\n\nFor some background information, I'm going into design school (yes, yes, suffering art student with no job in the future, I've heard it all). My friends all say I draw extremely well and hold high standards to my artistic abilities. I've been homing my skills for years now, so I've recently decided to try commissioning for some friends and classmates (I usually charge $20 or more depending on the size and type of work I'm doing). I've even managed to land myself a commision to design a logo for an undisclosed sports centre.\n\nMy friend, let's call him Jim. He's recently gotten into DnD, and has homebrewed an avatar bear. You read that correctly. An avatar bear. As in a badass bear who controls the elements. He's asked me to design and create a piece of this said bear. When I asked if I was going to be paid, he immediately said no, as I was \"only making some stupid bear.\" Stupid you say? I'll show you stupid.\n\nI half assed this mutant thing of a bear in about a minute and sent him a picture of it. The only thing he's sent so far is \"that's not what I asked for.\"\n\nYes but if you want me to spend time and effort on your bear, at least pay me a reasonable amount. I don't even care if its $10. You're my friend so you can pay me $5 for all I care. But for the love of god, I'm not wasting hours of my life drawing some bear for free. I have school work too and a university portfolio to finish. Please don't take advantage of me and make me draw some bear for free just because we're friends.\n\nTL;DR my friend wanted me to do a commission for free because we're friends so I drew the ugliest thing ever and sent it to him.\n\nAITA for deliberately drawing terribly because I'm not getting paid to do it?\n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway because I know people who actively use reddit. \nTLDR at bottom\n\nI recently left a job that I didn't like very much, but definitely needed, for another really great job with better pay. Throughout the 3 interview process, I was repeatedly told they would work with my daily 8 to 5 availability, so I took the opportunity. I won't go into too much detail but basically this was crap, and they wanted me to stay until 730 pm 3 nights a week. I can't because my one year old's daycare closes at 6 and my husband's job is 10 to 7 m-f. His boss was unable to accomadate him as well. I know, I know, hire a sitter right? Different topic for a different day but feel free to ask in comments. Anyway I resigned Monday. I was heartbroken because the first 2 weeks went so great, I fit right in and had never felt so confident or good about myself in my life. The past 2 days I have been rejected by 7 different places, 2 via phone call. I feel so low. And honestly have been crying on and off today. I am so stressed, I need to find a job asap. \n\nNow fast forward to tonight. \n\nMy husband came home earlier. He brought food but I don't have an appetite. He asked if I wasn't going to eat and I quietly said I wasn't hungry. Then he said \"so, what, you're just gonna sit around feeling sorry for yourself?\"\n\nInitially I was just shocked. It wasn't just what he said but how he said it. Now I am just trying to keep myself from exploding. \n\nAITA for taking a day to just cry about an amazing opportunity I lost, plus all of the rejection I have been hit with?\n\nTLDR had to give up an amazing opportunity after leaving the only stable job I had for it. Been facing rejection from several workplaces the past 2 days. Sat around today and cried, also didn't have an appetite. Husband told me I was feeling sorry for myself. ",

He told his Dnd group we were doing this and one of them decided to drive herself and her brother down as well. Ill be honest, I'm not exactly happy they are here. They have sucked up every ounce of his attention. Not to his fault, that's just the type of people they are. If they weren't hanging him ALL DAY, I wouldnt have a problem with it. I just feel like they have hijacked our plans.\n\nI do enjoy conventions but being around a mass number of people for long times makes me really anxious and I get kinda clingy. He knows this and takes it in stride. He does extremely well when we go out and I start to get anxious. He distracts me and makes me laugh and I calm down. He is essentially and effectively a security blanket. But he couldn't do that with his friends taking all his attention. \n\nSo I got overly stressed and tried to tell him I was gonna go back to the hotel 3 times. But everytime I tried I was interrupted(it has been happening all day) So I gave up and just left. I texted him to let him know. However texts seem to be slow. He hasn't sent one back yet. Knowing him he won't show if he's upset with me. I did apologize in my text and will explain myself better if he asks. \n\nI just want to know if leaving how I did, makes me an asshole.",

      "description": "I just bought a small one-page PDF (a game about character design) for $1 that was published today. I had high hopes but it fell very short. I wanted to write a review on its' social media page because I felt that other buyers could benefit from a warning.\n\nI didn't want to rant on the page so soon after release, so I messaged the author and asked if it was okay to do so. They wanted to see it privately first:\n\n&gt;*Just bought this and read through it.*\n\n&gt;*I’m quite confused as to what the purpose of this game is. *\n\n&gt;*It seems like the purpose is a round-table creative experience where each person is prompted to come up with a very basic character through the lens of grief and emergency triage, but at no point do you participate in the creative process of another person and it ends up being just a series of individual experiences. What was the intended experience when this was designed?*\n\n&gt;*I liked the aesthetics and theming, loss in transhumanist contexts where the rules don’t line up with the real-world human condition is very near and dear to my heart - but this was a very thin vertical slice of something I would have liked to have seen more of. Why are AI treated like objects? Why is there only time to save so little when falling into an atmosphere takes a long while? What exactly is a “[phrase]” and why is it never referred to or mentioned again? You are given a jumbled grab-bag of sci-fi concepts that don’t relate to each other very much and asked to make concrete out of smoke.*\n\n&gt;*Overall, I would not pay a dollar for this - but I would definitely pay far more for something deeper and more defined, such as a short story with these sort of themes. [Product] as it is now is far too shallow and undefined for me to like it.*\n\nTheir response:  \n&gt;*You seem to be taking a lot of the concepts inside the game with a mix of literal and figurative seriousness that makes this critique go all over the place.*\n\n&gt;*[phrase] is a pretty term for what’s happening [in the game]. It also makes the title there spell [acronym]. This is at the peak of the Character’s arc. the timing is dramatic, not literal, as in almost every narrative.*\n\n&gt;*Humans treat AI like objects every day, so I’m not sure why that stands out. It’s part of the disconnect between technology and humanity, which is central to [the genre] as a whole.* \n\n&gt;*It’s not meant to be more defined, because it’s a jam game made in a very short time period that is available for a single dollar, despite the fact that’s underselling my work considerably. *\n\n&gt;*I did take the time to answer this despite you just following me [on social media] seconds ago, so keep in mind that I’ve been a gamedev for about 4 years professionally and I do know what I’m doing.*\n\nTheir response seems hostile and condescending. I don't care at all about the dollar I spent, but the author's response has thrown me off-balance. AITA?",

We have known for years but it's not something that we talk about in my family because my brother is embarrassed of it in a way. He is EXTREMELY smart and always has been. He excels in math and physics and everything in between. He is going to college and taking hard classes that he does well in. Lately, he has been depressed. More than depressed. A couple of months ago, he tried to take his own life by getting drunk and swallowing a bottle of acetaminophen. He and I are extremely close and he only talks to me. He called me in a panic hours after doing this and I took him to the hospital. He went to outpatient treatment after getting discharged from inpatient. The nurse had called me and asked if my brother was diagnosed with autism ever because he shows some clear signs. I talked to my brother about it today and he is still somewhat denying that he has autism.\n\nMy brother loves me to death and I love him just as much. He has always looked up to me. I can't imagine a world without him. He loves how much more alike we get as we get older. He constantly says it with a big smile on his face. I have tried to talk to him about his autism and how he shouldn't be ashamed and he should own that about himself because some people don't even realize he has bad communication skills and he's so damn smart. Occasionally, his bad communication skills are very apparent and his disorder is obvious in other ways as well. I try to tell him that people say Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs have Aspberger's but it doesn't do much for him when I say that. I feel if I tell my brother I have Aspberger's as well he would learn to love it and not deny it anymore, possibly helping himself.\n\nWould I be an asshole if I live a lie for the rest of my life to make my brother feel he's not alone and possibly help him move forward in life?",

      "description": "This happened a little over two years ago, but I still think about it wondering if I was the asshole a lot because it ended our friendship.  I'm posting here to either get peace of mind knowing I was in the right or grow from past selfish behavior.  I've asked people over the years, but they are obviously biased towards me since they know me personally.\n\nA couple years back, my friend was offered a supervisory for an all-day event, let's say an art fair.  The duties required being there or the entire day, hiring workers, and picking up and dropping off the supplies.  He would receive a $100 bonus for both picking up and dropping off the supplies for a total of $200.  \n\nHe hired me to work the event which was fine, but because he didn't have a car, he asked me to drive him to pick up and drop off the supplies.  I told him sure, but I requested half of what he would make since the only reason he would be able to earn the $200 bonus was with my help.  He told me no so I offered to let him borrow my car instead or negotiate down to a smaller fraction.  He got very angry because I knew he did not like to drive in the city, and I wasn't willing to drive him without compensation.\n\nHe tried to emphasize that he wouldn't be able to do it without me, and I told him that if he knew he was unable to fulfill the duties, he should have recommended me for it instead.  His argument was that it was selfish of me to demand his money  This, however, would have taken at least two hours of my time total, and I felt I was being taken advantage of given he wouldn't even offer gas money.",

      "title": "AITA For cancelling my daughter's visit with her Dad?",
      "description": "A little background. Ex, \"James\", and I split when daughter was 1.5 months old, 8 months now. Typical shenanigans you'd expect when a woman boots out the father of her kid when their child is so young. Cheating, lying, slacking on financial/household/personal responsibilities and verbal abuse. The Beatles lied, love is not all you need. \n\n\nSo he was a terrible partner, but a pretty loving, attentive father. So I focus on that, how he is as a father. \n\n\nAnyway, he wants her, he's good with her &amp; he loves her. However, his visits &amp; effort revolve around his work (naturally) and his social life. Until 3 weeks ago, he only had her 1 day/wk for a few hours. His choice, not mine. He always had excuses as to why he couldn't take her more often, some valid, most not. \n\n\nHe typically goes out drinking the night before he has her. Hes usually 1 or 2 hours  late, some weeks he cancels last minute &amp; 2x not come at all.  That's ONE night a week to not go party. We agreed on half of daughter's direct major (not all) expenses for CS and he's usually late. He tells me he doesnt have any money, but then I hear abt him out at the bar. \n\n\nRecently, I lost my job. Hes been taking her 2-3x/wk so that I can focus on the job hunt. He was doing so good, but then yesterday he cancelled bc he wasnt feeling good. Ok, creates some extra work for me to find a sitter, but again hes been doing so good, so I dont give him a hard time.\n\n\nHere's the AITA situation. At 10am, we confirmed drop off at 11. He wanted 11:30 for more sleep (gets off at 10pm), I had an interview so it really needed to be 11. He ok's it. Ends up being 11:30 anyway bc LO wanted a bottle. now I'm running late, but not his fault. I called him otw over there, figure he could get that extra sleep he wanted. No answer to 2 out of 3 calls. One was a pickup with silence. I had my mom on standby in case James flaked. I get there, knock, wait over 5 minutes (yes I was watching) for him to answer the door. Then hes leisurely putting his clothes on, hes gotta go to the bathroom, expected me to unload daughter, her stuff from the car &amp; several boxes I brought for him (a little of his stuff, some stuff I was getting rid of anyway that he said he could use while he leisurely sets up her bouncer instead of helping me unload the car like I asked.\n\n\n I'm late. For an *interview*. And he cant pick up his feet?  I get pissed bc once again everything is about him, his convience &amp; comfort, at my expense. Its 11:45 and daughter is still in the car, so I tell him you know I'm running late, you're dragging your feet so I'll just get my mom to watch her. And leave. \n\nAITA for cancelling that visit?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Ok, so some background. I'm a chocolatier that's currently working part time while completing my studies whilst living with my parents to save money in order to have a solid foundation when I move out, and I consider myself a pretty heavy phone user. Pictures, games, reading... I pretty much do it all on my phone + computer for anything heavier. But my current Snapdragon 820 android phone has been getting really slow and the 32gb of memory has been driving me nuts. So I've been looking to buy a new phone for quite a while.\n\nSo my dad asks me what I want for Christmas, and I tell him I'm trying to get a new phone. But I before he walks away I tell him he doesn't need to do anything because mom already said she'd help me foot half the bill for a brand new unlocked phone - half from her, half from relatives and the rest from me. That's where the problems start.\n\nThe problem is, my mom just told me that my dad got scammed on the Facebook marketplace out of $100 while trying to buy something. When my mom confronts him and asks what he was trying to buy, he says it's a phone. That he wanted to give to me for Christmas.\n\nNow I appreciate the gesture, and it's nice that he went out of his way, but it's just a little infuriating to me. I already specifically told him I wanted to get a better phone (like a OnePlus or Galaxy at least) and I thought I made it clear that j was willing to foot the entire bill and not just half of it if it meant I could get the latest and greatest. \n\nBut according to my mom, his reasoning is that \"it's just a phone, he just needs something that works\", and he got defensive and started arguing with my mom after that.\n\nAITA for wishing he'd stop wasting money on what he thinks is the right course of action (because I'd never use the phone) and not just appreciating what he gave me?",

      "description": "Just some backstory here. I am currently living at my girlfriend's mum's house as a temporary arrangement due to undergoing spinal surgery in November 2018, as the shower and other facilities are easier for me to use due to my immobility. \n\nI purchased a pack of rather expensive Tesco's Finest Ham Off the Bone yesterday, in which you get four slices per pack. These are for my dinner to take to work as I work shifts.\n\nToday, I was sat in the living room watching the football, when my girlfriend's Auntie walked in the house to take herself and her Mum out for clothes shopping. This was around 3:15pm in the afternoon. As her Auntie walked into the kitchen, she said she was hungry and hadn't had anything to eat. My girlfriend's Mum then offered her some snacks, or to make a sandwich for her. My girlfriend's Mum then opened the fridge, looked inside for sandwich filler and informed the Auntie that there was some ham. As it happened, there were two packs of ham. One had around 12 slices in, was a bit thinner than the ham I purchased but was by no means cheap and nasty. \n\nNow, when the Auntie looked at both packs of ham, she decided that she wanted the pack which I had bought, which contained only four slices, was expensive (£4.00) and was for work. The Mum then explained that the ham belonged to me, but that she's sure I wouldn't mind if she ate it. At this point, I explained that the ham was actually for my dinner at work and only has four slices in, which in fact aren't even large slices. They would be sufficient for one sandwich, as they are like bacon medallions but smaller. \n\nI said it was quite expensive as ham goes, and that I bought them for work. I then said what is wrong with the other ham? The silence was deafening. I went to sit back down in the living room, and my girlfriend came in to state how \"rude, selfish and ungrateful\" I am. I was incredibly surprised by this as my girlfriend in the past has actually made comment on how ill mannered and cheeky her Auntie can be when in someone else's house as a guest. \n\nThis has now caused a rift, and I am now feeling ostracised and out of place, and to make matters worse, my girlfriend was supposed to be taking me out for a birthday meal tonight. But that has been cancelled, on her part. I'm in genuine shock.",

I know not everybody struggles with an early-ish loss, but it tore me apart.\n\nMy niece was born a few months later. I told my brother and sister in law what happened (even though I really didnt want to) and explained that right now being around babies under the age of one is really hard for me and I was going to need to distance myself for the sake of my mental health.\n\nWhen she was born I didnt go to the hospital to meet her. I did go to a bbq for her a few weeks later, but didnt hold her. It's not just her, I didnt hold any baby under the age of one until after my son was born. It was just too painful and would leave me crying when I got home.\n\nMy SIL texted me getting super pissed saying that she doesnt understand why I wont hold my niece. I explained to her again why it was so painful to be around babies at this time. And she repeatedly responded with, \"well I'm sorry but I just dont get it\".\n\nI told her that her refusing to understand hurts me and that my mental health needed to come first. She continued to get mad so now I have very minimal interaction with her.\n\nSo AITA for not being able to hold my niece when it was so painful to do so even though I very thoroughly explained to them why I couldn't bring myself to do it?",

      "description": "AITA for just wanting to enjoy my vacation?\n\nMy boyfriend and I rented a cabin for a weekend several hours from home. When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. ",

My wife rather quickly learned that she was the type of friend that replied of her (rather than her own wife) for emotional support and was... damaged in such a way that my wife had to be careful of what she said around her, as she would take offense at things that weren’t mean to offend. \nEventually, whilst drunk, she admitted to my wife that she was in love with my wife. At this point, my wife told her that wasn’t appropriate, that she should talk to her own wife about this, and that they shouldn’t remain friends or talk. She then completely cut her off. Email, text, phone calls, everything. \nYeah. It was a little brutal, but I guess I kinda get it. \n\nBut it’s been 6 months. And she’s still trying to call, and actually showed up at our house once, but left before ringing the bell or knocking. She called three times in a row this night and I answered the third time after declining the first two and told her we were considering a restraining order and would go through with it if this continued. \n\nAITA for that?

      "description": " So I’m gonna try to keep this as short and sweet as I can without leaving out key details. \n\nSo I’ve been with my boyfriend for more than a year  and things have been pretty good besides your typical ups and downs of a relationship. Overall he’s a great guy, and I love him dearly. But I HATE going to visit him at his house. It’s not that his house isn’t clean, or that it’s too small or anything. It’s simply because I don’t feel welcomed there. \n\nI know you’re probably thinking “how do you not feel welcome in your boyfriends house!?” Especially after three years. Well here are a few key details: I’m never allowed to just be there freely. I always have to sneak in and out and make sure that I’m not seen by anyone coming in or going out. I can’t be there while his parents are home either. \n\nIt leads me to believe that his parents simply may not like me (why I have zero clue). He constantly assures me that it’s fine that I come over when clearly it’s not. He fails to understand that if I ever get caught in his house unbeknownst to his parents that IM THE ONE that’s going to be judged and looked at in a negative light. \n\nAfter this passed year of sneaking in and out, at times having to basically bolt out of his house to avoid being spotted by a family member, I finally grew tired. I told him, probably super aggressively that I’m never coming back to his house until I’m welcomed. \n\nI just feel like I’m too old to have to sneak in and out of my mans home, especially when I live alone and there are other options. I understand that sometimes he doesn’t want to always have to drive to my house, but I don’t feel like I should have to be forced to be somewhere I’m not comfortable. \n\nAITA for refusing to go back until I’m formally welcomed into his home?",

      "title": "AITA for going ballistic on my friend after getting sick of her attitude if she was also being abused?",
      "description": "Sorry if my side is a little long. I'll split it up so it's not just a huge wall of text. A while back, I had this really good friend. Let's call her Sydney. Sydney and I were inseparable for about two years, but over that time, Sydney treated me, and everyone else, pretty poorly. I didn't realize how emotionally and mentally abusive she was acting towards me until I separated myself from her and my day to day mood and overall self-esteem practically instantly improved. Before that, I just kept taking her shit and forgiving her or believing her when she blamed everyone else. I can't explain everything Sydney did, for obvious reasons, but here are some of the things I can remember off the top of my head to help understand her general attitude. \n\nShe made me (and many of her other friends) genuinely see myself as a terrible person, and I thought all our problems were *always* my fault. If I just worked harder on myself, Sydney wouldn't be \"so depressed\". I was mean. I was jealous. I was arrogant. Etc. I could never do anything right for her. She told me all of those things to my face repeatedly, and would tell me that I was hurting her like her past friends had*.* It's important to note she had a LOT of \"ex\" friends. I didn't have many friends, I was shy and quiet, but of the ones I did have, none of them I ever had issues with except her. She also *always* had to be the victim. In any situation. She complained all the time about everything and everyone, and about how the world was basically out to get her. But no one else was ever could speak about their problems. If so, she would \"one up\" them every time while faking sympathy. She also hated when ever anyone had achievements or happy events she didn't have. For instance, if I got a good grade on a test (Sydney never had decent grades), she would be jealous and a little pissy for days afterwards.\n\n She would have a new boyfriend every week practically, say she was in love with them, and then next week they'd be gone and suddenly they had been abusing her. She dated my ex-boyfriend immediately after he and I broke up (which I was okay with even though it's somewhat shady usually because we were all friends together). But then she claimed I was \"jealous\" and was trying to get him to cheat on her with me. Even though she was THERE when I told him we cannot hang out alone anymore and went out of my way to distance myself from him. I was pretty hurt she would accuse me of such a thing, but she refused to apologize or even admit she was wrong. She was also extremely vain. She made me spend hours waiting for her in clothing stores at times while knowing I hated that kind of thing, would play with her hair all the time, would express to me that she was glad I would never have the \"pretty girl problems\" being \"wanted for my body\" like she does, things like that. \n\n I once told her to back off her boyfriend because she was insisting he HAD to come with us to my house in order to hang out. He was sick and didn't want to, so I told her he should be able to go home and rest. She completely flipped out, cancelled our hang, and threw books at me before storming off. What finally ended our friendship though were two specific events. She started dating this one guy who notoriously was a heartbreaker after breaking up with our mutual friend. I warned her that he was known for being a man whore, had already used and abused several girls, etc. She freaked out on me because she said I was insinuating *she* was a whore because she had ALSO dated many guys. I told her that wasn't at all what I meant; I was just trying to protect her from being hurt again. She stopped talking to me for over a month and blocked me on her Facebook anyhow.\n\n Flash forward, we made up, which only entailed me apologizing to her as it always did. Anyhow, a few weeks later my grandmother died. I go to her and my other friend, and after saying how sorry she was for my grandmother's passing,  she starts complaining to me immediately about how \"awful I always was to her\" and how \"I was always attention seeking\". How \"I drained her and made her feel like shit\". \n\nYeah, I had my problems. I was severely insecure, depressed, and had many immature behaviors that I didn't work through until long after High School which was when we were friends. That was still the last straw to me for her to make it about herself again RIGHT after I learned of my grandmother's death. I completely snapped, told her off, told her basically she was a narcissistic bitch and that's why she's always whining that everyone hates her, told her she was ugly inside and out on top of being a slut so the only reason guys were around her at all was because she put out, but she could never hang on to them because of that as well: all my frustration that I had let go of for two years to spare her feelings came out at that exact moment.\n\n And trust me, I sent her walls of terrible things. Not all of them were even entirely true. Some of what I said I only said because I KNEW they would sting her. Or I would throw things back in her face I knew she was insecure about. It was mean-spirited, petty, and probably seriously hurt her. I also knew from experience her parents were awful and that was likely part of why Sydney was how she was to everyone. For an example of one of the fairly minor issues with her parents, Sydney's mom constantly compared her daughter to me, pestering her all the time about why she couldn't just be like me. I felt bad about her difficult home life all our friendship. She really was abused by at least one of her boyfriends that I knew of as well, although probably not to the extent she loved telling everyone. Regardless, it felt good finally standing up to her after she'd spent our whole friendship spitting in my face. Still, I have always since then had a voice telling me I did a horrible thing and then felt awesome about it even though I was in the wrong. Did I?\n\nTL;DR, Was I being an asshole by ranting over text to Sydney about her shittiness as a human being after two years of suppressing my feelings?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "First of all before I start I would like to clarify i'm not a radical feminist, I believe women aren’t treated the same in other countries and it upsets me. I have my little moments where I rant about how women aren’t treated equal in other places in the world and I can understand why that’s annoying. Anyway I was talking to my boyfriend on the phone about it and he hanged up, a few minutes I calmed down after my ranting period and I went to go text him to apologize, knowing what I did was wrong. He texted me saying he believes men also go through stuff, which I totally agree with. He says he feels like being a white male makes him feel like everyone hates him, and that everyone else that’s a white male also goes through it. I began to tell him that I can understand why he feels like that, but he doesn’t seem to understand my points. The only thing I thought I said that was kind of offensive was me saying that man started this, because it is true, what kind of women would bring this upon another woman. I don’t hate men and I hate the me who started this oppression.\n\nI am a hispanic female, I was raised to believe that women should be submissive to their husbands and to tend them to their needs, and also the whole women  should act like this and look like this is very prevalent in my family. Knowing that there’s women who have it way worse than this, honestly makes me mad.  The whole thing really makes me feel weird so who else can talk to my feelings to? My boyfriend. I feel like he tends to ignore what I say and likes to bring up something else to make me view that the situation isn’t important.\n\n\tDiscrimination to white people is still discrimination obviously, but it had nothing to do with what I was talking about. I want to be heard, but I also feel like i’m doing the same thing to him, so am I the A-hole here?\nSorry if my grammar is bad, my English isn’t the best ",

      "description": " My mom died 3 months ago. A month after my mom died, my dad started dating someone new, and I'm expected to be OK with it. This new woman also lost her husband a few months ago. \n\nI ended up uninviting my dad from Thanksgiving dinner after he told me about this new woman because I was so angry, which led to him and my grandparents (dad's parents) hating me. When I uninvited him, I told him that he was disgusting and it was disrespectful to my mom, and that he could spend Thanksgiving dinner alone thinking about how his dead wife would feel knowing he found someone new a month after her death. He ended up spending Thanksgiving with his new girlfriend. \n\nMeanwhile, his daughter (me) is still a complete mess after the death, and I realized he seemed to be doing just fine since he's able to say, \"I love you\" to this new woman and talk about moving in with her at some point soon. I just couldn't stand the thought of looking at him during dinner knowing that he had a new girlfriend. He kept telling me, \"it just happened\", \"give her a chance\", \"it's my life and I can do what I want\", etc. \n\nMy dad was always verbally abusive towards me and my mom, so I've literally spent my whole life walking on eggshells not to upset my dad. My mom always used to protect me from him and keep him in line, since he always called me the worst daughter in the world. We didn't talk for the month between Thanksgiving and a few days before Christmas. Obviously I needed time to cool down. I called him and texted him a few times during that month, but he ignored all of my attempts at contact.\n\nIn that month, I learned that people have a lot of opinions about this subject. Some people say it's way too soon and agree with me and others say that what I did was awful and to just let my dad be happy.\n\nI decided to be the better person and invite him to Christmas Eve dinner, and then he drops it on me that the only way he'll go is if I invite his new girlfriend. I wanted us to all be together since it's the first Christmas without my mom, so I reluctantly agreed. I just sucked it up and pretended to be nice to this woman while my dad kept comparing her to my mom, and then saying he wasn't comparing them when I pointed out that he was.\n\nNow that the holiday's over, I kind of feel like a jerk, but at the same time, he's always been awful to me. I want to cut contact with him, but at the same time, I told my mom before she passed that I'd try to get along with my dad, but it's so much effort. \n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Yes, as ridiculous as that sounds I still wonder if I did the right thing.\n\nSo a few weeks ago I started up a Minecraft server with only my 6 years out of date knowledge to help me. I quickly realized I had no idea what I was doing so I began to promote people as admins to help me run the server. One of these people was Gaylord (not his real name btw). I gave him FTP privelages so he could set up permissions. He knew what he was doing, and the end product was an organized system of ranks.\n\nAfter a few days, the regular players started complaining about admin abuse. I didnt know who exactly was doing it, but I knew it wasn't Gaylord. So, I made everyone except for me and Gaylord a regular player. I promoted Gaylord to co-owner because of his hard work and dedication. I was going to have everyone re-apply for admin, but the majority of the players told me that they would prefer a more vanilla server with no admin interference, so that's what I gave them.\n\nI made a NEW server, one that was more vanilla, and I advertised in the old one. Everyone migrated to the new one, including Gaylord. However, I didn't give Gaylord or anyone else any permissions. The previous admins were totally fine with this, except for Gaylord. It made him very upset and he began to criticize how I ran the server. I tried to explain to him that they were two separate servers and I wasn't gonna make him co owner if both, but he wouldn't take It. He then hopped on Minecraft (the new server) and started complaining there. He would get mad whenever someone other than me would butt into the conversation, and I told him that if he didn't want other people to give their opinion, then he should DM me on discord. Being the attention seeker he is, he stayed, still saying \"GET. OFF. MY. DICK.\" every time people would chat (in a public minecraft server, mind you). It was at this point I revoked his FTP privileges from the old server, but I still kept him as Co-owner. That made him really mad (as I thought it would, but if I hadn't changed the password, who knows what he would've done). He then messaged me that he was done and would \"fuck off from playing the server anymore.\" So, I blocked him on discord and banned him from the new server as a precaution. In retaliation, he completely destroyed the old server, and tried to ban me from it. So, I banned him from that one as well.\n\nAITA? Is there a way I could've handled this better?\n\nTL;DR: I own 2 servers. Co-owner of one wants to be co-owner of the other, gets mad and destroys everything when I tell him no.",

He is pretty much at the point of no return.\n\nA few years ago, he had some phantom pain in his neck. The doctors would not prescribe him any medications so he bought them online. It's not exactly legal if you catch my drift.\n\nHe would always get Xanax or really strong painkillers and he became addicted. He would get them sent to his house. He later banked up so much Xanax that he would just sell them on for profit because he had more than he knew what to do with.\n\nHis mother is an alcoholic and she's got years of painkiller abuse under her belt. She found out that he was buying drugs online and intercepting the mail before he woke up. She didn't really care - free drugs for her. She would take all of the Xanax in the package and zone out for 2-3 days.\n\nEventually he found out that she got to the drugs in the mail before him but even when he did, he would leave them on his desk in his room and she would sneak in and take them.\n\nHe got frustrated with his living situation and he t so he decided to code a dark net market for profit and thought he would become the digital Pablo Escobar. I was like okay, whatever. You do you.\n\nBefore he launched his market, something terrible happened. He was in the middle of trying to get off of Xanax and Tramadol so he ended up taking methadone to help him. His Mum snuck into his room while he went shopping with his Dad and took a whole TWO BOTTLES of methadone. She died.\n\nHe texted me super casually and said \"My Mum is dead. She took my Methadone.\"\n\nDidn't know what to say, thought he was joking.\n\n\"No, honestly. She's dead. She took all of my Methadone.\"\n\nI went to the funeral a few weeks later and I cried violently. I wasn't even close to his Mum but I thought I would show up and pay my respects.\n\nHe didn't cry. He didn't show a shred of emotion and it made me feel really uncomfortable. This was around the time when I thought if I should stop talking to him or not.\n\nA week later, he messaged me and said that everyone in the family blames him for his Mum's death. The police have taken his phone and computer while they look for a cause of death and if he said something to deliberately get her killed.\n\nNot much happened afterwards. I've been really busy with life stuff when earlier today, he messages me and he's like \"I'm starting up the market again.\"\n\nI said it's not a good idea at all. The Police are on him like a hawk and I don't think he has grieved properly.\n\n\"Okay, I'll just focus on myself from now on. I can see you don't really care.\"\n\n___\n\nFrom that point on, I don't really want to speak to him. He pretty much single handedly killed his own Mum. I thought the weight of the guilt on his shoulders must be enormous but it feels like it doesn't seem the matter and he is immune to it.\n\nI'm the only real friend he has and I don't want to really turn my back on him but it's just been a clusterfuck for him lately and he manages to draw out negativity from all angles.\n\n** TL;DR: Friend who's a recovering drug addict, kills his Mum through lack of common sense, turns cold hearted and I'm having a hard time turning my back on him. AITA?\"\n\n",

      "description": "This was fourth of July, last year (17 months ago) when I was at a party with my girlfriend and her friends. One of which, was a MTF transgender (Pre-Op, 6 Months hormones), and dating her another one of her friends. This was the first or second time I met her friends, and I didn't know the proper protocol for pronouns with Transgender people. That being said, I made sure to use the They/Them/Theirs pronouns for the party. I thought everything went perfect up until about a month later. Apparently I had \"Aggressively Misgendered\" this individual during the party, which I found odd because I barely spoke to them and was not aware of any hostile actions or ill intentions the whole day. The only time that I can think of it happening was when we were playing a video game, and I used the ambiguous, \"Get him\" and \"great hit dude\" that I would use regardless of Gender. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do concede that I should have asked the individual which pronouns they prefer and attempted to follow their preference, however I was also never corrected and was instead ostracized from the rest of her friend group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for feeling like I should have been corrected instead of passively being mad towards?",

      "description": "So I’ve got a group of 3 really close friends and two of them are into volleyball. Now, one of them has practice Monday Wednesday Friday and the other has practice Tuesday Thursday Sunday. So the only times we can really hang out as a group is on weekends because we have classes during the week. Now here’s where things get complicated. Pretty much every weekend at least one of them has a tournament which means they are busy the entire weekend. It gets frustrating for me, someone who is never busy and would rather hang out with friends than waste the days away in front of a computer, trying to plan things with my closest friends but can’t seem to get a plan together where all 4 of us would be there because they’re always busy with sports. Summer is an option but me and the other guy are both taking summer school pretty much the entirety of July then August, someone’s gone until there’s 3 days of summer left. So it upsets me when I try to plan things where everyone will be there but they’re busy with sports or will be away. We rarely ever all get to hang out together and I worry that will be the demise of our friendship. So reddit, am I the asshole for getting upset about my close friends always being busy?",

      "description": "Yesterday I (38F) attended a very small local movie festival that screened two classic movies.  The venue was a small community hall, with about 120 attendees.  Seating was in 12 rows, each with 10 metal folding chairs, split with a center aisle.  The chairs were packed pretty tight for the small space. The movie was projected onto a screen like you would find in a classroom, at about blackboard height.  This was a low-budget setup, nothing fancy.\n\nA woman (late 50's?) sat in the middle seat of the front row. She was wearing a large sun hat and was blocking a good portion of the screen for everybody behind her.  It was fashionably placed on her head, tilted back, so maximum screen blocking by the wide round brim.  I was in the 4th row and not directly behind her, but could not see around her hat.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realized that she was not planning to take off her hat before the movie started, so after a long internal debate, I decided to ask her to remove it. I'm pretty shy and usually just \"roll with it\", so it was pretty bad to make me speak up. \n\nMe: (kneeling down and using a quiet voice) Excuse me, ma'am, could you please remove your hat? It's blocking the screen and we can't see around it.\n\nHer: (horrified look, long pause, started tearing up...)  No! I can't remove my hat.\n\nI went back to my seat, and she left in hurry, visibly distraught.  I think she was crying.  She never came back.  People turned to look at me, confused about why she ran out crying after I spoke to her for 5 seconds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I feel like garbage because I obviously stepped into a highly personal issue here.  I can't get it out of my head. On one hand, maybe I was being cruel and insensitive by asking her to remove her hat (I keep thinking maybe she had chemo and was wearing a wig and just wanted to enjoy a movie without stressing about what she's going through).  On the other hand, she decided to wear a big sun hat to watch a movie and decided to sit right in the middle of the front row, without regard to anybody else.  There were plenty of other seats open at that time that would have allowed her to wear the hat without blocking anybody's view.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I upset a lady by asking her to take off her big hat during a movie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit- Am I the Asshole for asking her to remove her hat?",

      "description": "Now now, everyone expects you to be this and that. To be there for them, to do this for them, so on and so on. What if I don’t feel the excitement to be there for you?\n\nMy cousin Alaina just moved to Montreal, on July 2018. Her little sister Lena moved here also with her husband and their 1 year-old daughter on May, before her. As sisters, they are not so close. \n\nAlaina came here with a visa of two years, for work. She just arrived so she has no job yet, so we spend most of our time together. She says she cannot wait to live life for herself, and comparing her situation to her little sister, Lena. She says “I can go out, not like Lena since she has a kid”. I tell her it’s very true. But maybe Lena isn’t the type to always go out. \n\nWhen Alaina first arrived, she booked an airbnb and that will be the place she will be staying for a month while she takes care of her paper while searching for a job. She met the Airbnb owner, and I guess she “fell in love”. I have met the guy. I don’t like him. He talks a lot. But I guess some of you would know due to my previous post. Anywho, while she was here, she was still talking to her boyfriend of 13 years. But she gave him an ultimatum: come with me to Canada, or we’re done. She waited for him a long time because he is a career-driven guy, she also wanted kids and be married to him. But he stayed in Dubai. But a week later, he wanted to come here. She said no. \n\nWhy, would you guys say? She got tired of waiting. Lena tells me their relationship is on-off because Alaina is often making impulsive decisions. Lena has pity for her sister’s ex bf. \n\nSo, on September, Alaina wants me and Lena to meet her at Starbucks. We do. Her news: she’s married to Airbnb guy and she’s pregnant. Baby due in April. Which means first thing she did when she arrived here was get pregnant to whomever. Lena had no expression on her face. She could not be happy for her sister. I, on the other hand, did not know how to react. So I just said “anyone wants a piece of my brownie?” Holy fuck, I suck at social interactions. I continued saying “well good for you, didn’t you say you wanted to keep living life without a family?” She replied: yes, my time is over now. Ok.. but weeks ago that’s not what you said. I don’t care honestly, everyone can change their mind.\n\nI’m not gotta get into every detail but Lena was not happy for her when we left Starbucks. She even cried because that’s crazy. Lena cannot understand Alaina. Lena’s mind is set on not being there for her sister, as Alaina said many things to concluding Lena wasn’t very important to her. Sad. \n\n\nAlaina will give birth in April, and she tells me she’ll call me when she gives birth. I’m going on vacation at the end of April. \n\nAITA for hoping I’ll be out of the city when she gives birth?\n",

      "description": "Yesterday was my deceased infant brother's 5th birthday and death anniversary-- he didn't make it 24 hours despite initial evaluations and positive reflex exams. Suddenly, things declined. I didn't know he had died until 3 hours after I was waiting for my mother near her hospital room where I had not seen her at all upon arrival.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was somewhat of a major fuckup in my early 20s. I was independent, but very troubled. Worried my mother a lot inadvertently with mental illness, xanax problems and serious suicide attempts. I was attacked in my building one night on my way home, and the prescription use spiraled, and I just spun out of control in addition to a bunch of other things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was thrilled. Really, I was. I don't wan't children, and I thought that being present and a being a third person for a new little person to trust would be amazing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut to this day, I feel and know that that some small factor of my mom stressing out over me likely caused a higher probability of premature fetal distress, which happened. He essentially ran out of oxygen close to delivery and with the systemic damage from lack of oxygen and fluid until it was too late. It sucks, and I tend to wallow a bit but not to make it my own tragedy anymore yearly. I was with my family the whole time-- in the NICU, hackling the nurses to turn the fucking happy baby music in the hallways for 20 minutes for us to get her together because I was furious for her. The baby was passed around. I apologized to him. It was fucking horrific. My mother and I were **not** close, I still have many unresolved issues, but I was the very best I could be for her when she needed me. I have tried to make my own peace...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, on the general topic of child loss that comes up in conversation more often than I'd like (because I find that she fixates on it frequently and I try to understand), she has on more than one occasion said: \"No way-- losing a brand new baby is much worse than an older child.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;nbsp:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow...I'm 26. I am her one and only daughter. She raised me alone, married when I was 12, and got pregnant when I was 20. Essentially, we grew up together. I saw her finish her education, work 3 jobs, get her heart broken, never skip a month's rent despite all of it and she will never know, but no one knows that woman like I do. Thus, that statement that she's made many of times makes me *furious*. I hold my tongue when it comes up between just us or amongst social gatherings. The most frequent was at dinner a few weeks ago. My step-dad's brother flew into town for a visit, and we went out to catch up. He told us a tragic story about a couple he knows who's baby just recently died of SIDS, and that he found out after he booked the trip and felt guilty about not being there for the services. Other shared tragic stories amongst us, the usual. Then (again) arose the comment from my mother, \"Nope, I'm sorry but losing a baby or an infant is a lot more traumatic than a child; at least you have memories with the child.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I'm sitting right there. I think I may have said something, like \"Uh, hello-- I'm sitting right here.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've almost died on her. Severe depressive episodes have would me up in near-death situations. I can't understand how she would think something like that, and then to say it. And again, it's not territory I plan to embark on. I've encouraged therapy and the like...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it's fucked up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for this conflicting feeling?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTL;DR-- Anniversary of infant sister's death is provoking thoughts of recent comments made by my mother that losing a baby is more devastating than losing an older child; I'm her only other child. I think it's an asshole comment to make around me, even if that's what she thinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Okay so, a bit of a baity title I understand. For some context, I have been struggling with an eating disorder for a while and I’m very pleased to say I’m now on the road to recovery I think. The problem is it’s a very fragile recovery and I tend to relapse into disordery behaviours quite a lot. One of the things that causes me to go off the rails is any comment regarding my body at all. It’s kind of irrational but it seems my brain will find any way to twist a comment about my body into “You’re a huge fat whale!” For example if someone says to me something like “wow you’ve lost weight!” In a positive sense I will twist that and rationalise it by thinking that no one would say that to someone who isn’t fat therefore, I am fat. I know how irrational and it seems really petty (it is), but these things can really spiral and send me into an episode of self hate and starving/purging. I explained this to my boyfriend and asked him if it would be okay if he didn’t make any comments regarding my body, even positive ones. He was a little confused but agreed. Later we were lying on the couch and he said something like “I love the shape of your body, I love how it curves” and I’ll admit I did overreact and completely freaked out at him I just felt a pit in my stomach when he said that, especially with the comment about curves,  and I started going on an emotional rant. (I know, unnecessary). It devolved into an argument and told me I need to grow up and I can’t expect him not to compliment my body when he’s my boyfriend. He said “in the real world” people will be making comments about my body all the time and I need to learn how to deal with it and not expect him to coddle me. \nI’ll admit, he does kind of have a point, but I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable. Comments like that, for lack of a better word, trigger me and I just want recovery to go as smoothly as possible until I can heal and be okay with it.  \nSo am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So sometime I take my bike with me on my way to work and in my city, there are special compartments at each end of the trains where people with bikes should ride. So these compartments still have seats along the walls of the compartment so that people can sit there, but once you enter with a bike you will  block 2 or 3 of the seats. So if people want to use the seats, you have to move your bike a bit so they can reach the seats and sit down. Which is most of the time not a problem, neither for people with bikes (like me, who gladly let people reach the seats) nor for people who want to sit down (who wait the bike is moved). \n\nSo one day, there were quite a lot of people already in the train and one seat behind my bike happend to be still empty. After the train stopped at the next station, an old lady comes rushing into the compartment, sees the empty seat next to me and immediately almost yells at me to make room at this very instant so she can sit down. I am bewildered and don't react right away because honestly, normally people politely ask you to let them in and I would never, ever refuse to do so. But being bewildered by her rudness I (before making space so she could sit down) said to her that I have no problem letting her reach the seat, but that I find the way she talked to me very rude, and since this is the bike compartment (cleary stated outside) it will happen that there are bikes blocking seats and that it might take a moment for people to make room. She was pissed at me for telling her that she was rude and a lot of other people around me started to be pissed at me as well, because \"she is just an old lady wanting to sit down\". \n\nThe thing is, I would never ever not give up my seat for an older person or person more in need of a seat than myself and I would never ever not make room with my bike so people can reach their seats. But still I think that the way she talked to me was not ok, and it was ok for me to point it out although most of the other passengers seemed to think that IATA.",

      "description": "***STRAP IN, BOYS, IT'S A BIT OF A SHIT SHOW***\n\nSo, a few months back, August/September, beginning of American school year. I want to get involved in clubs to look good on college applications, so me being the bisexual fiend I am, join the GSA (Gay Straight Alliance or Genders and Sexualities Alliance, depending on who you ask.) Suddenly, guy walks in. I had seen him walk around the halls before. We'll call him \"Davante.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDavante starts to talk about how much he hates himself and how much he wishes he had friends. I hate it when people are sad, I've always been really empathetic. I console him and tell him, \"hey, we can be friends!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward. He starts sitting with me at lunch. Not much of a problem. He begins to follow me to my classes when I walk. Kindofcreepy.jpg, but maybe we have classes in the same direction? I test that theory and go into the bathroom. He doesn't follow me, but when I look outside of the door, I notice him waiting outside of the door for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I'm extremely creeped out. I've had stalkers before, but they were at least a year younger than me and over the internet. I could block them and move on. Davante over here is two years older than me and very much real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell my friend, \"Cianan\" about Davante. Cianan says something like \"oh, he doesn't have a lot of friends. I'm sure just having you as a friend excites him.\" If I'm the right brain, Cianan's the left. I trust him to help me make the most logical decisions I can make, and I help him with expressing his emotions and breaking down the emotional barrier. It's a mutual relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast foward even more to last Friday, January 11th. I had begun eating lunch in the French classroom around October-November because I wanted a safe space from Davante. I don't feel safe around him. Also around October-November, I started taking photographs of him whenever he starts following me. Have six photos. Anyways, Davante walks in. Has anybody ever walked into a room and just completely sucked the life out of it? That's what it was like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrior to walking in, it was me, Cianan, \"Thomas\" from French Club and \"Ava\" from GSA. Keep in mind, I had only ever told two people that I eat lunch in the French room - Cianan, and my LDR boyfriend. **There is** ***no*** **way he should have been able to find out where I eat.** Anyways, Davante, in front of god and everybody, asks me to the semi formal next weekend. I obviously say no, make up some bullshit story about how it's my brother's birthday and I'll be in Florida. He leaves, and Ava asks, \"hey, are you ever going to report him to a teacher? It's obvious you're extremely uncomfortable.\" I say that I've attempted contacting my counselor, but nothing happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBell rings, I go to my next hour. I don't do a very good job of hiding my emotions and I read like a book, so instantly, my teacher is like, \"Voggy22, what's wrong?\" I think my exact words were this: \"This guy's been following me for three months now and it makes me really uncomfortable and I've tried to talk with my counselor and she hasn't gotten back to me yet and I'm scared to talk to him.\" My teacher gives me a really weird look and she asks if I know who he is. I give a description of Davante, adding in that he's probably a senior or junior, which scares me even more. (I'm a sophomore.) She looks at me and is like \"...you know he's Autistic, right? Autistic people don't really know how to read social cues or how to act in some social situations. I'm not excusing his behavior, but that's a probable cause of his behavior.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething inside me snapped. Not because he's Autistic. I have never, nor will I ever, exploit the mentally disabled or mentally ill for my own gain. I asked to go to the office to talk with someone, and she writes me a pass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go to the office and NONE (and I mean ***NONE***) of the counselors are there. I didn't want to make this a big deal at first, which is why I wanted to see a counselor before I saw a principal or school police officer. But this time around, after he **he found my safe space, after he asked me to semi formal (in my safe space), I didn't care.** I marched into the principal's office and said, \"someone has been following me around school and it makes me uncomfortable.\" I ended up filling out an incident report, and I hope to be updated on the situation further...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Autistic kid followed me around school, so I reported him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I'll see if I can post screenshots of conversations on Twitter between Cianan and I.",

      "title": "AITA for never wanting to travel with my mother again?",
      "description": "I’m currently traveling in Japan with my mother. I originally planned this trip with a good friend of mine, who I was supposed to go with. But because my mother insisted she wanted to go, it became so that I had to go separate ways with my friend and go with my mother instead. \n\nI originally didn’t think too much of this, and I was not unhappy about the arrangement, but a week into travel I am really regretting all of this. \n\nFrom the beginning she was quite frank that she didn’t want to put any effort into planning, and she wanted me to do all of it. So throughout the planning phase, she refused to participate at all. Whenever I asked her something, it would be “oh, I don’t know. You decide”. When I pressed the question, she would get annoyed at me and call me indecisive. I was very frustrated about this because this is a trip for the two of us and I want her to enjoy it as well so I wanted her input on where she wants to go/stay and what she wanted to see/do. However, since she refused to participate, I just had to guess at what she might like to do in Japan. It was frustrating, but I settled with this for the most part. \n\nThings started becoming not okay once we arrived in Japan. Literally everywhere I take her to, she would have a complaint for. For instance, because she likes shopping, I took her to some very popular high-end shopping malls (Isetan, Marui, etc) in Tokyo. Once we got there, she took one look inside and said that everything is too expensive so she didn’t want to shop there. I suggested that she didn’t have to buy anything, and it might be enjoyable just to have a look, but she insisted that that’s a waste of time. Then I took her to some popular and fairly priced shops but she said that she didn’t want any of that “cheap Chinese stuff”. I was honestly mildly offended at this comment because shops like Uniqlo is very well-received and by no means is “cheap Chinese stuff”.  I asked her what kind of shops she would like to go to instead, it’s again just “I don’t know, you decide”. At this point I was getting annoyed but I knew if I let out any hint of annoyance we’d fall into argument and the rest of the trip would be miserable. I just figured maybe she didn’t want to shop, so I tried some famous tourist attractions instead, but at attractions she would constantly complain that she is bored and tired and want to go back to the hotel.. \n\nDining is the same. I would ask her, what she would like to eat, she would say “I don’t know. Anything is fine”. But when I actually then take her to a restaurant, she’d be unhappy about my choice or say things like “We should’ve gone to eat xxx instead”. If that’s the case then why didn’t you say so!!!! \n\nFor some reason, my mother expects me to know Japan like the back of my hand and gets hugely upset whenever I have to stop to look at the map or I lead her in the wrong direction for a moment. Her reasoning is that I have been here before. While this is true, that was when I was *five years old*. Pardon my memory but I really can’t remember anything from before I was 10. On top of that, she was the one who took me there so she should have equal (if not more) experience. Japan has really massive and busy cities. I think no matter how much effort I put into doing homework before hand, I’m still not going to be able to navigate this place as if I have a GPS of Japan installed in my brain. \n\nShe is making me feel like I can’t do anything right. Whatever I do, it’s a mistake, whether it’s the places I take her to, the food that I choose, the turns I take. Feeling upset about this, I suggested maybe she could put some effort into planning instead, if she is unhappy about my planning. She gets really angry at this and said that it was my responsibility because I’m (apparently) more familiar with Japan. I’m okay with doing all the work, but it really hurts that while I’m trying my best to accommodate her, she is unhappy about everything that I do. Also it’s not like she’s very elderly in which case of course I should try my best to lighten her load. She’s in her late 40s, for reference. \n\nThere is one more thing she does that is really irritating to me. Japan has HUGE and very busy subway stations, and every station has a lot of elevators. The etiquette here is that everyone who wants to ride the elevator while standing still should stand on the left of the elevator, leaving space on the right side for people who are in a hurry to catch their trains to run/walk up it. My mother, however, always insists on standing on the right side of the elevator because it’s “less crowded” and refuse to move over to the left when I ask her to because she says it’s her privilege as a foreign visitor to stand on the right side. Because of this, she’s constantly holding up a bunch of people on the elevators who are in a hurry to get to their trains. I’m constantly having to apologise to everyone for her behavior. She would then always go off on me about how I shouldn’t apologise to them because she’s apparently entitled to stand there. \n\nI really looked forward to this trip for over a year, but she’s just making the entire trip a really miserable experience for me. Instead of enjoying Japan, I find myself completely stressed out trying but failing to accommodate to her wishes. I also feel really sad about this because being a broke uni student, the trip was something I saved for a long time for so I really wanted to enjoy it. I know deep down that I am a total asshole for being annoyed about this because she’s my mother so it doesn’t matter what she does I must pay her respect and do what she asks. I keep swearing to myself I’m never travelling with her again but I also feel like maybe I’m just being a terrible daughter for her for thinking this. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Sorry for format (mobile) and sorry for length \n\nI (20m) and my friend (23m) have been friends for 5 years or so now. Last year he was diagnosed with depression and had a short stay in a medical facility. I was also diagnosed with depression around 2 years ago so I was really the only supporting character in our friend group. I've had long talks about life/his view on himself and told him he can contact me no matter what time it is, helped him be more social for his dating life (or rather attempted to) made sure he was on medication and seeing a professional, and even would play a game with him if he was just feeling bad so that he could get his mind off things. If I don't hear from him for a few days I check up and I've done all this since he was diagnosed.\n\nRecently he's taken to a morbid view that the world is trash and everyone in it is also trash. I've tried talking with him about this but he kinda rejects any other opinion without discussion. Since then he's been very insulting and rude to everyone in our friend group and when we try to talk to him seriously he just blames it on his hormones or emotional state without even apologizing \n\nIt's been 3 months now since he started this and I'm struggling to be patient. He asked me to play a game with him and a friend and I said no so he called me trash. To this I sternly replied that he was a hypocrite because the day before he rejected my offer.\n\nHe blamed me for messing him up on a video game because I was talking so I told him nothing could make him do worse than he already was (probably a lil too harsh)\n\nLast night I asked him to help me stay awake for 1 hour because I needed to stay awake to take my medicine otherwise I deal with very serious side effects and he said he wouldn't mess up his sleep schedule for me so I told him (half jokingly) that he's a bad friend and then I asked someone else and they helped \n\nI feel like I've been patient and a good friend but me and my other friends are a little tired of consistently being insulted throughout the day and I personally feel under appreciated. I get having mood swings or anger but taking it out on people who care about you every day for 3 months imo is NOT okay.  Whenever we snap he goes quiet. AITA? ",

      "description": "I work in retail.  This mainly involves two of my coworkers.  Just to keep it simple I’ll call them guy and girl.  \n\nGuy is a really nice dude, but he’s really awkward.  I’ve worked the same department with him multiple times and he just doesn’t have a lot of social awareness.  He tries really hard to be friendly and has even tried to connect with me outside of work to go do things.   I’m not sure how many friends he has.  \n\nGirl isn’t so nice.  Honestly she reminds of a high school girl in an adult’s body.  Lots of gossip and shit talking.  She’s even gotten complaints about interactions with customers which is a big no no here.  \n\nGuy and girl both worked the same department all last week.  I guess guy thought that he had made friends with girl.  Before he even made it inside another coworker said to girl, “here comes your best friend”.   Girl laughing “he is NOT my friend”.    Then during break I was in the break room with girl and a few other employees.   Guy stops in and goes up to girl.  He was excitedly telling her about Captain Marvel and telling her how good it was and she really needed to see it.   He went into explaining something from the comics I guess, I’m not sure I was only half paying attention.   Girl seemed interested until he left.  \n\nAfter he left she started shit talking him.  Saying that working the department with him was the worst thing that’s happened to her and now she has a turtle(?) following her around mouth breathing all over her.  As she went on I just felt bad for the dude.   She’s obviously been shit talking him to whoever will listen and even though he might be an awkward fuck, he’s just trying to be friendly. \n\nTowards the end of our shift I made a point to find him and explain that girl is not his friend.  That she acts friendly, but shit talks people behind their backs.   Including him.  He wanted to know exactly what she was saying so I told him.  I’m not sure how he took it his expression was really hard to read.  \n\nI’m feeling bad if his feelings are hurt because someone he thought was a friend was bad mouthing him, but at the same time he deserved to know.   I’m pretty conflicted on whether I did the right thing or not.  ",

I'm still in college and he's stationed away with the Navy while he learns to be a pilot. We broke up for about a day because he was worried about our principals and fundamentals weren't fully aligned. We are madly in love and can absolutely see a future together.\n\nFast forward to now, he's become more invested in politics and has started leaning more toward the right wing and being a Republican. His two roommates are quite Republican and every time I talk about politics he brings up how the Democratic leaders are idiots and proposing awful laws. I'm pretty neutral, but leaning slightly more left. He used to be much more neutral and rarely talked about what's happening with the government, but that's almost all he and his roomies talk about now. He also started going to church. That is totally fine, I grew up Catholic but haven't gone to church in years. His morals are shifting a little and they're making me uneasy. AITA for being so concerned about the person he's becoming? Of course he is entitled to his own beliefs and opinions. However, I don't think I would have started dating him if he were the person he is right now. His morals and principals are drifting further and further from mine, but I feel like he expects me to roll with the punches and conform to how he thinks and such. Am I overreacting here?\n\nTLDR: BF is having a change of personality and morals, but they aren't ones that I share or agree with.

My parents are currently supporting me financially (part of my tuition and all of my living expenses) since I went to med school straight after undergrad without getting a job. I recently discussed the topic of marriage with my parents and according to my them, I can’t get married until I start residency and my BF is done with grad school and has a “real job”. Their reasoning is that they want to make sure that my BF is financially secure before I commit to him. The problem is, my BF is currently doing great financially — he’s completely financially independent with a modest income from his lab, and has a sizable amount of savings in the bank that he’s been adding to since he was a teenager. Even though my parents know this, they still doesn’t think this qualifies as being financially secure because he’s “still in school and who knows if he’ll actually end up finding a real job”. \n\nMy BF and I have been wanting to get engaged/married for a while now. However, his PhD program may take a bit longer than mine — maybe a year or two longer before he can start looking for jobs. We want to get married right after I graduate regardless of how far he is from graduating, since I’ll be completely financially independent from my parents by then.

      "description": "This actually happened about 4 years ago but it suddenly came up my mind again when I was showering and I’m beginning to feel guilty about it (again)..\n\nSo one day I was at the shopping centre and bumped into my senior back when we were at high school. So we chatted a bit and she just kept going on about how poor she and her family is. I didn’t mind listening until she mentioned how lucky I must’ve been growing up in a wealthy family. Now, we weren’t that close, and she knew nothing about my family and my family was not as wealthy as she thought we were, upper-medium class at most. She probably just figured out because my family go on yearly holidays overseas I’m not sure.\n\nA bit of a background: my parents moved away during my last year of high school due to family problems, although my family was living comfortably, I was not allowed to receive any money from my parents, so as a first year college student I had to work my ass off to make ends meet. My parents’ income mostly went to my dad’s cancer treatments and my grandparents hospital fees. So I was pretty broke.\n\nBack to the story. As I was about to leave, she asked if she could get a ride home. She lived completely opposite direction as I did, if I were to drop her off I would need to drive 35 minutes back home. I was really tired that day so I just said sorry, I don’t really want to. She then insisted on asking me why I didn’t want to and as she was getting on my nerve since the previous conversation, I replied something along the line with I was tired and also I was running low on fuel and I didn’t have enough money to fill the tank, there’s a main bus interchange station at the shopping centre where we were at. After a few more unsuccessful attempts at asking me to drop her off, she commented on how selfish and unhelpful I was before she left.\n\nI just want to know if I could’ve done better/was I really an asshole then. Hopefully if this happens again in the future I could handle it better.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to watch the Oscars this year?",
      "description": "Every year for the past 8-9 years, me and my friends have had Oscar viewing parties to watch the Academy Awards. We would watch the ceremony and we'd even make a betting pool and see who gets the most correct predictions for who wins the awards. But this year, I've decided not to watch the ceremony. I think the show is going to have a lot less personality without a host, I hate that they're not even going to televise some of the awards presentations, and I just think we have a weak batch of nominees, especially in the Best Picture category. I have more reasons to not watch it, so that's what I'm doing this year.\n\nI went over to his apartment to tell my friend who was hosting the viewing party this year that I'm not watching and I won't be coming over to his place on Oscars night. He was actually pretty upset. He accused me of \"breaking tradition\" and he said that I \"have to\" watch it and come over. I told him that I have no interest in this year's ceremony and that I don't want to watch it. And what does my friend do? He actually calls an \"emergency meeting\" and invites over one other friends to tell him about this \"situation\". The other friend arrives and they're both pissed at me for not wanting to go to the viewing party. And then one of them tried to guilt trip me into going by saying that these viewing parties are the best way to stay connected as friends and I decided to just use my nuclear option. I told them that we must have a pretty shitty friendship if the Oscars are the only thing keeping us connected. One of my friends then said that I'm not watching simply because I'm jealous that a lot of the movies I liked didn't get nominated for Best Picture, so I started attacking his taste in movies. His favorite movie of the year was Bohemian Rhapsody and I said to him \"The only reason that it was even nominated is because the main character is gay! That movie is a pile of shit!\" Then the three of us get into this giant argument attacking each other's favorite movies of 2018.\n\nI decided to just leave and I turned to my friends and said \"I'm outgrowing you man-babies who throw a fit over a stupid awards show!\" and they both said \"Don't call it stupid!\" But I kept calling it stupid and I yelled that I'm never watching the Oscars again and that they can have their dumbass viewing parties without me. I left the apartment in an extremely pissed off mood and at first I felt good about telling them off like that, but in hindsight I really feel like shit. Not only because of how the fight went, but because I'v already lost one friend (I posted the story here about ditching him at Wal-Mart) and it looks like I've lost at least two more. I don't even want to think about all of the other friends who usually attend the viewing parties every year. But I still think that my friends were overreacting to my decision. What do you think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for being jealous of multiple personality “adopted brother” monopolizing my boyfriend’s time and attention?",
      "description": "AITA for being angry at my boyfriend for this?\n\nSo to make a long story short, my boyfriend (M22) and I (F22) are long distance but we love each other very much and are very close. We have been dating for 9 months. We talk/WhatsApp call every morning and every night as we fall asleep, and inbetween when we can. My boyfriend is very loving and patient and we trust each other, although being an LDR is difficult. He takes the initiative 50-60% of the time and I know he genuinely loves me. \n\nHe’s also a huge people pleaser, which is important for what I’m about to tell you. \n\nAnyway, my bf met this “famous” guy on Instagram, who he met in person only three or so weeks ago, and this new friend is calling my boyfriend his “adopted brother” and has spent all day long with him for the past three days, cutting into my time with him that I have been used to every day and night for several months. \n\nThis new friend has multiple personality disorder and has delusions of being famous (in reality he doesn’t really have friends). He has 340k Instagram followers and has delusions that the press is following him (he has people take pictures/video of him like he’s surrounded by paps.) He gave my boyfriend a friendship bracelet, clothes, sunglasses, and other gifts within 2 weeks of meeting him for the first time. \n\nMy bf explained to me that if he doesn’t do along with the whole “brother thing” it’ll crush this dude. Also my bf needs friends anyway and he says he genuinely enjoys hanging out with him despite his quirks. \n\nMy bf asked me to “be nice to his new “brother,” but I don’t want to be. Who the hell does this guy think he is??!\n\nI think it’s important to note as well that my bf is extroverted and I know he needs friends since he is an immigrant (long story) and feels lonely often. My bf is aware and agrees with me that it’s strange, but he needs friends and wants to make this new “brother” feel validated even if it means going along with the complete lack of boundaries and bizarreness of it all. \n\nThis new friend also is an only child and my bf said that this guy said that he has “always wanted a brother.”  I can tell that by and large he’s probably a perfectly nice guy, but it’s just so odd. (Thankfully this “brother” has a girlfriend, or I’d think he’s possibly gay for my bf.)\n\nThe past two nights, he has spent time with my bf and has stayed at his house hanging out until 2am. I’m typing this now as I cannot sleep because I’m so angry that my boyfriend can’t even respond to my calls/texts because he’s hanging out with his new “brother.” \n\nNormally I would be happy but it is so hard being apart from him even on a good day. We live hundreds of miles apart and we can’t meet right now due to other circumstances beyond our control.\n\nThis guy has latched onto my boyfriend out of nowhere, acts like they’re family, and my boyfriend is more worried about offending him than he is about setting boundaries and making time for me, after spending 13 consecutive hours with this guy. \n\nTL;DR: my bf of 9 months is prioritizing a new friend of 3 weeks over me, when we have been used to talking every night, he’s rather spend time with him now. \n\nAITA Reddit? This feels like torture. It is just so bizarre and I feel like I’m losing my boyfriend to some nutjob that acts like he has monopoly over my boyfriend’s time and attention. I just needed to vent. Thank you for your time 🙏🏻",

      "description": "Mobile format blah blah. For context, my sister is currently 15 and I am currently 21, and a female. Sorry for the length. \n\nAbout two years ago, for certain reasons, my dad, my younger sister and I moved to my grandparents house. It is a two story farm house with a backyard and a small pasture. When we moved, as sort of a gift, and to convince her to like living there, my dad and Grandpa went to the shelter and got her a puppy she had been saying she wanted. \n\nNow, my sister has a history with pets. A bad one. Every pet she has owned has died or been given away  within a years time. She has owned everything from hamsters to snakes to lizards to bunnies. She will pay attention to them for about a week, and then they will either die from not being fed or given away by my dad before that could happen. And I know my dad should've learned his lesson but his divorce was really rough and he used to really struggle with trying to make his kids feel at home. It's a long story I won't get into. \n\nLike magic, my sister, as of now, no longer sees her dog. In fact, she has not set foot in this house in over a year; she lives at our mom's house now. But whenever my father brings up giving the dog away, she begins to cry and he drops the matter. Well, when he lived here this was not much of a problem, he is a fully grown adult that can take good care of a large German Shepherd mix dog.\n\nBut my father recently got engaged to his girlfriend, and is in the process of moving into her house a couple of cities away. Which is fine, but that just leaves my grandpa being the only person able and willing to try and care for this dog. However, unfortunately, within the last year my grandpa has had many many health issues. He is currently in the hospital for pneumonia, and will have to start using oxygen and a walker, so I have stepped up to the plate on taking care of this house. But along with shopping and working and taking care of everything else, I don't want to take care of this dog. I have purposefully not involved myself with her all this time. I feel so bad for this dog that just sits outside all day with no one to play with. She would be so happy with maybe a young boy to play with who has enough energy to run around and play with her. But me, I can't and won't. I know part of it is probably my personal agenda, but I want to sit down, tell her I'm giving the dog away, and then give her to a good home where she can play.

Well she got me an apron but it's pink and it has sprinkles on it (similar to [this](https://i.imgur.com/2ZYxZa6.jpg)) for less than 10 dollars. I thought it was funny so I tried it on when she brought it home and we both had a laugh. She asked me if I would wear it while I bake and I said maybe. \n\nA few days later I made a pumpkin pie while she was at work and I didn't wear the apron she got for me. I didn't wear it because we live with my parents and I know they would make fun of me and laugh at me. When she got home she could tell I didn't wear the apron and she got surprisingly angry. She didn't understand why I wouldn't wear it and basically called me ridiculous for caring about the fact that it's pink and has sprinkles on it. \n\nThat's not really what I care about, I just don't want to be laughed at and I feel like that's why she got it.

She (very candidly) said she wasn't in the mood to hook up right now but probably another time. That was fine, I walked her home, we said our goodbyes, but did schedule another date. We ended up going on more dates and we decided to enter a relationship after a while. \n\nFast forward to last weekend, we were cuddling watching a movie and both a bit tipsy. The topic of our first date came up. I made a joke about how I had blue balls for a while after. Then she mentioned that honestly she wanted to sleep with me but was trying to keep with her policy of not sleeping with someone on their first date. This is where I should mention that she had a male roommate at the time- who I had briefly met a couple times. I had my own place, and again made sort of a joking comment about how the joke was on her since at least I had the privacy to rub one out after. There was an awkward pause, and eventually she said that she had ended up sleeping with her roommate. So I guess the joke was on me really lol.\n\nI was pretty upset and we ended up getting into an argument. She kept saying that we weren't even a thing yet and that it had nothing to do with me. My argument was that sure that's true but that doesn't change how I feel about it. Honestly this might sound dumb but emotionally I felt as if I had been rejected in favor of some other guy that night. We agreed to talk about it when we were both sober. We ended up talking a couple days later and I broke up with her because I didn't think that was something I was going to get over. I told her I didn't think she did anything wrong, but it still got to me and I wasn't down with having those insecurities. She was absolutely livid (fair enough) and went on to go tell all our mutual friends who are pissed at me now. I didn't feel like I was disrespectful, I made it clear this was a me issue and that it was just unfortunately how things were. I never shamed her or anything. Now a whole bunch of people are all pissy towards me when it doesn't feel justified, nor do I think it's any of their business. AITA?\n\nTldr: gf had slept with someone else after our first date. I found out, wasn't cool with that, and broke up. AITA?",

      "description": "I hate cigarettes, cigars, and certain vapes depending on the scent/flavor because I have asthma and it just sets my lungs ablaze. Also, my mom and grandmother have COPD. It generally runs in families, so I have a possibility of developing it as well. Not to mention I just fucking *hate* the smell. Always have, always will. It's mainly why I've never taken a single puff of any smoking object. \n\nMy fiancé knows this. He's smoked since before we met, so I try to not nag him because it isn't really fair. But he cannot smoke in the house or my car and he needs to use some mouth cleanser before he kisses me because the smell/taste disgusts me and if it's strong enough it upsets my throat &amp; lungs. \n\nYesterday at a family reunion, he came in from smoking and immediately tries to kiss me. I dodge his kiss and the scent of cigarettes was so strong it made me cough. His brother gave me a \"drama queen\" look, but he's a dick anyways so I ignored it. \n\nToday he was honest and told me that a few of his relatives messaged and questioned why I was \"so rude\", \"publicly unattracted to and repulsed by him\", and if he was really happy with me basically. He explained it was his fault and he just wasn't thinking and defended my asthma and general dislike of the habit. They then said it was using my asthma as an excuse and it \"isn't even that bad\" and I made a scene in front of them and probably embarrassed him. I've had an asthma attack in front of them before at a 4th of July party that ended up with me in the hospital, so they know how bad it is for me. They're just willfully ignorant and act like I choose to be sensitive on the subject. \n\nNow I'm not apologetic for my asthma or reasons for not liking smoke.. but, AITA for the way I immediately backed away from him in public/in front of family? Was that an asshole way to go about it? They're making me feel like a jackass about it.",

      "description": "So this is my first ever reddit post, although I’ve been reading this subreddit everyday for about a month now. I’m also writing this on mobile, so excuse any errors. Anyways, for some background context I have three best friends, each who I love for different reasons and really value their opinions/advice. Well two of them are super open and understanding, one of them (call her L) can be very judgmental when it comes to topics such as sex, alcohol use, etc (raised super religious). It’s the type of passive judgement that kind of feels worse then direct judgement. So recently I’ve been talking to a mutual guy friend of ours and our relationship has turned somewhat sexual, nothing too serious just very casual. I told my other two best friends about it as I was seeking advice on the situation and they were completely understanding and not judgmental at all, in fact they fully supported me. However, now I feel awful about not telling L due to a fear of being judged/condescended but I’m also scared that if I don’t tell her now she’ll find out later and it will make the situation worse. Also, I have every single class with her (I’m in high school) so I feel like if I tell her I’ll never hear the end of it. I’m pretty conflicted. Am I an asshole for not telling her?",

      "description": "  \n\nThis started 3 years ago. I was straight out of an abusive relationship and had no friends. Then I met a this guy and we started to become close friends. I knew he was in a relationship, but never saw him as someone I wanted to date.\n\nWe normally spent time in my room because I lived off-campus and therefore had my own room, while he had roommates. Our hangouts were completely innocent. He helped me come to terms with what had happened to me. Overall, a very wholesome friendship.\n\nThen I noticed he was calling his girlfriend more and more. Now, I didn't really care. I wasn't going to stick my nose into his personal business, but he started to seem rather upset after they talked. Eventually, he let it slip that his girlfriend didn't like that we were hanging out. I offered to talk to her, to assure her that I had no interest in him in a sexual or romantic sense, and even told him that she was welcome to come hang out, although either he or she was completely against that concept.\n\nWe kept hanging out, though, even if it became less and less. Being older, I turned 21 before him and we decided that we would hang out and drink. It was college, we were there to have a good time, right?\n\nHe came over and we started drinking and having a genuinely good time. He told me at the beginning of the night that his girlfriend said it was okay for him to hang out with me as long as he didn't spend the night. I didn't think much of it until hours later when I realized this was his first time being drunk, and he fell down my stairs.\n\nSeeing this fall-over drunk, underage boy, I didn't feel comfortable letting him walk or take a cab back to campus. I told him that he should text his girlfriend and tell her that he was staying over, but would not be in the same room as me or anything like that. He couldn't figure out how to use his phone or even remember his passcode. I put him into my bed with a bucket next to him and then I slept on the couch, checking on him every so often to make sure he was okay.\n\nIn the morning, he called his girlfriend to explain what happened. She demanded that he come home immediately and he texted me an hour later saying that she had broken up with him. We stayed friends for a little while after, and played DnD. One day, though, I received a text from him saying that I shouldn't come to DnD anymore as his ex was joining back in and he didn't want to make things weird. Turns out, she assumed he cheated on her and, what more, claimed it was \"entirely my fault.\" She refuses to speak to me and has been telling everyone that I was responsible for the break-up. She is currently rooming with one of my close friends and has said that I am not allowed in the room because of what I did and says I'm the asshole who manipulated her boyfriend into cheating. So, Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I have this one guy telling me I'm like a female incel, really picky, entitled, and delusional. Basically, he was talking about something related to how women are bombarded with attention, while men get very little. So I mentioned that's mostly attractive women - I'm relatively unattractive and attractive women are pretty much invisible (as in no one really shows interest, I've never been hit on, only been asked out a few times in my lifetime, etc), as much as unattractive men are. He told me that's not true, and that unattractive women reject unattractive men every day, because they think they deserve better/are closed off to other unattractive people. So i say, how can I be rejecting all these people that aren't even there? \nThe dude kind of ignores the point then tells me to just make a tinder and I'll get tons of likes, which he think supports his point. I say I've never made a tinder, but just some kind of MeetMe app and got a couple messages from \"desperate\" guys (as in, the kind that send girls effortless messages that basically read like \"hey bb wanna go out 😉\"). But that in real life, when it comes to people who actually know me, there is nobody that is interested aside from a girl months ago (we were strictly talking about male interest, though I'm more interested in girls). \n\nSo he said I'm delusional, and throwing men in the trash needlessly. That I'm so entitled that I can afford to reject a man that I consider \"desperate\". He said I'm moving goal posts, he would be ecstatic if any woman messaged him and would give her a chance, and that men would kill to be in my position. \n\nSo.. am I the asshole? The way he sees it and I'm being entitled and picky if I reject the only person who shows interest in me, based on them coming off as desperate/not putting in effort. I thought I was reasonable, but someone else else was agreeing as well. Now I'm not sure if I really am too picky given most people don't give me a second glance. ",

      "description": "Let's call her T, we're in senior high, I transferred June 2018, and our sour history started on my first days.\n\nIt started when I caught her friend, on two separate occasions, silently standing behind me and snooping on my Messenger chat conversation with my SO. I let him slide the first time, but the second - I expressed annoyance and requested for him to stop doing it. T, with the guy and their friends, defended and justified the dude’s actions. In the end we agreed to avoid each other due to being incompatible people.\n\nSince then T and her friends have been passively impolite to me. I’d often catch T’s boyfriend staring at me and smiling when he sees me visibly uncomfortable. They'd gather around me during hardware activities (ICT course) to confuse me. During class discussions where I express the same sentiments or opinions shared by majority of the class, T singles me out and is quick to counter my opinion if and only if it’s me who says it.\n\nSome have noticed it. At one point, a classmate told me he noticed how I seem to be uncomfortable when T's group is around. Another told me to just ignore them.\n\nI’ve been silent until tonight. \n\nA classmate was complaining in our class group chat about the expensive fee of our graduation. T seen the message. I chimed in and agreed. As expected, T was quick to shut me down, “complain to the office, not here.”\n\nI responded how I think she tends to single me out; asked if she has a problem with me, then we could talk about it.\nT denied my claims and said if I didn’t like how things went in this school, then I should, “stop complaining and just transfer.”\n\nI’ve had enough at this point. There’s only a month left before graduation. I wanted to stand up for myself before the school year ended. \n\nVerbatim, what I said: \"Okay, you've been a dick to me since day one. I'm joyful your father died. You deserve all the pain that comes with it, because you're a rude bitch. I’ve been seeing through your bullshit since day one. If you think you can intimidate me because I tend to keep myself to myself, and I’m an easy target, well you’re wrong. I’ve never spoken up about it because I hate drama. But, I’ve had enough of your attitude. Fuck you, I'm glad your dad died. If I offended you - GOOD. Fuck you, dipshit.\"\n\nEveryone else was surprised and asked me to calm down. She was VERY furious, and her boyfriend even challenged me to a street fight along with variations of macho alpha male scare tactics. \n\nI responded, \"You don't get to cry like a bitch. You broke ethical rules since day one and have been disrespecting me the entire year. Don't dish out assholery if you can't take it.\"\n\nThat’s the last thing I said. I clicked out of the group chat and didn’t bother with her response. It would turn into an endless loop of ‘it’s not me, it’s you!” and I didn’t want to be in that circus.\n\nI understand that was below the belt, but at the same time I wonder if that may have been too much.",

When she spends the night her morning ritual is to take a shower then come out to the living room have a bowl of cereal butt ass naked before going back to her room to get dressed. So I have seen her naked more times than I can count and my gf has never once said anything about it.\n\nSo last week we went on vacation and my gf asked Beth to dogsit for us while we were gone and she agreed. So before we left I wrote a note detailing the ins and outs that she would need to be made aware of. The final note of the list was me letting her know that we put up security cams in the house. I did that with a little bit of humor by saying, \"Friendly reminder: We installed security cameras so if you do the horizontal tango while we are gone, we will know and we will watch... repeatedly.\"\n\nMy girlfriend saw the note before leaving and didn't object to it at all. She just laughed and called me an idiot. So the first night my girlfriend tells me, \"Looks like she found your note, she jiggled her tits in front of the camera.\" So I laugh and open my phone to take a look. My girlfriend gets mad at this asked if I really had the audacity to open my phone right then and there to look at her friends tits. I said, \"yeah, it was apart of the joke that I left her. It isn't like I haven't seen them a thousand times before.\"\n\nShe called me a pig a walked off. So am I the asshole for breaking some obvious rule I was unaware of?",

And that if I didn't like it, I could move out.\n\nSo I stopped cleaning.\n\nExcept after myself.\n\nI let the kitchen get disgusting from HIS messes, and seeing that he refused to clean anything, I bagged up ALL of the dishes on the counter and sink (that happens to be literally every dish in the house except for the ones I've been using) and threw them all away.\n\nIt's been literally MONTHS of me practically begging for help. I just stopped using my wheelchair a year ago, I'm still doing physical therapy, and use a walker frequently. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to clean up after a grown ass man and just simply throwing his mess away?",

      "title": "WIBTA for ruining my BF’s dreams because he cheated?",
      "description": "Hi everyone! This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That’s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn’t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we’re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn’t gathered, he’s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can’t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he’s exhausted. That wouldn’t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn’t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she’s skinny and I don’t really find you attractive any more (I’ve been working on losing weight but I’m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn’t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won’t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she’s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn’t know I’m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I “made him anxious and embarrassed him”.\nI’m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he’s right. He doesn’t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I’d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?",

She is a bit of a crusader and I imagine she will use any opportunity to show everyone how not eating meat or only organic food makes you a better person. Her views against the idea of being a stay at home mom when she could also  work and preach femiminism will do nothing but create friction in my 88 year old grandmothers house. Don't get me wrong I have female cousins that are lawyers, doctors and one is even a judge but they work hard juggling a home and professional life. They walk the walk my girlfriend just talks the talk. I explained to her that I want to enjoy my time with my family and I accept them for who they are. She really wants to visit my family and spend time with me traveling. She says she is open minded and will accept them but I feel I'm better off keeping my conservative family and her far away from each other. Thoughts? ",

      "description": "I feel like there are parts of this I was the asshole, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll try to give as much information as I can and if you have any questions, please let me know and I'll try to answer them as best as I can.\n\n\nSunday night, I got a call from my friend Sharon. Since it was already almost 11pm, I ignored the call as I was sleepy and coming down with a nasty cold. I figured if it was important, she would call again or text me. Well, she did and even left a voicemail, which is unlike her. So I called her back right away (less than a minute later) and she didn't answer. Now I'm a bit worried so I keep calling and even messaged one of her friends. As I was getting in my car to drive to her house and getting ready to call her Mother, She calls me back and explains that the friend i texted Alfredo, needed a place to crash. There had been an incident regarding the mother and EMS was called (he didn't hurt her. She drank too much and he was worried about her.) Because he called EMS, she told him he had better be gone when she comes home. So he grabbed whatever he could and left. After being told that I drove straight to Alfredo's home to pick them up. Now on the phone I was told he needed a place to crash for the night so I was surprised when he came out with what looked like 6 different articles of luggage.  \n\n\nOnce in the car, Sharon and Alfredo kinda fill me in on what happened. As we're driving Alfredo is calling multiple people to set up arrangements for the week. I offered my couch since it would be more convenient, as I only live 15-20 mins from them. Everything is agreed upon and we're all set.  I drop Sharon off at the train station so she can catch a train home and drive home with Alfredo.  \n\n\nOnce home, I show him where everything is. Tell him that everything in the fridge ( except a few dietary foods) are fair game. Just tell me what he took so I can replace and if he needs something else, let me know and I'll pick it up on my way home. We stay up till about 2am chatting, I'm trying to make sure he doesn't feel completely alone as he just went through hell. Eventually I do call it a night as I have work in the morning.\n\n\nThe next day, I get home and we sit there chatting some more. I poured myself a glass of wine (literally 1/2 a cup) and we continue out conversation. He tells me that he's applied to some places for work and is an appointment later during the week. Being in the mental health field, I tell him maybe try finding a counseling center. They can help him manage the trauma he went through as well as connect him to some services. At that point he asks me if Sharon asked me to talk to him. I told him no, this was just coming from my point of view. He didn't have to take my advice but it was another resource he could have. We're going back and forth between chatting about that and laughing at other things. It was a normal relaxed conversation. As we're talking I get some upsetting news from someone and I tell Alfredo that I'm gonna go take a shower and I'll be right back. He agreed and I go shower. I'm maybe in there for about 10 minutes or so. \n\nI get out the shower and am putting lotion on when I notice my phone is flashing. It's a text from Alfredo saying \"things to too intense and I needed to leave.\" I'm thinking maybe he started thinking about last night and got too emotional and went for a walk. But when I go to the living room I noticed all his stuff was gone. Now I'm worried about him knowing he has no where to go for the night and I texted him apologizing for ending our conversation and explained that I had gotten some upsetting news. I tried calling him and got no response. I immediately called Sharon as he had previously explained to me he has a history of depression and suicidal ideations and intent. I get no answer from her either. At this point I just threw in the nearest clothes I had on and ran to my car to go look for him. I'm still dripping wet from the shower and am wearing black not so modest pajama set. As I'm in the car driving around looking at the nearest bus stops, Sharon calls me and starts snapping at me. Demanding to know what I said to him, and what happened. Apparently he told her that I went on a drunken rant and was telling him what to do. I denied that happening as I wasn't drunk. Sharon asked me where I am and I tell her I'm driving looking for him. I'm on my way to his house at this point. Sharon l, after knowing me for about 6 years now, realizes that I would never get in the car if I was in any way inpaired. We hang up and after about two minutes she calls me back. Alfredo is willing to come back to mine. So I continue driving. 3 minutes later, she calls me back again and told me that he said he would rather sleep on the streets than see my face. I offer him just getting in the car, not talking to me, so he's not in the streets tonight. I even offer an Uber to bring him back to mine if he really doesn't want to see me. All my offers are declined and while I'm upset I decide to go home. Sharon said she would sort things out with him, and I told her while I hoped all was well, I'd appreciate it if she left me out of it. \n\n\nThe next day, as I think about things I feel upset. I hate how things went down. Especially him saying I went on a drunken rant. I feel upset as I feel like I was very generous and was lied about. Including Sunday, I had met that person only four times. I had messaged Sharon that he left dorm things at my place and  that he could come get them on Tuesday (yesterday). Yesterday evening he texted me that he's super busy and won't be able to come until Friday. Sharon won't be able to come to our town for over a week and I would honestly rather not have contact with him. I haven't responded to his message about coming to get his stuff and have removed the key from it's hiding spot. Obviously if he's dying or something I will help but for now I need distance from him. Would I be the asshole if I didn't answer his messages and instead told Sharon I want to go no contact with him and he should arrange with her to get his stuff? They're nothing big, a book, toothbrush, lighter, and toothpaste. \n\n\nThe part where I feel like the asshole is having that drink in front of him. He's given up alcohol but we've had drinks around him before and it's never been a problem. I guess I wasn't thinking after what happened with his mother it might be a trigger? He seemed ok with it, as we were emailing before cause I had made a mixed drink but it was too strong so I dumped it out and opted for the wine instead. \n\n\nI don't know guys. I don't know if I'm overreacting at this and would like some outside perspective. I've asked my best friend but she has a tendency to take my side most of the time and I'd like an unbiased view. Thank you in advance!\n\nTo;Dr: Offered my place to a friend of a friend. Things we going well until he started discussing employment opportunities and I have a few suggestions on where he might get some help. He blew up and told our mutual friend that I went on a drunken rant on him and was telling him what to do. Now he wants to come get his stuff but I no longer feel comfortable keeping in contact with him or seeing him. \n\n ",

I see posts all over the place for Nurse Practitioners, and she's saying she's applying but I don't know how hard she's actually looking.   I don't want to give her crap for it because she actually talks about it quite a bit, but all I see is her laying around on the couch watching TV all day and night.\n\nI was working from home today and she kept telling me to come hang out with her.   I told her I had too much work to do and would be working throughout the night.   I was annoyed at this point, because she kept interrupting me.   She said \"well why didn't you work over the weekend so you wouldn't have to work tonight?\"   This really pissed me off, since I saw her hanging around doing nothing all day, so I said \"well why don't you get a job?\".   \n\nWrong thing to say.  She screamed at me for a minute straight so loud that my ear drums actually hurt.   At one point she just opened her mouth and screamed while stomping.    So loud that I'm positive everyone in our neighborhood heard.   She ran into the room after, slammed the door, and said to stay away from her.   Which i'm doing.

      "description": "I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a little over 2 years and we moved in together about a year and a half ago and have lived in two different apartments. When we moved into our first place together I bought a 50 whatever inch TV and a wall mount to put it on. We both use the TV often. When we aren’t working at least one of us is using it. Usually using my PS4 to watch movies, Netflix, play games, whatever.\n\nI had a second TV I brought with me, a smaller with me, like a 22 inches. In our first place we had that one in the bedroom we’d use it with chrome cast, but in our new place the bedroom doesn’t get good WiFi reception so it’s just been hanging out, not being used.\n\nWe recently rearranged the bedroom and found spots that do get good WiFi. My girlfriend says that she wants to mount the smaller TV to the wall, and asks me how much the first mount cost. The first one was like $110 but the second tv is a lot smaller and less heavy so I’m not sure how much it will be. She says she wants to mount it on the wall and that’s pretty much the end of the conversation, I don’t really think too much about it.\n\nAfter Christmas she got a few amazon gift cards and she’s thinking out loud about what she wants to buy with them. Eventually she remembers the wall mount conversation and asks if I want to go in on half of it with her. I say no not really, in my mind that’s something she wants to do, her “project” so I say no. She doesn’t really like that answer, and I say I want to buy new parts for my computer should she be expected to pay for half of those? She says that’s very rude. I wasn’t trying to be rude, just explain how I see things.\n\nWe start getting more into the conversation, arguing a bit, and I’m asking why should I be expected to pay for half the wall mount if she’s the one that wants it. She says it’s because it’s MY tv that I should pay for half. In my mind she wants a tv and a wall mount, I’m essentially giving her the tv already, so she can buy the mount.  I didn’t ask her for any money for the big tv or the big wall mount when I bought those, I just bought it for both of us because it would be good for the living room. The argument devolves into her saying I dont buy anything for the house and she has to cover everything, now we’re both mad at each other. \n\nSo I’m asking here, am I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "This happened a few hours ago. I was at the theater with a girl I've been dating for a few weeks; we were watching Aqua man (didn't like it). In the row behind us there were three 30-50 year old dudes.\n\nNow where I live the people that show up early like to talk before the movie begins, but when the movie starts everyone shuts up. Well, except for the guys sitting behind us. They were talking at a regular conversation volume throughout the movie. About 30 minutes into the movie, my date whispers how annoying they are, so I turn around and quietly tell them to please be quiet. Surprisingly they seem very understanding and stay quiet for a bit.\n\nEventually they start talking loudly again, and I can tell my date is getting mad. I turn around and say \"Guys, can you please just shut up?\" in a slightly louder tone. My date still seems mad, and when the movie finishes I ask her whats wrong.\n\n She says that I embarrassed her when I told them to shut up and that I should've been polite. I then told her that I already tried being polite and they didn't listen, but she didn't want to hear it. So Reddit, am I in the wrong?",

      "description": "Hey guys, It's a long one. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nOk for some background we are both college students and have classes on Monday through Thursday at 11 a.m. Also, last night my boyfriend's cousin was in a car accident (they're ok) and we didn't leave the hospital until about 3 a.m. and went to sleep at about 5 a.m. \n\nLast night, I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to set an alarm for 10 or 11 or whatever, I just didn't want our sleep schedule getting messed up. He said he already set one so we went to bed.\n\nI woke up this morning to him saying hey and asking me if I wanted to get up yet. Now, we have a system that goes back years where one of us asks the other if they're ready to get up. If the answer is yes, we come back with coffee, and if the answer is no, we come back in about 30-60 minutes as a \"snooze.\" So today when he asked me, I said I wasn't ready to get up yet and he said, \"ok, I'll be back for you in a while.\"\n\nWhen he woke me the first time, I thought it was at about 11, as that's when I was thinking it was time to get up. My boyfriend told me that it was at about 2 p.m., and had I known that I would NOT have stayed in bed (also I'm not entirely sure that he had the time right, as it didn't feel that late to me).\n\nSo I went back to sleep, but was restless and kept waking up. It felt like it had been at least a few hours since my boyfriend came in, so I got up to check my phone and it was *4 O'CLOCK.* I freaked out a little bit and went to go talk to my boyfriend, who was playing video games in the next room.\n\nI told him that I was upset. I said that I didn't blame him for my body not getting me up at noon, but I was trusting him with setting an alarm and also with coming back in to get me like we always do. I told him that since i struggle with insomnia that I'm going to be up all night and am going to have to reset my sleep schedule the hard way by staying up late and getting up super early.\n\nHe told me that he was really upset that I was blaming him, and that he didn't come get me up because I already got myself up, but that was at least 2 hours after he said he woke me the first time. He said that he didn't think that it was his fault and that I was being unfair.\n\nTLDR: I wanted to get up early so my sleep schedule didn't get messed up. My bf tried to wake me and then let me sleep until I woke up naturally, which was at 4 p.m. and now my sleep schedule is ruined and we are both mad at eachother.\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "So i have known this friend for a few months now, completely casual relationship outside of a few text here and there, until it turned into something more. We ended up hanging out, sleeping together, which turned into a 3 day weekend thing and we discussed being together. The problem arose with the fact she was in a semi on again off again fuck buddy relationship with her ex of 3 years who she texted telling him she could not talk to him anymore because she found someone else(I.E me), he ended up flipping out, had an emotional breakdown and even used her mom against her. Her mom Happens to be very protective, so when she was gone for 3 days barely telling her where she was outside of the usual with friends response and found out she had spent all that time with me, she was livid when her ex told her the details and where she was.  \n\n\nHer mom ended up convincing/forcing her to come back home on the 3rd day to talk to her and her ex about everything, i was a little worried but not too much but our previous \"relationship\" which seemed to be forming was left in chaos, since then it's been 3 weeks with no word from her on what happened or what she decided on doing about her ex. I have texted, called or tried to call(she has me blocked now) and leaves me on read on the group me. Finally i had enough, i hit her up with a nice and well written message saying i hope she feels better, but i can't keep waiting without any information and i understand the problems she is facing but i don't like being outright ignored especially when we discussed beforehand i'm not that invested where hearing she wants to be with her ex will ruin me, but just tell me what's going on so i can process it all. Instead after waiting a day, i ended up getting frustrated and hit her up on our groupmes main casual chat asking her to check her pms. She responds \"Leave me alone\" and... i kind of lose it, i recently lost my brother(he's actually a long time family friend) and emotionally i'm not in a great mindset but i chose not to air dirty laundry in the chat. Instead i tried to hit her up one last time in a PM and through one of my google voice numbers( I have 3 google voice numbers, mostly for getting discounts or making new account info for certain sites) she never responded but instead blocked me again.   \n\n\nI know at this point i read the wall, obviously she doesn't want to talk to me, just move on etc i get that and normally if i was in my right mind i would've but i'm stuck in the city for his candle light vigil and honestly i just couldn't focus on other stuff. So i said screw it and decided to get back at her, i noticed our group me allows people to remove members regardless of any type of admin privilege so i removed her from both groups and said \"Your wish is my command\" right before i kicked her out of the chat. Am i the asshole or should i feel right to have these annoyed feelings?",

      "description": "Some back story, sorry if this is too long...\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for five years, the first four of those long-distance (she was in Boston, I was in New York). We're both in our early thirties. About a year ago, she left her job and moved in with me, planning to find a new job ASAP. She left her job and moved because we were both unhappy with the long-distance thing and neither of us wanted to live in Boston. Problem is, she hasn't been able to find a job in the area. On top of that, NYC just keeps getting more expensive, and we don't really like living here, so we'd like to move somewhere cheaper/friendlier. She's started searching for jobs in Boulder, we visited and we like it there, but it's been several months of looking there and she's still not getting any offers.\n\nHere's where I start to feel like an asshole: I'm starting to feel impatient. It's been a year now that she's been unemployed and I'm supporting her. I have a high enough salary to do so comfortably, but it's putting a dent in how much I can save. On top of that, I'm miserable here. My job kind of sucks, but I don't want to find something else here, because we want to move. On the other hand, I don't want to find something on my own in Boulder, move there, and still be supporting my girlfriend - what if there isn't a job for her there, either? I want to make sure wherever we live, she has gainful employment. I'd like to talk about starting a family but I don't want to do it as the sole breadwinner.\n\nWe've talked about this a few times, but I'm trying really hard not to be pushy. She gets very discouraged about the lack of job offers and I know she feels lousy about it, so I don't want to pile on. At the same time - she kind of seems like she's okay with just being unemployed and living off my salary indefinitely, and I'm concerned about that. She knows I'm miserable and talks a lot about finding something in Boulder to \"get me out of here\" but there are also a lot of days when she doesn't even do any job-hunting. I know she's trying, and I don't want to set a hard deadline of get-a-job-or-else, but I do want to know that there's a long-term plan, a backup plan for her/our future, if she just can't find the kind of job she wants in her field. Sometimes I feel like she doesn't have the same sense of urgency that I do to take the next step in our lives. WIBTA if I expressed these to her? Or if I asked her to tell me her long-term plan for becoming more self-sufficient and independent? Alternately, AITA for even contemplating that she might not be able to get the kind of job she wants?\n\nTl;dr girlfriend is unemployed and I'm supporting her, I want to bring it up and ask about the plan to change this situation, but don't know how to do it without being an asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "hey there. in mobile so forgive any mistakes. \n\nmy (25F) fiancé, lets call him Jon (24m) takes video games way too seriously. \n\nmy fiancé is very into Overwatch. he’s a diamond/masters player, and always feels the need to insert that fact into every argument we have regarding the game. i also play Overwatch as a gold player, and he is constantly shittalking any player lower than he is (“oh they’re a plat/oh they’re just gold” which insults me because i’m gold myself, etc). \n\nthe problem: every time he plays the game, he feels the need to teabag any enemy who does ANYTHING to him, constantly spams “Thanks!” to his team when they don’t do what he wants, and will throw consistently if his team doesn’t do what he seems to be “the right thing” (bc you know, he’s masters and knows these things /eyeroll). i wouldn’t have a problem with this if it was competitive or a once in a while thing - but this happens every single time he plays the game. he only does arcade/qp, since he does placement rounds in comp and then quits comp for the season for the most part. \n\nwe got into a big argument tonight where he was defending his actions, which were basically endless teabagging and sending toxic messages via PSN to the enemy (calling them a “low SR bitch lol” and other shit), he said he “wasn’t going to let himself be bullied” despite the fact that he was the only one sending toxic shitty messages to people. i understand it’s frustrating to lose a game and it’s frustrating when your team doesn’t do what you’d like — but i feel he’s taking it a step too far. it’s incredibly off-putting and i’ve told him many, MANY times how his actions on Overwatch negatively effect me, but he refuses to do anything to change his behavior. to be honest, if he’s going to act like a tilted 12 year old over something as simple as a video game, i’m not sure i even want to be with someone like that. this has been a continuous problem throughout our relationship since OW came out — him being petty on Overwatch and me being upset by it, and i’ve let him know this many times. he doesn’t seem to care, especially since he’s repeatedly said that it has nothing to do with me/why should it bother me/what he does on Overwatch isn’t my concern. except that it is, since even though we have two PS4s/TVs he refuses to play in a room i’m not in, so i have to deal with his pettiness and toxicity, not to mention the fact that HE IS MY FUTURE HUSBAND. \n\ni understand that it’s frustrating sometimes but shit, just leave the game?? and honestly if your FIANCÉE is telling you that it makes you less attractive/childish/irritating, is that not enough reason to change? it’s a VIDEO GAME and he is sweeping aside all of my reasoning in favor of “defending himself” against other toxic people on OW regardless of the fact that he’s sinking to their level. and honestly more often than not his team is just doing what they want — but it doesn’t fit his narrative of how they’re SUPPOSED to be playing the game so he becomes toxic and spams “Thanks!” and repeatedly suicides. it’s becoming a very big problem in our relationship and he refuses to listen to me, his fiancée who IS affected by it, bc he doesn’t think that it should affect me/i shouldn’t be concerned with it. \n\ni don’t know what to do. he won’t listen to me and won’t take my advice because he believes his “retaliation” by teabagging/sending shitty messages/suiciding is warranted because his team isn’t doing what he wants/what he thinks is up to standard, even if he isn’t on voice chat or anything. he’s acting like a teenager and it is the least attractive thing i’ve encountered. it’s affecting our relationship and i want it to stop, but despite knowing this, he refuses to change. he’s been suspended on PSN multiple times and honestly i can’t WAIT until he’s banned for good, but i know he’d just make a new account and continue on. \n\nAITA for wanting him to act like an actual adult and not be super childish and petty over a video game? it feels like he just won’t listen to me and honestly, as silly as some might think, this is a deal breaker for me. i’m not here to marry some toxic teenager. what do i do?",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI (F) and my girlfriend have been dating for about 6 months now. My sisters and my parents know that I am bi and they have all met and approved of Girlfriend. However before the holidays, Mom made it clear that she did not want me to talk about Girlfriend during the holidays with any of my extended family. I agreed with this because \n\na) my 91 year old Oma is very conservative and very fragile and we don’t want to stress her out with any drama.\n\nb) Mom has a lot of anxiety and is really self-conscious in front of her siblings / my aunts and uncles. She is still working herself up to tell them about my personal life. \n\nIn defense of Mom, she has made a lot of progress in accepting who I am. When I first came out, she explicitly told me she would rather I only dated men. She is constantly remarking on my sexuality with a “I just don’t get it.” And “Good grief, RubyBop”, but she is also genuinely curious and asking lots of questions about myself and Girlfriend. She even hugged Girlfriend when they first met!\n\nSo I agreed to cut her some slack and leave the gay talk behind during Christmas. I did not expect to feel as sad as I did. \n\nEveryone in my family (including both sisters and my 18 cousins) has an SO in some form or other. By all appearances, I was the only single adult. This wouldn’t have bothered me if I was actually single and actually straight, but as the days wore on, I was exhausted from constantly avoiding hot button topics or fibbing about my life. Meanwhile, I’m envious of every person that got to invite their SO to our parties or at least talk about them.\n\nAnd now, my sister: she’s not engaged yet, but I know that her boyfriend has bought a ring and I know that she won’t hesitate to say yes. Once all is said and done, I really want to ask my sister if she will let me bring Girlfriend to the reception. We will have been together for at least a year by the time the wedding takes place. \n\nMy reasoning is that most of my extended family will not mind that I’m in a same sex relationship, and those that do will have the decency not to say anything. Even Oma will be too oblivious to realize it. She already has a hard time keeping track of how many great-grandkids there are and over Christmas she kept calling me \\[sister’s name\\] and asked me where I worked four times. Bless her heart. \n\nLiterally the only person that would have a problem is Mom with her anxiety. \n\nIf were just up to her, I don’t think my sister would mind, but I’m worried about putting her on the spot or guilting her into saying yes. And if Mom is there whispering in her ear, she could be even more stressed. My sister is definitely more open-minded than Mom, but she can be just as emotional in stressful situations and I want her to be happy on her wedding day. \n\n\\---\n\nTL;DR: I want to come out to my family and bring my girlfriend to my sister’s wedding. But Mom wants to keep everything a secret. I’m worried that if I do, my sister (the bride) will be too stressed to enjoy her special day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I've had my reservations about the whole thing from the start seeing as they had only been dating for a month when he proposed. And there seem to be a lot of red flags with the guy. I tried to be supportive and help her plan it last summer (because weddings take a lot of fucking planning) but one thing or another got in the way. She's super scattered and flakey anyway so we just never made any solid plans. They didn't set a date until mid January. I happened to start a new job in January so I have 0 free time for anything now, especially when she lives an hour away and was my baby sitter (but stopped babysitting to plan her wedding) so now I also don't have a babysitter.\n\nSo now we're a couple days out from the wedding, there is no real plan, she barely answers my texts to try and figure out what's going on. There isn't even a rehearsal. And she keeps making plans without saying anything to me and then getting irritated when I can't participate because I wasn't given notice. I couldn't attend her bachelorette party because I had to work, told them all that day wouldn't work for me, but it's my fault apparently. \n\nI'm so over this whole thing. I really don't want to go. I don't want to be a part of it. It's exhausting and stressful and has sent my anxiety through the roof. So would I be the asshole if I told her I didn't want to be part of her wedding 2 days prior? \n\n\nTl;Dr : Friend is having a cluster fuck of a wedding in 2 days and I don't want to be her maid of honor (or even in the wedding at all) anymore. \n",

      "description": "Something that I’ve honestly stewed on for a few months and I’d love to finally get some resolve to this question.\n\nContext:\nMy friend (Josh) and I play music together in a band. Josh is a fantastic guitarist and singer, and he’s really had to work on it but it’s definitely paid off. I’ve always fancied trying to sing (I play drums) and I thought I’d give it a go.\n\nSo I picked up a guitar and started learning some songs by my favourite band - easy stuff to get me going. My friend heard these songs and then decided he wanted to cover them. This is where it got awkward. By him playing them, I felt like it kinda put a dampener on my learning. People heard him playing and assumed I’m trying to copy, albeit kinda badly. I just wanted these to be songs that I could play on my own without people making a direct comparison between our covers. \n\nI politely asked Josh it he could just refrain from playing these songs - just til I practiced them and felt confident. At the time he agreed and said it was no problem but it kind of came up a few weeks later and he clearly thought my request was a dick move.\n\nSo Reddit, was I in the wrong? I’m completely aware that this comes from a place of insecurity but I always wondered if my request was too much. ",

      "description": "This has been on my mind, and I need to hear the internet's judgement to see if I'm in the wrong.\n\n\n\nI have been job hunting a lot. A few months back, against my better wishes, I gave my information to a recruiting agency. I'm not a fan of them, as you end up with a lot of \"please pass this information along\", but I figured the extra job opportunities couldn't hurt. They eventually found a company I thought I'd love.\n\nTwo phone interviews later, they want to see me in person. I'm ecstatic. I'd love to work for this company. My agency has sent me their health benefits earlier, though no other information. I ask what their PTO (paid time off) and 401k information is, and they give it to me after verifying it is accurate. At this point, I am going to meet in person, and note that their benefits aren't great. But I still have no clue what the pay is. I fly out to meet the company with a ticket paid by the potential employer and it seems promising. I think I'd be a great fit for their company.\n\nI get the job offer. I am understandable on the pay; its good, and I am not against it. However I couldn't overlook the benefits. More expensive healthcare, a considerably smaller company match than my current 401k (match doesn't even start until after a year of employment), and a whole week less of PTO (two weeks less the first year of employment). I turn down the offer stating the reasons.\n\n\n\nTime for my judgement. Note that I have only been in touch with the recruiter, as I have no contact information of the company. I tell the recruiter why I'm turning it down as stated above.\n\n\"[plasmafire117], let me ask you this... Why would you spend the company's money on flying you out there, and then turn it down, if the benefits were going to be the reason you rejected? You knew about them before going to see them.\"\n\nI tell him I knew the benefits, sure, but he had only given me health. I had to ask for the other two (PTO\\401k), and a that point plans had been made.\n\n\"But you never asked for those sooner.\"\n\nI tell him that I had no way of knowing until an offer was put. I'd take lower benefits for higher pay, so I'd have taken it. But I know they are already offering me on the high end, and can't change benefits! How could I have known until an offer was made?\n\nHe continued to berate me for a bit on how I wasted his time and the company's money... slightly mad at how he responded, I told him to remove my information from his agency. I wanted nothing to do with them after that interaction. I then told him to have a nice day and hung up.\n\n\n\nSo... judge me. AITA for going on this trip and 'spending their money'? Am I in the wrong? I can't stop thinking about it. I feel bad sure, because I really felt this company would be great. But with a family and the benefits, I couldn't overlook how much less we would get. Should I have canceled the trip? Should I even be thinking about this so much?",

      "description": "I'm 26F, have quite damaged teeth from a disease and visit the Dental clinic here quite often. Some treatments are more expensive, my budget tight, so i got offered a place in the student courses. Nice girl there treted me amazingly well, but there still was stuff to do, so she asked me if i wanted to be her friends patient in her exam. I agreed. \n\nMonday then the exams started. We made three appointments for this week, one on monday, one yesterday and the third should be on friday. I was really looking forward to the first one, convinced that all would go well, cause the students knew their stuff (like the first girl who treated me amazingly.)\n\nBut what should i say: It was a disaster. It was 3 1/2 hours of pain, the other student being so nervous and hysterical, that she made easily avoidable mistakes  and i cried on my way home for an hour straight. My mouth angles are burnt by acid she misused, the local anesthesia, which she injected wrong 3 times has my whole mouth swollen up till today.\n\nTuesday i returned, because as i said i somehow felt commited to help the genuinely nice girl to pass her exam and not letting her down, but yesterday was just as bad. I told her about my mouth angles and asked her to be careful, told her where else i was in pain and just asked for a bit of consideration (she wanted to do the other side this time, so not working in the same area as the day before), but in the end her nervousness got the best of her and she got tense and bitchy and completely didn't care for how i felt at all anymore. \n\nThat was the second day i returned home crying, not able to eat or drink or speak, cause my tongue got burned, the other mouth angle looks the same and everything has swollen up in my mouth and still is right now.\n\nFriday would be our last appointment and i just don't want to go. I never had anxiety about dentists, i already fell asleep on the chair more than once cause i'm usually so relaxed, but right now the pure thought is the horror to me. Everything still hurts and i don't think any off the pain will be gone by friday and sitting there for another 3 1/2 hours just seems like the last thing in the world i want to do.  \nI'm not sure if they would manage replacement for me (a friend of hers already cancelled his appointment for thursday and she was losing it, because she had to find someone else on time) if she couldnt find someone herself and I don't know how this would affect her in total - i feel miserable for letting her down. \n\nSo now im stuck between my own well-being and withstanding one last 210 minute long torture to not feel bad about disappointing her. If I want to be fair I should cancel that appointment today, so she has as much time as possible to find a replacement, but im still struggling for what to do.\n\n  \nSo WIBTA for cancelling the appointment?\n\n(I'm very sorry for my bad english. Not my first language and don't speak english that much, so got kind of rusty.)",

My mother initially told me they would leave the apartment at 10:00 am, so that's what I told the host. Apparently though, they asked the day they arrived if they could leave at 11:00 am instead, and they were told yes.\n\nOn the day they were supposed to leave someone was at the door at 10:00am, asking them to leave because they needed to clean for the next guest. This much I understand, since there was probably some miscommunication between whoever welcomed them and the host I spoke to online, and I was never made aware that they were planning to stay until 11:00am. They were given 20 minutes to leave, and, as they were leaving, my aunt told the person there that it was rude that they were kicking them out when they had agreed to leave at 11:00 when they arrived. \n\nAfter they left, my mom got a message from the owner's wife saying basically \"you are so rude don't you dare give us a bad review because we will give your son a worse one\", which I think is really uncalled for. So I left a three star review, and wrote pretty much what I wrote here.",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to take 3 days vacation to spend with friends?",
      "description": "Okay so backstory - I've been together with my girlfriend for 2 years and it's a bit difficult for us to match our vacations together. Last year we managed to squeeze 2 weeks together (out of 4). However, this year I managed to book 3 weeks (15 working days) on the dates that she was able to get vacations (In other words, I didn't decide when to have vacations, her work decided my vacation) and we are planning to go two weeks abroad and stay one week inside the country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this leaves me with one more week of vacation to take out (plus a few extra days that I get over the year for working overtime and such). And 4 of my friends decided to go abroad for 5 days (Wednesday - Sunday) which would mean that I have to take 3 days of vacation (which would be no problem for me since I still have several days of vacation to use). And my GF would be working this weekend so it wouldn't really affect her much. \n\nBut when I told her about this, she freaked out saying \"You never got out of \\*country\\* with me because my vacations don't match yours, and this years you decide to go to fucking \\*abroad country\\* with your stupid little friends. Its not fucking fair and I hate you for that\". Even tho I had the weekend before this \"friends vacation\" booked with her at a spa hotel (which would not intervene)\n\nFollowed with a text saying how she gives me all her free time and that she does her life around me, but I never asked for all her free time, I even encourage her to go meet her friends more often since she basically never meets her friends and some has even slightly drifted away since she tries to spend all her time with me. Which is also a problem for me because I value my free/alone time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, so I decided to not book the tickets with my friends because I didn't have energy for more drama (ironically here I am) but I was still disappointed with her controlling, so just a few days before the trip (when my friends had already booked) my GF all of a sudden says its okay for me to. First of all the price of the tickets were up, my friends had already booked both flight and hotel, and it was basically minimal chance for my to be able to get days off from work on that short notice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now (a few weeks after) we are still having this argument because she still insists that she was right and that I don't care about her because I wanted to go to \"stupid \\*country\\*\" instead of spending every single day of my vacation on her. Now she wants to cancel the vacations we had planned together because quite her: \"you don't want to be with me anyways, you can go with your friends, I don't care\".\n\nAlso she told me a few days ago that she is going to approve that I hang out with friends on Fridays, but only if she is working (since she works in shifts).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - Am I the asshole for wanting to book 3 vacation days with my friends?",

      "description": "This will probably be a long one, but here it is:\n\nWe have a caregiver living with us since last year. She used to be really nice, then she took a vacation and seems like a totally different person since she came back.\n\nOur agreement was that she would take care of an elder family member and have the weekends off, but she would still live here. We also agreed she would do part of the house chores. I pay her well(i think). She works from 9am\\~10amish to about 13h\\~14h. Not too many hours. After that I take over, and she spends her afternoons and evenings how she want to(and decided to work somewhere else to get more money, which I didn't oppose to). \n\nRecently she's been slacking off on house chores, but I didn't really mind. I kinda did but I'm mostly a very forgiving person.\n\nProblem is: she doesn't buy her own stuff. Eats all of mine. Every month I do a nice grocery shopping so that she and my grandma have good food to eat, and I buy a whole lot of stuff.\n\nYet, she still eats everything that i buy for myself. for example:\n\nMade dinner the other day. Saved leftovers for me to eat on the next day. Woke up to no leftovers at all.\n\nThis happened a few times.\n\nYesterday I ordered pizza and saved a few slices for me and my grandma(and even her, if she wanted to). There were 3 slices. She basically ate all of them, and didn't offered none for my grandma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother stuff that's bothering me are the toiletries. Her room is full of her own stuff, yet she still uses most of mine. Soap, shampoo, even a shaving cream I bought for me, she asked to borrow it and just took it for her.  \n\nEven laundry soap: bought a full pack on sunday. about 1,5kg. \n\nI was gonna do my laundry yesterday and there was. no. soap. at all. \n\nAnd it's not like she did a whole bunch of laundry too. She did hers, only. and the laundry soap just poof'd.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm ok with sharing. I really am.I buy stuff for all of us to use, but i just wonder how can someone use 1,5kg of laundry soap in about 2\\~3 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, we really don't have that many money. I'm almost going on debt to pay her + pay the house bills and there's barely enough money for me to eat. I've been skipping meals like crazy. My grandma and her confort is my main priority.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nam i being a bitch?\n\nis she being a bitch?\n\nwhat should i do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really hate conflicts and I like her(she's not a bad person, i think), so I feel kinda bad that it has come to this(me writing a reddit post trying to understand sides).\n\nWish I could find a way to be more assertive and make her understand my side without flipping out(she tends to freak out when things don't go her way, and can be very rude sometimes).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: caregiver works about 4h a day, 5 days a week. Lives with us, uses most of my stuff, and hides a part of it in her room. don't wanna fire her bc i kinda like her, but i don't wanna be taken advantage of.",

      "description": "I lent my boyfriend $200 a couple months ago, and he was supposed to pay me back a couple of weeks ago. He said that he had a check coming in and it would get done (it didn’t) and then yesterday he said he tried to Western Union it but it got fucked up and he’d try again this morning. We are in a LDR by the way.\n\nHe notoriously has bad luck/is shit at paying me back, and I really need the money to pay my rent (which I technically already paid but if he doesn’t pay me back ASAP then my check will bounce and I will incur late fees which I have no means to pay).\n\nI have expressed to him multiple times that I feel like he takes my kindness for granted and does not respect me enough to prioritize paying me back in a timely manner. I have tried really hard to stay calm and patient, but I tend to have a short fuse and I am reaching my breaking point. I would rather not blow up on him as I normally would, but being meek and understanding is getting tiring. It’s always something with him.\n\nThis time it’s not only that the transfer fucked up but he also says he’s not feeling well. He was diagnosed with (stage 1 or 2, I forget) colon cancer some months ago and has told me he isn’t feeing well lately and just sleeps for most of the day. I called him this morning to remind him to resend the money as he promised he’d get it done today and he seemed upset as if I was being insensitive to how tired/sick he’s been feeling. Here’s the thing: I get it. I feel bad that he doesn’t feel well and that he’s sick, but I need to pay my rent and he promised to solve the issue today. Not only that but he promised to pay me back nearly a month ago, at what point am I allowed to be upset? I’m not asking him to run laps for me. He can send someone else to get it done for all I care! All I’m asking is that it gets *done* and he shows some type of understanding to the urgency of this situation.\n\nAnyways AITA?\n\ntldr; my boyfriend owes me $200. he has cancer and told me that he hasn’t been feeling well lately but i’m insisting he pay me back urgently as i need the money to pay my rent",

      "title": "AITA for telling my dad I only have an hour of time to work on his logo for his organization?",
      "description": "I'm 17yo and my dad recently started his own judo club. Yesterday, told me he had to get a logo to represent them. Since he doesn't want to pay a graphic designer (we aren't poor, money really isn't an issue for us), he asked me to do it for him. I do know some basic image editing, but I can't compose or design for shit. Mainly I do programming in my spare time and suffer from social anxiety, so during holidays I spend most of my time in my room working on a project with a colleague who's overseas. My dad isn't really aware much of what I do on the computer, I'm extremely introverted and anxious about talking to people about my works so I prefer to keep them to myself.\n\nHe has severe anger management issues, and he easily gets angry for any minor thing or mistake that arises. For example, if my mom would forget to put a bottle of wine from the fridge on the table, he starts yelling and demanding it. I didn't really want to turn my dad down because I feared he would get mad at me for not making it for him, even though I am not nearly up to the task he wants me to do. I'm pretty busy and didn't want to spend hours making a bad logo that very likely wouldn't end up being used, so I asked him if it is particularly urgent for the logo to be finished. He told me it wasn't and there was lots of time to work on it until it's finished.\n\nSo I spent an hour working on it with him, made something basic that looks really cringy and ugly, and then told him I had to go work on my project with my colleague who's overseas, because we had agreed to meet up at that time (we rarely get more than 2 hours daily to meet up on Discord and sync our work). He said he was fine with it and I went on with my day.\n\nToday, as soon as I woke up he asked me when I have time to work on the logo again. I told him I'd have some later tonight when he's back home, and he was fine with it but angrily added that he doesn't want me leaving again after just an hour because it's too little time to get anything done. I told him there wasn't any rush and I'm not sure when I'll meet with my colleague again so I can't guarantee that. He told me that we should get it done ASAP because he needs it for a public contest for renting space for training sessions and didn't say much more, we both went on our ways.\n\nI was down to get back into messing around with the logo, and as we started working on it I mentioned I had to meet my colleague in an hour because we can't meet up a lot and we're working on a large project. At this point he bursted in anger and started yelling at me, saying that an hour is too little to focus on making it properly. He started blaming me that every minute less I spend at my computer is a huge bother to me and that I don't have any love or empathy for him. He told me all I care about is that \"box\" and I don't have a life at all, even calling me a \"waste\" and \"washed up person\". He then complained about being unable to reach me because again I'm always at the computer and he has to call me multiple times to do it for him. He then told me there's no point in working on it now because he's so shaken and disturbed and just locked himself up in his and mom's bedroom. I could hear them arguing and yelling about it for an entire hour before he finally burst out yelling and just cut the cord on the router, leaving the house without network access.\n\nI honestly feel like shit because of all the things he called me and said about me, but I think his reaction was extremely overexaggerated. I feel like I could have avoided all of this bull by just telling him straight up I wasn't up to the task and he should pay someone else to do it. What do I even do from here? Right now he's watching movies on the TV downstairs with my brother and mom and I've locked myself in the bedroom because I'm seriously scared of his presence. I'm typing this up on my phone right now as I have access to 4G.\n\ntl;dr Dad wants me to design a logo which I'm not capable of doing. Yells at me and calls me useless and a waste because I oblige to do it but with limited time on my hands. Then cuts off the network in anger.",

      "description": "My mother-in-law was baiting my four year old daughter into saying things she didn't want her to say and then threatening to go home when my daughter gave her the answer she knew she would get to the question. That's the TL:DR version.\n\nThe longer version is that my niece is going through a biting stage right now and bit my daughter last weekend when they were at my house. They came back for Christmas, and now my daughter remembers that her little cousin bit her and doesn't want to play with her. My wife and I are working with her to get over it and explaining that she's been bitten before and that her cousin didn't mean anything by it, she's just going through a phase and learning that it isn't ok. Understandably, in my opinion, my daughter isn't understanding that yet. Afterall, she's only four. This morning, my mother-in-law asked if she wanted to play with her cousin today, and she said no. As she's said every other day that she's been here since she got bitten. My mother-in-law then said she was going to go home if my daughter couldn't be nice. I got upset by that, but knowing that my wife was on the way home, I just told her about it and decided to let her take care of it when she got here. Then a few minutes later she asked why my daughter wasn't happy. I told her it was probably something to do with the fact that you told her you were going home for, in the four year old's mind, no reason. Then a few minutes later she is asking her more questions about why she doesn't want to play with her cousin and my daughter keeps telling her it's because she doesn't want her to bite her again. My mother-in-law keeps asking like she hopes the answer is going to change and I can tell my daughter is getting frustrated, so I snapped and told her in a not so nice tone of voice that it was because her cousin bit her and she doesn't want it to happen again. Now everybody, including my wife, is pissed at me, and I'm hanging out in the basement doing house work instead of spending time with my family. My wife is upset because she thinks I'm intentionally upsetting her family every time they come over because her sister got upset with me a few weeks ago and said I yelled at her when I answered the same question for the fifth time in a row.\n\nI told my wife I would apologize, but honestly don't feel like I did anything wrong. So, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Throwaway account.\n\nI am in college and one of the things I've learned in school is that I need to take breaks when I can. This year I booked a trip for spring break that would keep me away from any areas with reliable cell or internet service. I made sure to book it so I didn't miss any classes. I would leave for my spring break trip after my last class on Thursday and would return a week later on Friday, giving me a weekend to do work for my classes.\n\nFor one class that meets weekly on Thursdays, groups of students are in charge of setting the readings and leading discussion for one class session. I was originally assigned to do this on the second week after spring break. However, during the week before spring break, our professor emailed my group, asking us to change our assigned week leading discussion to the first week after spring break. I said I was not ok with this change UNLESS everyone in the group was ok with me not doing any work until the weekend before spring break because I had previously arranged travel and would not be able to do any work during my travels. Classmates and professor said that was fine, so we were now in charge of leading discussion on the first week back from spring break.\n\nBefore I left on my trip, I reminded my classmates and professor that I would be traveling and not be able to do any work until one week later. No response. Great! I set an automated away message for my email and off I went. I spent a week enjoying myself and returned feeling refreshed. I looked forward to spending the weekend doing work for my classes after time for myself.\n\nI returned to find that the professor had emailed our group the day after I left on my trip, demanding that we prepare our list of readings and complete our presentation during spring break. There were numerous email threads from groupmates and the professor about readings, course logistics, etc., and emails from classmates and the professor about why I was not responding or communicating. I also received a separate email from the professor, saying I was unprofessional for not responding to emails during my trip. This surprised me because A) I had warned everyone about my travel and everyone was ok with me being away, and B) my automated away message served as a reminder that I was traveling and out of range.\n\nI don't know my status with the group. They did all the work while I was traveling, knowing full well I was not able to contribute. The professor's email still bothers me. AITA for not doing any work during spring break?",

      "description": "This is every bit as petty as it sounds but I really want your opinion on it. This past summer a local beauty company opened in town. Everything they sold was rather pricey but since they boasted about the exceptional quality (I believe it's all organic) and I wanted to support small business I would often visit and spend around $50 at a time. I've been keeping up with the company on instagram and they followed me back as well. After recently stopping in and speaking with the owner (who is literally the face of the business; runs all of her own social media, is the only employee etc.) we chatted and she excitedly told me that they planned on expanding. I decided to post a picture of my purchases to my instagram story and tag their account to hopefully bring them some more business. I was shocked that night to see that the company page unfollowed me. I know it's something small but I was pretty upset since she was always so friendly with me and it honestly makes me feel like I somehow did something wrong?  I don't plan on going back now since I almost feel unwelcome. If I message the company and said something along the lines of \"Hi there, for future reference it's poor business practice to unfollow loyal customers when trying to expand a new business venture.\" would I be the asshole? I know this isn't terribly important it's just something that's been on my mind and I'm genuinely conflicted on sending the message.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInfo: My account is private so there's no way it was an accident. After hitting the unfollow butting she would've had to confirm that was what she wanted to do. Additionally her \"instagram ratio\" is pretty poor; meaning that she follows a ton more people that follow her. If she has massively unfollowed loads of people to make the business appear more popular I would've slightly\\*\\*\\* understood. ",

      "description": "I DM for a group of 5 people: Will, Lorraine, Ben, Issac and Holly. I met the latter three at uni, while Will and Lorraine (a couple) are friends of a friend. I'm not am experienced DM but I really like this group as there's always a fun atmosphere around the table. As an additional advantage, the group doesn't have anyone that's a creep which is a real luxury. A while ago we were watching a bunch of YouTubers playing some D&amp;D who were dressed up as their characters. I can't remember who suggested it but somehow the idea that we should do the same got floated around and as it sounded like fun, so everyone agreed. Next session everyone had their costumes ready and everyone looked great considering that we didn't have much time/budget. The session went really well. All of the group seemed to be acting in character way more than usual and as we wrapped up I chalked it down as a really great night and got a lot of great feedback from people there.\n\nA few days later though, Holly messaged me privately outside of the group chat, saying how the costumes Lorraine and Will were wearing had made her feel uncomfortable and that she didn't think they were appropriate, that they were unnecessarily showing off and made the rest of us look inadequate, even if it was unintentional. She also asked me to ask them to wear more next session. Now, I wouldn't say anyone at the table was unattractive or overweight, but Will and Lorraine are both highly physically active people and have the bodies to match, and their costumes didn't cover a lot.\n\nWill's character is a monk, and his costume was basically Dhalsim off Street Fighter: shirtless and with warpaint covering his chest and face. Lorraine meanwhile plays a sorcerer and was wearing a woven bikini top, harem pants and African style body paint (apparently you can't get elf ears for black people). As a DM/DND player in general, I like to think I have a really low tolerance for creeps and the usual shittyness that can come with a hobby mostly populated by nerdy guys and take every complaint I get about someone's behaviour seriously, but I'm not sure I can with this. Like if they'd showed up wearing, say bondage gear I might've had a word but they made sense for them as characters, they weren't showing any more skin than you'd see at the beach, and the outfits themselves wouldn't be out of place at a music festival and the designs were inventive.\n\nEveryone else sent messages saying how much they enjoyed the last session and the effort people went to for their outfits so it just seems like a shame to stop doing it because one of us is made uncomfortable by a bit of skin (as far as I know, Holly hasn't mentioned it to Will or Lorraine). So yeah, am I an arsehole for not taking this seriously? Like I get having body issues, but I'm not sure being intimidated by physically fit people and being uncomfortable around them is a good way to go in life and the session we had in-costume was one of the best we've ever had.\n",

      "description": "So I’m bi and male and have recently become really close friends with another bi guy who’s in a relationship with a girl. Their relationship has been rather rocky lately and she is insecure about he and I being friends. He came over to my apartment to hang out the other night (completely platonic) and she got upset and worried that I’d “fall in love with him.” He ended up spending the night (nothing happened) and she told him “don’t kiss anyone good night. Truth is I do like him, but completely respect their relationship and am pulling for them to work it out. Well, he specifically asked me if I like him and, knowing it could damage their already rocky relationship, I said no. I feel bad about lying but it was so he could tell her she had nothing to worry about. She doesn’t, I’m not going to make a move while they are dating, but I think he deserves better than she’s treating him and while I hope they work it out I also would not be upset if they broke up. AITA?",

      "description": "So recently, I've started to get quite annoyed with my pastor. I've had this issue for awhile now but I decided last Sunday that I would let my pastor know about it.  Just so you guys know, I'm actually an atheist but because of my family I am forced to attend a baptist church. They have this tradition they do every Sunday. Basically, everyone stands in a circle at the front of the church, linking hands. The pastor or his wife will then walk around, applying oil to everyone's forehead as a prayer is said. This is where I have a problem. I have very oily skin, and that's resulted in serious acne. I can't have people touching my face, and I constantly have to use acne products to combat it. The pastor just loves to smear large amounts of the oil in the form of a cross on my forehead, which is the most acne covered. It got so bad that I finally decided to tell him about it. I went right into his office that afternoon and explained to him my skin problems. I politely asked him if he would leave me out of the practice. He then proceeded to attempt to tear me down saying that I was disrespecting the tradition and by not wanting to be a part of it I was condoning the devil. He said that if God wanted me to have clear skin then I would have clear skin or something and I was pissed. I simply said: \"Sorry, but I believe I have the right to refuse, God or not! \"When God cures my acne then Ill join in, but right now my priority is my health\" and walked out. I don't know if I actually disrespected him, but Id like to know if I was in the wrong :/\n\n# Could I have handled it better?",

      "description": "Okay, before the pitchforks come out, let me explain. \n\n* on mobile please excuse poor formatting\n\nWe are both in college, and both in the same fraternity. His girlfriend is hundreds of miles away back home, and my friend (let’s call him Baker) is one of my best friends.\n\nOut of everyone I have ever met in college, he receives the most attention from women when we’re out. He started pledging this semester and is a freshman so not a lot of people know who he is, and if he has a girlfriend.\n\nUsually, when we have our parties, we all get extremely drunk. When he gets drunk, he’ll take his shirt off and dance and garners a lot of attention. Problem is, in about 3-4 instances, girls will give him a look and shoot one back. I’ve never seen him make the first move, but multiple girls have gone up to him and initiated contact. The first two times he was making out with them for a minute or so before he semi sobered up and got up and basically sprinted. But the last time was different. After he finished dancing, he sat on the couch to get a breather and a girl came over and sat on his lap and was going at it with her for about 10-15 minutes before I saw him and told the girl go beat it. In every instance, he’s been near blackout levels of drunk and doesn’t remember any of these interactions. I don’t even think he knows about the last time because I didn’t tell him.\n\nHis girlfriend is also pretty psycho. She’s cheated on all her past boyfriends, and still talks to her ex. Usually when Baker and I go out to fraternity events/social/night outs she’ll hang with him and post on her story so he knows. She’s extremely restricting and doesn’t like him going out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not telling her? I get that he shouldn’t be doing it, but he never initiates, is extremely drunk and usually will realize what he’s doing and never remembers in the morning. \n\nIf so, what is the best source of action to tell her?

      "description": "So, I know the title sounds like a shitpost but I actually do feel bad. I’m a 15 year old male who is kinda overweight and fairly tall, 5’11. To reduce my weight, I have started cycling in my neighbourhood. I put on my headphones and start making laps around my neighbourhood. There are usually a bunch of kids out playing and I always stop until their game (usually football/soccer) pauses. There is a certain group of children who are around 13 years old who always annoy me to no end. Whenever I’m cycling and pass the area where they play, they will throw their football at me to hit me or wave their cricket bats in my face as if to threaten me. I had told them not to do this many times but they persisted. Once they started doing this a lot I stopped responding or paying attention to them. This just made them do this more. I try very hard to avoid conflict and so I used still didn’t pay attention to them.\n\nNow the day of this incident, I was cycling as I usually would and I payed no attention to them. My girlfriend had recently dumped me and my mood had not been the best, to say the least. I know I’m still pretty young but it really hurt. I was in no mood to deal with these kids but I still started to do my daily 10 km. These kids pestered me again and again to the point where I was boiling with anger. As soon as one of the kids hit me with his football again, I got off my cycle and stomped over to him. He started to raise his football to hit me once more but I knocked it out of his hands and restrained his hand by grabbing by his wrist. I shouted in his to not hit me with his football ever again or else I would myself get violent. Once I stopped shouting he teared up and I let him go. He ran away to his house and all of his friends were standing around shocked. I got back on my cycle and after finishing my 10 km, I went  home.\n\nNow comes the ‘am I the asshole part’. Once I got home, I started prospecting about what had occured. I started to feel bad because one: I had made a 13 year old cry. Two: I had fairly violently grasped his wrist. Three: I may have ruined his reputation in his friend group and fourth: I had voided my own ethics and code of conduct. Being very conflicted about what to feel like, I now turn to you, the users of Reddit and subscribers of this subreddit and I ask you: AITA?",

      "description": "I'm using a throwaway just in case the person in question has one as well, but I'm highly doubtful. Better safe than sorry.\n\nAlso, apologies for the length. I want to add as much detail as possible for anyone reading. I've lurked on here before slightly, but I'm not sure if this is considered AMIA worthy. Apologies x2 if it's not.\n\nThis happened awhile ago, but I still think of it time to time and wonder if I acted like an ass at any part of this whole ordeal that ultimately disbanded the friend group.\n\nJunior year of high school, I opted out of continuing to attend the \"normal\" high school in my town, it was too much to handle mentally and caused me great anxiety, so I was switched over to the intermediate school that consisted of about 200 people altogether, so people knew each other even if we didn't want to.\n\nThe first few months were quiet for me. I'm a pretty closed off person and keep to myself most of the time. Luckily though, I knew a handful of people from Junior High that I could talk with, and two of them went from acquaintances to close friends quickly. We'll call them Becky and Derek. Becky, Derek and I would spend time together all the time, so its no wonder why we became so close so fast. I didn't have any other friends besides them, really. Fast forward a couple weeks, and Becky introduces Derek and I to this new girl [We'll call her Tabby] who just moved across the state and didn't have any friends. We took her into the friend group and she fit right in immediately. She has similar interests and personality to I. I stayed closest to Becky because we were very comfortable with one another. Things were going really well for us all and we all hung out at Becky's almost every single day. We'd have parties, hang out in the hot tub, watch anime together and bump music, just teenage things. \n\nWell, eventually we all finally go over to Tabby's house, and we're all [silently] blown away by the catastrophe that Tabby and her mother lived in. They were straight up hoarders [boxes and clutter scattered everywhere leaving only a small trail to walk through. Flies everywhere to the point that clouds of gnats lingered in the hallway. Couldn't even sit in the living room. You get it]. We're obviously all taken aback, and Becky very kindly offers that we all have a day to take the time and clean the apartment together. Tabby is embarrassed but agrees, and I think it's sweet of Becky to offer to take this on because Tabby is obviously not in a very good place and neither is her mother. So, we set a date for this to happen after school.\n\nWell, on the day that we were supposed to go in and do it, I go to school and Becky and Tabby aren't there but Derek is. I asked him what was going on, and he said that Tabby and Becky had skipped school to do the cleaning. I didn't mind, they could get a lot done before we got there. After school I drive Derek and I over, and Becky is gone and some clutter is disposed of. Tabby said Becky was tired from the cleaning so she had left. We helped her clean some more before plopping on her bed and smoking some weed and relaxing. I took Derek home and went home as well. All is fine.\n\nFast forward a little more, and I'm still closest to Becky out of everyone, I'm just comfortable with her and can be myself and she can do the same. We all hang out all the time at Becky's as normal, and she confides in us that she's never had such close friends, or a best friend for that matter. It was an emotional night as we all let go of our emotions and told each other a lot of things. The group gets all the more closer.\n\nSoon, Becky starts talking about an anime convention she really wants to go to but doesn't wanna go to alone [aka, with just her mom]. I offer to go and so does Tabby. We start planning what we need to save in order to go and how it'll be a tight budget but we think we can do it if we stay at a cheap motel for the weekend. Becky jumps in and says that she'll get the VIP tickets for the con and we can stay with her and her mom for the weekend at some high class hotel that is like 100+ a night, and all we have to do is pay her back for the tickets! Hell yeah!\nBecky ends up leaving early that morning to get to the hotel for check in which leaves Tabby and I to make the commute after school. Now, Tabby and I are good friends, but we've never had 1 on 1 time at this point. The car ride is long and awkward. So awkward that we listened to classical music for a good 30 minutes without touching the radio until I cracked a joke about how awkward we were being. This broke the ice and was the start of our super close friendship. We get to the hotel and put our stuff away before leaving the hotel with Becky and heading to the center for the con.\n\nThis is when things start to make us turn our eye on Becky. She claims front seat [no big deal] and we arrive and park. Suddenly, this trip that was supposed to be about all of us having fun turns into everything Becky wants to do. We follow her around like dogs the whole day, only getting to choose the panels we want to go to between the ones she has \"scheduled for us\". I brush it off as her excitement to be there with friends. Until, me and Tabby run out of money. Now, we have no funds to really do anything by the third day, which is the one that she conveniently decided would be the day she spent most of her time in the artist alley. The whole time shes making snide remarks about how \"at least she had money\" [her mothers money. They're rich.] and \"it must suck to be broke\". She also yells at us for not knowing how to put HER cosplay on HER since she was dead set on being someone from AoT. I tell her its \"not my fucking problem\" and she can \"stop acting like a cunt\". \n\nShe rubbing both me and Tabby the wrong way, so instead of being her side kicks we go and sit next to a trash bin instead until she's done spending all her moms money and running around to meet people SHE wanted to meet.\n\nCon ends. We go home. She also has a mother effing cow and kicks my seat the whole ride home since she decided to travel back with us and was not happy that I got the front seat. I told her to stop being an idiot or I'd pop her in the mouth [out of frustration]. Suddenly, Tabby and I are growing closer. Becky doesn't like this, I presume, so she begins making rude remarks about Tabby when shes not around. About her gross house and her \"annoying\" personality. Derek and I don't approve and we tell her when she does this that shes being a brat. At one point I'm beside Becky at her locker when she opens it and some water bottles fall out. She rolls her eyes and decides its appropriate to say \"at least it's not as bad as Tabby's house\". I can't help myself and say \"You're being a real bitch, Becky.\" and I walked away.\n\nI try to see past this side of Becky, she has to feel some level of threatened by Tabby and I's friendship, right? She has no problem with Derek and Tabby being close friends.\n\nWell, Derek and I are hanging out with Becky and she makes a remark along the lines of [I'm paraphrasing] \"I'm worried about Tabby's health but don't know how to tell her. I'm going to get just dance and invite her over to play for at least an hour a day\". So, basically, a ploy to get Tabby to work out and lose weight without directly voicing her concerns of Tabby's health. I also do not understand why she's being so slimy, Tabby and I are around the same size, I'm just a little smaller but still chubby. What's the issue with Tabby and not me?\n\nFast forward, Derek and I are talking about this with a casual friend, Lacey. Lacey listens the whole time and cant believe how grimy Becky was being for no reason. She also casually brings up the fact that Becky SENT HER PHOTOS OF TABBYS HOUSE the day Becky went to clean and was ragging on her behind her back. Derek and I are astounded and angry. \n\nDerek and I go to Tabby's together and sit her down and have a heart to heart about whatever the hell is going on and whatever is going on in Becky's head. Tabby is rightfully incredibly upset and can't believe her friend did this to her and was being so mean behind her back. Derek and Tabby are immediately against Becky, and I'm trying to mediate the situation so it doesn't blow up while Tabby is upset. \n\nEventually, I text Becky about everything and tell her its unacceptable and Tabby needed a break away from her after all of this. Becky breaks down. This break down follows into the weekend of that week. Tabby, Derek and I are hanging out smoking and watching Netflix, and tabby doesn't want Becky around. Well, Becky and Lacey are hanging out, and Lacey calls Derek to say that Becky is having a break down and we all need to drive to Becky's house and talk in person because the silence is getting to her from Tabby and Derek. I will say I was probably the only one who was even mildly texting Becky while the other two went ghost. I thought she was being mean, but it wasn't fair for her to lose her three closest friends in one swift strike.\n\nAnyway, we get in the car and it's dead silent. Tabby is in the front driving and seething. I could tell by her chain smoking and the look on her face. She can't believe that *she* has to be the bigger person and go talk to Becky about all this shit now that Becky was outted. We pull up to her house and Becky is curled up outside her front door, sobbing and won't look at any of us as we walk up. It felt like some teenage soap opera. We stand in front of her, a couple feet away. Becky is blubbering and apologizing, and Becky is simply saying \"I will not talk to you if you're going to be like this. We should talk like adults.\" This doesn't calm Becky down, and Lacey is just sitting next to her on her phone. This goes on for like, ten minutes, just this back and forth of incoherent words and Tabby telling Becky she needs to c",

And in all the time I've known them, they have been extremely depressed and suicidal. They have made several attempts to end it and I have been the one to talk to them down about 3 times. I care deeply for them and would never want them to hurt themselves. But lately the stress from it all has gotten to be too much. I have depression myself and sometimes suffer from suicidal thoughts. I've never attempted but I have thought about it. This friend knows I also suffer from depression and comes to me often because they know I would understand the things they are feeling better than most. Anyway this brings us to the incident I mentioned in the title. Last night they called me telling me that they couldn't go on any longer and they were gonna finally end it. I tried to talk to them for about an hour to hopefully distract them or something. But after awhile my anxiety was getting to be too much for me to handle and I had to tell them that they needed to seek professional help and that I couldn't do this anymore. They obviously were upset and got very angry at me. They told me that because I was abandoning them that they were gonna do it right now. As soon as they said that, I immediately hung up and called the police. Told them what was happening and where the friend was. Thankfully the police and EMTs arrived in time and were able to save the friend. They have been in the hospital since then and will probably be there for awhile. I'm not allowed to see them, as they don't allow visitors at this hospital. I can't help but feel I'm to blame for this. They trusted me and I couldn't help them. Am I the asshole for abandoning them in their time of need and calling the police?",

      "description": "Let me explain, my mother and father are divorced and I live with my mother as well as my sister. My mother is a single working mother and she regularly travels outside of the country because she is invited to company trips where she does nothing but have fun. My sister is a spoiled girl, she never interacts properly with anyone, she tried to meet up with random strangers before, and she has bad grades. I am not so good in school myself but I consistently get better grades than her. But my mother always picks her to go on trips even though i put in way more effort. My grandmother recently came to take care of me because my mother took my sister on another trip again and my grandma is her to take care of me (I am 14). And I just had an argument with her and she expects me to respect my mother and have neutral feelings towards her even though she obviously puts my sister above me (e.g lets her sleep later than me for no apparent reason, scolds me for making the same mistakes as my sister but never scolding her when she does it, is more lenient to her even though she is constantly rude, buys her a rolex for no reason other than that she wants it but won't even but a wifi adapter for my pc so I can move my desktop to my room). I didn't complain before because I know about the tense situation from my mom and dad but I feel very discriminated against and I need to rant.",

One of my doors has no lock, and the other has a lock that doesn’t work, for reasons I will get into shortly. Whenever I am doing anything, my parents burst in without knocking. This is normally fine, but my dad doesn’t know when to stop. If I am changing he still opens the door and I have to yell at him before he leaves, and he once tried to have a conversation with me while I was naked. I used to lock my door, but it frustrated him so much that he tried to throw my door open, and eventually the wood split off. I asked my dad about this and asked them if I could get locks, but he started yelling about how I am being too private and we shouldn’t have locks. So reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "I recently rejoined the dating app world, and things have definitely changed. I consider myself a true-blue lefty and have always supported the LGBT community (one of my nephews is trans). \n\nThat being said. I’m straight and interested in dating people of the opposite sex. I also want a 1-on1, monogamous relationship. I noticed the app was including couples looking to swing, people identifying themselves as  polyamorous, pan-sexual, saipo-sexual, bi, etc. I checked my settings, and nothing seemed amiss. Then twice in 24 hrs I received two matches that were clearly Male-to-Female trans individuals. I contacted the dating site, and in addition to telling me to check my settings, they added this comment: \n\n“Please keep in mind that we have expanded gender options. OkCupid is an inclusive environment where transgender and nonbinary people may express themselves however they’d like. Some people may not conform to how you personally view the gender(s) you’re searching for.”\n\nI’m sorry, but I think that’s bullshit. I can filter by race, religion, height, body shape, etc - but not gender? It’s ok for someone to decide they don’t want to be matched with someone black, or republican, or under six feet (all choices that could be “controversial “), but there’s no way to filter for trans. I get it. They’re saying people are allowed to identify however they want - but I feel like there’s a bigger issue not being addressed - your right to be attracted to who you are attracted to. I’m not interested in dating a trans person and that’s ok. I’m fat. There’s plenty of people turned off by that, and that’s ok. But I feel like this is some PC bullying bullshit. \n\nAnd what a waste of time! I guess I could post a doctored photo that makes me look svelte, but nobody would be fooled once they saw me in person. And being vague about gender is both a shitty thing to do and can be dangerous (plenty of male-to-female people have been victims of violence because of this). \n\n It also seems like a poor business decision. If a dating app becomes so inclusive that there are no filters, you lose functionality. Imagine not being able to choose gender at all? Or age (don’t want to be ageist!). Eventually your just in a huge pool of people. Then what’s the point?\n\nSo? Am I the asshole for just wanting my matches to be the gender I prefer?",

      "description": "Back story, meet my husband whom ive known for 7 years (married last year) who's quite a bit older than me. Hes in his mid 60s and im about to turn 40. I work part time and do ecommerce on the side (ebay etsy etc) so I am always working. \n\nMy husband is retired and he drinks more often than not. On an average month, he is only sober for a handful of days. This is an obvious issue but theres no chance hes going to change for me or anyone else. Frustratuon aside, I mostly feel alone on thr days where hes obliterated.\n\nLast year, I bought two tickets in April for a Halloween concert. Cost me 188$ for special seating too. It was a Marylin Manson concert. He offered to get the hotel and i offered to get the tickets. \n\nFast forward to October, the week before the concert, and he proceeds to drink every day for two weeks streight. I cant even have a conversation with him in this state because his paranoia kicks in and he does the \"poor me\" routine. Not wanting to drag an angry rude drunk around on our two day journey, I canceled the plans and got my money back for the tickets. I had planned this trip since April.\n\nI work hard every week and I deserve to have a good time, especially when I paid for it! Instead I get a sad depressed drunk to babysit at home in between the multitude of things that I have to take care of regarding work and business. I was so let down.\n\n Imagine planning something for months only to be let down by someone elese's drinking habit. When i showed up for work on the night of the concert, I had to lie to my co-workers and tell them that we canceled because he had \"health problems\". I even had requested special days off, so whatever \"vacation time\" i had was wasted.\n\nI planned almost that whole year for that one week off work. I never got it.\n\nTheres another concert coming in August, a band that ive been telling him for three years that I would love to see, and they are finally on tour. \n\nSo am I the ahole for telling my husband that I want to go to the concert alone? I feel so let down from what happened last time. I just want to enjoy one event without having to deal with his drunken behavior and bad mood. He doesn't even like my music. ",

      "description": "My mom's mom is suffering from early dementia/Alzheimer's that seems to be progressing at an alarming rate. Having witnessed my step-mom's father succumb to this disease years ago I am very sympathetic and understanding of the pain and heart break this disease inflicts to everyone surrounding the afflicted loved one. \n\nHowever, with my Mamaw I just cant bring myself to honestly care all that much. She is tied as the most toxic and negative person in my life (neck and neck with my dad). She's seemingly has dedicated her life to pitting  her 4 daughters, 3 granddaughters, and 2 great-granddaughters (my kids) against each other. \n\nI've had extensive conversations with my mom, aunt's, and sisters about it and our conclusion is that ontop of undiagnosed mental-illness (which is rampant in my family) she had a lot of issues with her mother being abusive towards her and favoring her sister because she was \"dim\". \n\nTherapy and life experiences have helps me heal from the abuse and isolation she inflicted on me. I have forgiven her for it's all and the way she continues to be. This forgiveness is for my sake and the sake of building a relationship with my older sister. I've never told my Mamaw this because, to put it bluntly, it's not worth my breath. \n\n\nNow let's get to where I may be an asshole:\n\nMy Mamaw's phone etiquette has not evolved since the 60's. She was always a stay at home mom and unless her Soap's were on TV, she would be on the phone (most likely talking shit about someone). I truly believe that in her mind that since cellphones can go with you where ever you are that if you have it turned on then you should answer it just as you would answer your caller-id lacking landline.\n\nShe would always call when I was at work. At the time I worked as a store manager, so hours were completely random. She refused to believe that when she would call at 6/7pm (peak hours most days for my store) that I was at work and that even if I was really at work that I couldn't have been so busy that I couldn't just answer the phone. She would call several times in a row and would only leave voicemails saying to call her back. The conversations we're always based around my sister's or my mom and typically if I knew why they weren't answering her calls. If she did want to talk to me about my life it was about my short lived history or drug abuse, or about how I shouldn't be doing traditional things at my upcoming wedding since I'm a \"divorcee\", or backhanded comments about my daughter's and comparing the two of them. \n\nOver the summer she didn't come to my bridal shower (the excuse she gave was she just had a perm done and didn't want the smell to bother people, even if that were true it's an outdoor event). She called my sister 11 times during the shower, then called me 3 times, then called my mom who answered to just be asked if my sister was there, if she was okay being there because of her own failed marriage and if I was making sure I didn't make her feel bad about it. \n\nI blocked her number right then and there. \n\nI only intended to do it for a few days, but here we are almost 6 months later and I don't feel bad at all that I still have her blocked. My grandpa has a cellphone that he's learned to use so well that he can participate in our family group chat on Facebook messenger, so luckily I'm able to still communicate with him. \n\nAt Thanksgiving my family was surprised that i still had her blocked. They tried to take me on a guilt trip about her current mental state and health. They insisted that once she gone I would regret it. \n\nI firmly explained that I might regret it, but that was a risk I was willing to deal with. I have love for her feel down, but I dont feel bad about wanting minimal contact with her. I don't think she deserves to suffer, but I don't feel heartbroken about her limited time. I dont feel responsible for pretending like she wasn't awful to me my whole life and that just because she's sick that none of her abuse happened.\n\nThey still don't understand and I don't expect them to. I've unpacked my emotional baggage, and I'm not going to put it all back and join them on their guilt trip. ",

      "description": "A group of my friends and I are in an Instagram group chat together. There’s only about six of us, and we all go to different schools, so it’s almost our only way of communicating with each other. Well, lately (as in this past week or so) I’ve had a lot to do. I’ve had a lot of homework and band/play rehearsals, plus I’ve got some personal stuff going on at home. Because of this, I haven’t been texting the chat a lot recently. I still go on there for a little bit everyday, just to catch up and see how everyone’s doing, but I usually can’t stay for long. It’s not my fault, and hopefully soon I can stay to talk longer. I explained this to my friends and they all seemed to understand. I thought everything was cool. Then yesterday, one of my friends (we’ll call her Louie) messaged the chat and said something along the lines of “fuck this chat. fuck you guys. especially u/iwentintoadream.” When I saw the message I started to freak out. I have anxiety, and was having a mini panic attack because I’d really thought I’d fucked up my friendship with this person. My other friends in the chat immediately started to private message me, all like “what did you do to Louie?” I didn’t know what to tell them. I’d said a few things in the group chat earlier that day, but I’d been doing homework almost all day. I hadn’t talked to Louie privately at all, and we had been fine right before she said that. It took me a while to convince my friends that I honestly didn’t know what I did wrong. I tried privately messaging Louie, apologizing and asking what I did wrong so I would know to never do it again, but she just left me on read. One of my friends told me that she was mad because she thought since I wasn’t active in the chat a lot, I thought she was annoying and didn’t want to be friends with her anymore. But I never did ANYTHING to make her feel like that, or at least I don’t think I did. That wasn’t my intention at all, she’s my friend and I don’t think those things about her. I apologized to her again, and I think we’re cool now, but I still feel really bad. While it was happening, she was posting stuff on her Instagram like “I’m really sad and angry right now.”\n\nI don’t think we’re fighting anymore, but I still feel awful. At the same time, I feel like it was really unfair of her to get as mad at as she did. I honestly didn’t do anything wrong, and even after I apologized the first time, she still wouldn’t answer me. I don’t want to lose her as a friend, but I feel like that was kind of a shitty thing for her to do. Am I the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "I have a friend of more than 20 years. She was a bridesmaid at my wedding, and we have been close for so long. When we were around 18 or 19, she was there for me when I fell in love with somebody who didn’t feel the same way. I was heartbroken, and completely devastated. We used to “fool around” when we got drunk together but I put a stop to it when I found out he’d had a girlfriend the whole time. Like I say - heartbroken.\nI met my now-husband not long after and we have been together for 9 years - fairly happily I might add. However, on a night out with my friend a few years ago we run into this guy and the two of them start flirting. I get upset by this and ask to speak to her privately, but she refuses. I walk away and they start kissing. I get a little angry with her, we have an argument and I leave. I know that I am married but seeing him and then having him flirt with one of my friends bring all the awful feelings back for me. He didn’t want me and I had to deal with that, it was very painful. I’m not entirely sure that I have ever got over what he did to me, or if I ever will. I don’t doubt that I made the right choice in marrying my husband, and I am fully aware this other guy is a complete effing tool.\nShe said to me that nothing would come of it, but I found out they had a few dates and I still see them following each other on social media, liking each other’s posts. Whenever I see this it makes me feel sick. She knew how I felt about him and I know longer feel I can be her friend because I get upset whenever I think about what happened. \nI know that I am married and I was never officially “with” this guy so it could be considered a grey area, but am I an asshole for not wanting anything to do with her, or do I just need to get over this? It is a difficult subject to speak about and I do not wish to rake all this up again, but I am finding it more and more difficult to spend time with her.",

      "description": "Pretty much the title. A few weeks ago, I met and spoke to a girl at a party with my gf who, in all honesty, I found very attractive so I added her to FB just so I could ogle at her pics. She's also an old friend of my sister's (a detail unknown to me and told so by my GF) so I figured there was no big deal. FF a couple of weeks later, and my GF asks me for my phone and checks (she swears she didn't do it on purpose but was searching something else) my recent searches and recognizes her name from the list. She then asks (I remember it a bit hostile) the timeframe of when I added this person, I lie back, admittedly a bad move, that I probably had her from long ago since she was a friend of my sister's.\n\nShe then points out that isn't likely since I didn't know she was my sister's friend until my GF pointed it out, and she gets mad and thinks I'm lying. Now, my plan was never to speak with this chick, which ofc my GF has no way of confirming it, and I can't get mad that she's mad that I added her. Time goes on and she seemingly forgets about this.\n\nFF to last night, she asks for my phone again and I innocently lend it to her (I don't really think I have anything to hide or fear from private message popups and the like) and she uses it to check on the friendship status and shows it to me where it clearly says \"Friends since February 2019\" which obviously destroys my story. I admit to her that I lied and say I'm sorry, explain that I didn't mean anything by it or anything was gonna happen, I responded that from our talk, I found her cool so I might enjoy what she might post online. She then asks the reason I lied then, and respond that I was just trying to avoid a clearly inevitable fight over it.\n\nIn the same argument, I then point out that I have admitted to my wrongdoing and I have said I'm sorry, I had no bad intentions but that I also hated that the reason she asks to use my phone is just so she can keep tabs on me which she denies at first but, as her anger was bottling up, then she just screams \"So what if I do?\" and then kicks me out of her house.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA? I know I'm at fault here and I'm sorry I did it but am i the only A?",

When I'm at work during the week my dad is at the house on his own and sometimes asks one of his brothers or friends for help.\nI don’t expect him to be there when I am working but I must admit it is handy.\nI on the other hand am also an amateur photographer and am sort of the house photographer for a youth organization in our town. I have been for several years now and they are counting on me being there when they have an event. This year I already blew off some activities because of the renovation but as the organization exists for around 60 years they are organizing an extra weekend for all of their members. They asked me if I could come as well and I already said yes. It’s a once in a decade weekend extra but it just happens to fall during this time when we are renovating. So I kind of feel bad that my dad is doing so much work in the house and I’m going on a weekend.\n\nI haven’t told my dad yet as he is recently somewhat stressed. I plan to tell him this week but I’m currently looking to take some extra leave during the week to compensate for the weekend. ",

      "description": "So my BF and I disagree on this. I usually trust his advice since he is the safest driver I know... \n\nBut. I am paranoid on the road. The reason for my paranoia is that I have been in three accidents over my 6 years of driving. Once I was rear-ended, not at fault, the other two... involved hitting a christmas tree in the freeway at night in the very dark spot under an overpass, that was my bad. It was late, I was tired, I was not expecting a tree. Last time I did rear-end someone. My fault. I looked at my gps at the worst time and traffic abruptly stopped. I am not a good driver, but I have been trying very hard to be better... part of that is looking at other drivers so I have a better idea of what they are going to do on the road.\n\n... this looking at other drivers has saved me from at least 3 other collisions where the driver was looking the opposite direction/down at their phone/at their passenger and began merging into me. \n\nIf they are driving erratically, I look at them as I pass because I want to know where their focus is. I almost never catch somone's eye contact, and have yet to have a negative reaction. I am a smaller woman, probably not very intimidating.\n\nMy BF HATES when I look, he tells me that I'm trying to \"make it personal\" and that other drivers will take it as such... I've gotten to the point that I plaster on a serene expression or just a concerned one when I look... I don't want to make someone angry, I just want to see what they are looking at. My BF makes the point that I am taking my focus off the road, but I feel like I have been careful and these glances are hardly even a second as I pass... \n\nAm I coming across as an asshole on the road?",

      "description": "I have been dating my SO for a little under a 2 months now. We agreed to keep it to ourselves for a bit at first, and that was fine. Now that’s it’s been a couple months, my friends have obviously noticed we spend a lot of time together. He has been around me and my friends before, and it’s clear that something is going on. Now, at this point, I don’t mind telling my friends. I would kind of prefer it. He came out to an engagement party with me and my friends and they joked about him seeing other people. I have to specify here, I really don’t believe there’s anything suspicious going on. But the fact that they assume he’s still seeing other people just rubbed me the wrong way. In his eyes, it would be funny if my friends thought we were only hooking up for as long as possible. He gives me no reason to believe he's cheating. He just finds it entertaining for some reason. My friends know that I have broken off things with my previous hook ups and keep asking me about our relationship status. It’s getting kinda uncomfortable to keep lying to try friends and make it seem like we’re not something when we are. I brought this up, but he insisted that we try to keep it up for as long as possible. I asked what I was supposed to do when they try to hook me up with some of their friends when we go out (which happens often), and he said at that point I should tell them.\n\nOn one hand, I don’t want to break any trust we have built up so early on, but on the same hand I’m not a big fan of lying to my friends especially when we’re so open with each other about our relationships. I also am not a big fan of the light this puts me in. In their eyes I have given up all my other hook ups and am tying myself to a person who is still seeing other people. \n\nJust to clarify a few things, I have heard him on the phone with his step mom talking about me. He’s made it clear to her that we were in a relationship. So he’s not hiding the fact that we’re dating from his friends/family, just mine.\n\nSo, WIBTA for just telling my friends we’re dating? He really wants to keep this illusion going and doesn’t want me to ruin it. But I don’t want to be at a point where I’m stuck either flirting with someone at a bar or just admitting I’m in a relationship. Am I just being sensitive? It’s really harmless and otherwise, our relationship is perfectly fine. Of course I’ll bring it up again, but at this point if someone asks I’d rather just spill the beans.",

I'd rather distance myself than feel the pain of a friend rejecting me for their partner.\n\nAnd all my friends who were in relationships where they didn't mind having separate lives and friends have moved and I never had to ask them to ditch their partners, who seldomly if ever joined us.

      "description": "First time posting here. I hope my grammar and spelling errors won't make it a pain to read, as I am a french student.\n\nSo it all happened two days ago. We were about to be tested for our german oral expression. The problem is that about 90% of the school loathes german, but still take it over spanish because it may be useful in the future. It ends up in almost nobody being able to learn the language, as the french method to learn languages is shit (I still have no idea how I got that one godly english teacher, though). So, everyone was panicking because we were all gonna pass the test in two hours, and I had not even managed to learn my text yet. So did my classmates.\n\nSo, at lunchtime, I offered everyone to skip the class before german. It was an hour long class we have every other week where we learn to use our graphic calculators, as it's needed for our math exam at the end of the year.\nThe thing is that nobody likes that class, everyone is bored and we hadn't even seen the professor all day. So? What happened? I encouraged everyone to skip class and practice our exam together, because we were almost certain to all get a 3/20 or something like this oterwise, since we couldn't remember anything we learned the night before.\n\nIt happens, we skip class (we're only 14, but still), even the two students with above 16/20 grades in languages and who are just really good students overall. Everyone studies or chats and we get the test. We didn't get the grades yet, but that's not important.\n\nThen, the next day, the principal comes in with the teacher during our first period and proceeds to ask where we were at x time of day instead of in class. I proceeded to say before everyone else that we skipped class to study for our oral expression and that I was the one who offered to do so in the first place.\n\nThe entire class ended up getting 2 hours of detention and everyone's parents got a message via the school's grade viewing system with the explanation.\n\nLuckily, my classmates didn't turn me down and said they took part too since they agreed to skip class, but that was useless. Every single parent started emailing my mom, talking about how their kid is gonna fail his math exam at the end of the year (we're 12 graders) and that I am a stupid kid who doesn't care about school. This isn't true, I'm working hard and have a good reputation as a student, but I really don't know where to put myself as I got every single one of the students in my class grounded, even the really smart ones, except myself, because my grades weren't inflicted and that I skipped to study, so my parents just told me to not do it again.\nBut really, I have no idea what to think of now...\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Well i finally decided i will share my story, this happenend couple weeks ago.\n\nIam from Poland but i work and study in Berlin along with my older brother and several friends. We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish café) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.",

      "description": "So earlier today I went to a coffee shop and the parking spaces are very tight there. It didnt help that there was a car that was parked too far out (who was preventing multiple customers in the lot to move around) that was making it extra tight. Anyways when I left due to the fact that the car was making it difficult I had my friend step outside to guide me and make sure I didnt hit the car behind me. She does this thing were she literally stands inbetween any potential car I might hit and we make sure I don’t hit any cars otherwise I’d hit her (I know very dangerous but we’ve been doing this for awhile and im extremely careful NOT to hit her) Anyways I was getting a bit too close and she bangs on my car for me to stop so I obviously stop immediently, by then I’ve had enough room to pull out safely so she hops in the car and we get ready to leave before a man interrupts us, here is the dialogue:\n\nSo you’re just gonna drive away and pretend you didn’t hit that car? \n\nMy friend very confused and says “She didn’t hit that car I swear it, I was literally standing in between the cars if you heard or saw her hit it she hit my leg.”\n\nHe insists that I most definitely hit the car and I step out of my car because at this point i’m very flustered thinking I hit the car. A third person in my car a part of my party assured me I did not hit the car but the man was insistent that I did.\n\nHe begins threatening to take a picture of my license plate (which he did) as my friend explains to him and tries to assure him I most definitely didn’t hit the car. I asked my friend “Are you sure I didn’t hit the car?” And then looked to him and said “Sir are you sure I hit the car” and he looked over to her and said “If you’re not gonna be honest about it I can just let the person inside know what she did.” I am not a confrontational person at all and this really made me anxious but my friend began getting very frustrated as he was accusing her of being a liar. We said if we hit the car we had no problem letting the owner know (We really had no problem with that) but he went inside the restaurant. I reflected in the middle of the lot what to do if I should go inside and explain myself to him. But I am so sure I DID NOT HIT THE CAR. My friend is SURE 100% I didn’t hit the car. A man we were friendly with in the coffee place came out as he was curious to the situation and I explained it, he said “I would just leave, you didn’t hit the car.” We stayed in the parking lot for a good 10 minutes to see if the guy who confronted us may come out with a person. My friends all agreed that we should just go so I drove away. But I felt really bad and wrong for this... That man was really convinced I hit the car and I felt like I was a criminal for just leaving ... He has my plate number and I’m afraid if there is a scratch on that car (even if its not from me) I might be blamed for it. I understand he was just trying to be a good citizen and I commend him for that but it really bugged me that he refused to reason with us and accused my friend of lying. It’s just been bugging me all day. AITA for just leaving? ",

      "description": "I posted on here earlier but some things have changed. The situation is this: \n\nI go to a small private school. Seniors, instead of senior privilege, are forced to do work such as washing dishes, sweeping floors, managing concessions etc in order to raise money to go on a class trip. Here's the catch- the trip is NOT optional. I don't want to go. Yet, I must do all the work anyway, making it involuntary. I refused to do it. I posted on here asking if I was the asshole, and the arguments for stronger for the YTA side, so I accepted it.\n\nhere's the updated circumstances:\nI started doing the chores that I was supposed to do in the first place, and I did them well. Even tried to have fun with it. But my homeroom class advisor takes advantage of it I still believe. I no longer have time to eat some of my lunch (I do get to eat some, but not all. The uneaten part goes to waste) and I even have missed part of Physics (my favorite and most difficult class). One day, I was eating my lunch when I was asked, by my friend (not the class advisor) to clean the dishes. I politely told him \"I'll go in when I'm finished my lunch\". he said \"ok. that's fine but hurry up\". and I did hurry up. I guess my friend told the class advisor that I wasn't coming in IMMEDIATELY, and of course she flipped. She cane out of the kitchen and told me to go in NOW. I told her that I told my friend that I was quickly finishing my lunch. and she said she didn't care what he said and that I needed to go in now. I told her I was simply holding up my end of the deal. Needless to say, I finished my lunch anyway and went in afterward. For the record, everything was done on time that day. So AITA for going in to my kitchen responsibilities late?",

      "description": "I recently moved out of an apartment living with three other roommates. One of them, an older man who was on disability for chronic fatigue, was always home and made me feel incredibly uncomfortable (I struggle with social anxiety and depression). He often slept in the common areas and had a very uncoordinated sleeping schedule. I decided this place wasn't for me and decided to move out. I moved out early after my landlord had a showing without notifying me, but still paid rent for the whole month. \n\nNow, the roommate who is older would like to have me pay utilities for the whole month, despite me only being there for half the month. I asked him if he would prorate the utilities and he declined. Eventually, we got into an argument where I told him I was not going to pay for him to sit on his ass all day. He said I \"exploited\" his sickness and a ton of other things. Am I the asshole for leaving early and deciding to not pay for half a month in utilities?\n\nUPDATE: after reading all these and agreeing with most, I've decided to just pay. He's not living in poverty or struggling. The rent is very cheap and he typically pays for utilities then sends us the bills later. One time, he sent us 3 month's worth of utilities in a lump sum and was pissed when we complained. That was when I decided to move out.\n\nIf anyone said something about my anxious behavior causing issues I would try and correct it. He has been texting me and frankly it's exhausting to have someone at his age constantly nag me about me being unreasonable for being upset about him being stubborn and very nosy. I have decided to ignore him as discussing has got us no where.  Even after I told him I would pay, he still feels the need to imply that I am not bright and even brought up a time I came home and threw up claiming that he was bothered by that. I've decided to just apologize to him when I go drop off the keys for what I said. ",

My group has five people in total including me. Two people from my team kept yelling at me because my phone is slower since it’s an older model(SE). It was a fucking kahoot so I tried telling them to shut up but they kept harassing me. And because of that tapping answers was slower. They kept harassing me and I kept saying it is just a  kahoot. They wouldn’t stop yelling at me and I snapped. I loudly exclaimed and yelled “shut the fuck up you idiots”. My teacher heard. I loudly said again they are being idiots for getting so competitive over kahoot. I don’t remember so well what she said but I think it was along the lines of calm down but I said well tell it to these idiots who keep getting mad at me over kahoot. It was the last two questions so I just quit out the game out of spite for my team. We ended up fifth out of six teams in that game. The next two rounds I didn’t play I just let them and they snarkily were like “what place are we in(my name) now huh”. I didn’t say anything. They ended up in 4th in the next two rounds. I didn’t play those last two rounds. Thing was we answered practically all of them correct it was just slower so we got less points.

      "description": "I’ve been this girls friend for years and years (I’m 21 and we’ve been friends since I can remember) let’s call her Claire.\nSo when Claire and I went to high school we went to different high schools, so we kinda lost touch until I was in grade 11. \nThe reason we really started hanging out again was because she tried to kill her self after a teacher, who she fell in love with, told her they weren’t friends and that she had to stop texting her all the time and treating her like a friend. \nMy friend was then diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. \nI didn’t really notice the symptoms that much at first. We were all super depressed and suicidal in high school (I use to be a hardcore self harmer and alcoholic until I met my now boyfriend of 5 years) so the fact that she tried to kill herself shocked me, but I had many friends who attempted suicide so I never really thought of her diagnosis at the time. \nNow, fast forward about 5 years, and I’m ready to rip my head off. \n\nNow let me start this off by saying I understand she has problems with boundary issues, but it never seems like she tries to actually stop them. She will show up at my house if I don’t text her back, or she will spam text me, or text my boyfriend and all my friends asking if I’m with them and why am I not answering her, or she will get her other friend (who I’m kinda certain also has the same boundary issues but for the sake of not diagnosing someone I’ll just say she’s kinda on her side) to text me so that if I anwser her then Claire knows I’m ignoring her. \n\nToday, she wanted to hang out with a mutual friend of ours. And that mutual friend (let’s call her Jenny) wasn’t feeling well, but because of Claire’s boundary issues couldn’t tell her that (because Claire would just try to convince her to let her over anyways) so Jenny just ignored her. It was kinda a thing a lot of us in my friend group do when Claire wants to hang and we don’t because there is no way to tell this girl no. \n\nSo Jenny ignored her, but then Claire SHOWED UP at her house, and Jenny’s mom let her in (Jenny and Claire are cousins so Jenny’s mom is her aunt) but then told Claire that she was sleeping and wasn’t looking like her was going to wake up. So Claire decided “ok, well I’m just going to wait in the living room until she wakes up” and FaceTimed her friend while she was waiting for Jenny to “wake up”. She would also peak into the room to see if she was awake. \nWhen she realized Jenny wasn’t going to wake up (after AN HOUR) she went home.\n\nJust recently she was living with her moms friend for her last semester at college, and just like her teacher fell in love with this lady, and then threatened to kill her self and had to get sent to the Heath unit because this lady told her mom that Claire was telling her about all her problems and that she didn’t know how to help and wanted advice (which Claire knew about because she snooped on her moms phone and laptop to see their conversations because “she knew something was up”) \n\nThis is only a glimps of the last 2 months. There’s way more stories and way more boundaries that she has crossed. I am having a hard time even hanging out with her because all she talks about is herself and her problems and it’s always negative. I’m going threw my own stuff (depression, eating disorders and ptsd) and I can’t Handle the stress and negativity that comes with being her friend. I have tried talking to her about it but it’s like she listens but doesn’t.(says “yes I know I have boundary issues” but never actually does anything to change them) I know I am her 100% best friend, and I fear that if I cut her off she will either threaten to kill her self or actually try. \n\nSo basically, am I the asshole for wanting to cut ties? Jenny is ready to snap too and we both feel super guilty about the whole thing, and we feel like we’re trapped and just want to do the right thing for everyone. \n\ntl;dr : my friend has borderline personality disorder and crosses boundary lines all the time and me and my friends want to stop being her friend but don’t want her to hurt or kill herself.

However, I really hated it as it hurts and just have no pleasure at all. Anyway I agreed for second time as I thought it would get better but it didn’t. So he did not push it often now. However, last time I gave in to anal again as we were in an argument and agreed kind of a forgiveness. \n\nNow onto what happened last night, he has been hinting at anal again the past week and last night I kind of gave in thought I could try and enjoy it. But midway through I kind of chickened out and told him to stop. He got angry and ignored me the whole night while I cried next to him(felt guilty mixed with abit of anxiety attack from thinking about anal/pain). \n\nAm I the asshole ? \n\nTLDR - kind of agreed into anal but chickened out in the middle. \n\nPs.

      "description": "The issue is that my current housemate (A) is planning on moving in with one of my friends (B) who is currently living with someone else (C). We're all university students, they're doing another year while this is my last so I'm not part of the equation.\n\n\nA is planning on moving in with B and C, but as a current housemate of A, I know that she has an unhealthy relationship with C due to an unreciprocated crush. A and C are completely incompatible and will never happen (religious differences) and A knows that, but she still talks about C all of the time. As a current housemate of A, I have to hear about her issues with C, which has become all she talks about. All conversations with A are negative and one-sided towards her problems, making her a very unenjoyable person to live with.\n\n\nI messaged B and warned him of the situation he would be entering if he signed with A and C. He was glad that I told him my thoughts and we met up to talk about it more, and deleted the messages so there wouldn't be a trace. He is left in an awkward situation, having few other options for housing, but was nevertheless grateful as he was already having second thoughts about the house and felt my comments alleviated the guilt he felt over those thoughts.\n\n\nI made the poor decision to tell another of my current housemates (D) about the conversation I had with B, knowing that D was also frustrated by the constant negativity of A. A few days later, after a small falling out with D which is now resolved amicably, D told A what I messaged B. A was predictably very upset, for which I do not blame her.\n\n\nI am now living in a very hostile environment, with all my current housemates considering me to have interfered in something that wasn't my business and exacerbated the negative mood of A (who claims to suffer from anxiety, though has never sought diagnosis or help for it, and consistently embellishes her issues). I still believe I did the right thing in telling B not to move in with A, and only regret my part in A coming to know about the whole situation. If I had known it would all come to light, I would have still have had the initial conversation as I truly believe living with both A and C would be deeply unpleasant for B.\n\n\nAs I think my actions were justified, apart from the telling of D which I regret, I have refused to make an insincere apology to A about the initial conversation. I have expressed my regret that she came to know about it, and apologised for not keeping it between myself and B, which was an error on my part.\n\n\nSince I have half a year left in this house, I am keen for some impartial input into my actions. As a principled person I am hesitant to apologise for the interference, since I do not regret my actions and would do the same again, even in hindsight (minus the telling of D).",

      "description": "I don't have the best relationship with my parents. I've been working on that since I got engaged, as I want my fiancee to have a relationship with them if she wants.\n\nTo help with this, we've tried including my mom in aspects of the wedding planning. My mom offered to cover parts of the wedding, and after considering her list, my fiancee and I decided she could cover the rehearsal dinner and alcohol for the reception.\n\nMy parents live in FL, and fiancee's parents in CO. We are in the NC/GA border. Her mom wanted to come visit and see the area, and at the same time go wedding dress shopping. We tried to include my mom in this, and she was excited to be a part of the dress shopping and meeting my future MIL. But, she's been helping my sister with her kids while my sis finishes grad school. This means logistics with the kids. With 2 months to plan, my mom wouldn't ask their dad to take them early for his visitation with them. And my mom complained about the thought of traveling with a 5 and 2 year old. Understandable.\n\nMy future MIL and my mom have talked on the phone to discuss wedding logistics. MIL thanks my mom for covering the alcohol, and my mom acted like she had no clue. She does this to make people second guess themselves and to make her look flexible and generous.\n\nI talked to my dad 3 days ago. Had a great convo, avoided all the hot topics. But, he tells me that this weekend, they're going to the same city we tried to arrange the shopping and meeting, so that they can see some of their friends. This upset me greatly as this is the same weekend we tried to set it up. And, my mom called the kid's dad and he took them early.\n\nAfter thinking it over for 24 hours, I decided to call and discuss this with her. I told her how upsetting this was to me and my fiancee, and she acted like this was the first she had heard about being invited for dress shopping. And that acting like she had never heard about the alcohol made my future MIL uncomfortable.\n\nTo be clear, we talked multiple times on the phone about these things, and there are multiple texts and emails directly addressing this.\n\nShe of course acted very upset(she's a master manipulator and I've learned most of her tactics). She cried and cried and kept saying everyone must think she's just a bitch(she's always been most concerned with her image), but never apologized.\n\nShe hangs up. A couple hours later, my dad calls me after hearing her paint the image of this convo that she wants him to hear. He berated me for 1 hour and 33 minutes about how I devastated her. I get it, and that was not my intention. I just wanted her to make more of an effort if we try to include her in the planning. He or she never once acknowledged that she hurt us. She has twisted this and made it all about her.\n\nTl;dr: trying to include my mom in the wedding planning is backfiring, she's manipulating everyone and making it about her.",

      "description": "I’ll try to make this as short as possible without giving you my life story.\n\nMy mother was emotionally (and slightly physically) abusive towards me (25f) growing up. She’d call me names (loser, bitch, c*nt) and yell “f*ck you” to me for making small mistakes, even after I made an effort to fix them. She also ignored me (sometimes for days) after we got into fights and never went out of her way to apologize. Here are some specific examples of things she’d do to me:\n- The night before I moved into college (20 minutes away from home) I came home late and she got pissed. This led to her not helping me move in my dorm like we had planned. I had to call a friend and help instead.\n- She got pissed over something (I forget what) and she threw my French horn against the wall of the living room, so hard that she dented it. She then made me practice it afterwards. \n\nThis has led to low self esteem and a high sense of perfectionism in my adulthood. \n\nI live 10 hours away from her now. She was diagnosed with cancer last year, and has gotten surgery and chemo treatments since then. I think she’s still getting chemo. \nI get all this information from my dad because I haven’t talked to her in 6 months. I’ve been going to therapy to try and figure out the best way to approach our relationship. \n\nI feel bad that she’s been sick and that I haven’t talked to her at all, not even a phone call, to see how she’s doing. But talking to her is awful for my mental health. She just sent me an email this morning asking if we can start talking again. She apologized for “whatever she did to make me stop talking to her” but the thing is, I did already tell her (multiple times) why I was angry at her. She should know by now. \n\nAITA for still not wanting to talk to my mom, though she has cancer and seemingly wants to make amends? ",

      "title": "AITA For being a hypocrite about junk food and calling my spouse fat?",
      "description": "Cut a lot to reach 3K, hope it still makes sense. Sorry, on mobile. \n\nSo, I've seen quite a few posts by men who want their girlfriends to lose weight. They tend to end up the asshole, usually because there's some element of \"lose weight to get hot.\" This makes me wonder if I'm also an asshole. \n\nAs long as I've known my husband, from the best friend days to the dating days to marriage, he's always had a little extra chub around his middle &amp; thighs. We joke that with our genes combined, our children are going to have unstoppable booty.\n\nFor a year-plus now, he's been working a job that sucks the life out of him to make ends meet. A side effect (or perhaps correlative) especially over the last few months has been a bit of a ballooning in his weight. He's now currently at the heaviest he's ever been and still gaining. \n\nHe comes home with swollen ankles and feet, back pain, and he's accidentally ripped his uniform pants twice recently (they went from ill-fitting loose to ill-fitting tight). Obviously I hate how much pain he's in, and give him massages when I can, hot pads, etc.\n\nFor bonus context, I'm hitting 8 months pregnant and have also been gaining weight like it's my job. We tell each other that we're chubby pretty frequently and there's a lot of fat fondling in our relationship. \n\nSometimes I crave shit I shouldn't eat and will say stuff like, \"I want (diabetes inducing processed food), but I'm just gonna get fatter.\" He'll reply with hugs and something like, \"That's okay. You're my cute, chubby (embarrassing pet name) and you're pregnant. Let's get (McNasty YumYums).\"\n\nSo, I get enabled almost unconditionally to have whatever I crave, but I still try to reel in my cravings so I don't actually eat shit every day. BUT when it comes to grocery shopping trips or my husband's snack cravings, I have found myself much more worried about what he's eating and will try to talk him out of certain purchases sometimes. It's not 100% black and white, but he's basically the perfect support and I'm maybe accepting 50% of the time. \n\nMost recent example, from last night: We went out to grab donuts because I was craving donuts. As we grab that and milk, my husband asks, \"Should we get ice cream too?\" (This store sells lactose free ice cream in his favorite flavor.) and I immediately said, \"Nah that's going overboard.\" (We always get enough of my craving food to share fifty-fifty.) He didn't protest and we left. \n\nI also bring up his weight gain fairly routinely as a point of concern because of his chronic joint pains. While he doesn't seem to mind, I don't know if I'm actually just an asshole and he's got thick skin.\n\nSo, given the context, AITA?\n\nTl;dr: Hubs's got a booty that won't quit, getting thiccer by the day. I'm becoming a veritable baby blimp myself. We both acknowledge our mutual fatness, but only one of us tries to stop the other from eating abject shit. AITA for being a hypocrite and talking to hubs about his weight-gain related health issues? ",

      "description": "So for my 16th birthday we went to Wisconsin Dells (which is a water park for those who are unaware) with a small group of friends. Everything was fine but one day (stayed for the weekend) we were having fun in the hot tub chatting it up breath holding contests and all that but while we were having a nice lighthearted conversation one of my friends suddenly brings up some family problems out of nowhere (either it was a family member passing away or an argument don't remember) Now for more info on the group, we were that kind of misfit group with social problems like for me it was that I had a bit of trouble with empathy and often relied on my friends and family (or in this case Reddit) to tell me if what I did was okay. For my friend it was reading the mood of the room which you can probably gather. Anyways it got quiet for a second and then we just kind of ignored him and carried on because we enjoyed the happiness of the moment and if we stopped and talked about it the mood would've been totally killed. Had he picked the right moment to say it I'm sure all three of us would've acknowledged/talked about it. But just three seconds ago we were debating if Stewart little could beat Remy from Ratatouille in a 1v1 (not really but it was along the lines of that kind of conversation) we didn't want to stop the good time so suddenly so AMITA or in this case AWTA (are we the asshole(friends))?\n\nnote: before replying I am aware that the perfect person would always stop to talk about it but please think realistically and imagine yourself in the situation before commenting. Thank you!",

      "description": "I started a new job on December 10th. It’s an office job in the healthcare field. I sit at a desk in a small, dark room with three other people. I’m on the phone for most of the day, but my job regularly requires me to get up and speak in person with doctors, medical assistants, and X-ray technicians. Sending emails to various people is also something I do regularly and to pretty much everyone. \n\nIn my specific office location, there are 7 people who work administrative staff (including myself), 18 doctors (usually 3-4 working in the office at one time), about 15 medical assistants, and 5 X-ray techs. \n\nSo it’s been over two months now that I’ve had regular interaction with every single person in the office. When I first came on, I had been the only new person they had hired for about a year.  I consider myself pretty extroverted and introduced myself at the very beginning to every new person I met. My emails that I send to people are also signed at the bottom with my name and position. \n\nSo just the other day I’m sitting at my desk and one of the medical assistants who I literally talk to all the time comes in and hesitantly approaches me. “....what’s your name?” I tell her, and then just brush it off. A second time that same day, one of my other coworkers who I regularly even have lunch with and am constantly working alongside had to be corrected after calling me the wrong name (someone else corrected him). A third instance included a woman who legit introduced herself to me like she had just met me when I had been working with her for over a month. The doctor who obviously knows and remembers me who she works with looked at her like she was insane before just nodding at me saying, “how’s it going today?” \n\nThese are just several examples, and yet this has been happening all the time, sometimes with the same people, sometimes different. I get that they are totally innocent mistakes, but I can’t help but be annoyed by it. \n\nI guess I kind of take pride in the fact that I’ve learned over 50 names in a short amount of time (that doesn’t include the people in our other clinic locations). I’ve always felt it’s an important thing to learn because it shows you care about that person, want to work with them, and reveals a certain level of maturity. I realize I’m also biased because I was previously a flight attendant for a major US airline for 3 years and the amount of names that you needed to learn on a daily basis was ridiculous, but helped me recognize the social importance and how it makes people feel.\n\nBefore flight attending, I had worked in the healthcare environment for 10 years at varying offices and never experienced this kind of struggle from coworkers before. \n\nSo AITA for expecting my coworkers to know my name after two months? Is this a dumb thing to be annoyed about? ",

I was denied my time with my daughter this weekend by her mom and there is more I can go into about but basically that's what upset me as it's court ordered and I have not idea where they are do there isn't much I can do about it atm.\n\nThat all aside I told my gf (25f) that I (24m) was going to a friend's house to have a few drinks with friend and my brother. She refused to come support me because I was having some beer to cope. Now I only had 3 and half I don't really enjoy being trashed. But she then text yelled at me in the morning like 10:30 this morning saying that she isn't gonna wait around for me all day and she won't support my horrible coping habits (I do not drink all the time though it's a big problem for her even if it's just a couple and I thought we mostly worked that out.) \n\nAnyway I think she should've just supported me instead of even the next day just being mad at me still and kinda making it about her and how she's not gonna wait around all day for me to text her (again 10:30am is how long she waited) she is gonna do whatever the fuck she wants when she wants today and she will contact me whenever she feels like it because I in her words obviously don't need her very much. Don't know how that's obvious but AITA? ",

      "description": "My husband and I have been married 10 years and have four kids. I love the whole lot of em, but I'm a stay at home parent and therefore from the minute I crack my eyes open in the morning, someone is talking to me. Much of which is essentially monologuing, not a real conversation. \n\nIn the evenings, my husband talks almost non-stop, too. It generally isn't a conversation, but just endless information, facts, anecdotes (most of which he's already told me) and so on. We have real conversations via messenger while he's at work, but at home he essentially does what the kids do: talk and talk while I listen and interject a 'yeah' here and there. Mostly stuff he knows I don't find particularly interesting, but I'm not an asshole in that I know he has a lot of shit to say so I'll pay attention, even if it isn't engaging. If I am in another room, he'll come talk to me there. \n\nBut by the end of the day, I'm just all done being talked to, or rather, *at*. I don't need all night, but I would love even half an hour of quiet. No talking, no interrupting whatever I'm doing. Just quiet. I just went to bed ahead of him because he talked from 7pm to 1:30 am pretty much non-stop and I just needed to not have chatter going on.\n\nAITA for basically hitting a \"shut up please\" limit with my partner? WIBTA if I flat out told him I need to just be left alone at least a half hour per day? ",

      "title": "AITA For Using A Stock Photo To Sell Something On FB Marketplace?",
      "description": "Context: 2 years ago I threw my best friend an Alice In Wonderland themed bridal shower. I spent a lot of time and money going around to thrift stores and estate sales, purchasing mismatched teacups/ saucers. We let the guests each take a cup home but we had about 15 left over. We had the bridal shower at my parents house and once it was done I wrapped all the leftover cups up, and stored them in their attic. \n\nFlash forward to yesterday, I am at their house and stumble upon the box and decide to sell them on Facebook. I was too lazy and busy to unwrap each one to photograph and then rewrap them, so I used the most obvious stock photo from google. One thing to note is that I had about 15 cups and saucers, and a handful of unmatched cups. The stock picture I used had EASILY 45 in it and it was even a little bit blurred. In my opinion, it was clear that this picture came from the internet. \n\nAnyways, because of my laziness and in the interest of selling quickly I posted them as a lot for $25 CAD (I spent at least $3 / cup and $2 / saucer originally) and got a ton of interest. Probably 15 messages within 10 minutes. My post said “no holds, first to show up gets them”. \n\nMost people were annoying (asking to have them unwrapped and photographed, making complicated photo requests, asking me to drive to drop them off to them, etc) or asking me to hold them for multiple days but this delightful lady messages me saying she is heading there right now and can I hold them for 1.5 hours? She seemed nice so I obliged. \n\nWhen she showed up, I unwrapped one of the cups, stated that I couldn’t be bothered to unwrap them all but if she wants to she can. I believe I said that was part of the reason I was selling them for so cheap. I know I said “if you want to look through them, to make sure you like them, it won’t hurt my feelings. I honestly don’t even remember what they look like at this point” \n\nShe said no, that she trusted me (seemed like a weird thing to say, but ah well) paid me, and left. \n\nThen I get an angry message this morning at 430am saying how she is disappointed that I seemed so trustworthy and ended up being dishonest. She goes on to say that the cups were not the same ones in the picture and that “in fact, NONE of the cups in the picture were in the set”. \n\nI said that I’m sorry she feels disappointed, that I wasn’t trying to be dishonest and that I thought it was clear that the picture was taken from the internet. I told her I’d be happy to give her the money back if she wants to return the cups to me (I had a lot of genuine interest while I was waiting for her to arrive). I had no interest in having this be a big deal and thought that I was being more than fair, considering the chance I gave her to look through them and the fact that I held it for her despite the post saying i wouldn’t. \n\nWell, she seems to expect me to drive an hour and a half outside of the city to give her back her money and take the cups back. I explain to her that I don’t have a car and work full time, and that is just not going to be possible. \n\nTo be fair, I don’t think I ever explicitly stated that the image was taken from the internet. I thought it was obvious but I guess not to everyone. But I gave her the opportunity to go through them when she arrived and she didn’t take the opportunity. And at the end of the day, she got them at less than half the price that they can be sold for. \n\nAITA for not going out of my way to fix this?",

      "description": "I have always kind of suspected my parents weren't the best parents. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because they had 4 kids before age 26 so things were hard financially (then again it's entirely there own decision to have 4 kids they couldn't provide for).  I just recently had a child born in November and I have been ruminating a lot over my own upbringing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Good:\n\nWe weren't homeless, starving or unclothed. I was able to hang out with friends and maintain relationships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Bad:\n\nPhysical abuse both my parents beat me pretty much weekly until I was 15 and moved out. My beatings were for small things like I didn't do the dishes or I was out late with friends. They would even drive around the city and find me at the park and drag me home for no reason other than it was too late; embarrassing me in front of my friends multiple times and making things awkward. I didn't do drugs, didn't skip school, didn't do anything illegal. They would put me down whenever I would try things my mom was born in Italy and I tried learning italian and showed her my progress but she told me my italian sucked. Whenever I tried learning anything frankly they shot me down and said it wasn't good. (tried learning piano for another example). They had no money for travelling, gifts, sports. I couldn't go on any school trips because they cost money, I couldn't play sports because it cost money, I wasn't given any tech toys like video games. Me and my sister decided to get a paper route because we wanted to have money to do things my sister wanted to do figure skating and was saving up for skates. I was 10 she was 11 and neither of us were old enough to understand finances, bank accounts, any of that so we asked our parents to open an account for us to deposit our money in. We worked for 1 year and my sister was doing calculations of how much we made and when she had enough for her skates she went to the bank at 12 and asked to withdraw the money but it turns out our parents never made an account for us and it was all a charade. the money was going to my parents to pay for their smokes or whatever else. My sister never got her figure skates and it wasn't until she was in University did she get to learn. We quit the paper route when we found out about this and talking to my sister recently now 20 years later she still feels sad about it. When I moved out at 15 I was on welfare, renting a room and finishing high school. I received no financial assistance from my parents ever. I had braces when I moved out and when I went to get them off I found out my parents never made a single payment and I was stuck with a $4,000 bill at aged 16 a hole that took me until 21 to climb out of. I luckily got into the #1 university in my country and did well and have a well paying job and will raise my child better than my parents ever did. \n\n  \nWould it be awful of me to cut them out of my life for the way I was raised? I see my own child now and it really makes me so angry thinking of the things my parents did to me and I could never do that to my own child. I felt this way for a long time but it wasn't until my child was born did it really sink in how bad my parents were. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We don’t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they’re fine with what they have. We also don’t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don’t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we’ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I’m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? ",

      "description": "I (38F) was driving around with my husband (37M), looking for parallel parking in a busy area of town. I saw a parking spot that a lady (45ishF) was standing in. She's a human, not a car, so I start backing into the spot. She kind of waves at me like I didn't see her, but she moves out of the way.\n\nAs I open my door to get out, she comes to my door yelling at me that I'm rude. Because she's already yelling, I yell back that she's the rude one because she was standing in a spot meant for cars in a busy area.\n\nThen, the person she was saving the spot for came around in their car and was blocking traffic (there were two lanes, one going in each direction) because she was yelling at me instead of getting in the car. She told me that I almost hit her with my car. I feel like (and I didn't say this out loud) I didn't hit her because she moved out of the way. If she didn't move I wouldn't have backed in.\n\nI start walking to my destination and she is still standing in the lane beside her car yelling at me. Before she gets in the car, she calls me a gorilla. The only thing I have called her during the yelling is rude. And also that she's not a car so she can't park in a spot.\n\nMy husband and I go on our way, then after getting what we were in the area for we head back to our car. I pass the lady again on the sidewalk with her companion (maybe her dad?). I want to ignore her but she sees me and says, \"Oh, god.\" Then stands there yelling at me again that I'm rude and she's going to call the police because I almost hit her. The person she's with called me a bitch. I was very careful not to swear because I'm not sure if that counts as verbal assault or what. He yells at me sarcastically, \"Your parents must be so proud of you!\" And I was like, \"Actually, my mom is!\" He also said something to along the lines of, \"She's proud of you for swearing and calling people names?\" I say, \"I never swore! And this woman called me a gorilla!\" \n\nThe man accuses my husband of calling him an asshole. Which I didn't hear but my husband admits it, and my husband also told them to \"get the fuck out of here\" because the man had called me a name, which I also didn't hear amid all the yelling. The old man (and I admit I laughed at this a little inside) said, \"I never called her a gorilla, I called her a bitch!\" I said again that it was the woman called me a gorilla.\n\nThe woman threatens to call the police and I said, \"Please do!\" Because I feel like how can you argue that a person is a car? And parking spots are for cars? Also, I didn't hit her?\n\nAITA for not driving on and just giving her the parking spot? Is that by default an A-hole move? Because she was so angry it makes me question it. Is there an unspoken code for drivers that if someone is standing in a parking spot, just move on? I argued back because she yelled first. I've been conflicted about this since it happened. When I saw he was older, I felt kinda bad. I just want to add that I feel like if she had said to me civilly, instead of coming at me yelling, \"My dad is an older dude, is it okay if we take this spot\" I would have moved. \n\nI did look up afterwards to see if it's legal in my town for people to hold parking spots. And in a nutshell, it's not, but also don't hit people with cars. Which I didn't.",

      "description": "I am 23 currently live with my GF, her mom, her brother, and every other week I have my son. I moved into their house to get myself and my son away from my abusive father. I was unable to sleep or relax while living with him, and I wasn't financially or mentally ready to live on my own yet. About 2 weeks after we moved my dad was arrested for domestic violence after dragging his GF at the time across the house by her hair. Needless to say we had to get out of there.\n\nAfter moving in with my GF and her family I had occasional run-ins with her brother and her mother, one main issue they have is I am a naturally introverted person, and they are generally the opposite. They now look at things I do like going and relaxing in my room after work, quietly enjoying a movie, and generally keeping to myself as if I'm purposefully trying to be an ass. \n\nAs I have explained everytime this comes up I've dealt with extreme social anxiety my whole life and I have a hard time trusting people. My father made me feel like I did not belong, my ideas were not helpful, and I was a mistake. I have spent my adult life trying to get over these issues I have but it has not been easy. Her mom and brother claim they understand this but continue to talk negatively to my GF about it behind my back. But this isnt even the biggest issue..\n\nNow, after 2 years of living with them I am branded as a total asshole for things I feel i have no control over, nothing I do is right in the eyes of my GF's mom and brother. \n\nEx. One night my son wakes up and his tooth was hurting, he went to my GF's mom first after getting up as she's up early in the morning usually around 2AM. She comes in freaking out and tells us he needs to go the hospital. I said it would be better to give him children's Tylonal and make a dentist app. She starts to get upset and say I don't care about my son. 3 hours of sitting in the ER and a 200$ copay later resulted in the doc telling me to give him pain meds and take him to the dentist.. I was upset. Nxt day her mom noticed I was upset and proceeded to yell at my GF. Her brother joins and both were yelling at her after she had just stepped out of the shower with nothing but a towel on. I hear it and try to defend her cuz things sound like they are getting out of control and she has told me her brother has shoved her before. I go in and they just get more upset and tell us to leave. Her mom says I threatened her by the way I was leaning up against the door (I was simply leaning with my ankles crossed) and that I will abuse her daughter and our future kids because my dad abused my family.\n\nThe truth is I have always been over critical with myself because I couldn't live knowing I hurt people the way my dad has. I would never hurt my family. I've never even been in a fight or thrown a punch let alone thought about hurting someone I love. \n\nThx for reading, my GF and I are working in moving out now, am I the asshole here",

      "description": "Sorry for the long post but tl;dr near the bottom.\n\nI enrolled in a project course at my college back in May. The timeframe is flexible: you decide with your professor how long the course should be (up to 1 year), and that determines how much work must be in it, how harsh it's marked, etc. It's expected to at least be graduate level quality. I decided with my professor I only wanted to devote four months to it, as it corresponded to the spring/summer months and if it were longer, my other courses would interfere with it.\n\nPart of these courses is you go in with a project proposal, it's accepted or declined, and if it's accepted, you do only what you defined in your proposal. To make it more manageable, you can define due dates for portions of the project and a proposed marking scheme. Everything was accepted and off I went.\n\nOver the months and after updating my professor with my progress, demonstrating my work, and discussion meetings with him, he kept asking for more and more. He loved my work but thought I could make so and so adjustments to my proposal and implement them. I was keen on the idea as it could mean better marks. If he liked my work, surely encompassing even more would be better? He continually told me to not worry about the due dates so much and instead focus on adding abc or xyz to my project and just updating him with the progress.\n\nI took his advice. I missed deadlines by weeks. It got to the point where the final due date approached and he told me again and again don't worry about it, just keep working. It worried me because I was soon starting a full courseload but still kept going anyways. It became difficult to manage what is basically a mini-thesis alongside a 15hr/week schedule of lectures and labs, but since I was assured to not worry about deadlines (I assumed my 4 months would end up being 8-10 months), I spread things out a bit.\n\nOn November 1st, I was abruptly told through e-mail that I have exactly two weeks to submit everything. At this point, my project was completely different from what I originally planned to do, and I wasn't finished. I mean, I finished what I set out to do originally but not the added stuff my professor convinced me to do. I had to rush things and admittedly submitted subpar work to my standards. In my summary paper, it was clear things were in disarray but I had a time frame all of a sudden when previously I didn't.\n\nI ended up getting a 20%, not only failing but killing my GPA. I was told it had \"no academic merit\" and he was \"embarrassed\" to be part of it. He said he would never work with me again. How much this hurt me was indescribable: he was my favorite professor, an inspiring force in previous classes I had with him, and we were on a first name basis to top it off. He never replied to my e-mails.\n\n#tl;dr\n\nSigned up for a 4-month course with my favorite professor. He told me to not worry about the 4-months and take as much time as I need to add things to my project not originally in the project scope. I did my best until was abruptly told to hand it in and I submitted poor work. I failed.\n\n#end tl;dr\n\nWIBTA if I appealed his grade? Normal procedure is to hand in material verbatim, but since I got my mark, I've still been working on the project, even knowing I've failed. What I would have considered 55-60% grade material back then I firmly believe is 80-90% material. If I appealed, I would obviously hand in my revised work. The supervising professor left the country for sabbatical and would otherwise be unable to verify the same work was handed in. He's going to look bad and cannot defend himself.\n\nEven if I was caught handing in different work, I have a strong case I think for a re-evaluation:\n\n- I have documented proof of him stating to not worry about deadlines\n- likewise I have proof of him expressing desire for project expansion, which AFAIK is allowed but should warrant extensions\n- and I have proof he looked at my source code but I didn't even submit it. He marked strictly off my report",

I turned down my music and could hear him shouting \"Can you not see the light is RED! It's a damn red light!\"\n\nI did nothing but tell him from my closed car to go on. So after some additional gesturing he walked back to his car, capped off my bad day, and i went home to have a cry. \n\nBut i'm stuck feeling, am I the asshole for trying to make a light while singing from my car?",

      "description": "So, I want to keep this short. I met this guy last semester and hit it off. We were in a relationship with for a few weeks till we ended things on okay terms. It was tough at first emotionally but a bit later I proposed we be FWBs. He disagreed saying the emotions are too raw. \n\nFew weeks later he said hes up to be FWB. We sext some but it was nothing to write home about. During this time he sent me two spontaneous dick pics out of nowhere. The first time was annoying. The second time was to be funny so I told him warn me next time and got over it. Third time I was livid. I told him if it happens again I'll block his number and that despite it being my idea originally I no longer want any type of sexual relationship with him.\n\nHere's where things get a bit complicated. We were still good friends while all of this happened, texted everyday and kept eachother close. I think I'm of partial blame now because last night I broke the plan to keep things platonic and asked how he'd feel about getting a surprise sexy photo. He was all for it and we were sexting like old times. I asked for a pic and he said hes scared to after my threat from last time. I told him it's different because I'm asking. We ended up getting interrupted so I never got the photo although it was no big deal. \n\nCome to today he said he had fun last night and I apologized for going against the platonic understanding. He laughed it off and were texting as usual. Then, out of the blue he sent me a dick pic. I asked what did he send me. He said a pic of his dick poking out of his pants. I asked him wtf and he said its fine no one saw him take it. Totally misunderstanding the point of my annoyance. \n\nSo I responded in disappointment that I thought the warning of being blocked would be enough for him to know better and for him not to text me anymore. He rolled his eyes and only replied with a text saying 'Bye'.\n\nAITA for sending mixed signals? I feel like I made it clear on multiple occasions not to send me unsolicited pics but by also flirting with him would that be giving the wrong expectation? I'm so bothered because me and him have been in touch for so long I feel like maybe I'm being harsh. ",

Before our relationship I have been in one relationship and had handful of one-night stand, where has my girlfriend has been in none and is a virgin. She told me at the start of the relationship that she wants to wait for the right person and the right moment to lose her virginity and throughout the whole relationship the lack of sex has never bothered me because I didn’t want to pressure her into anything that was uncomfortable for her.\n\nAbout a month ago it was my girlfriends 21st birthday and for it I bought her pretty expensive (for a student) jewellery (that she told me she was saving up for at the start of the relationship). \n\nIt was my birthday 2 days ago and for my birthday present she told me she was giving me her virginity. I was pretty disappointed by this as my gift was pretty expensive, thoughtful and had emotional value as it was something she wanted for ages. I always thought sex was mutual thing between people and not something that one person owns and gives to other person. I felt she was just taking the easy way and didn’t put any effort into the present, so I declined by saying I am not feeling it right now. We spent the rest of the day with my friends at party they organized for me. She was pretty unenthusiastic for the rest of the day and yesterday neither of us made any effort to talk over the phone or by text. \n\nAm I in the wrong and apologize?",

      "description": "3 years ago when I was fresh out of college I was walking around the city trying to find a job (back then, I never considered applying through online). After 3 months, still unemployed, my father wanted to hire me in the box company (where he worked at for over 38 years) before he retired. He was the manager of the operations department, I agreed because why not, no one was hiring me in the first place, and I wanted to be \"not a burden\" anymore, financially. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs it turns out and it was obvious from the start that he pulled some strings just so that I could be hired, when he was still in the company, everyone was nice to me at first (I believe I was nice to all of colleagues in return - this was my first job - I was very enthusiastic and naive about the company). After 4 months being employed, he retired, then everyone started to act weird. I was trying to have a clean record so I didn't do gambling inside the company (my colleagues did, but I would never snitch about it because they're my friends after all), I finished doing my job first and then convinced my boss to let me use my personal laptop and showed him that I could make an app that showed a summary of our department's progress and he agreed (but everyone else just wanted to play poker and the boss didn't like gambling), and somehow my colleagues found out what my net salary was and said that it was unfair (I was single with no children, not a big spender, and never needed to acquire debt -  they took loans from the company that's why they had less, and we were payed equally for our jobs to begin with). I found out that they hated my father, but there was nothing they could do to him since he was retired, so they had to takeout their frustration on to me. We had our fights, we tried to make peace but deep inside me I felt scared of being bullied (I know that they can just yell at me that I have a job thanks to my father, but he said that \"I deserve to have my son to have a job there, that's why you should take my place\").  \n\n\nI thought we were all friends but I don't know, may be we still are, but it's just that things are still awkward. After working for the company for 1 year and 4 months I decided to not apply to be rehired (why this odd amount of work experience?, because the company had this loophole policy against asian laws \"that if the employee was hired for 6 months or more they should become a regular\", what they did was they hired me for 5.5 months, and I applied 3 times, and I decided that the 3rd time was my last because I truly believe that there was no chance into becoming a regular employee - I asked a friend from the labor union, but they just said that \"it was your fault for agreeing to work for 5.5 months\" - hence, the loophole worked and the government just tolerated it).   \n\n\n6 months later I found a new job as a public worker, but it wasn't something related to my course and I feel okay about it now since this time \"no strings were pulled\", but my father didn't like the job because my rank was just low with little potential to be promoted. He angrily told me that if I only discarded my pride I would've became the manager that would've replaced him or even higher (I was never the type to share my feelings, so may be he thought \"that I was being pompous about not applying for rehire just because my former colleague hurt my feelings\"). I found out that my father became a regular after 15 years working there, although he became a supervisor for the next 20 years, and became a manager for the last 3 years before retiring. He said I was lucky that I had a choice and that I would've never had to go through what he went through. He also shared how when his former bosses treated him like dirt he would've just sucked it up with his colleagues and friends (I really wanted to talk back at him for that, since I believe that he was lucky that his friends were there with him, in my case, rather than the boss, it was my colleagues that wanted to fight me, and my former boss would not want to get involve with that - I know that he only wanted what was best for me, but I can't just talk to him properly when he was too emotional).   \n\n\nRight now, I found out that he was trying to pull some strings again in that box company, he told me \"since you're just so impatient about becoming a regular, if you worked there again after a year, you would become one, and with a bigger salary than the job you have now\".  \n\n\nAm I an Asshole:\n\nfor not sucking it up,\n\nfor not telling my father the truth (since I told him that the reason for not applying to rehire was that being a public worker was better compared to working for a private company - thinking back then, I guess it was obvious that I left because of my colleagues), \n\nfor not applying to rehire at the box company again since the offer really is better compared to my job now (but the same people are still there, and it's going to be the same reason again why I would be there - the company had the policy to hire relatives of employees in the first place, in a stoic world view of it, it's really not unfair, but I know that people would definitely think that it is especially if they didn't know what my father did for the company with little pay from the start.),\n\nor all of the above (any answer is fine, I am committed to not go back to that box company ever again).",

      "description": "My family used to be large and close, until quite a few members died. Although we all try our best to stay close, naturally it became difficult. But my one aunt and uncle in particular have been horrible.\n\nWithout going into too much of a backstory, a huge fight broke out between my one aunt (C), my mom (M), and my other aunt and her husband (P &amp; R) about a hefty loan that C gave P and R to start a business 10 years ago. P and R claim it was a gift, called us all greedy for thinking it should be paid back at all, paid it back, and proceeded to start a different shit storm about my dead grandparents estate. Then, they threatened to file a restraining order against some of the family for (pretty nicely and not too often) attempting to contact them to reconcile after some VERY horrible emails from P and R. We have all been pretty nice to them in spite of some horrible things they said about us regarding our relationships with our dead relatives. \n\nSo we've cut off all contact. I grew up with P and R and their children, spent every holiday, vacations, and just hang out time with them. This sucks, but they refuse to attempt any kind of counseling or reconciliation, and have instead escalated this into a baseless legal battle. \n\nIn their business, R BRAGGED about how he commits light tax fraud by writing off things that are not business related, uses other people's receipts he finds on the ground to write off, and even has written off entire vacations because he went into one store that related to his business and purchased an item. He paid me cash under the table when I worked for him from ages 14-16. He has never been quiet about these things.\n\nMy question, is WIBTA if I reported P and R to the IRS in hopes they get audited? It comes purely from a want for revenge for the shit storm they have caused and them wanting to attack us with the legal system, but it's not like what I'd be reporting isnt true. ",

      "description": "She claims that her son is going to pay it possibly but the thing about her son is that he goes into depressive episodes and will disappear for weeks or months at a time. She claims that he said he would help with her Comcast bill. Personally, if it was in my name I would just have the service shut off because $184 a month is outrageous. I can think of much better things to spend $184 a month on.\n\nShe said that if he doesn't pay it that we will go halfsies on it but she is not too good about paying her bills on time either. I have a business to run which requires internet to be able to stay in contact with customers. It's due to be shut off next Thursday and I'm trying to figure out whether or not I should just go ahead and pay it. She's telling me to wait till Tuesday to see if he's going to pay it. She just got off the phone with him and no mention was made of this and he may or may not call her back.\n\nIt would be nice if he would pay it but I'm starting to get frustrated because I need to know if I need to just pay it and I'm getting tired of the games. She said he may call her back tonight but that may not happen. I don't understand why she won't just ask him straight out if he can pay it or not. Am I the asshole for being frustrated because I can't get a straight answer about this? \n\nI'm about ready to just go pay it so that way I don't have to think about it anymore but she's telling me not to and I'll be damned if I'm going to lose customers because she was irresponsible and let her son drag his feet instead of finding out if he could do it. I'm just tired of her telling me to wait to pay it. If I do that then I may lose out on business. I'm super pissed. I'm tired of this stressing me out.",

My family enjoys doing favors for other families so much that we have a dog, called Hunter, over frequently, and he constantly tries to harm the family cat.

This has been an ongoing issue for 2 or more years. I have made it perfectly clear that Hunter is the issue, and not the cat, as getting rid of Hunter is the only solution not yet tried. Yes, we do refer to our cat as \"the cat\".\n\nThe actual text:\n\nDRUGGING THE CAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE OF A PREDATOR CONSTANTLY TRACKING THE CAT DOWN TO KILL IT FOR 3 DAYS STRAIGHT.\n\nHunter is to never be allowed back in this house after this session of cat torture. We MUST accept the fact that the SAFETY of our own pets should come before the COMFORT of other people's pets. It is simply too risky to continue housing Hunter, or any dog that attacks cats, while we have a cat. \n\nMy course of action: \n\nI will tell the owner of Hunter the following: \n\nWe are not a kennel. Hunter is truly more than just a mere burden, and he is never to return to this household under any circumstances, due to his threat to the life of the cat that lives here. \n\nEnd of text.",

My father recently got engaged and us 2 moved into a bigger house with my father's fiance (54f) and daughter (18f). I live in the northern midwest, aka Minnesnowta. We only have 2 garage spots open, one for my soon-to-be stepmother and one to share between my step-sister and I. \n\nWe agreed Saturdays would be the day we switch off every week as Minnesota's weather can really affect our cars, as we both have older model vehicles. We also agreed that if either of us were gone for any extended amount of time, the other was free to use it. \n\nShe likes to visit the other half of her family mostly during her week for a few days so I get to use the garage more often than not. I do however give it up when she comes back, and when my week is done as well. However, she either doesn't know or doesn't care what day she's supposed to vacate the spot, and normally if it was even like 20 above outside, I wouldn't mind staying out but we've hit cold snaps quite frequently this winter. My car has taken quite the beating, and if I'm move out soon, I can't afford an extraneous repair bill or worse. \n\nI took this up with the father after he came to me saying he thought it was Sunday, which led to our normal conversation turning into a fight. He thinks I shouldn't be complaining for generally having more time with the garage but I think of it more as a lack of respect/not following the rules and amongst many other things, even this simple thing is straining my father and I's relationship\n\nAITA here, Reddit?",

One thing we used to do regularly, when we were dating, was call each online, and talk throughout the night, until either of us went to bed.\n\nRecently, I texted her to ask about an picture she had posted on her story about a dog. From there, we started talking again, during our conversation, she randomly brought up the app we used to talk online, discord. I took this as her wanting to talk, which I thought would be fun, so I said that we should chat sometime. So we both got online and talked for about 3-4 hours, until I went to bed. The whole chat reminded me of the way she had been when we were dating, and the way I felt when we were dating. So, I wanted to know if she still had feelings for me. So I texted her a day later asking:\n\n\"This might seem like an odd question, but do you still have feelings for me?\"\n\nShe opened it, and has not responded for the past week.

      "description": "So my wife has an apartment in canary wharf near where she works; in case either of us have projects or deals close to deadlines and we have to work absurd hours, usually we live out in Surrey in the countryside outside of the big city. \n\nSo one day after work, she goes to the apartment and the key snaps in the lock of the main door (not her apartment). The services refused to come out as it was something like 11PM and she had no choice but to get a train back home to where I was even though she had to get to work at 6am the next morning, which meant she had very little sleep and was exhausted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day the services rang and their handyman came over and inspected the lock and said that he couldn't fix it and that we would have to call a locksmith and pay for it ourselves because it was her fault. Okay, fair enough I guess, she did break it after all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe both finished work at like 10PM and we book an appointment for a locksmith for quarter past. He charges double due to the late hours but that's fair enough as we don't have enough time. It takes him 2 hours to fix the lock. He says unfortunately its going to cost £450. Given the time, complexity, we don't think this is unfair. He then says bill it to the services as whoever did maintainence on the lock broke lots of regulations and took massive cost cutting measures and the lock would have broken at any point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we ring the services and explain the next day and demand they pay. The handyman then rings us and is aggressive saying we're lying, the locksmith is lying, he didn't cut corners etc. We then send an invoice to the services. The handyman replies to the email and in his footer is his address (which is important later). Anyway, there's a dispute. I get my lawyers involved and we win after getting multiple experts and statements etc. The services company pays out £670 to us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months later (Last Friday), services ring us and tells us someone is coming to make sure all the gas/electric meters in the apartments are working. We make nothing of us, we weren't busy with work and were living in our Surrey house. We go out for drinks in the city and we decide to stay in our Canary wharf apartment as no trains were going to our main home that late. We go back to find the place trashed. Fridge smashed, food all over the place, furniture broken, sofas slashed, TV smashed etc etc. My wife installed a camera in the kitchen and living room because we don't go to that apartment often and so we were extra careful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe look on the cameras. Shock horror, the handyman comes in with his friend to check the meters, then proceeds to trash our flat. We're so angry. My wife is about to call the police but I tell her not to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI call my brother in law, who is the dodgiest bloke I know but he likes me. He gathers his friends. They go to the address the next day at 1Pm and we trash the place worse than they trashed ours. He lives out in Essex but my in laws friends do a great job and sent me photos. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is now fuming at me and her brother for taking it in our own hands. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Backstory. My mom has always been great, but has never picked the best men. After a 20+ year marriage, she caught my stepdad cheating and they divorced. Infidelity aside, he was a world class prick. Misogynistic, racist, narcissistic, manipulative, etc. The divorce was nasty, but my mother made it out and had a new outlook on life. At this point, my wife (newly married) and my mother had a great relationship, like a sit and talk and laugh for hours type of relationship. \n\nEnter my mom’s new BF. At first he seems super nice and well behaved. Slowly, he starts to make little comments toward the women in my family. Never myself or my in-laws. Nothing awful, but things that suggested that he was in charge. If he ever crossed lines, he would pull that move where he pretended that it was a joke and that they couldn’t take it. He, for some reason, really singled out my wife. He spoke down to her and tried to flat out tell her what to do. At first, I didn’t even see it, or maybe ignored it as I grew up around this behavior. \n\nMy wife and I move away (2yrs) then back to for a job. \n\nTo speed up the story, the behaviors that I was concerned about are more prevalent when we return. Racist jokes to my in-laws, booze hidden around the house, etc. I speak to my sisters and they are divided, one likes him, the other does not. \n\nMy mom’s house (which he lives in rent free because of complications with his divorce) has an on suite and we move in while we are waiting to close on our house. I start working right away when I’m gone, he takes issue with everything my wife says or does. She does it all wrong. My mom, is now short with my wife, parroting his issues and judgmental about her lack of job search (we agreed she wouldn’t look until we were settled). \n\nNaturally, we start avoiding them and figure, 3 more weeks and we are out of here. Then he demands that I bring my wife into the kitchen for a family talk and I fucking lose it. I call him out on all of it, anything that has been under the surface gets said. I Tell him I see right through his BS and the house feels an awful lot like it used to when my stepdad lived there. He gets aggressive with me and I jump out of my chair and he backs down. My mom is crying, calling me disrespectful. I am shouting that respect is earned. Blah, blah, blah. We calm down and he apologizes for ME not reading the situation correctly and puts his hand out. I storm out and ask my wife to start packing. \n\nLater my sister calls and says that they are worried about my “anger problem” and since then I have had minimal contact with my mom. \n\nI don’t feel bad about yelling at him. He, in my opinion, needed to be knocked down a peg or two and I needed to defend my wife. I do wonder if AITA for letting this come between my mom and I. We have a great relationship otherwise, but right now I have no interest in seeing her. I just can’t get over that fact that no responsibility was taken on his end and she acts blind to it. ",

      "description": "I'm the middle of three children, the only son of our parents. Our dad was in his 50s when he had us and his 70s when he recently passed away. Our parents split ten years ago and our mum (she is much younger, only in her 20s when they married) had nothing to do with him and is married to someone else now. When we were children our dad was very controlling/domineering, abused the three of us on a borderline if not outright sexual level on top of mentally and physically slapping us around. This never went to the police and our mum wasn't much better off and treated equally horribly and it took until our dad's frailness started to show for her to finally leave him and take us with her.\n\nAs he got older he became physically and mentally weaker, he was diagnosed with arthritis, high blood pressure, had very limited mobility in his legs and needed help to get about so was  considered disabled. Since it took him a long time to get around the home ae needed care to keep him going and my older sister has taken on this responsibility and to a lesser extent so had I. \n\nEventually I started noticing that our dad became more haggard/downtrodden in his temperament and sometimes bruises from out of nowhere would turn up seemingly at random, when I asked him he said he slipped trying to take out the bins. Saw it first hand when he briefly attempted to revert back to his old domineering self when arguing with my sister about something and she grabbed him by the wrist and dragged him out of the way. Noticed again when after a bad fall down the steps he asked for help and she seemed to get snappy and told him to shut up and wait. \n\nPulled my sister aside  and while she didn't admit to doing anything with him she admitted she didn't care if he died any sooner so we could have him out of our lives and get the inheritance we're all owed. Didn't feel any sympathy for him myself because of what he did to us.\n\nA few days ago he died in circumstances that have me wondering if my sister could have done anything to prevent it and I have a stupid semblance of something running through my head condemning me for enabling her and not doing anything about it.\n\n",

Ex was *extremely* abusive, and left me really mentally scarred, to the point where I have flashback semi-regularly. Fast forward to yesterday, talking to a girl who I’d met online as well and known for a couple weeks, and she says she wants to date me. I don’t really know why, it’s likely because I’m a massive people-pleaser doormat, but I say yes, because I like her as a person and she’s kinda cute. Really soon after, I start having *extreme* flashbacks. This goes on for about twelve hours before I tell her I’m not able to keep on with the relationship. She says okay, but keeps on flirting with me into today, when I tell her that in all honesty, I just need to stop talking to her for a bit so I can sort myself out. AITA?",

I am not the daughter in question in this post.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis upcoming fall, my (42 F) daughter (11 F) will be entering middle school and will have opportunity to do school sports for the first time.  The question is about a fall sport; I would like her to do track and field, but she wants to do sideline cheer. She has the best time for girls in her class in running, flexed arm hang, sit ups, etc.   I would like for her to do track because she can be celebrated as an athlete for *her* hard work and achievements. I may be wrong, but I feel that sideline cheer celebrates football players, not the cheer leaders. I have to also add that it may be cultural preference, I was raised in the Ukraine, and we didn't have American football or cheer leaders there.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe wants to do sideline cheer instead of track because she's done gymnastics for a few years, and wants to do a sport that allows her to keep doing gymnastics.  Additionally, she wants to do competitive cheer (a winter sport, which we agree she can do) and says sideline cheer is a good \"warm up\" for this more serious season. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, AITA for preferring she do a sport that celebrates *her* achievements, instead of the football team's?

      "description": "So this happened about 5 or 6 years ago. My mother, sister and I always went to this park that was close to the close to the school we went to. We always went to the park after school and my mom would talk to her friend and my sister and I would just go on the playground.\n\nOne day as I was playing tag with some other kids at the park, I spotted a 10 dollar bill near a tree. I rush over to pick up the bill and stuff it in my pocket. Now, my family at the time was poor, not super poor but below average in income so I didn't want to return it to the principal or give it to my mom.\n\nI kept playing with the other kids and I notice an elderly lady was looking near the area I found the dollar bill. I casually walk towards where my mom who was distracted talking to her friend the entire time I took the money and sat down next to her. I just watched as the lady tried to find what I assumed was the 10 dollars. \n\nI definitely would've returned the 10 dollars if the lady had asked my mom or I as she was looking close to where my mom was sitting.\n\nThe lady looked for about 4 or 5 minutes and eventually left. I felt bad after the whole situation and told my mom what happened. She told me I didn't do the right thing and should've returned it when I was still at the park. My older sister called me a douchebag for not returning the money.\n\nWould I be the AH in this situation?\n\nTl;dr: Found 10 dollars at a park, saw a lady trying to find something (most likely the dollar), didn't return it.",

      "description": "So here’s the deal my group of friends, 2 with which I’m living with, came up with a date to celebrate the birthdays of another 2 close friends on the 14th. I’ve been stressed with uni exams lately and when they suggested that date I didn’t remember it was valentines. We are a group of about 10 people and the only date where we all coincide is that one. They’ve also decided to celebrate it at my flat.\n\nMy gf has got really upset with me because of this first off blaming me for that being the only date and because I was inconsiderate (even though I didn’t choose the date). She lives 5 minutes from where I am and refuses to come to the party. I’ve suggested lunch together and maybe after the party going to sleep with her at her flat but apparently I’ve already ruined her valentines and she doesn’t want to meet up for lunch that day. \n\nI didn’t suggest the date, it’s the only date all my friends can meet up, I’ve suggested other ways of meeting up that day and I wouldn’t mind having a “proper” valentines date night the following day. But she still makes me feel like im the asshole and I just feel tired of looking for solutions on my own and her being the one who holds the grudge on me .",

      "description": "I've (21M) been dating my girlfriend (21F) for about a year now. We have a great relationship - this isn't an issue about us. Her friend (21F) (let's call her Megan) annoys the hell out of me. \n\nMegan has had a few rough times in college. She's not as healthy as she once was/wants to be and she often feels lonely because the rest of our friend group is in relationships. She's a very very sweet and selfless person and we all love her and include her in everything. \n\nBut, in my opinion, there's gotta be a point where we stop feeling sorry for Megan. She often talks about her issues at length, even crying sometimes. For example, there have been a few situations where Megan would be upset while we're all out for the night because everyone's with their SO. She had a poor attitude and didn't allow herself to have fun. The issues she has are no one's but her own, and she's gotta be the one to seek help and/or practice some self love. My girlfriend, being Megan's best friend, is always supportive of her but sometimes sacrifices time with me to be with her so she doesn't feel left out or lonely. \n\nWhile this may sound selfish, I only feel this way because this has been happening since I started dating my girlfriend. I don't disagree with the idea of making a friend feel better, but I guess I'm just annoyed by it after dealing with it for a year. My girlfriend doesn't always approve of Megan's behavior but would more often than not choose to be with her. \n\nAITA?",

She told me last week that she's pregnant, and I didn't react super well. I basically said \"shit\" and freaked out a bunch. She's on the pill and obviously it's not 100% but I was still taken very off guard.\n\nWe had the conversation about what to do about it and she wants to keep the baby. And so do I, I think? I mean I always wanted kids with her, and the idea of aborting our baby is upsetting to me. I think if we aborted it then when we did have kids together I would always think about this one and wonder and feel selfish. At the same time, I just feel so stressed and freaked out when I think about this. \n\nMy girlfriend is upset because I am not happy about the pregnancy. I tried to tell her that of course I will love the baby when it comes I'm just upset because it wasn't how we planned our lives to go? She feels like since we've committed to having the baby that means I should feel happy and excited about it. But in reality all I've been thinking about all week is how it feels like we super fucked up even though we didn't really do anything wrong. We talked last night and she got really upset with me and accused me of not even wanting the baby.\n\nAITA for not doing a better job of hiding my unhappiness about the circumstances from my girlfriend when we both agree and have decided that we want to have the kid?",

Our sessions are quite often arranged very informally and on the fly.  \n\nYesterday, however, I needed to know if they were available as I was being asked if I might be available for somebody else's plans. So, naturally, I make a post in our group, basically saying to let me know within the next few hours whether they would be available at a certain time. This gave me ample time to determine and let the other party know whether or not I would be available.  \n\nMy players, however, took this as a sign of me saying, \"We're playing at this time,\" and ONE of the five messaged me. Given that, in my eyes, it seemed obvious nobody wanted to play, I went out with the other party and had a good time. The time I specified comes and goes and suddenly a few of them are upset: why hadn't I run our game? I explained but now I'm just catching flak and shade from one of the group in particular.  \n\nAITA for going out with the other group last night and, WIBTA for just calling off game plans until further notice since they just aren't putting forth an effort to meet me on the middle?",

I went to the bathroom as I didn't want to get into any drama and when I came back I saw that my friend was beating the fuck out of the kid who was on the floor (I don't think he intended to remove him). \n\nI went and got some help (as he was rabid beyond anything and I didn't want to get into that) and it took several of the staff there to remove him. Unfortunately, for the kid in question he was taken to hospital, had a brain haemorrhage and died. \n\nAnyway, the security cameras cleared me of having been involved and the police didn't need anything from me other than a witness statement. My friend (ex friend) is into jail and it will probably be 20 years or so before he gets out.\n\nI returned to school determined to re-integrate. And it has been going very well. However, the aura of the incident (despite me having nothing to do with it) has followed me. It has resulted in a certain intimidation factor (people giving me their seats etc). \n\nThe thing is that I am not a violent person, not at all. I didn't know my friend was a sociopath but I have been exploiting this fear and I am starting to feel a bit bad for doing so.\n\nI should add that no-one blames me for the incident. Event the family of the child have said that I did the right thing in getting help and my principal has said the same.",

      "description": "Background: Me - 34f; SO- 44m, my son- 5m; stepson- 15m. \n\nMy SO annoys me because he’s a lot harder on my kid, who is only 5, than his own. They both do similar things because my son looks up to him, yet the 15 yr old doesn’t get in trouble for being loud, leaving his garbage everywhere, and being rude. My son gets in trouble for the smallest things, like talking to much. Everyone has seen and noticed this and I’ve brought it up to the SO, but he just shrugs it off.  He’s also really negative and acts pissy all the time but denies it. Example - he’ll open the fridge to get the milk but it’s pushed to the back of the shelf. He’ll heave a huge sigh and mutter under his breath and slam things around. But if anyone says anything, he denies it or ignores them. He does little things like this constantly. \n\nThis afternoon, we’d all just taken naps because we got up early to see a movie - it’s cheaper that way. We were sitting in the living room and my son came out of his room to show me something he built with his legos. Stepson was sprawled all over the living room floor so my son had to step over him to get to me. In doing so, he accidentally stepped on the dog’s paw. The dog squeaked a bit. Stepson starts yelling at my kid about stepping on the dog. So I looked at stepson and said in a slightly raised voice “Stop yelling and calm the frick down.” After which my SO turns to me and growls, “You shouldn’t be talking! You’ve been in a pissy mood all weekend!” I haven’t, I’ve been in a fine mood and I’m thinking he just said that as a rebuttal for me chastising his golden child. I’m basically not allowed to chastise his son, but he’s allowed to yell at mine even though I’ve told him not to. His son broke my hand once out of irritation but I wasn’t allowed to say or do anything and I never received an apology. Try talking to him about it and he usually gets mad and turns it around on me. Every time we have an argument, he plays the victim because when I tell him the things he does that are upsetting, he says I’m calling him “evil and abusive” and it “totally changes” his view of himself. If that’s true and you see how what you’re doing is bad, then why are you still doing it? Just so irritated with all of this. When I’m told I’m doing something upsetting, I make an effort to stop doing that thing. I feel like I am putting in tons of work into this relationship and he isn’t. \n\nEdit: He might have thought I was crabby because he tends to make snide comments about things like dishes not being done, floor needing vacuumed, etc. So I mentioned the fact that he can do those things too. I work 60 hours a week as a nurse and he works maybe 30. ",

When we started, *he* was actually *she.*  I knew she was a bit tomboyish and had some dysphoria, but I didn't know it would be so far as to change their name and identity. I'm just not as attracted to this guy anymore. (for the record, I am bi with a large preference towards girls.) \n\nAnyway. My boyfriend, (let's call him Jack) was always really into me. He was a pretty good partner too. Always sweet and thoughtful and stuff. But as wonderful as he is, I've just not been as happy in the relationship. The transition might've had something to do with it, but I feel it's just mostly me. I'm just not feeling it anymore.\n\n This especially sucks because I know Jack has been having some serious mental health problems. His mother (also we're teens, forgot to mention that) has been borderline abusive, being completely against his transition and going as far as to slag him off sometimes, and his brother has been doing the same. His father lives elsewhere and has been having drinking/substance problems, and thus Jack's been feeling pretty abandoned. His school life is bad, he's falling back in his classes and some of his former friends have been incredibly toxic towards him. Basically he's pretty mentally unstable. (And he also goes to a therapist every week.) \n\nI'm worried if I break it off I'll push him over the edge. I know his mental state has apparently been improving thanks to our relationship and I don't want to see him regress, but I'm also just not happy at all. \n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I broke up with my poor, mentally and emotionally unstable, trans boyfriend?

I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn’t say “I love you too” etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback🔫 \n\nI told her that if she can’t tell her friends by a certain date i don’t think it’s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we’re long distance  \n\nWe’ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We’ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don’t know.  \nHer solution to this is that “I’ve told my friends I’m not dating ANYONE” or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked “yeah I saw him we talked”\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it’s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI’ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn’t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you’ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying “I don’t know if you’re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me” \nAll my friends know we’re dating, that’s a key difference. \n",

      "description": " \n\nMy parents (64M, 62F) have been married for 35 years. I (32M) am their only child.\n\nDad has anger issues and some narcissistic tendencies. He can become upset over even minor things. When he’s upset, he tends to verbally attack, gaslight and manipulate those around him.\n\nMom is passive and tends to try to smooth things over without dealing with them. Of course this only goes so far, and sometimes there are big fights with my mom losing her composure and crying, and my dad criticizing her for being emotional.\n\nThings got very bad in the mid 90s thru mid 2000s. My dad had career difficulties and didn’t handle the stress well. He took it out on us, and though we had food, shelter and nice things, I can truly say life was miserable during this period due to the psychological abuse he inflicted. My mom had a very serious medical issue (cancer) and he treated her like absolute shit, at a moment when she was undergoing chemotherapy and needed as much support as possible.\n\n**OK, THAT’S JUST SAD. WHERE’S THE PLOT TWIST?**\n\n5 years ago, I discovered Dad had been visiting sex workers in various cities regularly since at least the mid-90s, and lying about his whereabouts during these times. I remember him coming home crazy late and he and mom fighting, and him saying he was just working late or whatever. He was dropping hundreds of dollars on these activities each “visit”, during a time when he started a fight with my mom for spending $20 to take me and her out to lunch.\n\nI had a what-the-fuck moment and fully intended to tell mom. But she was out of town, and I confronted Dad first (maybe mistake?) and he got uber mad at me, talked me into thinking I would be guilty of breaking up the family, etc etc. I’m ashamed to say that I let fear guide me then, and I did not tell her, telling myself I would bide my time. But I never did. And at that point I was much more under Dad’s spell of influence.\n\nI also found out mom had suspected something like this, and confronted him multiple times over the years, but he argued with her until he convinced her she was crazy for suspecting him.\n\nThis has been a weight on my soul ever since. I’m a professional artist, and I feel like due to this emotional weight, my creative output has been affected to the point it’s starting to sideline my career. I think the best art tells the truth, and in my heart I feel I’m not honest with anyone when I’m holding this in. Hard to reconcile.\n\nWhat spurred this post is that I signed up for a meditation class. And with that practice of introspection, I’m realizing this whole situation is making me sick and weighing on me even when I push it to the back of my mind.\n\nSo, will I be the asshole if 5 years after finding out, I tip the canoe of my parents’ not-happiest-but-at-least-stable 35 year marriage?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I banned my boyfriend’s friend from our house?",
      "description": "We’re all 25. My boyfriend and I have been living together for approx. 7 months, together for 2.5 years.\n\nMy boyfriend has a friend from college, “Mark”, who has been causing issues in our relationship since the beginning. I’ve posted about him before:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a96xx6/i_have_an_insane_urge_to_offer_my_boyfriend_an/\n\n\nTo sum it up, Mark has some pent up resentment towards me. My theory is that this stems from two issues. 1) my friend, who he had a one night stand of sorts with, wasn’t interested in anything past that evening. It was also one of, if not his very first, sexual experience. 2) Mark wants his “bro” back, and I’m standing in the way. In his eyes, at least. I never try to bar my boyfriend from hanging out with his friends. Mark and my bf were he last two single guys in the group, but now it’s just Mark. \n\nAnyways, if he gets a chance to insult or demean me, he does. Whether it be directly, like saying that “all girls that you meet at the bars are whores” (he was at the bar with my bf the night we met), or indirectly by being an absolute horrible houseguest (refusing to clean up his own belongings that he spew all over our house, that was covered in detail in the second link above) he takes full advantage.\n\nThe issue is, Mark is a little bit of a jerk to all of our friends, even my boyfriend, so they’ve kind of tuned him out and don’t even notice most of this. But I’m not a longtime friend of Mark, so I notice and I also don’t have the same level of patience as everyone else does. They usually say things like “Mark is always like this” or “Mark doesn’t know any better”. Nah, I’m not buying it. The dude is a grown as man and in medical school, he knows that what he says/does is inappropriate and hurtful. The cherry on top of all this is that on the several occasions when my bf has had to talk to Mark about being rude towards me, he only apologizes to my bf. He’s never reached out to me to offer an apology.\n\nAnyways, I’ve had *enough* of Mark. I don’t care if my boyfriend wants to maintain a friendship with him, but I’m done. \n\nHe likes to come visit and stay the night time to time, about once a month-ish average, but I really don’t feel like I should have to put up with his crap in my own home. I’m also worried that, because we’re renovating our attic and turning it into a lounge/bar, that Mark will be trying to come over more often. \n\nWIBTA if I told my boyfriend that Mark is no longer welcome in our home? I don’t care if they hangout anywhere else, truly. I just don’t want him here. I get that this will put my bf in a tough spot, because he’ll be inviting everyone over to hangout and Mark will be pissed if he can’t come, but at the same time it’s Mark’s own fault for being such a jerk.

      "description": "Two weeks ago, my (22f) uncle (mom’s brother) lands himself in the hospital. He can’t walk right, he’s slurring his speech, and giving more classical signs of a stroke. Also, my uncle is 60-years-old and has been morbidly obese for at least 30 of those years. Since he’s been in the hospital, they still don’t know what it is. Potentials are spinal tumor, multiple myeloma, or other bad neurological and/or cancerous things. \n\nNow, have never, ever, liked my uncle. I have never loved him. I know this makes me sound terrible, but it’s true. \n\nMy uncle has always been the kind of person to intentially piss the people around him off. He drives unnecessarily aggressively, has cursed almost every member of my family out (including 10yo me when I was crying because I was scared during a tornado), has always intentionally messed up his “memories” of people/things/teams that others like just to make it look like he doesn’t give a shit (which, he doesn’t), and more. He never tips wait staff, because “it’s their job.” He has ZERO personal hygiene, and spends literally all of his non-work days parked in front of the TV watching “politics” (read: inflammatory “facts” about our country’s “demise”). He has always owned dogs that he neglects so much that I have genuinely considered calling the ASPCA to finally give him reperrecusions for his actions. (And before I get hit with it, I am a LVT in a veterinary ER. I know true neglect and abuse when I see it, unlike most Facebook commenters.) He’s extremely sexist, racist, violently atheist, and just a generally gross person. I have seen my uncle physically gripe waitresses, he has told me that I need a husband because single women “eventually become welfare cases”, and told my mom that she should disown me when I was dating a Mexican guy. My mom says he loves me. I don’t believe it. He has only ever tried to buy my love. He’ll buy me tickets to sports games, amusement parks, and more. After YEARS of him intentionally antagonizing me, buying me shit I don’t even necessarily want, and not making any ACTUAL effort to get to know me, I’m tired of him. If it was up to me, he wouldn’t be part of my life. The way he treats himself, his dogs, and the people around him literally sickens me. This past Thanksgiving, I could barely even look at him. \n\nSo now, he’s potentially dying, and my mom and grandma are stressed. Yeah, they pretty much hate him too, but he’s still their son/brother. To me? He’s nothing. I am not the kind of person to wish ill on others, especially when it comes to health problems, but I feel like karma is finally catching up to him. My mom asked me to visit him with her the other day, and I said no. She understands but still says he loves me and would like to see me. Would I be an asshole for not going to see him? \n\nTLDR; my obese asshole uncle is having severe health problems but after years of suffering through his personality, I don’t care what happens and I don’t want to see him.",

I then go to lunch, while im go e she apperantly comes back with a notepad and a pen saying she needs to help run the department, not a problem in my job but they never told me and it kinda ruins plans if I dont have a certain amount of people so I send a message to that department asking \"what gives?\" I explain what she told us and they said they said no such thing. I get more info on whats going on and look her up in our system, shes doing another job that shes not supposed to be doing. I send her manager a message explaining whats going on and tell him of my evidence and he agrees what she did is wrong and confronts her. She came up to me later very mad asking is she not valued and how shes helped the department, I explain you are valued but what you did was lie to us to get out of the our department after you were told to come back. In my job we need to be tracked otherwise we can get into trouble or miss a deadline if not accounted for. Im told what I did was the right thing to do but I feel like such an ass, shes filing an HR report on me and another associate involved who can testify for me that all these events are true because she witnessed them. \n\nSo am I the asshole reddit?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to go to a college my dad can't afford?",
      "description": "I love my dad to pieces, I really do. \n\nBefore 2008, my parents had a very successful jewelry resale business (AB) that made enough to buy a $900,000 house. When he got laid off as a salesman, my family was okay when my mom went to work for a bank and he took over the business. After the recession, we made ends meet, but AB never recovered, until eventually no orders came (around 2014-2016). \n\nEventually, my mom got a new job that required a lot of commuting, and from the stress arose a lot of tension that caused my parents to split in 2011, and my mom paid maybe $700 in child support. My dad stayed unemployed, and drained his savings and checking to pay for the mortgage for years. \n\nI moved in with my mom in 2015, and I started seeing my dad less and less until it was only partial summer and maybe a holiday or two. As I started high school, I got put into tutoring and prep classes, as well as college courses, that were really, really expensive. For the entire duration to now, my dad has never paid a single cent towards child support or my education because he had no job. \n\nFor a really long time, up until two years ago, I never realized how disappointed I was in my dad for not bothering to work and believing AB would pick up again. After hitting 0, he finally landed a part-time job making $15/hr last year, I began to regain my faith in him, and I was proud of him again. As I toured UCs and various colleges junior year, I found out my dad had said he wanted me to go to a city college that was essentially free, which of course, upset me. I felt as if he cared more about cost than my desire to go to a good college, but I understood- I didn't have to worry about debt. \n\nThis year, filling out financial aid was the most stressful process. I knew I couldn't receive much because my mom's income is considered too high for most schools (though our standard of living is much lower in California than in other states with the same income but w/e), but my dad can't contribute anything (for reference, he made $17k in 2017). My expected family contribution is still high, $30k, but even with my mom's salary increase, it's still nowhere near enough to pay for tuition.\n\nFor years, especially when my dad's accounts were in the negative, my mom has tried to persuade my dad into selling the house and for him to move into a smaller, older townhouse we rent out and haven't fully paid off. He continues to refuse, despite the lump sum, after taking out $80k to give over 4 years, will give him a lot for retirement and better his financial situation, and provide my mom money to help pay for college. \n\nTonight, I told him I got into NYU. I thought he would be excited, but the first thing he said was \"That's good, but the cost...\" and he even asked me, \"What about city college?\" When he ~~argued~~ talked with my mom, he refused my mom's proposals to sell the house and continued to bring up city college and the cost of NYU until I was extremely dissuaded to go there. When I applied, knowing that if I didn't get financial aid and couldn't appeal, I would have to withdraw my acceptance because I don't want to break my parents' backs- because I think anything over $5k in debt every year is too much- but actually getting accepted and talking in a group chat with other students made me realize I didn't want to go anywhere else, and especially not to a city college.\n\nI feel really, really bad about wanting to go. I don't want my dad to worry when he can't even cover all of his bills, and I don't want my mom to suffer for trying to make my dreams come true because she already busts her ass to pay for everything without this college burden. I know I could definitely go to a cheaper school, but I'm stubborn. I know it's selfish, so AITA for being so adamant about going when my parents just can't financially afford it?",

      "description": "Yesterday I was doing my usual mid-week shop. When I was ready to check out, I had a choice between two cashiers about 2m (6.5 feet) apart. One lane was moving clearly faster than the other.\n\nHowever in the middle of the two lanes was stood this lady, obviously waiting to see which line is best, obstructing everyone else from choosing a queue. There was no need for this as one lane was clearly ready for her to start loading her shopping on to. I am aware in some supermarkets this is the usually process but not in this one.\n\nSo I refused to play her game and skipped past her to the faster lane. To which she of course reacted negatively and had lots to say about how impolite and inconsiderate this was.\n\nMy question is - why if she knew my lane was the faster lane, didn't she go there in the first place and continued to wait in the middle?\n\nCherry on top - she had to choose the other lane, something went wrong with the cash register and she had to wait even longer to get checked out, long after I was gone.\n\nI regret nothing.

Well BG pulls out this knife and obviously i'm shook, i don't know why BG has this knife until she finally speaks up, BG asked if she could cut me with the knife while we have sex, i mean; i'm down for a lot of things but this isn't one of them, so i tell her that i'm not down, at this point BG has come over and sat on the bed, knife still in hand; she says ok and i think thats the end of it, until this time BG asks if i will cut her, now at this point my dick is inverted into my body i am hella turned off, i tell her no and that i would like her to leave, after she had left, i hopped on my phone and sent her a message saying that i don't want to see her anymore; now this wan't due to the fact that i didn't like her kink but more because i got no warning to her pulling out this knife.  \n\n\nAm i the asshole?",

      "description": "So back in November 2016 a buddy of mine and his girlfriend (let's call her Emily) broke up they'd drifted apart the breakup wasn't a suprise to many regardless of them having been together for quite some time. I've been friends with them both ever since school same classes group of friends so on so forth and I didn't really want to take a side the breakup seemed amicable no drama or anything. Fast forward about 6 months I'm in the middle East deployed with the military and I'm planning on going travelling in Europe when I get home I've been consistently asking friends to come along if they have a bit of time free but most are busy with work so on fair enough I'm happy to go alone anyway. I ended up texting my buddy's ex like I said we're friends anyway and I know she's travelling in Asia and casually mention that in going travelling in Europe mainly asking her for any advice on it and I just mention that if she's free she should come with me and to my suprise about a day later I get a message from saying she'll come along. I'm quite surprised happy and worried at the same time it'll be good to have some company but I'm worried I may have crossed some sort of line with my pal back home.\n\nAnyway I get back home a few months later and tell my friend about what's happening reassure him that it's not my intention to hook up with her.\n\nSo we go travelling and to cut a long story short about 2 weeks in we end up sleeping together not out of any plan it just happens and have a really great time for the next 3 weeks or so with the intention to break it off when we get back. So she goes back I spend another 2 weeks travelling. Now I also felt really bad that we were doing this in secret no one knew anything was happening we kept it very hush hush and planned on keeping it that way until I told my buddy. So when I got home I went to his house and explained he seemed ok with it but it was definitely an awkward atmosphere so I left relatively quickly. I told my best friend soon after and word started to spread and that's when all the drama with friends started saying that it wasn't fair and I wasn't a good friend and it made both me and Emily feel horrible because it's not like it was a one night stand we actually really enjoyed each others company and wanted to make a go of it and be happy but everyone's opinions kind of ruined the mood. For those of you wondering about time scale this whole ordeal happened in September so a full 10-11 months after Emily broke up with my pal. \n\nAnyway we're in the process of buying our first house together and we're so happy I love her to bits she's a wonderful caring person and I'm happy to have gone through all the shit for her but it still plays on mind whether I did my buddy wrong so Reddit AITA?\n\nTL;DR - Went travelling with my buddy's ex girlfriend 10 months after they broke up and hooked up with her we've now been together over 18 months.

      "description": "TLDR: I joined a slow grow league for a niche game run by a store. There's an entry cost that I paid. The format isn't being followed and I'm unhappy with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey all, throwaway due to uncertainty and limited Reddit interaction. There are a lot of generalizations to make this post (hopefully) comprehensible for non-hobbyists in a specialized product.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently took up a new hobby that's essentially a mildly complex boardgame. It requires people to be invested quite heavily, buying components and miniatures with an optional painting of them aspect, it basically needs the local gaming store to endorse it for it to get off the ground in a serious way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo try to create a local community, the store started a slow grow league. Basically you sign up, pay the equivalent of a reasonable restaurant's main course, then you claim points based on a long list of factors over a month with weekly changes to the size of the game to earn points (The games increase in size/complexity over the month).\n\nThe important factor in this instance is that the first two games you play in a week count for scoring, the ones beyond that don't. \n\nSomeone only got one game in the first week. At the tail end of that week they've requested that they be allowed to have a Week 1 game in Week 2 and have it count toward the point totals. The Game store owner running the league has given this the nod.\n\nI also only got one game in Week 1 as well and could request the same, however I feel that it breaks the premise for the league I paid to participate in to go around the rules and allow a Week 1 game in week 2 for anyone. AITA for thinking the store is breaking their implicit promise on how the event was to be run? There was a two page document put together to run the league, it clearly spelled out how it was meant to work and this is outside of that framework.",

      "description": "To start I have suffered from cold sore outbreaks since I was 4. It's not due to an STD. But I have had crippling confidence issues when they arise. This particular breakout was one of my worst. I don't get the cute ones they use for Abreva commercials. They are to, put it mildly, horrendous, lip scaring monsters. I had plans to see a friend (a new romantic relationship just starting) while driving back home from an 11 hour trip. She was upset I hadn't stopped to see her while driving through, and I promised we could connect on my way back south. However over the weekend a breakout started to form and when it came to drive home Sunday, the flair up was bad. As stated above, it was a record bad one.\n\nI made the excuse that after the long/busy weekend and nearly 20 hours of driving, I had been too tired and my timing was later than expected. It just wasn't going to work out that night. This wasn't a complete lie (it was late and I was tired), but I thought it better than saying I have a lip full of swollen and leaking love bumps. This is someone I am just starting a more than friends relationship with. I didn't want the her thought of me to be one where I have unsightly diseases hanging out on my lip. I have lost people/relationships to this same exact situation on more than one occasion.\n\nToday we were talking and she wanted me to send a picture about something we were discussing while I was at work. I playfully refused, and she assumed I was lying or trying to avoid her. I decided that this is someone I wanted to be with, and eventually I would need to be honest. So I explained the situation, and that while I am healing up my lip still looked rather bad. I really didn't want to show it off. I was asked if that was the reason why I couldn't see her on my drive back. I was honest and said \"yes\", it was probably the main reason. She then went on to say how dumb she felt for feeling bad that I was tired and driving for so long. That she would have understood, and that I lied to her and ruined her trust she has with me. After talking all morning back and forth, it instantly became a \"I have this and that to do, I don't know when I'll talk to you next. Have a great day\" situation. I tried to explain that it wasn't a lie, everything I said had been true, but I withheld one bit and why I'm so self conscious about it. Its been communication black out since.\n\nReddit, I gotta know. Am I the Asshole here?\n\nJust to get ahead of any questions; yes I know all the medications (OTC and Prescribed), herbal remedies, voodoo rituals and at home routines for cold sores. They don't usually work or help in any way they advertise. I have Valtrex for when I start to \"feel\" one come up. But I didn't catch this one because of traveling.",

      "description": "TLDR: At the bottom\n\nSo, a little backstory between me and my friend, we have known each other for years about 4-5 at this point we are both recently out of high school and I got off on a good foot. I got a good job, and was able to go to school to go and start working on my associates. Now my friend also got a fairly good job, but never showed up to work he frequently lied to his employer, and lied to the people he lived with. Naturally he got fired, and was soon booted out of his place by his roommates, I offered to take him in for 300 bucks a month, which is much lower than the standard we have in the state we live in. He accepted and got a job at a large superstore chain which pays very well.\n\nNow gets into the part on why I kicked him out. He started going through the process in which that got him fired from his first job the deceit, the excuse making, and the whining about his job. He never has never paid the agreed upon amount, but instead throws his money away on pointless shit novelty nick-knacks and whatnot e.g. A fallout bobble head that he paid 70 bucks for. The absolute worst straw is that in the two months in which he has been living here he hasn't taken a shower or a bath and has owned up to it, as a result I told him to pack everything up and to move out by the end of the month. He proceeded to tell me that I'm an asshole and that he hopes I get the bad karma I deserve someday.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for kicking him out for being deceitful, not taking care of himself, and hardly going to work?\n\nTLDR: Kicked a friend out for deceit, complaining and not showering, says that I am an asshole and hopes bad things happen to me.",

(niave me) It wasn't until recently that I was made aware of how dangerous this is as one of the sockets blew without it causing the electric to trip which could have ended badly. A few years ago my daughters dad was electrocuted and was flung to the ground whilst re-fitting something (I can't remember, but it is important to make aware of)\n\nI've had two electricans confirm with me that they would condemn the house and that it isn't safe. I have raised this issue with my landlord and he denied it, claiming that the electrics are safe. At this point, I don't even think he has landlord insurance either.\n\nMy landlord has knowingly neglected to keep us safe and has risked my daughters life.

I'm sure a few of you know which one I'm talking about.

I figure it's a non-issue but after we decide to ban the guy he brings up he doesn't think I should be a mod if I can't be unbiased.

      "description": "So my best friend and I (both nearly 17) were with a group of friends and we were playing cards against humanity and drinking (we were probably a bit tipsy) and a card came up about a coat hanger abortion which led to this exchange\n\nFriend 1: I think it’s so sad that some people feel the need to do that, that they can’t get a real abortion\nMy best friend: I think abortion is horrible, should be illegal and I will never support anything or anyone otherwise\n(Basically all my friends were a bit WTF bc we all thought otherwise)\nFriend 2: yeah but what if one of us got pregnant?\nAnd me at the same time: I’m probably going to have to get an abortion if I ever fall pregnant, will you support me?\nMy best friend (which her hands over her ears): whatever just adopt out the baby\nFriend 3: okkkkk let’s keep playing (which we did)\n\nBasically I have a condition that would result in a very very painful pregnancy and a 80-90% chance of having a stillborn, so I’ve basically been told that it’s my health, or an abortion if I ever fall pregnant. My best friend knows all this and knows how upset I am because I’ve always wanted a lot of kids. I don’t think she ever really put the dots together with the whole ‘oh my bff has a v painful pregnancy, she’s gonna have an abortion’. I didn’t mean to put her on the spot with the whole ‘will you support me’ thing, but it kind of hurt knowing what she knew about me (none of my other friends really know about my medical condition other than the fact that I’ve been hospitalised over horrible period cramps). I never knew how she felt about abortion until now, but it makes sense because she is very religious. I feel horrible now because I feel like I made her look bad in front of our friends and put her on the spot and I’m worried that it will cause problems. I don’t want to bring it up again, but I feel like she’s avoiding me. I feel horrible. I don’t think she meant it in a bad or mean way towards me, she was just stating her opinion on the matter",

      "description": "I've been with my girlfriend for about a year. She's more outgoing than I am: I have a few friends that I've known since I was a child that I still keep in close contact, and she has a much wider net of friends that she's relatively not that close with. I'm a very direct and open person, and she's similar, so we haven't had much difficulty so far in talking it out when there's been a problem. Before me, she was with somebody else for a year, and her ex is somebody who she's known since elementary school, but according to her, they used to talk every few months before they had started dating. They broke up a while before we started dating, but according to my girlfriend, the guy was going through a rough period in life, and had few friends other than her, so when we started dating she still regularly talked to him (messaged and called, since we and him are in different countries) mostly about his issues as far as I know. I could empathize with this, but still I told her that the fact that she was in contact this much annoyed me. She said he was a friend, and that she couldn't just abandon a friend because I asked. I realize that I have no right to ask her to stop talking to a friend because it makes me jealous, but still, for the following several months she talked to him much less often. Recently she again started talking to him regularly, \"only sharing funny stuff on the internet\" according to her, but I got mad and shared this with her. Again she brought up the fact that he is an old friend, and I try to understand, but this does not help how I feel about this. Every time I see a message notification from him when we're, say, playing/watching on her iPad my mood goes down noticably, and this causes some friction between us.\n\n​\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way? I'm not sure how I should be feeling about this. All of this just makes me unable to think long-term with her, and occasionally makes me want to not invest a lot in the relationship.\n",

I also used the task record I keep to fact check his claims of me not following through on projects by showing evidence that I submitted said projects for approval in a very timely manner and even reminded him several times that they need approval to which he never responded to me. I was very respectful used no vulgar language formatted it as healthy request for feedback and open forum for suggestion.

      "description": "Sorry if this is formatted wrong\n\nAnyways, let me explain the situation. About two days ago, my grandmother invited her friend and their family over (a total of about 6 people), and served them food. \n\nThe problem with this is that the food wasn't JUST hers. My mother had made it (a large pot of soup) to feed the 10-11 people that already live here, and I feel like it was wrong for my grandmother to just use what was left of the soup to give to her friends (the soup was supposed to be for my father and brothers when they got home.)\n\nNow, yeah, I know it's polite giving guests food,  but my grandmother didn't contribute at ALL to buy the ingredients needed to make the food, nor did she help make it (All of the 6 adults that live in this house contribute to groceries, except her) (Note; She isn't jobless or anything, and according to her, she does make money.) She didn't ask if she could give it away either. \n\nBut I feel like i'm in the wrong for being mad at her about all of this, since she is one of the owners of the house that my family lives in. AITA for being upset with her?",

      "description": "I was in my car and got to texting a friend who said she had just went gym which is around a 15 minutes drive from where I was. She said she hadn’t eaten properly (eating disorder), didn’t have money (not sure how true this is) and was too tired to even move. I called and she was already angry but I remained calm and it was obvious she wanted a lift so I said ok, drop your location and I’ll be there soon. \n\nSo I go to her location and it’s a no drive zone. I call her asking her if she can walk a little bit to me as I didn’t know where she was exactly but she just got really extraction at me saying you’ve tried to make the situation better but you’ve just made it worse and you always do this and just going on about why I drove there and not to her exactly. She was really close, like 5 minutes maximum walk. \n\nAfter she said that I just told her I’m going back and she can get her own ride. Still not sure how she got back but whatever. After that she texted me saying it was really unfair for me to leave her so quickly and not talk it out at least and put up with it. I’m still not sure if I should have. Another thing that annoyed me about the situation is she kept mentioning she really wants food and I’m assuming she wanted me to buy her food. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nAlso some random background info, she’s been a friend for a few months and she helped me out of a really tough spot a while ago. Since then I’ve been doing really good but she still seems to have the same bad habits, same mentality and every time we meet I feel like the conversation is always about her problems and me trying to support her. I genuinely feel like I’ve helped her when she’s been in a tough spot as well but atm, I kinda feel guilt tripped to stick through her anger/depressive moods because she helped me? I DO want to help her but she makes it really hard to and I feel like I’m sort of the emotional sponge here and my job is literally to cheer her up every time we meet. She said that she only does that because I never talk about myself but she doesn’t really give me a chance to and she never asks questions about me. I’m positive it’s not just me being a plank either because I’ve been talking to a lot of people lately and I’ve never felt conversations were this one sided with anyone else. \n\nSo I guess a double AITA? Am I being a bad friend for not wanting to help her with problems even though she helped me with mine? ",

      "description": "Throwaway coz reasons. So my wife recently received a not insignificant amount of money after her parent passed away. \n\nFor background we have always pooled our money together to pay bills and expenses and split the remainder IF there was anything left. Over the years my contributions have been higher 99% of the time as my wife’s work is sporadic. Sometimes through her decisions sometimes through no fault of her own. She has always been not great with money and regularly overspends on herself and the household outside of our budget leaving nothing left to split once everything is covered.\n\nWe initially discussed using this money to finally clear our debts which would have used just under half of the inheritance (We have been paying the minimum for as long as I can remember as there is never anything left at the end of the month to tackle these). I can’t remember the exact timing but I think it was just before everything was to be finalised she suggested we not do that as it would use up a fair chunk and instead we should pay one debt and save the rest. I was in agreement as given where the money came from I didn’t think it was my place to really have a say.\n\nFull disclosure: We both added to this one debt by buying some (very much needed) clothing which doubled the debt and this was then paid off.\n\nSince then she has also bought herself, with my agreement some not inexpensive items that she had wanted for some time now and I would guess about a quarter is gone. She is still spending on smaller items but I’m starting to resent the fact that in my opinion she now has a personal slush fund for herself to use as she pleases while we still have the majority of our debts that I can’t really do anything with as my income is used to cover all the expenses. Her income is so sporadic and generally never enough to cover half.\n\nMy ideal would be to suggest she either keeps using her slush fund but contributes 50% of the expenses each month. This would let me have something at the end of the month/ Clear our debts while we still can or/ Stick will the plan and save what’s left.\n\nI should also add that the majority of the debt is credit card debts run up to cover our living expenses when her income was low.\n\nSo will I be the asshole if I try to have a say in how this money should be used?",

      "description": "Okay so this happened while I was in school, and in one of my classes we were just having a work day and I pull out my phone and ya know doing whatever, minding my own business. My friend is sitting next to me and doing the same. Then they begin to film a video, and smack my face. They were doing it as a joke and found it to be very funny but I didn't find that to be funny at all. It wasn't that hard of a smack but it wasn't a light tap either. Anyways, my first thought was to hit them back but I chose not to because I knew that would just escalate things and I just decided to move away just ignored them, like didn't acknowledge their existed which seemed petty to them instead of giving them what I believed they deserved. They said I took it personally and too far and that it was a joke. That made me a little more upset because I think that I was allowed to react how I did, feel how I felt. I will react however I feel is appropriate for a situation w/ conflict. I don't know, it's hard to not feel like an asshole for them saying that but whether I was an asshole or not, I think my choice was certainly better than engaging in conflict w/ them.

Since I’m still a student, I can purchase tickets at a discounted price ($20 instead of $200 for similar seats). \n\nTwice during the first act and again during the second act a baby started crying during the show. It happened during some of the more serious moments of the show and I was very annoyed. \n\nI turned to my friends during intermission and after the show and said: who brings a baby to a show? I was really annoyed but my friends (who aren’t usually theatre goers) thought it was no big deal. They said maybe the parents couldn’t get a babysitter or something and I should have empathy for the parents.\n\nAm I the asshole for having no sympathy for the parents? If you can’t make arrangements for your baby, then you can’t go see a play or musical.  Wait until the kid is old enough to control their actions and possibly even enjoy the show. It’s not like you can easily leave the theatre if the baby decides its time to cry. It’s dark and it takes a minute to maneuver to the door. It’s a situation the parents can avoid (unlike babies crying in the supermarket or on a plane). \n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "My friend and I have our first 2 classes together, so we usually wait for each other and walk to our next class together. She got mad at me not long ago because I didn’t wait for her after 1st period. I told her that I didn’t always have to wait for her, and that it wasn’t like that she’d always wait for me before. She said that she had always waited for me, and then after that we didn’t speak for the whole day.\n\nBefore any of this happened we’d always sat together on the bus and at lunch. I’m not very good at talking to people or making friends so I wasn’t very close with the other girls at the table. After what happened before, she’d been ignoring me on the bus and at lunch, and since I wasn’t close to any of the other girls at the table I stopped sitting with her and went to sit with my other friend, and stopped sitting with her on the bus.\n\nAnd then later, she confronted me about how I stopped sitting with her on the bus. I told her that I stopped sitting with her because she was ignoring me, but then she told me that I was the one ignoring her. She then proceeded to start complaining about how she was the one who always started the conversations and that I never started any. I told her that it wasn’t true, because it wasn’t. Even if it wasn’t as often as she started them, I know that I’ve started a lot of our conversations. She then told me about how the other day she’d said hi to me and tried to start a conversation with me and that I hadn’t responded, even though I said hi back to her. I told her that she shouldn’t come to me complaining that I never spoke to her. I also thought that if she’d approached me to try to start a conversation then she should’ve been the one to start it and not expect me to, because shortly after I said hi back to her she walked away and began talking to her other friends.\n\nIt began to go back and forth from there, and then she left telling me about how she’d always been a great friend to me, and that she always waited for me before, which isn’t 100% true.\n\nThat was the last time that we spoke, and it’s been several days now. Prior to this we’d been friends for about 4 years, so I thought it was kind of silly that it was ending over this. At first I thought that I wasn’t really in the wrong in this situation, but I’m not sure now. And sorry if this is long, I wanted to get in all the details.",

      "description": "Hello all. I’ve got a weird one today.\n\nPosted on r/relationships as well because I both want to know what should be done and also want to know if I’m the asshole here. I'll refer to my little brother as John.\n\nLong, sorry. See the bottom for a TL;DR\n\n\nBackground: me [F 22] and my little brother [M 19] live at home with our parents [MF 62]. I am attending a nearby university for a one-year grad school program and working on the weekends. John graduated high school a few months ago, dropped out of community college, and is trying to get a job in IT. He has had two 3-month positions and has not searched for a new one when this job ends in three weeks. John aspires to be a Twitch streamer. My parents both work – my mother being a nurse and my father being a contractor. It may also be important to note that we all have mental illness problems in my family. My parents, myself, and my older brother all cope well and use medication for various forms of depression. John has GAD, depression, and some unknown mood disorder. He is not compliant with his medications.\n\n\nMy family has always had cats. My two brothers (28 and 19) are allergic to cats, but my older brother adopted a cat before he knew he was allergic. Over time they acclimated to our cat and had no problems unless they rubbed their faces in her fur. Our first cat was killed by a loose dog a few years ago and we adopted another. When my older brother moved out he took that cat with him. Since then, we (my parents and I) have missed having an animal in the house.\n\n\nMy father grew up with all sorts of cats, dogs, and farm animals. He loves them all. My mother grew up with a dog. She’s not so much a cat person, but mainly because the cats we’ve had haven’t been lap cats, which she values. As I said, they miss having an animal presence. Now that we’re grown, my parents decided they wanted a dog. They’re getting older (62) and haven’t had a dog in 35 years due to my brothers’ allergies. We had no idea that they’ve been wanting one for decades. We were all happy that they were finally able to do something for themselves after caring for us for years. They adopted a beautiful, 9-year-old, 80lb mutt named Hank. He thought he was a lap dog, never barked, and was so chill. Within a few days, however, they had to return him to the shelter. John has a phobia of dogs due to prior experience, however, he said he loved Hank and didn’t mind having a dog. John was apparently so afraid of Hank that he wouldn’t leave his room. I can’t blame him for not knowing how it would affect him. Still, this surprised us as he loved Hank at the shelter and agreed happily. Maybe he was just trying to make our parents happy. Regardless, they were devastated.\n\n\nNow, a few years later, we’ve been discussing getting a cat. I unintendedly brought up the conversation but showing my parents pictures of cute cats and constantly saying “I love cats”. As hard as it is to believe, I was not planning or hoping to get a cat. I will only be living with my parents for another year and I wouldn’t want to dump a cat on them. That would be selfish. I can still vicariously enjoy them. Apparently, my comments made them consider it, and they called a family meeting. Everyone agreed, including John, although he was rather apathetic. So we went to the shelter, fell in love with a 6-year-old bonded pair, and started filling out the paperwork. John found a tiny 4-month old kitten that he wanted, but my parents said no because honestly it will probably outlive them. At this point, a woman with a tiny, yapping purse dog came in. John's anxiety shot up so he went outside. We were signing the last form when he came back and said he doesn’t want a cat. My father and I were, again, heartbroken.\n\n\nJohn's reasoning for not wanting a cat:\n\n1.\tHe walks fast and is afraid of spooking the cat.\n\n2.\tAnimals make him anxious.\n\n3.\tHe does not want the cat to chew his computer cables.\n\n4.\tHe’s allergic.\n\n\n2 and 4 are valid. 1 is understandable but not necessarily a real issue. 3 I would consider bogus. A cat is not a chinchilla. \n\n\nHere’s the kicker. Last week he changed his mind. He told us, expecting us to praise him and thank him. We did not. We planned to go to the shelter yesterday. John called my older brother and complained, saying he feels outnumbered. After this comment, we had another meeting. My parents tried calmly to explain why they want a cat and he exploded (his honest-to-goodness usual reaction to being told “no”). My mother decided it’s not worth it. She feels like saying yes to one is saying no to the other.\n\n\nNaturally, I’m mad over all of this. John has a history of being extremely emotionally manipulative towards my parents. He’s typically gotten what he wants. \n\n\nSo AITA here? I don’t know what the appropriate response is. It’s 3-against-1 but is it acceptable to overlook the concerns of one family member for the wants of another? That seems wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR My adult brother does not want my family to have a cat. The rest of us do. AITA?\n",

      "description": "Wasn't sure how to title this. Basically, I've worked for the same company for several years. The previous campus I worked at was a very toxic place so things like \"spirit week\" wasn't a thing. I transferred to a new campus last spring, the the people here are SUPER friendly and always doing moral building activities. Its nice being in a building where I don't have (literally) worry about making eye contact with my coworkers, so when I was invited to join my unit's \"Family Feud\" team, I jumped on it. The game is this afternoon after lunch and up until this morning's team meeting, I was very excited about it.\n\nApparently, the rest of my team is going to be quizzing each other on Christmas trivia to prepare for the game during lunch. When I passed, and said I wouldn't be here for lunch. I was told I'm not being a \"team player\" and they're worried im not \"taking this seriously\" and \"toxic\".\n\nLook. I would get what they were saying if this was a Jeopardy knock off, or Who Wants to be a Millionaire? But this is Family Feud, and that's not how this game functions. I spend my lunch paying bills, and scheduling doctors appointments for my kid (Ongoing health issues), etc, and I don't want to waste the precious little time I have on something pointless.\n\nSo, AITA for: 1.  thinking they're overreacting and 2. Refusing to spend my break playing trivia time?",

      "description": "So these whole events have just happened and I feel like a dick but I also feel like I wasn't treated or consulted fairly in the first place and it's become a bigger deal than it needed to be.\n\nCliff notes:  I'm moving in with my SO in April as that's when her lease ends.\n\nMy lease ends in January so for a few months I'm staying with my parents as a short term extension was a hassle for roommates and things. It's a small room and inconveniencing them as they are already in a duel living home with a family above them.\n\nSO lives with her brother in a 2 room apartment. When it came to pass that SO and I were moving out, he and his girlfriend decided to do the same instead of finding a new roommate. \n\nTl:dr We had all agreed 2-3 months ago to move out at the end of their lease in April, with me at my parents house in the interlude.\n\nFlash forward to today. SO and I are informed by her brother (B) that his girlfriend (BG = brother girlfriend) has had an anxiety attack last night about the move and the events and organisational things and they decided to push the move back another month. They then ask/tell my SO who says that she thinks it's ok but will talk to me about it. He then goes and talks to the landlord straight away and extends the lease.\n\nI receive a call from SO who tells me what she knows and that they're pushing it back another month and I basically say that I'm not having it. In my view the only person who should've been asked about this was me as me and my family(who I'm staying with) are the only ones affected by this. BG is a lovely woman and although I'm not an anxious person myself I do understand others can become overwhelmed. I just feel like the decision was made too quickly in order to calm BG in the heat of the moment and that it doesn't really solve anything as I'm 100% certain she'll have another. \n\nI'm not trying to say that in a mean way, I'm just saying that if we'll have to set a line in the sand and refuse a request made in a panic attack later on, we may as well do it now so she has months to come to terms with and sort out all the details.\n\n\nMy suggestion is if her brother made the decision then he can stick to it. SO and I can move out as planned and he can pay her rent for 1 month(he can easily afford it). The second worse scenario is I move in with SO and her brother. Or we let BG decide and I stay with my parents an extra month.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I (26 M) grew up as an only child. My parents divorced when I was 5yo and I lived with my mother after it happened. My dad was still in the picture but I lived with my mom. She's been remarried once, but then divorced again as I was entering high school. Since then, she's only been able to hold a relationship for a couple years at the most and currently lives alone.\nAnyway, I'm currently in a committed relationship and have been for about 3-4 years (was long distance at first, now we live together). My gf (25 F) is somebody whom I trust with my life and I respect her judgement to an umpteenth degree because she is usually very rational. As I transition to adulthood, I have had to set boundaries with my mother in order to allow myself independence. My mother has taken each \"line in the sand\" that I've drawn as me \"changing the rules\" on her and reacted with confusion and frustration before eventually accepting the terms.\nAt least 60% of the fights between my gf and I (there are relatively few) have been about something my mom is doing that my gf finds odd or intrusive, but that I'm used to. Since my early teens (before meeting my gf), I've had thoughts that she viewed me as a way to emotionally unload and I reacted to that by shutting it down before ever realizing exactly what was happening. She confided in me about very adult dilemmas while I was still too young to understand the consequences of her decisions within that context.\nOne of the hardest things about this is that I know that my mother's intentions are good, and she genuinely cares about us (specifically me). However, her actions have a net negative effect in that they create unnecessary drama within my relationship. It recently came to a head when she called me at 9:00pm after 4 days of radio silence and the phone call started like this:\n\nHer: \"What are you doing?\"\n\nMe: \"Working on a presentation. What's up?\"\n\nHer: \"I feel like there was some friction last time we talked. Can we resolve that?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm in the middle of this, do you have some time to talk tomorrow?\"\n\nHer: \"...No. *sigh*\"\n\nMe: \"...Okay, what about the next day?\"\n\nHer: *Starts into the argument she was planning on having anyway*\n\nI spent 45 mins arguing with her and explaining why the thing she was doing RIGHT NOW was manipulation. It felt like I fell into her trap, but I also got a few things off my chest.\nThe point is that I want to be a different kind of adult than her. I feel like she's been using me as a kind of \"pseudo-partner\" to unload her emotions because she doesn't have a long term relationship to deal with herself. It's causing stress in my own relationship and the only way I can keep that from happening is by decreasing the emotional support I provide to her, even though it will increase her stress. I'm afraid to bring up the concept of \"emotional incest\" with her because it's a disputed concept in psychology already and the name it was given is rather inflammatory.\n\nAITA here?\n",

      "description": "For a bit of backstory, I live in a condo and underneath me is a mom living with her grown son. These two have caused me problems for years. I work full time and sleep early so I’m never really home and I NEVER throw parties or act loud in absolutely any way other maybe dropping something here or there which is to be expected when living in an apartment. These two clearly live of welfare as they are home 24/7 and seem to take up entertaining themselves by calling the police on me every week and complaining about how extremely loud I am and I won’t let them sleep. They bang on on the ceiling and scream at me at 3 am while I’m sleeping (and have to wake up at 6 am) and claim that I’m being extremely loud and bothersome. One time they call the police on me for being loud while I was OUT on vacation. The condo manager entered my apartment only to find an empty place. Lately these two have been keeping me up because the son will be screaming at the mother for hours, sometimes it sounds like furniture is being thrown around. These don’t sound like little disagreements, but full on screaming fit to the point where he’s losing his voice. I decided that I had enough and took it upon myself to report the son for what seems to be elder abuse and asked if the police can “check up” on them. In my mind I feel like it’s fair as it does sound pretty bad down there and I’m hoping these police visits every now and then will show them that I’m sick of being harassed by them.  Also want to add that I have tried approaching them when i ran into them at the parking lot, but they felt threatened and called a private investigator on me who told me that’s i am never allowed to approach them or I will be “arrested”",

      "description": "My parents are divorcing, they separated three years ago when my Dad developed a drug addiction, cheated continuously, had another baby, then pretended he wanted to change but continued to cheat and lie and string her along for another year. I also saw him gaslighting my Mum and being quite cruel to her. This really damaged my Mum’s mental health and self-esteem. \n\nAnyway, they’re in the final stages of a lengthy divorce process and negotiating on assets etc. They own a business together which makes the divorce complicated. I just finished a law degree and opted not to actually practice (so I’m not qualified to give legal advice and this could cause liability in extreme cases). \n\nDad texted me one night when he was clearly drunk or on drugs asking me for legal advice in the divorce. I said I can’t because I’m not qualified. He ridiculed the fact that I’m not qualified. He got mad and tried to guilt me into helping him - saying he slaved away to send me to a good school (I went to private school on an academic scholarship) and uni (they helped me financially for the first three years of university). I definitely appreciate this and have expressed it to him.\n\nThen he framed it as a family issue but he was really asking me to essentially negotiate with my Mum on his behalf about terms of the divorce. This is also an issue for me because I don’t want to be involved in their divorce for emotional reasons (I took the same approach to advising my Mum). I explained that and he again blew up at me, becoming sarcastic and rude via text, saying that I don’t appreciate what he did for me. I told him to get a lawyer who is actually qualified to do this. \n\nThere’s issues with finances because of actions my Mum has taken before the divorce has been finalised so I understand his stress. He then started saying “who’s going to pay these bills? Are you?” I ignored what seemed like sarcasm and he persisted actually asking me for a loan. \n\nBecause he was pretty nasty, manipulative and persistent even after I said no several times, I got mad as well. I haven’t talked to him since and muted him because I don’t want that negativity. It’s been about a month. \n\nI have major debt from studying and only just got a well-paying full time job so it’s hard for me to help financially. There’s a lot more history - like my Dad had an abusive childhood and severe fears of abandonment. He mentioned all this when trying to get me to help him. So I feel bad that he’s obviously going through a hard time. And he really did go above and beyond when I was a kid (pre cocaine addiction). But he also got himself into this situation and I’m not equipped to deal with it nor do I want to be involved.\n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\nTLDR: I refused to help negotiate on behalf of my Dad in his divorce with Mum or give financial assistance to him even though he supported me through uni.

      "description": "Ive lived here a month now, been no issues. We got out first electricity bill in...\n\n(Tldr i want to ask to limit usage of the vaccuum, dishwasher and washing machine because the electricity bill is more than im willing to live with)\n\nOnly one person in this house works. Thats D. Shes the only one who works, T is on disability with a shattered foot, and ive been looking for work for a year.\n\nWhile shes home T will vaccuum, stack the dishwasher, put a load of washing on, but will hang it out (thankfully) instead of using the dryer. I tend to chuck my washing in with whatever load is getting turned on anyway.\n\nD doesnt do much when shes home other than drink but shes just as fanatic about cleanliness.\n\nNote. I have only initiated the washer being turned on ONCE in the month ive lived here. Other than that ive put my stuff in with theirs.\n\nI havent turned the dishwasher on, even once. I actually dont know how, but i tend to handwash anyway. I only own, two of everything, mugs, cups, plates etc. And i reuse it all, i like to use the same mug all day. It doesnt get washed in between coffees because its pointless and wasteful.\n\nT and D dont share that philosyphy, which brings me back to the electricity bill.\n\nIve been asked to contribute 60 bucks, which is my third. I cant afford 60 bucks. Im not sure anyone ever should be able to afford 60 bucks for a sparky bill and im pissed off that im being expected to.\n\nMy electricity usage boils down to charging my phone, having the TV turned on for the better half of the day, and boiling the kettle. While theirs boils down to 3 or 4 dishwashing cycles and running the washing machine at least once daily. We are three adults not a family of five. My sister with two kids doesnt pay this much electricity.\n\nIm not asking should i debate who uses more electricity, i agreed when i moved in that bills are to be split three ways. So thats how its going to happen.\n\nConcerning the not yet surfaced water bill, i have been asked not to take baths because it uses too much water. \n\nI want to ask: Vaccuum every second day instead of daily, run the dishwasher once a day only, and use the washing machine every second day instead of daily. We all have enough clothes that we can go without washing them for a day.\n\nNOTE. I and T are 21, D is 27.\n\nSo AITA if i try to tell them how often to use the dishwasher etc",

I don't know who exactly she's talking to, and I don't really care; she's not in a long-distance relationship, she has a bf who lives about 30 minutes away.\n\nNow, I really like sleeping, and for health reasons, I need as much as possible.\n\nI tried asking her one time, her solution was to go downstairs; this doesn't fix anything, I can still hear her very clearly. My parents tried to tell her to stop, but she doesn't. \n\nAt the moment, whenever I go to bed and hear her on the phone, I tell her to stop her call asap.\n\nThis has been persisting for a month and I'm getting tired of it.\n\nI'd put a parental control rule that only enables the access from 5am to 10pm; I'd obviously not tell her in order to try to disencourage her to use the wifi after 10pm. I checked in advance and already know how to do it, and found her device in the router's list.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: sister stops me from sleeping because of phone calls, I need to sleep, tried confronting to no avail, WIBTA if I put parental control rules on her phone?",

The thing with allergy shots is that you have to stay in the office for half an hour for them to observe you in case you go into anaphylactic shock.\n\nMy doctor’s shot clinic hours are also pretty inconveniently in the middle of work hours (9:30 to noon) so I have arrive at work 1.5 hours later than I usually do, which is tough because it’s a crazy busy time and I’m swamped with work.\n\nI asked at the beginning of my appointment whether they had guest WiFi I could use but they didn’t so I ended up just reading on my phone instead of doing work on my laptop (I need internet to work). It was a very unproductive half an hour. \n\nConsidering I will need to be going in multiple times a week for shots, I asked them if they would consider setting up a guest WiFi network for people to work during the half hour waiting period.\n\nThey seemed really annoyed and said it was not a priority for them and told me to get a hotspot on my phone instead (I can’t since my phone is company owned and they prohibit that).\n\nAITA for making a what I thought was a reasonable request for a doctor’s office to set up guest WiFi?",

I abandoned my argument cos I’d rather a peaceful life. \n\nI have not revisited it nor do I ‘care’ when my wife goes to work and I don’t.

One of the single beds I applied to in the past wants me to tour and its a good deal I do not wanna pass up\n2. If this doesn't work out I will happily continue my search with you.\n3. If you desperately need a roommate, and cannot live without one and cannot find one in the next few months, feel free to contact me and I will change my living plans to accompany you.\n\nMy friend's dad told me that I can go for it, but followed up with a \"looks like my life is still in shambles.\" I just feel awful, but I feel like when it comes to major monetary decisions in life I know I need to make the right move for me.

      "description": "On mobile blah blah blah, TL;DR on bottom\n\nI bought my sister the newest Amazon Fire Tablet. She really wanted it, because she liked mine (my parents got it for me), but mine was an older generation.\n\nWhen I gave it to her, she was very unhappy. Apparently the older generation tablets had some kind games built in that the newer ones didn't, and the games are not offered anymore. Simple fix, we return the tablet, and get a different one. I tell Amazon, we box it up, UPS is coming the next day, over and done.\n\nShe wakes up and decides she will give the tablet a chance. Cancel the return to Amazon, tell UPS not to come, reopen it, reconfigure it. The next day she's crying because she's now decided she doesn't want it again.\n\nTo make her happy, I give her my tablet, since that's the one she wants, and Amazon doesn't sell this generation anymore as new. She was happy with that. I reset the tablet (losing everything I have saved), give it to her, she gives me the new one, we both set it up to our accounts. Everyone happy, right?\n\nNo. A few days later she complains that she wants to change her mind.... Again. Maybe she didn't have the tablet long enough. Mind you, Amazon isn't like Google. Once you switch devices, everything you put on that device is gone. My downloaded books, everything. I think it only sincs certain things, and only if you have Prime, which I don't. (We use my mom's Prime, we don't need two). Now she's saying I'm a b*tch (or AH for the purpose of this sub), selfish, ruined her birthday. I haven't heard the end of it, and her birthday was a long time ago. \n\nAm I wrong for putting my foot down with this indecisiveness?\n\nTL;DR: Bought sister tablet she didn't like. Try to return it but changes mind. Changes her mind again and wants my tablet. Give it to her and, again, changes her mind. I say no more, and get called selfish",

      "description": "I get a ton of spam calls and am also have trouble hearing/understanding people on the phone, and so I make heavy use of Google's call screening tool for numbers I don't know, even if I'm expecting a call - it plays a clear message that asks the person to state why they are calling, Google transcribes it in real time and then I can read it and know if I need to pick up. \n\nWhenever I do delivery with any of the food apps, I type detailed directions for delivery to hopefully avoid a phone call. My building has a large driveway to park in, two large signs that are bright red with the name on it, and a 24-hour front desk person. All they have to do is pull in, drop the food at the desk, and be done.\n\nInevitably they will somehow not understand how to pull into the driveway, or insist that the huge lighted sign isn't actually there so they don't know where to go, or they'll just insist on calling me for some other reason. because I don't know the number that they're calling from, I'll use the screening service and often they'll just hang up on it and keep calling me back. I'll just keep screening it because I struggle to communicate on the phone and if they could just identify it to me that they are actually there by using the service which will transcribe the text to me, I can run right down and meet them. I also constantly monitor the app itself and when they are close, will often go down to the lobby so I am ready to meet them in person.\n\nToday, I ordered breakfast and the person showed up 30 minutes before the app said they were supposed to, so I was not in the lobby and when I started receiving phone calls from an unknown number I screened them. The person repeatedly hung up on the screening service, and eventually just left the food at the desk. My front desk called me and I picked up because I have their number stored in my phone so I know it's them, and I went down and got the food. The lady at the desk said the driver was really irate about me not picking up the phone.\n\nAITA? Phone communication is very difficult and o bend over backwards to provide contextual information ahead of time to make the delivery easy, and then also have a way to bridge the communication gap (transcribing call screening) and even pay close attention to the app, and still somehow the drivers are upset.\n\nBecause this person was mean to the lady at my friend ask, I went to head and adjusted the tip amount down to zero which I realized maybe an ass hole move on it's own, but what I really want to know here is if I am an ass hole for simply trying to use all of the technology options in front of me to optimize delivery and avoid a phone call. \n\n",

      "description": "So for context, my brother linked my name to another person's post sharing an article from a local news website about 'Local man charged with burglary' as I knew who this person was. It was someone I used to work with when I was working at Wal-Mart back 4-5 years ago. The news article reported that he attempted to break into a family's house with a circular power saw and was recklessly driving through the town in his truck drunk with .17 blood-alcohol reading.  \n\n\nMy interaction with him was when he was a teenager being a part-timer at Wal-Mart for unloading the truck with me, he would constantly leave for the bathroom nearly every day as everyone on the receiving team would assume that he was texting on his phone instead of needing to use the bathroom. He was pushed to back in receiving after other departments he was in reported for using his phone as he couldn't do any of department responsibilities in a timely manner where he was slacking off and not doing his work. (Why the managers never fired him is beyond me. )  \n\n\nBut I put down on a post detailing my background of what I knew about him and was very volatile in my verbiage because he caused property damage to two homes with driving through the yard of one home into another and the family he was threatening had a two-year-old child in the house that he was trying to break in with a power saw. My post ended with the following,   \nWarning: Post is graphically explicit with the name of the person redacted from my post on the article.\n\n&gt;!\"I worked with this asshole in Walmart back then. For any context of his character, he was a lazy-ass employee that couldn't stay off his phone. He would frequently go to the bathroom on shifts to text (I presume no one takes 15 minute shits at the bathroom) and 'take his time' in doing his work. He was pushed to our area in receiving after he couldn't do any other department in work after other employees complained about his efficiency. The guy was a complete idiot that on father's day, he called sick in work, except one of the team members on the crew was friends with him on Facebook and found that he was out fishing. I believe he was fired after that. (Don't quote me on that.)!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!&lt;Drunkard's Name&gt;, if you're reading this, you're a fucking useless idiot and your shit-eating grin makes it worse that you were so intoxicated to steal and threaten a family with a 2-year-old child with a power saw. I hope you're going to be somebody's glory hole to use until you're 46. You fucked over your life and I feel sorry for your mother that she raised a moron like yourself.\"!&lt;  \n\n\nI feel that I may have been relishing justice being served and that someone I knew that didn't take his work seriously now was likely to go to jail for 25 years. Am I the asshole for this or am I justified for my comment?  ",

At first, I loved this about Alex. She was so chill and laid back, we had similar interests and hobbies. It was awesome. She is a straight up tomboy and that's okay. I've always had a thing for the tomboy aesthetic. Girls with undercuts rock my world, but I think Alex's personality and mannerisms are too masculine for me. Take for example if I try to open up to her emotionally, she reacts like a dude and busts my balls. Don't get me wrong, we have top notch banter, but I would like more than that. She doesn't allow herself to be emotionally vulnerable either. I've caught her more than a few times crying and when I try to go to her, she gives me the ol' I got allergies excuse and brushes me off. I've never seen anything quite like it in a woman, to be honest. I really do love and care about this girl tho. She's really cool, just not wifey material.",

      "description": "Ever since I was young my sister (11) has always had all of the attention. She's also gotten all the awards and one-uped me. She always knew she was smart but she treated me like an idiot even though she's 2 1/2 years younger (I'm 14). Every time she'd say some fact and I'd say I knew it or I said some interesting fact she'd be like 'how did YOU know that' as if I'm an idiot. I'm not even a dumb kid. I'm pretty smart, I just have dyslexia and adhd but I still get mostly a's. But because of her none of my acomplishments get noticed. \n\nMy parents always seeme to focus on her. They focused on getting her into selective school and a scholarship but they didn't even try with scholarships for me and only gave me one selective school practice test. They help her heaps and tell her when there are all sorts of oppurtunities but didn't try do any of the reccomendations for me for my adhd and dyslexia even though with help I could do really well.\n\nShe also always has tantrumns. When I have friends over she'll insist on playing video games with us but if she doesn't win she'll throw a fit. One time I mentioned to my brother a new JonTron video was out because he's said many times JonTron was the only Youtuber he really watched and my sister had an hour long breakdown. I can't go a week without having a fight with her resulting in a tantrumn and I can't hang out with my friemds without including her so they have to expeirience it too.\n\nMy parents also seemed to only be invested in how she was. The past to years have been really shit for me (things are a bit better now). I've had suicidal thoughts, self harmed, struggled with my sexuality and remembered some repressed memories of sexual abuse. But yet no one could tell a thing was off and no one asked. I'm not say she shouldn't have the support, she definitly should, she needs it, but it feels like my parents are neglecting to help me\n\nTheres a lot of other small reasons I grew to dislike her like her saying socially unnaceptable things and being a bit of a bitch and being mean to other people or being selfish. \n\nI only found out she has autism a few months ago but I had grown a hatred for her when I was younger which was now more of a dislike but I still feel bad. I've been trying to like her more but it's hard. I feel like a bit of an asshole, but what do you think? AITA? ",

During the school year, he has her every other weekend and one evening a week.\n\nHe comes from a very close knit family. They are very active and involved in their children's lives. His daughter is in many extracurricular activities. In the 3 years we have been dating, she has been in 4H, cheerleading, tumbling, basketball, and almost year round softball. This past summer and fall, she played on 3 softball teams. I honestly did not know this was possible. \n\nI am not a social person. I don't like crowds or loud noises. In all honesty, I especially dislike crowds of children. I frequently attend her games and practices anyway. She often asks me to go and I love her. \n\nIt also feels like my boyfriend expects me to be there. His parents usually coached his teams. My mother attended some games but usually dropped me off to practices. She attended some games and was the only member of my family to do so. This is normal to me. In contrast, the daughter's first basketball game this season had 11 people attending to watch her.\n\n\nI think it would be acceptable to attend 2 or 3 games of each sport per season. I'm honestly not sure how many I attend now. It varies depending on my work schedule. My boyfriend seems to think I attend less frequently (at least in relation to the total number of events) than I do.\n\nAITA for kind of hating these activities? WIBTA if I go less frequently while trying to make sure this little girl knows I love her?\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend's daughter is very active in extracurricular activities and his tight knit family attends (what seems to me) an unusual number of them.

After a few months Lia started being kinda mean here are some examples: I said I did meditation she said if I kept doing it I would become a hobo, she said I would die soon cause I was vegetarian and the queen eats meat everyday and is over 100 (the queen does not eat meat everyday), one time I fell down some stairs and she just laughed didn’t help me up or ask if I was ok, one time i slept over at her house and she went on my iPad (which had a password but she looked when I put it in) and played my games and used my in game money (isn’t that bad bad she had done a lot before) I eventually left that school cause I have extreme social anxiety and I would have anxiety attacks twice a day and I started to be homeschooled. A few weeks ago Lia found my FB page and messaged me. She said she was sorry and she was vegetarian now and wanted to be my friend and said people were taking about me at school saying I was mad at her and my “friends” told so many people that I was mad at her for TOUCHING MY IPAD people only thought I was angry about that. So I had a small anxiety attack in my room and she said my closest friend told a bunch of people that I was mad at her. I felt sad, betrayed and like I was a horrible person. I talked to my sister and she says I shouldn’t be friends with her so I said this. “I don’t know if I can still be friends with you, I’m still rlly hurt and I’m trying to get better” and I blocked her. I told Mimi who knows about my issues and told me I was mean so I unblocked her and Lia blocked me because she told her mum and her mum HATES me because I had a yt channel where I played games and I played ukulele with my friends in a “band” so I asked Mimi to tell her I was sorry and we can be friends so she unblocks me and says “Thanks I really appreciate it and I know you mean well but I think you’re a few years to late, I hope you find other friends but for now all I can do is wish that we have both learnt from this, together and can be better people.” I said “I feel like a crappy person” and she says word for word “UwU so do I” I sent her a pic of my dog and she sent a pic of hers and now we are friends and I just thought after I said bye “how did that happen” I go to a new school with Mimi and when I saw her the next day she acted like nothing happened (Lia was also mean to her sometimes) and I kinda avoid her at school now I still talk to her but I don’t hang out with her anymore so now I’m back to only having two friends.... am I the ass hole?",

      "description": "So this is exactly as the title states. I've had a falling out with my FWB. Sorry for bad formatting and whatever. I'm posting from my phone.\n\nThis all started when we kissed. It was not intended as he was just a friend, but we just happened to click. He got out of a relationship a bit before and wasn't ready for a new one yet and I am too busy with work and school to focus on a relationship, so we decided to not take it any further. We kept it at kissing, making out, going on dates and foreplay. I am not one for being physically intimate, so sex was off the table for now and any other form of physical contact is at a minimum. \n\nWe went on one date and it was amazing. I felt like I was in a good mood and felt comfortable around him and the night consisted of me initiating holding him (instead of the other way around) and whatnot. At the end of the night, he texted me and said he had a really good time and hopes that I will open up more to him and the idea of being more physically affectionate. I agreed and the night ended. \n\nAfterwards, we didnt have much plans made and I was hanging out with other friends. They are guys. Every time I would text my FWB about my time hanging out with a friend (platonically), I could feel a wave of jealousy wash over him. His texts seemed quite passive aggressive. Like for example, I was hanging out with a childhood friend of mine who is a guy and he said \"have fun on your date. Lol\" in a \"joking\" manor. I got a little frustrated and decided to stop replying. I always told him that if he finds someone else, I wouldn't be mad if he decided to pursue them. I told him to let me know so I wouldn't be an interference and we would resume a normal friendship. He agreed. \n\nThis whole jealousy thing continued into what I described to be \"clingy\". Whenever I didnt start the conversation by 5 PM, he would text me saying that he was upset that I didnt text him all day because he missed me, which was confusing because he could have texted first too. He would also get upset when I would read his messages and not reply. The only messages I would not reply to would be ones that seemed to be a dead end such as \"okay\". I kinda shrugged it off. \n\nHim getting upset about me not responding/texting first continued and I told him that we arent dating and I'm not obligated to reply to him. This upset him. He started getting very short with his messages. I felt like he was starting to play mind games. I told him so. This made him more mad and we had an argument. I told him we need to talk about this in person. He agreed. I gave him times I'm free and he said he would let me know when he could.\n\n Days passed and I got no response on when we would talk. I messaged him and asked him if he knew when he could. He said he didnt know. At that point, my week was about to be busy and I only had one day I could meet up with him to talk. I asked him if the day/time worked out. He said he would let me know. He never did. The day came and he asked where I would like to meet up. I got frustrated because he never let me know if that time would work and I had made new plans. He got mad and it escalated to him saying he wouldnt want to be friends anymore because he felt like I didnt care. I was so done that i just agreed. As soon as I sent the message, I regret it and told him I said it out of anger and would want to be friends still and that I still want to talk. It took him half an hour of messaging to convince him.\n\nSince then, we've scheduled times to talk, but he keeps bailing. I feel upset because I enjoyed spending time with him as a friend and as a FWB.  I cant help but feel that it's my fault. \n\nAITA?\n\n(SORRY FOR THE NOVEL)\n\n\n",

      "description": "I created this Throwaway account so my friends don’t find out about my family issues on Reddit. This is one complicated shitstorm that has 14 years’ worth of back story so I’ll try my best to give you a brief and unbiased perspective.\n\nThis all started 14 years ago when my parents and I lived in a small city. We were told that my aunt suddenly passed away due to mental issues and misdiagnosis one day and my uncle was a complete emotional wreck and was in no state to take care of his 6 yrs old child ( I’ll call him Aaron). Our relatives and my uncle wanted to us move cities take care of my cousin Aaron, because my uncle works in middle east and comes back home only once a year. It was a mutually beneficial for both of us. My mom always wanted the best opportunities for me and moving to a bigger city means that she’ll be able to provide them all and at same time she’ll be able to take care of Aaron and bring him up like her own son.\n\nIn the beginning everything was good. My mom and dad are very strict about discipline and manners, but I’ve never seen them treat me favorably over him or vice versa. We got our asses whooped equally and treated to an ice-cream equally. But I could see something was off with my brother Aaron as he approached puberty. When he was 12 yrs. old my neighbor caught peeping through a keyhole when my mom was changing and another time my driver caught him peeping again when he was 14 yrs. old. He was creepy and started getting more and more aggressive and my mom said even his hugs were very inappropriate, but she still in my opinion treated us as equals.\n\nThing went out of control when Aaron started spiraling into some mental issues like OCD and Depression, and his father (My uncle) had to leave his job in the middle east due to Arab spring that sent the country spiraling through a bloody civil war. He is really nice man but the trauma of losing his wife led him to pamper him and silently enable him in being absolutely disrespectful and degrading to my parents. He would treat my mom like a servant and would threaten violence against my father if he was angry. My parents decided to bear through this humiliation because I was in high school and they didn’t want to me to lose out on the best opportunities because of this asshole.\n\nFast forward now 5 year later, I’m a 23 yrs. Old and I was able to follow my passion and graduate from a great college just like my parents hoped and I’m now employed in a different city with a decently well-paying job with enough income to support my standard of living without any financial issues. I have to mention that my parents completely funded my entire college expenses including monthly allowances. But, things at home have gotten worse. Aaron is increasing spiraling and going out of control and orders around my parents and treats them very disrespectfully. My parents especially my mom has grown to hate him and has started actively showing her displeasure. My father works as a government bureaucrat and he’s waiting for his promotion so my parents can move out of this shitshow but unfortunately due national politics and election his promotion has been delayed by 6 months. My Brother’s mental health has also steadily deteriorated, he doesn’t take his meds properly and my uncle has pampered him.\n\nMy mom calls me every day and cries to me about how she gets treated and horrible my brother behaves. I feel really helpless because she doesn’t want to leave my father alone and at the same time can’t stand living there. Its horrible hearing my mom cry and I feel absolutely distraught that I can’t do anything to help her. Today I snapped and told her off, I told her to not talk to me about this and asked her to leave me alone. She says she just wants to vent to someone she can trust (like me) but I’m an introvert and have difficulty processing emotions’, I just want to left alone. I hate feeling helpless and this is taking an emotional toll on me. She blames me for being selfish and self-centered after all she’s done for me and provided me with the best opportunities even going above and beyond in some cases. AITA the asshole here?\n\nTL;DR : My parents are going through hell because of my abusive and disrespectful brother (who’s going through some mental issues), but can’t move out due to some external issues like national politics. My mom cries to me every day as a way of venting but today I snapped at her and told her to stop talking to me about this issue because I feel helpless and seeing her cry and vent out to me is taking an emotional toll on me.

      "description": "This happened a while ago, like I’m talking about  sophomore or junior of high school and I’m a freshman in college now but I wanted input. but basically a mutual friend of ours at the time wanted to set my best friend up with this guy at our school talent show because she thought they would be good together. Me and the guy talked a little at the talent show and the way we got off it seemed like we were friends for years. He kept making funny comments because he was sitting behind me and I kept turning around at the show and telling him to shut up because I thought it was funny. I didn’t think what was going to happen would happen. \n\nWell low and behold my best friend at the time stopped  wanting to hang out with him because she didn’t feel like it and he kept asking me what was wrong with her and this that etc. Me and him started FaceTiming more and getting deeper conversations and sooner or later I knew I was in love with this kid, but my best friend was dating him still and as much as I wanted to, I didn’t want to get involved. \n\nBut as time went on they finally broke it off because it just wasn’t working out and he turned to me when shit hit the fan. \n\nI finally told him how I felt about him right before they broke up and said I had to tell my friend because if I didn’t and she found out not from me that it was going to make matters worse. \n\nSo I told her, and shit just went so bad so quick. \n\nI got judged and and it got held against me because I was apparently such a shitty friend for liking her ex for not even a month. \n\nI tried explaining to her that I can’t control how I feel and that it honestly  wasn’t my fault for originally just wanting to be a good friend and be there for him when she wasn’t because she “just didn’t feel like hanging out with him.” But at the same time I understood how she could be hurt in this situation because I would feel the same way. \n\nMe and the friend aren’t that close anymore and we don’t talk much because of that situation, and this friend was basically like a sister to me and we were super close. It still hurts me that she couldn’t be understanding, because if the relationship lasted longer I could understand but it wasn’t for that long. Me and the guy are still together 4 years later even though we’ve had our ups and downs he’s still my best friend even after the fact and I wouldn’t have it any other way. \n\nI miss that friend every day and the relationship we used to have but my boyfriend is my rock even 4 years later. \n\nSo because of the situation am I an ass hole for dating her ex for not even a month and being together with him 4 years later?\n\n",

      "description": "A little backstory for context, my best friend and i have been close for about four years, and things started turning sour around this time last year. \n\nSo for a while I was living with my best friend (bf for short) and her family, and I didn't have anywhere else to go. All was well until she started seeing this guy, and it really got bad. \n\nThe first time was when I bought train tickets for bf and I to go visit a friend. We were only there for about an hour before she had her boyfriend come pick her up, leaving me stuck there by myself until the train came a few days later (I had no option to leave with her, his car only had two seats). \n\nSo I ended up staying up north for a while, and while I was gone her boyfriend stayed over for a while. Once I came back, he just never left (keep in mind we were sharing a bed so this entire time she made me sleep on the couch). \n\nA few fights later and a months worth of sleepless nights on the couch, I decided to move. After a while I ended up forgiving her, and all was well. Recently she was going to come visit me for a week but ended up canceling on me because her boyfriend was coming to town, and I just decided that I was done dealing with her doing that kind of stuff to me. AITA?",

We had a pretty big falling out but I still think he should of showed the respect of coming. My boss has told me that I am being silly and irrational.\n\nA little background, this man and me once made a killing together in the early 2000s before I left. After I left on my trip, he used the money we earned together to invest in a separate business. I also fronted him 20,000 dollars to get us both started in the original business.\n\nWhen I came back I was very angry for two reasons. 1)He never visited me when I was away, never even called and 2) He obviously also used both of our money to start a business I receive no money from.\n\nHe ends up in an accident that shatters his eye socket. He somehow blames me for this for whatever reason. I wish him a speedy recovery.\n\nWe discuss the matter with an older mediator we both know. We let bygones be bygones, and he agrees to return my intial investment with interest. As a man, I expected him to show up to my party to show everyone we work with the conflict is over.\n\nBy not showing up he disrespected me (again) and ruined my party. My boss is telling me to let it go and that im being unreasonable. Am I an asshole.",

      "title": "AITA for blocking my housemates devices from our broadband because he hasn’t paid for months?",
      "description": "So I live with three other guys in a university house, for the past three months one of my housemates lets call him Sam has not paid me his share. When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don’t know about lol). The rest of us didn’t really mind this as it wasn’t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn’t which I didn’t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he’ll either ignore it or say he’ll send it later. This has meant that I’m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he’s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that’s fine but I’m serious I will block your devices if you don’t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I’m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn’t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he’s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he’s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he’s finished his work. I told him that’s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn’t work well in them and I’m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don’t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don’t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?",

Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? ",

I learned about this while at work and immediately rushed over after due not being able to get off early. My dad, stepmom, and one of my aunt were all there. My other aunt, I learned, had been informed well before me was not. Why? Because she could not be bothered.\n\nI don’t know the complete depth of the relationship between my grandma and my aunt. I only know a few things from other relatives . It comes down to that my grandma has not always been the nicest woman. She played favorites among her six kids with the boys winning favor over the girls and an instance when she left with her youngest son and had the other five fend for themselves. That must of really hurt my aunt I’m sure.\n\nI’m honestly not too surprised she didn’t come. She’s the type to only pop by when she needs something but that is some fucking cold shit to pull.

      "description": "Hi! \n\nFirst off, since *loud* is very subjective, I took a reading on a decibel meter app sitting at my desk right in front of my speakers. ITT, *loud* means approximately 70db. Not eardrum shattering, tinnitus inducing kind of loud, but loud enough to get a good groove on.\n\nIt's 4 pm, I had some cleaning to do in my apartment, so I thought \"Nice, let's put on some Tool and do the chores with a smile on my face!\". I put my music on, and my upstairs neighbor starts banging **hard** on the floor. When I say hard, I mean cups shaking in the pantry kind of loud. \n\nI know it's a dumb situation, but it pisses me off. She just keeps banging everything upstairs and it's fucking annoying.\n\nNow, the things that are important to know are: \n\n1- I've been living here for 2 years, and she's always been an extremely loud upstairs neighbor. No music or partys, she just walks like a freaking tank, and her kids do, too. I never really complain about that because well, it's an apartment complex, I have neighbors, that's just reality.\n\n2- Me listening to music loud is not a regular occurrence. Maybe once every two or three weeks. \n\n3- I don't party, I've been sober for a little over two years, so at night, my apartment is pretty damn quiet.\n\nSo, almighty, all-knowing Reddit, AITA? Should I lower the volume even though it's Friday and it's not crazy loud?",

      "description": "Ok so I’m in Nigeria right now to visit family and we have this tradition of going out to watch what we call “the masquerade” . It includes people who dress up in suits to entertain people (I won’t explain it too much because it’s not important to the story). \n\nSo if you go to watch them it’ll be very crowded which will result in a lot of contact with other people. My friend and I went and we were standing in the middle of a big group when I felt someone holding onto my shoulders. At first I assumed it was a little kid who was scared of the masquerade but when I turned around it was a grown man. \n\nI saw some girls laughing and joking with him so I just thought maybe they dared him to hold onto me or something. After some time he kept coming back and holding onto me and saying things like “do you want to be my friend?” At first I just tried to just brush his hands off of me because I didn’t want to cause a scene. He still wouldn’t leave me alone so my friend and I moved to the far side of the crowd to get away from him. \n\nHe ended up following us and he put his hands on my shoulders and then on my waist, this got me really spooked because I’m 15 and he was at least in his 20s. I yelled at him to stop touching me and my friend started to berate him and told him to fuck off basically and that he was disgusting, causing him the run to the other side of the road.\n\nThe same girls who were laughing at the start came up to us and started arguing with us saying that he was “not right in the head” and he wasn’t aware of what he was doing. I don’t know if he was their brother or their cousin or someone who lives in their area but they were really mad at us. I didn’t know that he was disabled before I yelled at him because it didn’t affect him physically. Everyone in the crowd started to give us the stink eye so we just left. It’s been like 2 or 3 days and I’m still thinking that i could have handled the situation better :/.",

      "description": "To preface I'm a male in college age 21 and my friend is a woman the same age as me.\n\nBefore all this began I said to her I needed to concentrate on school and I said that we should \"take a break for a while from talking\" and she said fine.  I admit I didn't exactly specify how long I wanted to take a break for, but I didn't know how long I'd need because I said I just wanted some alone time to deal with some personal issues.\n\nFast forward to 3 months later and she's angry and says that she doesn't want to be friends anymore.  I ask why and she says how she feels neglected that I didn't message her for 3 months despite me writing some Facebook messages that she didn't notice at the time.  I reminded her we agreed to take a hiatus from talking, but she says \"I just said ok because I didn't know what else to say\".  I say this isn't fair to me because I did exactly what I said before, albeit I was a little vague.  But still I don't think I violated anything I said.\n\nI can understand that she emotionally feels hurt and I feel bad too, but I thought we both agreed to this.  The thing I don't understand is why it's such a big deal to not talk for 3 months.  She wasn't my girlfriend or anything.  I can't fathom why this is such a weird thing to just not talk for 3 months and then resume later.\n\nI tried to explain that some of my other friends I don't talk to for months on end or half a year and catch up whenever we feel like it and it's all good.  In my opinion I feel that she's too possessive of my time as if I owe her my time.  If someone doesn't message me for a couple months and then later wants to catch up, I'm like \"cool alright at least I'm glad you took the time to just talk\".\n\nThe last message she sent me from our last convo was \"Goodbye AmIthethrowaway20\".  And I left it on read because I didn't feel like arguing it if it's her decision.  I'm not playing mind games to try to \"win\" her back.  If she feels strongly about that then fine, I'm not going to fight against it.  We had a conversation for an hour before hand.  I feel like in the back of my mind she *wants* me to do something drastic about it.\n\nI'm not focused on doing anything if she truly believes what she said.  I just wanted to be on good terms, but she doesn't seem to want to.  And if she doesn't want to what I am I suppose to do, besides just leave it?",

I decided to let her know because I am really sensitive to smells and the sweet smell all day long makes me nauseous. He vapes throughout the day in our small, open concept office. When he does I have to step outside to get fresh air. My boss must have said something to him because my coworker did not vape at all today in the open (usually he vapes at least 5x throughout the work day). I believe he went in the bathroom to vape because I still could smell it on him, which I am fine with. I just didn’t enjoy him vaping out in the open where I am forced to smell it because it’s happening within 15’ of me. I’ve seen clients grimace when he blows smoke in their direction when they are visiting the office. My coworker was really sullen and withdrawn today and now I am feeling bad... maybe I should have not said anything and just sucked it up? Did I just really mess with the quality of his work life?",

      "description": "I got a new laptop (parents paid for it) and it's meant to last for college (I am a high school senior right now). I bring it to school because it's 3.5 lb compared to my old laptop, which was 6 pounds not including the heavy charger, on my 1-2 hour commute to and from school (2-4 hours depend on how public transport treats me. Using it in school means I can get a lot more work done at school during my free periods (which is like 2 hours a day if not more), and I can use it to take notes in classes where I can't write fast enough.\n\n\nFirst thing dad says is \"why are you like this? You're going to waste my money\" He's wondering why I don't just bring my old laptop to school if I need to and why I have to use my new one now, which he says will break if I use it and bring it to school, and that since it's his money that paid for it, he gets to decide what happens with it. Basically, he's saying I'm being reckless with money when I have a perfectly functioning old laptop to use.\n\n\nAITA, or NTA? I mean, he paid for it, but I think given that I've never had any laptop broken beyond usability (and he just thinks I break everything I touch, I'm sure), and I really need it so I can do work at school, I don't think I'm being ridiculous, right? He believes that since I was able to live without my new laptop, I can do so now as well, but it just makes things easier and saves me time.",

Thankfully Q was kind enough to understand. \nWe had to wake up K - which she was not happy about at all. She didn’t want to leave the couch but I helped T carry her upstairs to bed. \nThe next day, I found cum stains in my bed and became very suspicious. \n\nI asked T if he knew the basics of consent; he took this seriously to heart and asked if I was accusing him of rape. I said that this was how it looked to me. He called in K and she said she didn’t remember having sex - but admitted that they have sex all the time. She wasn’t concerned. \n\nI later found out that T had been accused of rape before.\nAITA for putting this difficult question to him? If not me then who else? Our friendship has never been the same since. ",

      "description": "Hi all,\n\nI'll try to keep this brief.\n\nI had a big fight with my partner over letting her little sister live rent and bill free with us for 2/3 nights a week every week.\n\nBack story is that rent is expensive where I live and I pay 60% as I earn quite a bit more than my SO.\n\nIt's a small 2 bed place and having my own space is important to me.  The second bedroom acts as an office / wardrobe / guest bedroom.\n\nMy SOs little sister works in the city we live in and stays with us several nights a week without contributing anything towards our expenses even though she earns reasonably well.\n\nShe's also particularly useless when she stays over in that she never cooks or cleans and creates work for us because we have to clean her sheets for other guests and tidy up after her in general.\n\nThis drives me crazy as I can't help but feel like I'm being taken advantage of. It's made worse but the fact that my SO never has money for herself and is living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nI don't want to cause a rift with my in laws so I don't address little sister myself, but I feel my SO should be doing this.\n\nAnyway last night I had a go at my SO about letting her little sister walk all over us, invading our privacy and generally taking advantage. Needless to say, it didn't go down well and Valentine's day is ruined.\n\nAITA?\n\nThanks for the replies all, I forgot to add that SO and myself have discussed this previously and she is aware that I was frustrated with how things were going. That said, I let it slide for awhile so she may have forgotten how I felt. Little sister is a good person, just oblivious to how her freeloading is causing tension for us.",

      "description": "Quite a long post, tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nMe [18M] and my girlfriend [18F] split up about a week ago.\n\nMe and my girlfriend had been together about 6 months, and were each other’s “first love” as we both had been with people for short periods of time , but had never had sex or the like( we lost our virginity’s to eachother)\n\nOver the Christmas period, it started going downhill with her cancelling plans with me to be with her friends more- including male friends which had told her they wanted to be with her(not people I knew but still male friends).\nI did not say anything although this did bother me, but I trusted her.\n\nI let this go and hoped that when we were both less busy we would be able to see each other again.\n\nA few days after Christmas I saw her again, and stayed at her place. It seemed everything was back to normal, except the days before she had told me that she didn’t want anything sexual to happen, which I was fine with- as I just wanted to spend time together.\n\nWhen we actually met up, within an hour or so she initiated sex with, and I went along with it. This confused me but she told me she was sure, and the two days we were together were great.\n\nThen the arguing started again- and she told me she needed space, and didn’t speak to me for around 3-4 days(we were used to be in almost constant communication). I only saw her at a meal with around 12 of our friends, which she was late to. She sat at the other end of the table as opposed to next to me and we didn’t even make eye contact.\n\nWhen we left I spoke to her and said that it obviously wasn’t working for her anymore and what she wants to do. She told me we were broken up but that we would probably get back together .\n\nThat night I received messages from her telling me that she still loved me and “always will” and that In a few days she’ll want to get back with me. \n\n3 days after I messaged her just trying to have a normal conversation, trying to give her time about what she wants to happen. She was extremely blunt and I thought she needed space so I told her that it’s fine and I’ll go.  She also told me at this point that the reason it didn’t work was Because she was a “bitch and spoke to boys as friends” which never seemed a problem to me as I knew about it. She also said that somthing within her “changed” and it had nothing to do with me. It was made obvious we were over for good.\n\nI was then told the next day, that she was looking to get with my best friend. This was 4 days after we broke up, which seemed soon- and I had heard nothing about it from my friend or my ex-girlfriend. \n\nI spoke to her about it and she flat out denied it, although more and more people are telling me that the two of them getting very close.\n\nWhat bothers me is that the “change” in why we broke up was probably the fact that she wanted to get with my best mate.  This means that when I stayed over and had sex with her, she was in a place where she wanted to be with him. \n\nAITA for getting pissed off that she is probably getting with my best mate so soon after breaking up with me, even if it’s what is best for her happiness.\n\nTl;dr broke up with my girlfriend and she is now looking to get with my best friend just a few days later. I have “figured out”(educated guess) that she was interested in him when we were still together.\n\nOther info: I’ve just been told that around the 4 month mark(when everything was still good) she went ice skating with her friends, something she does often, and told them that “when I’m at skating I’m single” and spent most of the night with her ex\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not liking my boyfriend's baby sister because she's shy?",
      "description": "I'm a female and my boyfriend and I are both 23 in case it matters.\n\nI started dating my boyfriend about 2 years ago, right around the time his mother had gotten remarried and was pregnant with my boyfriend's new half sister. His sister was born about a month or two after we were \"official\". I visited his mom in the hospital after the birth. \n\nHis mom is amazing. She welcomed me into their family with no hesitations. She's extremely supportive, unbiased, and really has everyone's best interests at heart. As someone who doesn't have a great relationship with their mother, the relationship I've built with my boyfriend's mother is invaluable to me.\n\nNow, I'm not entirely fond of kids. I feel like i sort of missed out on some of the maternal instincts I see from other women my age. To be clear, I don't automatically hate kids. I just don't automatically like kids just because they're a kid. That being said, I loved my boyfriend's little sister (I'll just call her Alice). She was so sweet and cute and smart. Think huge brown eyes, chubby cheeks, and dark curly hair with the cutest smile. She's really adorable.\n\nAlice used to be very fond of us as well. We go to their house about once a week for dinner and she loved being held by my boyfriend and me. She was all smiles all the time.\n\nAround the time of her first birthday, the \"stranger danger\" kicked in. She no longer trusted ANYONE. If her grandmother comes over less than 3 times a week, she won't even make eye contact with her the next time they're together. Its the same with my boyfriend and I. She won't be in the same room with us, she'll barely make eye contact, and she was suddenly scared of my dog (a senior citizen waddle butt) that she used to adore.\n\nI am 100% positive there has been NO abuse if that's what you're thinking. Alice's father tends to be a little introverted and her mother is an \"extroverted introvert\" as she calls herself. My boyfriend's younger brother is also fairly shy and introverted. \n\nAlice is now 2, she's been consistently socialized, her mother is the best mother I've ever seen, and i can't see any reason why she suddenly became so shy. Apparently her mother asked the pediatrician about it and he said it wasn't anything to worry about.\n\nSo, am i the asshole for losing interest in her? I don't really feel the need to try to make her like me when 99% of the time it just makes her scared. My boyfriend is 100x better/more patient with children than I am, and he hasn't made any progress either. Its been A YEAR. I don't pay much attention to her anymore because I don't feel like getting disappointed when she wants nothing to do with me. \n\nI feel like this might be upsetting his mom and her husband now. They haven't said anything outright but I've noticed that they might be a little upset that I don't really like her anymore. \n\nFor clarification: I have never been mean or rude to Alice or her parents. Its more of an indifference. I used to try a lot harder, but after a year i basically say hi, smile and wave, talk to her a little bit, then she runs in the other room and hides and that's about where i lose interest. My boyfriend will make a few more attempts than I will but still with no progress. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

Note-ex boss man is *flammin’* ass gay so I know there’s nothing to worry about there...it’s just that he’s a piece of shit. This is not my opinion. This is a locally accepted fact that he is an shit person. He is universally hated among the people that work in my town....\n\nSo when my girlfriend asked me what my concern was about her hanging out w him, I said “my concern is that he enjoys anything in life and he doesn’t deserve your friendship or *any* friendship from anyone. He has a dog for that.”\n\nBtw this dude has no friends (because he’s a piece of shit) so I kind of took pleasure in the thought of him being lonely.

      "description": "Met a lot of my extended family at a hotel for lunch yesterday. It’s summer here and there was a little play area outside for kids so all of the other kids in our family were allowed to go play. My daughter (6) was wearing a new little white Dior dress and I really didn’t want her getting dirty and ruining the dress (it wasn’t cheap) so I didn’t let her play. She was really upset with me and I did feel really bad but no one had bothered to let me know there was a play area at this place or I would have dressed her in something else or bought a spare pair of clothes. I was tempted to just take the dress off her and let her go play in her knickers but I know what people are like and I probably would have been labelled a bad mum for allowing that too. So instead of playing outside I let her sit and play on my phone. I got eye rolls from my family and called ridiculous for dressing her in expensive clothes, not letting her play and instead letting her on my phone. They said it was just a dress and I should just let her play, but I wasn’t gonna have her Ruin this dress just so she could play for half an hour,..\n\nMe and the rest of my family are quite different and don’t always see eye to eye but It really annoyed me how they acted like I was a bad mother for not wanting a new expensive dress ruined. \nSo was I the asshole for not just letting her play or were they the assholes for acting like I’m a bad mum because of this?

      "description": "Throwaway\n\nSister, we'll call D, brings her boyfriend, we'll call M, on vacation. After dinner, cousins wanted to do shots. I (25F) had a shot, but I didn't want more than one. In all, I had half a beer and a shot, my cousins had about 4 shots, and M was a couple shots and beers in\n\nOwner of the rental house calls, saying there were too many cars in the driveway and we need to move one. Street parking was not aloud, so we thought about finding some lot and parking a car there. M freaks out saying that everyone was drunk and no one should be driving\n\nI wasnt remotely close to being drunk, *however*, I agreed that we all had been drinking and we should find another plan. Since all of the houses around were empty vacation rentals, we could move a car into the neighbors driveway, which was *at most* ten feet away. My cousin gets the keys to his car, and M *freaks out*, running around and yelling\n\nMy cousin had drank a bit more than us, so he shouldnt be the one to move the car. I would never drive drunk or even close to mildly inebriated, so I offered to move the car the ten feet\n\nM grabs my arms, gets close to my face, says \"NO. You're DRUNK\". After telling him repeatedly that I wasnt, he refused to listen and kept telling yelling. My cousin was about to hand me the keys, M snatches the keys out of my cousins hands.\n\nThe owner calls again, saying if we don't move a car from the driveway he'll call the sheriff to kick us out. Everyone is agitated/stressed, M still refuses to give us the keys. It becomes an alpha male dick swinging thing between the men. My sisters and third cousin come out to see whats happening. Things start to get aggressive, when my third cousin comes out, I figure she can move the car since she didn't drink\n\nWe tell M that my third cousin is absolutely sober and can move the car, he *still* refused to hand over the keys. M doesn't give a real reason, keeps saying \"NO\"\n\nWith M being unreasonable, things get more aggressive between the men. One cousin gets in M's face, tries to grab the keys from M. M retaliates with \"Get the fuck out of my face\" and shoves my cousin. A full on fight breaks out between the men\n\nI try to break up the fight, put M in a headlock. The fighting stops, I let go of M. M throws the keys at us and storms off. After getting the keys, original problem was solved in 30 seconds\n\nLater, D got most of the version of events from M and he says us three 'jumped' him, so D demands I apologize to him. I tell D that everything that happened was stupid, no one was right, and everyone shares part of the blame\n\nD gives me an ultimatum, apologize to M or she'll stop talking to me\n\nI figured once everyone cooled off it would be fine, so I tell D that I never expected an apology from M and I think it's absurd that they are demanding one from me\n\nI fully believe **ESH through and through**, myself included.\n\nBut ATIA for putting my sisters boyfriend in a headlock and not wanting to apologize for it?",

My roommate [27M] had last Friday off, and apparently his girlfriend did, too, because she stayed the night. Totally fine. I told him earlier that week that I would be working on Friday and then heading out for the holidays the next day.\n\nSo I start working at 8:30 a.m. like I do every day. Around 10 a.m., I hear sex noises. Not like just furniture creaking. Full-on sex noises, while I’m trying to get work done before Christmas. I had just been on the phone with my boss, too, and thankfully, they didn’t start while that was happening. I’m on calls with my coworkers frequently, and most of them take place over Skype, which picks up every sound.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. My roommate can bang whomever he wants. I am supportive! But I was really irritated that he chose to do it in the middle of the morning when he knew I would be working.\n\nAITA for being pissed? Is this not a big deal?

      "description": "Sorry this got kinda long and became ranty.\n\nTLDR: historically have ended up \"parenting\" my peers. Don't live with bf, plan on doing so, he has said that he's kinda the same way (not really good about cleaning up after himself) and i worry about him a lot and feel like i have to remind him abt some stuff already. scared I'll end up having to \"parent\" him as well. I've told him about how much filth and general inconsideration bothers me. WIBTA for breaking up over something petty? \n\nFor context, I don't actually live with my bf. I'm only early 20s but I have somehow end up \"parenting\" a lot of my friends/exes. With my most recent ex, i had to clean up his mess, wake him up for class, do his dishes, etc. Once he called me \"mom\" and asked me to bring him a beer. Another time he drank a carton of apple juice because he \"likes the taste\" despite being allergic wtf. We broke up for unrelated reasons.\n\nI have to take a friend grocery shopping every week and occasionally he forgets something and then asks to take him back the next day. It's maybe 1-2 hours of my life every time and I don't always need to go. I've talked to him about multiple trips in a week. Recently he's been asking me to take him to work (his coworkers' schedule has changed) and then take him home. While this is something I can do, I don't really want to but I feel like he would just starve and he's really appreciative every time. \n\nWith my current roommates nobody takes out the trash until there's a mountain of trash and absolutely disgusting. One roommate doesn't do his dishes, piles them in the sink, so then noone can do their dishes because there's a pile of dishes in the sink. I used to do all the dishes so I could do my dishes but I stopped because I got busy and then there were dishes in the sink for over a week. I've talked to them and the answer is \"yeah I'll do it later.\" I'm fine with mess, but I hate filth\n\nSo onto bf. He's really sweet/ considerate and the best person in the world but sometimes he can be a mess (forgets to eat, forgets to take meds, leaves dishes out, can't see the floor in his room, etc). I worry about him a lot and while doesnt really bother me as much since \"his house, his rules\" and I don't actively have to deal with what he does in his own home/not my business but it's something I worry about in the future (for moving in). I don't want to end up \"parenting\". While I do it because I care, it's just stressful and tiring. I've complained many many times about roommates/grocery guy/communal space mess/etc and I'm assuming he knows that this is something that will break me since I've bitched about it so much, but he says things like \"damn rip me\" or \"I'm kinda like that too.\" I've literally offhandedly mentioned that i would break up with someone over dishes/trash in the past too. I love him so much but oh my god dishes.\n\nI feel like at this point maybe there's no hope and I don't want to make someone change but I'm just so tired and frustrated.",

      "description": "  \n\nAm I the Asshole? \n\nMy wife and had a baby a year ago. We are getting ready to have a one year birthday party. My wife has been working really hard getting ready for the birthday party. Her mom, sister, and a few friends are coming from out of town to attend. My wife is extremely type A and has been killing herself making the house look good (which we recently moved into). However this has been super stressful for me, I’m travelling for work and nothing is where I left it, we have new bathmats, new shower curtains, new coffee tables, new futon, new rugs, so much stuff. A lot of this requires assembly. There's also packages of party decorations, and streamers, and masks, and blah blah blah. This is stressing me the fuck out from a cost stand point and just the fact that there’s five packages at the door everyday. I don’t know why I find it so overwhelming exactly, but I do. There’s overflowing garbage from all of the boxes that we had to have hauled away. We have enough money, it just feels wasteful and excessive to me.\n\nI about lost my shit last night because someone had to come haul away all the boxes and drive through our yard leaving a six inch deep gouge that’s twenty feet long. The freezer’s leaking water all over the tile floor because it’s too full, my wife tried to put up curtains and left a bunch of error holes in the drywall, and my wife and MIL are cooking an involved dinner that we won’t eat until 9:30 when I’ve just had a fourteen hour day of work and out of state travel. She knows I’m stressed about it and she’s mad at me because the home is something she was proud of is now ruined and I’ve “broken her heart”. I’ve told her I like everything and that it looks good (because it does) but she knows I’m irritated. In fairness I was visibly distraught by the lawn, packages, freezer, and drywall immediately when I got home and pointed all these items out. In front of her mom. But I wasn’t being angry or yelling, I just wanted to know what the fuck was going on.\n\nThe cherry on top is my mother-in-law. My wife told me was coming in last Sunday on last Friday. My MIL and wife drink heavily and stay up late having heated discussions about their family. She is going to stay for a week. Last night my wife came to bed late at 1 AM and woke me up to cry at me and tell me she didn’t understand why I was so mad at her. Honestly I’m mad at her mom who casually cusses me out all the time. It’s under the guise of a joke but eventually it becomes very disrespectful. She said Fuck You to me like three times yesterday and called me a bastard and a bitch the night before. That COULD be funny but in this instance I’m just not into it and don’t want to be spoken to like that in my own home. My wife says I was acting pissed off all night. Well, in fairness, I was. Am I an asshole? My wife has been working from home, doing all this, doing a great job with our daughter, and doing the lion’s share of the housework. I’m not upset with her, I’m just frustrated that this situation seems so overwhelming and out of control.",

      "description": "About a week ago, my aunt and uncle took me to Hawaii as a little surprise vacation to celebrate my acceptance into nursing school (yay!). My uncle is an investor while my aunt owns her own bridal salon; needless to say, they’re pretty well off. And while they spared no expense for the trip, I didn’t want them paying for anything I brought back because Hawaii was amazing enough (I had to *reeally* fight them on this too).\n\nI spent a little over $300 in total on gifts. On the last day of the trip, my mom called and asked me to buy gifts for three of my cousins because their mom had given us gift cards this year. We normally don’t celebrate xmas/exchange gifts with them, so it caught me off guard a bit. Nonetheless, I walked down to the ABC store and started looking.\n\nMy aunt had shown me another ABC outside of the hotel earlier on because they had better deals, so I decided to walk over and check it out. Low and behold, they had a magnificent 5/$20 shirt deal going on. I was also able to get 2 additional shirts for my other cousins (whom I’m very close with), so it was a win-win in my head. I even had them all pick the shirts out themselves through FaceTime to make sure they liked and would fit in them.\n\nFast forward to the day I get home, and my mom is fuming with anger when she finds out what I got them. She said I was cheap and selfish to spend so little on them (they gave us $20 Starbucks gift cards) and compared them to the $11 shirts I had bought for my siblings (I got them from the hotel ABC store prior to finding that wonderful 5/$20 deal at the street ABC). Then she decided that she was just going to buy entirely different gifts for them herself.\n\nI would’ve never guessed my mom would get so worked up over something like this. For starters, she doesn’t like that aunt *at all*. Neither does most of my family (some decades-long drama), but I like my cousins just fine. I’m just not close with them, so I wasn’t planning on spending a whole lot on them. I probably should’ve gotten them an additional souvenir or something just because of the $20 vs $4 disparity, but I don’t think the shirts are a bad gift... heck, I would’ve got one for myself if I hadn’t already spent so much. I’m going to give them the shirts anyways just because I already got them, but I wanted to know if it really was an asshole move on my part? \n\n\n\n\n",

I’ve always been against abortion and couldn’t imagine going through that. My boyfriend has no kids obviously and is younger than me. Since we found out he’s been pulling away from me, hiding in the bathroom for hours to get away from me, he’s even laying here in bed with me as I was just trying to talk to him and he’s covered himself in a blanket from head to toe and said he doesn’t want to talk.. or there’s nothing to talk about because I want to keep the baby. \n\nI’m at a loss.

      "description": "Okay, this is on mobile, so sorry in advance. Also, I am terrible at spelling so sorry about that too.\nAnyways,\nI met a wonderful girl named Ashley in the fourth grade. We slowly eased into the friendship, but became attached. That right there was the problem. I found a group of friends that I fit into and I absolutely adored. But Ashley did NOT like these people.\n\nWhenever I would hang out with them, I would always see Ashley moping and being sad, even though her numerous other friends were constantly by her side. I, unfortunately, already had anxiety issues, but the pressure to be the best BFF that Ashley was too much to handle.\nI’m talking, I almost killed myself until my friend convinced me to talk to someone.\n\nNumerous other things would happen:\nShe would get mad at me for the smallest things such as sitting somewhere or not arriving early for school.\nShe wanted me to devote my life to her, and have only one best friend, but she was always surrounded by oodles of friends. \nShe had serious trust issues with me, as I trusted her with my life.\nShe would always have a rebound to my criticism or advice.\n\nLet’s focus on the last one.\n\nI finally decided this year that I was done with the crap she was giving me. This was how the conversation went down: (A-Ashley M-Me)\n\nM: *sends a serious message about how our relationship was unhealthy and I wanted to end it or at least back down a little*\n\nA: I’m sorry that myself wasn’t good enough. I’m sorry that I couldn’t be the perfect friend. I’m sorry that I caused you stress. I’m dealing with a lot at home and I guess I’m not good enough for you. I’m sorry I wasn’t perfect. (Simplified, this was much longer and gave off a “Woe is me” vibe)\n\nM: I’m so sorry I never meant to hurt you. Will you ever forgive me? I’m just the worst. I should’ have said that. I’m so so sorry. I’m the worst (being serious)\n\nA: I guess but I don’t think I can trust you much anymore.\n\nM: Alright. It’s what I deserve.\n\nThis is very simplified.\n\nI know she has trouble at home, but that doesn’t give her the right to treat me like that. She knew damn well that I would cave if she brought up home. In conclusion, AITA for getting mad at my friends response to her being “dumped” from a friendship?\n\nSorry so short. This is my first time posting like this.",

      "title": "AITA for being friends with someone out of pity?",
      "description": "I had an online (best) friend for about 4 years. I only knew her for a couple months when she became depressed. She was lonely irl with a ton of family issues. She was my best friend, not out of pity. I wanted to make her feel better and I listened to her rants, and offered my opinions. Occasionally she would disappear to take breaks from social media, but when she came back I was really happy to see her, and she was always happier after the breaks. Everything was all good.\n\nFast forward another year of being friends with her. I started being less social and had no idea how to respond to people, and much preferred listening. I never initiate any conversations with others unless it directly involves the other person because I just don’t think about talking to people, and I honestly don’t know what to say. So she started thinking our friendship was one sided and that I didn’t care about her since I barely say much in my replies, nor do I talk about my own life. I can see why she thinks that but it’s simply not true. I constantly assured her that I liked her talking to me, I just didn’t know what to say. \n\nBecause of this, she started to attack me, saying that I don’t give a crap about her, and am a shitty person for not being upfront about it. None of these things were true, even though it did seem like it. She also thought I was only friends with her out of pity, but at the time, I really wasn’t. When she would text me at school and I don’t reply immediately, she would also talk about how she’s really sad that I don’t care about her and whatnot. And it hurted me a lot. But I couldn’t tell her that, I didn’t want her to end up sadder than she already was. Sometimes she did talk to me about stuff that I didn't want to reply to, like intimacy stuff with her boyfriend. I'm 15 and very uncomfortable about it, which contributed to her feeling this way further.\n\nShe continually implied that I made her depressed. She already has low self esteem issues, and me ‘not wanting’ to be friends with her made her even less confident and able to trust. At that point I was so hurt (but couldn’t say anything) that I actually started being friends with her out of pity because she had no other friend and was depressed enough already. So I just continued to listen to her rants. \n\nThough I didn’t know what to say most of the time, I was occasionally helpful. I helped her with her highschool courses, helped motivate her get through a year of college, convinced her to get out of a relationship she didn’t want to be in, etc. (still a very small fraction of stuff I could’ve helped her with but didn’t) , and now that she has people in her life and is happy, I was finally able to drift away from her. We still keep streaks, but I guess that’s how our friendship ‘ended’. \n\nAm I the asshole for being friends with her out of pity for a really long time and made her feel like crap because of how I text people?",

Me and my friends can’t smoke weed for various reasons (I get random drug tests at work). They started passing the bong around and we lit our cigarettes. One of the guys asked us to go outside because the smoke triggered his asthma. Now I normally wouldn’t have a problem with this at all. People have problems with cigarettes and their smoke for good reasons.  However this guy who has problems with just smelling cigarettes and being near them was taking rips out of the bong. It didn’t make sense to me how he could have a problem with cigarettes but could directly inhale a ton of weed smoke. It was freezing rain out too which added to my reluctance to go outside to smoke. My friends eventually convinced me to head outside. We had all been drinking and I guess I was being a little louder than necessary. I complained about how I thought his story was BS and I guess they heard me from inside. So AITA for not just taking this guy at his word. ",

I live on the first floor of an apartment building, and we just recently had people move in upstairs, a single mom and a kid. For the first week or so everything was fine, just the normal moving in commotion. \n\nLeading up to all of this I hadn't slept for about 4 days and was just ready to crash, that's when the screaming and running started from the kid upstairs. It stopped pretty quickly so I just shrugged it off, that's when it started again and this time went for almost 2 hours. Again I let it slide, until the very next say it started up again, this time at 7 AM and went for about 3 hours. Fed up I decided to go upstairs and ask them to keep it down (didn't want to be that neighbor and run right to the office). He was screaming so loud I could hear him clear as day from the bottom of the stairs through a metal door.\n\nMe \"hi I'm sorry to bother you but do you mind keeping it down just a little? It's pretty loud in my place.\"\n\nUN \"it's been really cold outside, he can't play outside and he needs to play.\" And before I could really reply she closed the door in my face. We live in Colorado and it's been below freezing so I get it. I thought that was the end of it but it only got worse. More screaming more running and now extremely loud kids music. I gave her one more day and ended up making a compliment with the office. She had a notice on her door the following day, but I didn't really help much and now when family comes over she loudly tells them they need to keep the noise down because I'm a child hating bitch. \n\nI asked my friends on Facebook and some of them think she's being ridiculous and the ones with kids think I should just let it slide. I complained one more time before posting and they got another notice this time she came down and actually yelled at me for it, and because of my lack of sleep and anxiety from lack of sleep I don't think I can be impartial on this one.

      "description": "I was at whole foods yesterday and noticed that they had free samples of pizza on a tray for customers to try. As I approached closer I saw that there was a woman standing next to the tray grabbing every piece of pizza from the tray with her bare hands, examining them, and then putting the pieces that she liked into a box while putting the ones she didn't like back onto the tray. I stopped where I was and stared at her with my jaw agape. It really infuriated me for a couple of reasons.\n\n1) She is being greedy and taking all of the samples so nobody else can try them.\n\n2) She is touching all of the pieces with her bare hands and then leaving them for some other unfortunate customer.\n\nI was really close to walking up to her and saying something like, \"uhh excuse me but that's sort of disgusting what you are doing\" but in the end I decided to just walk away. Also just to mention, there was an employee just a few feet away from her and they didn't seem to care at all. So WIBTA if I had called her out? ",

I like having friends but I also like having time on my own.\n\nI can’t seem to become friends with guys that don’t end up liking me. Some of them are good at hiding it but other aren’t. Two of them (who would hide it really well) ended up getting really drunk and admitted they had feelings for me. I still talk to one of them often as he didn’t make things awkward at all and we’re really close.\n\nOther ones are just showing signs and it’s bothering me. I can’t help but feel that they’re only good friends because they secretly wanna get in my pants! \n\nI recently started studying with this other guy. And ever since then he wants to do everything together.\nOne day he wanted to study in a small room at the library when it was already late and the library was almost empty. He hesitated so much and said a room was better but I really didn’t want to be alone with him there.\nHe invited me to go to a club meeting but I told him I was going to another one and he showed up to that one even though I said I’d meet him later.

      "description": "I'll start this by saying on I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for any formatting issues. Also, \nI'm a bit of a rambler so this might be long. Sorry. \n\nSo I am a vegetarian with the intent to transition to veganism for ethical reasons. My boyfriend is not a vegetarian. Whenever we cook together it is always a vegetarian meal but even when my boyfriend is alone (we don't live together) he doesn't cook himself meat. He doesn't like factory farming and the treatment of factory farmed animals. The only time he eats meat is at restaurants or if someone else is cooking and makes a dish with meat. \n\nMy boyfriend owns a few guns and has mentioned in passing about an interest in going hunting. At first I didn't really take it seriously but when he applied for a hunting licence I told him that I thought going hunting seemed a bit pointless and unnecessary and didn't really fit into my ideal lifestyle. He claims he wants to hunt as a way of avoiding factory farming and likes the idea of being able to provide for himself. The way I see it is that hunting is an unnecessary cruelty because he doesn't eat meat enough to justify killing a few hundred pound animal. We got into a bit of a debate about it which ultimately ended with me telling him he's free to do what he wants but I would seriously reconsider having a relationship with him if he went hunting. \n\nA few months ago I went on a 2 week holiday to visit my friend in another country on her birthday. I have only recently discovered that my boyfriend took this as an opportunity to go hunting with a friend of his from work. I only found out because a mutual friend happened to mention it. When I confronted my boyfriend about it,  he said not to worry because they were unsuccessful anyways and that he technically never lied to me. I've told him I need time and space to myself to think as I feel he was deceitful and I'm torn between him and my passion for animals. So far he's telling me I'm being unreasonable and most of his friends agree. \n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I met a girl who was homeless near my university about a year ago. She asked for some food and I decided to do a little more, and took her to shop got some things she really needed.\n\nI started trying to help her more and would meet up on a weekly basis because she told me she wanted to go to med school one day and was near the university to see all the free lectures she could. I was also applying to medical school, so it seemed like I could also help her with more academic things.\n\nOver the course of these meetings, her requests for things starting getting a bit more than I could afford and even when I’d set a limit, she’d try and guilt me into buying more. I worked full time in a lab and would get out really late. I would still make time to meet her, but she’d say I was just trying to get rid of her if our outings lasted less than three hours. \n\nShe got really flirty and confessed her feelings for me after a few months. I told her I was flattered, but that I loved my current SO and was happy with him. She proceeded to ask questions about our sex life and my personal life. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that several times, but she kept prying. Physically, she was more touchy and if she wanted something, she’d grab my arm and massage it or do odd things like that. \n\nI eventually told her I needed space and time away from her because She didn’t respect my limits. She proceeded to say her feelings were hurt and I should be more considerate of her as she’s in a vulnerable situation.\n\nI’ve only seen her once time since then to give her some clothes, and keep giving vague answers as to when we can meet up again. I’m tired and strained, but I haven’t stopped texting her because that seems too mean.\n\nTLDR: helped a homeless girl until it became too much for me financially and emotionally. Have avoided seeing her, even when she asks for help because i don’t want to feel guilt tripped again.",

We finish up but I'm a bit slow so I just took the last half of my fries and nearly my whole drink out with me and everything is fine. We are on our way to the bus stop and all of a sudden C decides to smack my drink out of my hands. Okay that was really annoying and I ask him why the hell he did it. He said he thought it would be funny and I just got pissed of and left it at that,i reach for my fries and Whack he smacks them too. I get up with one of my friends and just go and get another fries and drink from the kfc we were next to. I have the idea to get a sachet of ketchup and go to get a little on his arm when I've gotten my food. \n\nSo, I went outside and snuck up behind C whe he was talking to our other friend and got a blob about the size of a ring pull (the bit you pull on a can) on his arm. \n\nI ruke him as I was leaving and don't know what happened to the hoodie but as I said this was over a year ago and we've apologised and moved on (obviously) so, AITA\n\nTL;DR friend hits fries and drink out of my hand so I get ketchup on his £30 hoodie as revenge. \n\n",

      "description": "Buckle in cause this long.\nSo recently a friend of mine (we'll call her k) asked me to take a look at an midterm essay worth 30% she just submitted.\nNow for some context, she's a good example of the self destructive behavior, self medicating type. She spends most of her time partying, drunk and high (to the point where I've never seen her sober). Shes also an emotional wreck, to the point where her roommate moved out because she never stopped crying. \nMe and my friend C try to be supportive, where she knows that I'm perfectly happy to put aside my own issues to help her with work. But sadly enough she doesn't do the work, and doesn't want to try, therefore shes been failing all her past midterms.\nRecently when we are all hanging out, she asked me to look at her essay. It was very bad. There was only a page and a half. Plenty of grammatical mistakes, run on sentences. What irritated me the most was the lack of a clear thesis.\nI told her quite frankly that it was really bad and I'd be happy to help her edit it. She told me that she already handed it in, and started crying that she couldn't fail another midterm.\nNow my ADHD dumbass started voicing my thoughts. Why didn't you get it looked over, why is there no thesis, and how the hell do you expect to pass with this. She was crying and told me to leave. I went into the other room with C to tell him what happened, we could hear her bawling in the other room.\nFast forward to last night, I was hanging out with her only remaining roommate and C. K comes home drunk and high out of her mind. When she gets there things lead back to the essay. Here she starts screaming to everyone asking them to tell her she passed the essay. No one answered, until my friend C told her that she probably passed. K told me to leave. And as I was leaving I asked C why she lied to her, in earshot of K.\nI'm not going to lie, I can be an asshole sometimes (mainly cause I dont think about what I say). But, the reason why I'm sorta pissed at her is because people are willing to help you, but she just wants to go to the club and smoke dope all day. Anyways I dont think were going to see her return next year.",

      "description": "I'm a cosplayer, and struck up a partnership with a photographer. We've been friends for years, one of the most compassionate people I know. We struck up a fair and beneficial contract to protect us both from potential issue. I have yet to sign it, we keep forgetting. As partners, despite it being my brand and content, I wanted them to have an almost equal amount of creative input as I did. I want to work together and make something neither of us could make on our own. We mashed our ideas together last month to narrow down to the best. He never responded to my ideas, after I asked there times, so finally we went with one of his ideas because it was the only option left. I wasn't bummed- it was a cool idea. Fast forward and we've done the shoot, I'm waiting to see shots, when suddenly one is already posted (a month early) without my knowledge. I didn't get to help pick the photo, and it being early created a LOT of extra work on my side. We release two to public, so when the time came to pick the second we disagreed about which one. They told me to trust them, that theirs was better and people would like it more. We argued, I told them that I was upset and felt steamrolled and they said 'sorry you feel that way. Fine, I'll just shut my mouth and show up and take pictures.' but that isn't what I wanted. I wanted to work together, and when I told them how I was feeling, I felt brushed off like I had no right to be hurt. They apologized for posting the first photo, but said all the extra work it created for me was no big deal so maybe I'm overreacting. They said it's my fault for not just saying I didn't want to do their idea, but I didn't mind doing their idea. I just hated feeling like my ideas weren't even good enough to acknowledge, and that they picked the first photo without me, and now I wasn't getting to pick the second. I got more and more upset and said 'fine, since you obviously know what you're doing do whatever you want.' They posted their choice, knowing it upset me. But I did give them permission to post it so that's on me. Two stupid photos are not a big deal, but I'm afraid to sign a legally binding contract and then find out that my project isn't 'mine' after all and my partner doesn't care about my feelings or my satisfaction with the product I'm putting out. We've already started working together, but instead of signing the contract I agreed to, I want to ask to change it to better protect my right to creative input.  AITA for wanting to change a contract I already initially agreed to? ",

      "description": "So I’m 16(M)  and in November I got my first job working at McDonald’s just to make some money to pay for my car and car insurance when I get a car. And when I first started they put me on deep fry which was cooking all the frozen stuff (Mcchickens, nuggets, chicken tenders, and crispy chicken) which was not a hard job by itself(actually kind of boring sometimes). Then after that they trained me on grill, which was also cooking the patties, bacon,etc.  a little harder than deep fry since you had to keep everything stocked and that also the patties sell the quickest but not too bad . And while I was on the grill they would put someone else on deep fry. But then about 1 month into the job  they started putting me on deep fry AND grill which kind of bugged me  but most of the time wasn’t hard if we weren’t busy. But when we would get a big rush,which was from about 3:30-4:30 and then another big rush from about 6:00-6:45 or 7:00. And of course with every job you’re gonna have some person that is a complete Asshole. And that guy was bob( not his real name) and bob would piss me off so bad almost all the time. He would try to boss me around, say that my regular meat looked shitty(reg meat is the basic meat that goes on all the burgers),and one time he spilled grease and told me to clean it up which I didn’t because it’s not my job. So most of the time I worked Monday,Tuesday,Friday,and Saturday(sometimes Thursday too) so I would clock in expecting to do grill or deep fry that day only to find out I’m doing both and this went on for about 3 months.( I should also say that my manager hired at least 6 people during that time that could’ve been put on one of the two so that I didn’t have to do both,just one) so about 2 weeks ago I decided I had enough of doing both every day, and bob making me mad all the time I told myself “I’ll give my them until 5:00 to bring in somebody to help me and if they don’t I’m leaving” no one came. So I filled up the deep fry freezer, filled up all the trays and stuff, and just walked out. \n\n\n\nTL:DR- got tired of doing two jobs, was also tired of my coworker pissing me off all the time ended up walking out during my shift.",

      "description": "I’ve had a good friend for about 2.5 years now and she’s always been sort of into her Instagram. She’s smart and kind, but also socially anxious and pretty self-centered. Like not selfish, just self-centered. I unfollowed her Instagram recently and got confronted on it. \n\n\nThe last year or two she has gotten more into the Instagram and into this idea of being an influencer and into her “aesthetic”. All with this light pink filter into this very ideal life of hers that frankly isn’t that accurate. She probably spends about 3-4 hours a day on it easily. She follows about 5000 accounts and has around 6000 followers. More than that, the amount of her mental energy that goes towards it is pretty bizarre to me. I don’t spend much time at all on Instagram and basically only follow friends. \n\n\nAbout 6 months ago she made a smaller private account for just friends and she posts more stuff from parties or personal insights into her life. I’m quite a bit more comfortable with that and it’s not that fake. \n\n\nI unfollowed her main account a couple of days ago because I would get a weird feeling seeing it. That it’s just not real and how much time goes into these pretty fake posts. I didn’t feel a need to follow it either, as I can see her day to day on the other one. \n\n\nShe confronted me about it in the most non confrontational way today, with a couple long DMs. I had said that I preferred to follow her other one because t was the friend I knew and loved. She went off about how it upset her because it’s something she’s passionate about that people don’t accept and wishes people would be more supportive of her hobby. And she says I don’t have to look at it all of the time, which is true, the amount that it bothers me is not greater than our friendship or anything. \n\n\nI do see how she feels, and I’m not sure if it means I’m unsupportive as she says I am. \n\n\nYeah. I know it all sounds small and petty, especially given the subject matter, but I do take friendship pretty seriously, especially as Im getting older and don’t see these friends as much in person. Thanks for reading through this, it’s a bugs life.  ",

      "description": "So, I live in a small town, our school has under 100 students, so people know each other well. I was with my friend group, then when I made a joke about me being fat (which all of us did, sort of a inside joke), my classmate (who has been an annoying pest everyday, screaming in class, not behaving well, and acting like a nuisence) starts insulting me for my weight. She might have wanted to add some banter of her own, but she took it too far, so I thought of a way to get back at her, so I immediately started talking about her ex and I said \"Good luck with getting (Ex's name) back!\" She got pissed off, I had been telling her to shut up in class and insulting her for her lack of manners, and said that she was gonna go snitch to our main teacher, I didn't really care at the time, I wasn't the one to start attacking the other person. Then in class she starts screaming that I bite, when told that we have to sit together for some assignment, I tell her \"Shut the fuck up\" to which the teacher tried to stop the argument, but I start yelling at the teacher that the girl doesn't know how to behave, and then she starts insulting me again, I had enough, and then said \"Maybe if you didn't look like a whale and learned some manners, there would be more people that don't want to stab you with a pencil.\" She started crying. I don't feel remorse for this situation, but would love to hear your opinion. ",

      "description": "Background; I'm a middle child. Older sister is 7 years my senior, younger and I are less than a year apart. Grew up poor as fuck, appreciate what I have/what I earn. I'm not spoiled (contrary to popular opinion). We're all grown, we're all neurotypical, we all function \"normally\", we all have jobs (She's got a better income than me, and in-laws that pay 99% of her and her wife's bills, no joke) and the focus is usually on the kids in our family, with one or two things for the adults.\n\nI do my damnedest to give thoughtful, useful, nice gifts that show the receiver that I give a damn and want them to be happy. I put a lot of time and effort into the present if not the wrapping, because I get anxious about the receiver feeling like they're not \"good enough\" for a good gift, like I don't care. This is actually a huge thing for me.\n\nFor a long time, my sisters would do it together to try and make me lose my temper or throw a fit, or freak out because it wasn't good enough. I don't. I just throw the stuff away and go about my business because I'm not giving them the satisfaction of knowing I'm upset.\n\nI've gotten back at little sister a few times, given other people things she had her hopes up for. Kept things I didn't want/need that she really, really wanted and ruined them on purpose in front of her. Fussed over little things like saving wrapping paper and delayed opening up stuff she was eyeballing.\n\nMy older sister got married and calmed down; she and I are on much better terms all around and usually do well for/with each other. My younger sister, not so much.\n\nI told my younger sister that if she's going to give me something stupid and useless this year, do us both a favor and don't get me anything. She got in her feelings and is trying to turn people against me. Half our family is rolling their eyes and the other half is calling me selfish, greedy, etc.\n\nLet me give you an example of some of the \"greatest hits\" I've recieved.\n\nA raw potato.\nA \"natural pencil\" AKA a burnt twig.\nA 3/4 burned down scented candle...that I had bought for her.\nA box of uncooked noodles.\nA used toothbrush.\nA pair of my own ripped tights. From the trash.\nA toilet paper tube.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for telling her not to bother if she doesn't care enough to try?",

      "description": "Alright, first time poster here. I'm also on mobile so sorry in advance for any typos. But anyway, to begin. To make a long story short and to add context, my parents hate each other, but they continue to stay together in the same house as they say it's best for me (m18 first year uni student) and my little brother (14 M) to grow up in a non-broken. So as you could imagine, there's plenty of unnecessary and annoying fights that go on at home on a daily basis. My little bro, he's a tough guy, so he doesn't really seem to be affected by it, but I sometimes lay awake thinking what it would be like to live in a normal family where the parents both love each other and don't bicker back and forth over stupid stuff. It gets to me sometimes.\n\nBut anyway, I had worked the whole summer before uni started and saved some money so I wouldn't have to ask my parents for money during the school year, but it was starting to run out and it got to the point where I only had about $20 dollars left in my bank account. Now, my mom has access to my account so she can see how much is in money is in it. So she must have seen it, because she confronted me about what I was going to do for money. I said I would sort it out and find a way to make some money by getting a job a grocery store or whatever.I just really wanted to deal with my money problems myself because I didn't want to add any unnecessary stress to them. She said ok. I thought the situation was dealt with but my dad called me and asked me why I had told my mom I was afraid to ask him for money. I never said this. Ever. In fact, my Dad pays my phone bill every month (he insisted even though I said I could afford it for the year). So I told him I never said that. I then called my mom to ask her why she would say that I said that. And she said that she came to that conclusion based on me staying secretive about my financial situation. I said you can't just assume something like that and then go on to say it as if it's true. My dad isn't necessarily the most easygoing guy on the planet but I know he loves me and has never been abusive towards me or my brother. Now, my mom is pissed at me saying that I'm rude for questioning her, and she's being all passive-aggressive and stuff. AITA in this situation?",

      "description": "First of all,  I'm on mobile\n\nI'm going into the trenches with this one and bracing myself. \n\nOK I've been with my partner for 4 years now and it's been very wonderful, we've been living together for nearly 3 years. \nI've been trying to do a lot of stuff for mine and our betterment in all little ways, I've joined a gym and started moreso clean eating and cutting out smoking and walks when the weather is right. \n\nMy lovely girlfriend is quite a heavy girl,  being at 116 kilos and is having medical problems because of it that I'm trying to help in ways. I've let her be who she wants to be and encourage her if she feels happy as she is,  then to stay the same when she brings up the topic which she doesn't feel happy about her weight problem.  \n\nI suggest as I'm trying to be healthy (83 kilos, 6'1 height) \nShe is more than welcome for me to help when I can,  she mainly cooks as I work afternoon shifts, but I've always said and talked I can pre- cool healthy meals for her during the day and meal prep. She says that's great but is the type of person to eat what she wants and have it fresh, that's ok, but it's usually big carbs, like chips and meats. \nI've suggested we go for walks but because of her weight her feet hurt often so I only ask first when she feels OK to do it,  mind you we have different shifts but I still try.\n\nI also suggest when her sister moves out we make the spare room into a little workout area and we do workouts together and she likes the idea,  hope it sticks.  \n\nI've also been buying healthy snacks for the house and dips to try and cut out any chocolate and bad chips and such but they always make their way in here.. \n\nI've hinted now and then if she still wants to lose weight for her health and confidence sake but if I bring it up without her saying it or agreeing with her that she should for her own benefit, I get shot down.  I've always tried to suggest it in the nicest way.  \n\nWhen we talk about outings and adventures and seeing new sights the first thing she mentions is if there's any food places around and trying new meals,  and not the nice ones... \n\nI feel like an arsehole for suggestions these things but I don't want her to feel left out. I want her to be healthy and about instead of always watching TV and drinking on weekends. I want her full of confidence as she's not feeling confident with just my praises of love and affection which I do truly feel for her.  \n\nShould I be firmer? Any suggestions folks?  \n\nAnd please as a reminder DO NOT even think or say I don't love and support her as I most certainly do!  She has gained about 56 kilos since we got together and I want to strive for her to be confident in her skin and to feel healthier to go on bush walking and hiking,  another passion of mine that I want to share with her.

      "description": "For reference I'm a 16 yr old guy, and the dorm worker is a 40 yr old woman and works as an educator (means she is also responsible for teaching social norms, among other things).\n\nBasically two of my friends and I started walking up the stairs side by side and the educator was behind us. She apparently wanted to pass us, but couldn't.\n\nWhen we got up the stairs she stopped us and said how we were very disrespectful. She said that before we started going up the stairs we should have asked if she wanted to go first because she has authority.\n\nI mentioned that a couple of weeks back she was about 15 steps in front of me on the same stairs and she stopped and waited for me to pass her for some odd reason. And then I told her sarcastically \"Classic example of do as I say, but not as I do.\"\n\nThis lead to a 30 minute talk about social norms and how it is important to let others (who are above you in the hierarchy) pass you on stairs, for xyz reasons with which I disagreed.\n\nAITA? Is it important to let older people and women upstairs first? She never said a thing while we were on the stairs that indicated she wanted to pass us.\n\n",

      "description": "I live in Australia 19(M) my cousin lives in Pakistan 19(F) she says its her dream to travel to Australia and study here (study in Pakistan sucks!) I've been helping her for a while by correcting her english in voice messages she sends me which often require very little correction. I tell her that her english is very good constantly because she tells me she's depressed and that she often doesnt go to her english academy but just stays home in bed.\n\nShe tells me that after I started helping her she feels more confident however she still pity's herself constantly and I feel pissed off and awful at the same time. I don't know if I'm an asshole for not giving her more of my time (she often complains that I give to much time to my other cousins who I'm currently visiting in Pakistan, she lives at her uni). Most of my cousins are younger children and a couple are my age so I'm super busy when they get back from school. While they're at school my cousin whos learning english is at her academy so I can't help her then either. \n\nNow last night at almost midnight she sends me 6 minutes worth of voice messages so I tell her I'll get back to her in the morning. She insists I listen to them and correct the english in them before going to bed. It's now 2pm the next day and I haven't replied. I don't know if its wrong because last time I took too long to reply she sent me a message at 3 am telling me she feels like she can't get anything done and that she's not going to her academy but just staying in bed at her hostel. She said that she only has confidence to go while I'm helping her. \n\nListening to her self pity has taken a toll on my own happiness which is the main reason I'm putting off listening to her messages.",

First court date came and he asked for a postponement.  2nd court date was scheduled for earlier this month. She withdrew the divorce so she could keep him on her health insurance plan. All the while she's constantly calling him and texting him. She almost always initiates unless he needs something.  She pays his bills, including the cc bill he used to buy his gf expensive dinners. They broke up this week so most if the texts where him telling my SO he stills loves her etc. Her response was \"i love you too but you need to focus on getting better\" That pretty much did it for me. What started this was waking up this morning to her texting him while she was next to me. So reddit...and excuse me if this was a little convoluted...AITA  for getting mad and wanting out? ",

I then asked asked if she was okay with me just masturbating because I was still in heat and of course didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. She said it was cool so I grabbed my phone to pull up some NSFW subreddits and get going. As soon as she realized I was going to look at some porn gifs she let out a disappointed “hhmmppff” . When I asked why she did that she told me she thought it was wrong of me to want to watch porn when she was right next to me. She wanted me to use my imagination, and think about her to jerk off while she was going to sleep.  I thought that was sort of weird. I used porn a lot when we had been long distance and it became commonplace for me when masturbating. It’s clear she seemed to think of it as emotion cheating of some sort but I see it more as primal than emotional and don’t think jacking off to porn with her there should be immoral. She made me feel bad about how I masturbate and now it’s bugging me. Can y’all let me know who the A****** is?",

We were sitting in traffic at a standstill about ten minutes' walk from the college. It was quite a cold morning, about 5°C, but it was a dry one. I figured that at this rate, I was going to be late for work, but if my sibling got out and walked the rest of the way, I might just make it. (My sibling's first lecture didn't start for about another half an hour, to my knowledge.)\n\nI asked my sibling if they would mind walking the rest of the way, and they were rather annoyed by it. They agreed, however, and I got to work with about five minutes to spare. I feel bad about making them walk on a cold morning, but I'm all but certain that I would have been late myself if I hadn't done so. AITA?",

      "description": "We’ve been together for over 2 years. I’ve traditionally worked in high risk startups with high turn over so I need to find work every year or 2. I have sacrificed a lot personally for my career. A year ago I relocated to a small town in the middle of no where for a niche project. I knew it was a volatile situation but I was making 6 figures. It was an hour from where I met my girlfriend where she was living. She moved as well and went from working customer service at a car dealership in the city to one of the local ones in town. She makes about 30K. \n\nI was laid off a few months ago and have been looking for work. There is quite literally no where for me to work here and I don’t want to move back to the city. We have the highest taxes and poorest population, no access to health care etc. I would get way more for my money elsewhere.\n\nAnyway I have an incredible opportunity to work with a startup and by the sound of our conversations it will be a quick turnover, like hired and start packing that night kind of thing. I see no issue with this but my girlfriend was furious. Right before my final interview with the CEO she freaked saying I don’t consider her feelings and her life. Her issues with moving were that her band is releasing an album. She quit her band when she moved a year ago, her band replaced her but they have already recorded and mastered the audio, they are working on art work. She maybe sees them for an evening a month. Her other issue was that it would be farther away from her family. Her parents are retired, with disposable income and have came to see us once for a few hours. Lastly she says she can’t just up and quit her job. In my opinion she works jobs that require no specialized skills or education and are deadend. She doesn’t actively pursue promotions or have seniority etc. \n\nI have told her repeatedly I’m not forcing her to do anything and she can come and go as she wants. I also suggested she go to school and I take care of us financially while she does. I offered to also fly her home when she wishes. We would be living a 2 hour flight away.\n\nAm I an asshole for expecting her to leave her job because mine makes significantly more than hers? I am pissed because I feel like I have enough to worry about and should be focusing on securing a new job, not worrying about this. \n\nTLDR: I need to relocate for work and expect my girlfriend to be on board because I make more than her.

      "description": "Title doesn’t give much info so I will explain further. \n\nThis happened about 20 minutes ago. I (20F) just finished seeing captain marvel with my boyfriend and a group of our all guys friend. There were 5 boys in total (they average about 6’2” together) and little old 5’1” me (female). As the movie ended we began to walk out. I fell behind and was stuck walking with a group of young boys. \n\nPlease note for the next part I did not make eye contact with any of the boys and had not even been sitting near them during the movie. \n\nAs I was walking with said group of young boys one of them purposely bumps into me and stares at the side of my face. He then takes a deep inhale and goes “UGH smells like fish sticks!!”  His entire entourage of boys copy and begin also yelling “ugh do you smell those fish sticks!!” “Fish Sticks!!” And so on. \n\nI begin to push my way through them as I immediately become upset as that is a touchy subject for most women. As I am pushing my way through them they begin to make obnoxious moaning noises as if they were pleasured by me pushing through them. \n\nI grab onto my boyfriends jacket and say “Hey! Why didn’t you say something they’re saying I smell like fish sticks” \n\nHis response is “ThoseCacti, they’re 13. That’s just giving them what they want. What am I gonna do? You don’t even smell who cares.” \n\nI agree. I see his point. It was probably just going to give them the reaction they wanted but I am really upset. No woman wants to hear they smell like that. I have also confided in my boyfriend about how I am nervous and insecure if I do smell like that. \n\nAlso, after we exited the movies I was visibly upset. One of my guy friends asked me what was wrong and I told him. They all said nothing about what I just told them, said “see ya later” and left immediately even though after most movies we stand outside and talk about it. \n\nWould I be the asshole for going back and telling my boyfriend I wish that he defended me in some way? Would I also be the asshole for telling my friends I wish they had said something too? ",

      "description": "sorry for grammar errors, on mobile:\n\n\nI met this guy in high school about 17yrs ago, we shared a few classes together, and after talking to him a bit we shared alot of  common interests, so we started to hang out. Fast forward a few years we both move out of state, I move to California, he heads to New York, but we still stay in contact through social media and we play games online almost everyday. One day I get a new friend request on Facebook from him, I accepted and asked why he deleted his old account, he said when applies for a new job he deletes his account and makes a new one for when he's job hunting. I stopped checking my Facebook account everyday for a while, since I dont post anything relevant or personal, and he'll message me on w/e game we are playing and ask me to accept a new friend request, so I do so, then start reading his profile to see how hes doing since he seems so interested in me. On his new account he starts posting and talking about \"oh F the government, our nation is screwed, our military is corrupt\" so I'm just like w/e to each his own. Another few months go by I get another friend request, and again he asks me to add him in game, this time around he's going on about how the catholic church is full of sinners and how we should follow sharia law to bring the nation together. Roughly 6-7months later again he makes a new profile, sends a request, messages me in game to accept the new profile and also asks if he can use me for a reference for a job position in the area at a local airport. I frankly told him that I dont want to recommend him for anything since I've only talked to him over the net for the past 7-8 years, and that I'm not going to accept his new request because its getting beyond annoying to keep accepting his requests on a platform I dont use anymore, ( I just use it to keep up with my mom at this point). He keeps pestering me about it on the games we frequent and I eventually  block him on all the other games we play as well. A few mutual friends we had eventually start to ask me why I ghosted this guy for no reason, and I tell them I'm just tired of the constant profile changes and his constant need to be added every 5-6 months, I wasnt comfortable being associated with him and his views.\n\nSo AITA for purging this person from my life despite knowing them for so long? \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for wanting a friend with mental illnesses to actually talk about it?",
      "description": "I've got a friend, lets call her Daisy, who struggles with some mental health stuff. I don't know what exactly she struggles from, because she's kept me in the dark about nearly everything for the last year and a half. We used to be attached at the hip.\n\nI get it, as someone who suffers from some ongoing issues myself. The shame of being 'broken', the fear of losing friends and even employment, etc. I've cut people out too in the past - for far shorter periods than her, but still. I'm always better off in the end when people reach out to me and I actually talk about it. I've gotten help/medication as a result and can actually live with stability again.\n\nJust in case, I've asked Daisy on multiple occasions if I'd done something to personally offend her. She always says I didn't do anything, which leaves me to assume that it really is the mental/personal stuff. Which is understandable, conversation can be overwhelming when you're struggling. But these days, I only learn about her life through happenstance and conversations with mutual friends. She never directly tells me anything meaningful anymore, and if I press her to tell me what the deal is her answer is always 'oh, I don't know'. A few times, she's even gotten angry.\n\nI've stopped messaging her first and begging for info for the sake of my own mental health, and to give her the space she apparently needs. I've told her in the interim that her behavior has been hurtful - nothing has changed. But she still wants to call me a 'friend' and talk with familiarity that she doesnt seem to realize died a long time ago. The last meaningful thing she told me was that she was getting help - which I'm beginning to doubt was truthful. It's been five years since we met and she's in the same state, if not worse off than she was in college. \n\nLately, Daisy and another friend of ours (we'll call him Victor) tried dating. It didn't work out; she shut down about three months in once things started getting serious between them, even though she started flirting with him first. Now Daisy's being petty towards Victor with little microaggressions: Ignoring him in group conversations, having her character act uncharicteristically snarky towards his character in our DnD games, or making snide remarks when he tries to joke about anything. We play League together, and sometimes she'll even ignore his callouts, which obviously hurts the whole team. And like with me, Daisy won't tell Victor why when he's directly asked her. In fact, she apparently just calls him self-absorbed each time.\n\nHe called me last night to vent and ask if he was really being as self-absorbed as she says. I can agree that he can be a dick sometimes, but he's not the sort to keep being a dick if you tell him he's being a dick, you feel? He acknowledges his faults and commits to being better, but only if you're willing to talk to him so he actually has concrete goals to work on. But she won't tell him to do better or just fuck off or anything. The petty silence has literally brought him to tears in recent history. \n\nOther people in our social group have noticed that she's been acting like this. It's starting to degrade the quality of the long term roleplay games we agreed to play together. I'm thinking of setting up one last mediation session between everyone to air out greviances and hopefully reach a peaceful conclusion. But before I do that...am I the asshole, here? For wanting to know what exactly is this nebulous mental illness is that makes her keep people at arms length? Or in the absence of that, at least a straight answer about her intentions with our dying friendship?\n\nTl;dr - A former close friend/someone I have to interact with on a weekly basis refuses to open up about her issues. She's already hurt people and its beginning to cause drama in the group at large. Idk if I'm entitled to a straight answer at this point or not. \n\nOh, and for reference: In this social group  we're all in our mid 20s, and have been friends for three years or more. It's mixed company, but predominantly female.",

Our lease has ran out and and her brother and her family want to find a house that we can all live in together. She would rather her brother not live with us as well but she feels obligated to  have him live with us because of her family's demands and she feels like she has to help him with his work at University and so he doesn't have to live with strangers. In my opinion he is 21 and he can take care of himself just like I had to. I have been vocal that I would like to keep my privacy.

      "description": "I'm getting married in June, and my fiance and I really enjoyed the idea of walking down the aisle together. It's not because my dad was unsupportive, absent or abusive (although he is acting that way now!). I'm a devout Catholic, and this is actually the ancient, traditional way of walking, although they allow the cultural tradition of fathers walking daughters to persist. It symbolizes the couple freely entering into marriage and approaching the altar together before God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in September, I proposed the idea of us processing together to allow my parents to get used to it and open up for discussion. But they couldn't even talk civilly about it, they got really overwhelmed and upset and screamed at me. I'm my dad's only daughter, so he said he would take his disappointment to the grave. My dad even suggested that he wouldn't have given my fiance his blessing if he had known this would happen. For weeks afterward, my dad avoided me and my mom would remind me of how much I hurt his feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I tried to explain the significance to him (and that if we wanted to get married at the Cathedral, him walking me wouldn't even be an option!) but he insists I made it up. My mom is Catholic and defends him, saying she has never seen that before. I am about as bull-headed as my dad, so this behavior made me want to walk with him even less. However, I have good friends and priests giving me advice, and my fiance is very level headed. They suggested compromising with my dad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo last week the topic came up again, and I suggested a compromise. My dad walks me halfway, and my fiance walks me to the altar. The aisle in the church is very long, so dad will have plenty of time to walk me. He has another outburst. He said if he doesn't walk me all the way to the altar, he won't come to the wedding, and it will be the most embarrassing day of his entire life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know my dad is being manipulative and terrible here. But AITA for threatening to take this moment away from him? He said he has dreamed of this since he first ever held me. But now that he's trying to hold me hostage, I want to be on his arm even less, and I'm dreading it when it happens. Everyone insists it's \"my\" wedding and I should do whatever I want. But then when I tell them this story, they say I should let it happen, and I know they're right but it's confusing.",

      "description": "So my ex broke up with me about a year ago, and due to having a lot of the same friends we see each other often. I saw her at a Superbowl party, and after she texted me and said sorry for the way she had been treating me, and that I deserved to know what happened. I was a little surprised, but glad she did so since we see each other often enough and it would be better if we were friends again. (we've been friends a lot longer than when we dated, and I honestly don't have any feelings for her anymore but still want what's best for her. Anyways..)\n\nOne of the reasons was that she met someone, and I was fine by that. But then she posts a one year anniversary with her boyfriend, and I did the math and we were still dating for a month. I felt a little lied to that she didn't say the whole truth, so I texted her \"two boyfriends at once? Not mad just disappointed\"(yeah that does seem kinda asshole-ish) She said that they weren't dating then, they don't know when they started dating, so they picked the day they became close friends. All I replied was mkay. \n\nOn top of all this my grandma just died the night before, so I was already upset. She didn't know, and I tried to apologise to her and explain it, but she's blocked me on everything. The thing that bothers me is that now it's just going to be super awkward with our friends (if she's ever around anymore, you never know), and that I don't like burning bridges, because I genuinely care about anyone who's been around me, whether they were close friends or not.

      "description": "I'm 33 and my wife is 29. We've been together for 4 years, married for just over a year. \n\nWe moved to a different country together in July as I got a job transfer. She found a job here and has her work permit, but she is still waiting on her resident's visa. \n\nThis means I'm the only one with a bank account, valid driver's license, etc. Also her salary is pretty low (I'm earning more than double what she earns). All of this means that I'm the only one able to actually financially call any shots with regards to any purchases or payments.\n\nI have my dad and some close family friends here, but she doesn't have any of her blood relations. It's a bit harder I guess for her to feel at home. We spend most of our time with my dad and his friends. \n\nWe've been staying with my dad since we got here, and I haven't really put any effort into getting our own place, even though we can easily afford it. It doesn't make sense to me to get our own place yet since we're staying with him for free. I'll admit though, I haven't made an effort to save any money but we've been enjoying ourselves.\n\nShe's an introvert who struggles with anxiety and depression. She wants our own space where she can chill at home in her pjs after work and cook our own meals (difficult to do as we're in my dad's house).\n\nShe keeps going on at me for not doing anything to try and regain our independence as married adults. She's been arranging viewings at apartments for us and put together realistic budgets that includes saving a decent amount. \n\nShe's mentioned the idea of leaving me to go back home but I doubt she'll do that.\n\nAm I the asshole for not putting effort into being an independent married couple just yet? Or is she the asshole for trying to rush us and threatening to leave?\n\n\n",

Now, before him I dated a few guys that were over 6’5” in height and my boyfriend measures at my height of around 5’6”… so when he saw some old pictures on my social media of my exes he had some concerns. Now I have never asked about any of his exes and we have never gotten into issues of jealousy before, but it seems he wants to talk about it. One of my exes in particular was underprivileged growing up any my boyfriend seems to be focused on him in particular.

And with the workload of engineering, the gym and my hobbies, I honestly have time left only for sleeping.\n\nI asked him a few times to stop doing it when we're with others friends but he eventually starts doing it again. \n\nI've actively trying to cut contact with him recently since I feel like he doesn't respect my boundaries anymore.

      "description": "One of my friends recently started dating this guy. We're in our third year of college and she is my best friend. We have lived together since freshman year and we get along so well. This guy is a senior but was suspended a year and therefore takes many classes with us and they started becoming friends. I don't know exactly what happened to cause the suspension but it was related to the sexual assault of a girl. He did not carry out the assault, as he was only suspended, but he was definitely part of it somehow. \n\nSince we have known him, he has been a great guy. He is funny, nice to her and reasonably respectful. However, perhaps because I was raised more conservatively, I always thought of the assault and  kept a distance. I did not want to be friends. I tried to not be rude but I definitely avoided talking to him and was more curt and/or reserved when he started conversations with me. He got the message and it was fine as we had different friend circles. However, once they started dating, he has started coming out with our friend group and everyone is warming up to him. My friends have started to ask me to get to know him and \"be comfortable\" around him. \n\nI do not want to befriend this guy but I love my friend and we are roommates. He makes her happy and seems to be a perfectly great guy, other than this blip on his past. My friend is lovely. She would never force me to be okay with him. She knows that I don't like him so she does not bring him over or talk about him when we are alone. I know how my reaction must be weighing on her. I want to support her and be excited for her. I believe people can change but being even complicit in sexual assault is so unforgivable to me that I never want anything to do with this guy. AITA for being the only one who does not want to give this guy a chance. ",

      "description": "Okay so I (20f) have worked everyday since I was 16, my younger sister, call her S, is 3 years younger. She used to have a Saturday job and make almost more than me a day. Anyways I used to make a 45 minute bus journey to work every day while S could walk or take a 10 minute bus journey. My parents always refused to pick me up from work even at 2/3am when I had to work late and so if I had no money I would walk home take almost 2 hours but at anytime during the day because S’s work closed at 7pm, they would drop whatever they were doing and pick her up. I assumed it was an age thing but even when I was 16 they never picked me up and I still had to walk. So a little into her job S’s boss turns out to be a bitch and my sister leaves (which is also why I left my first job but had to get another to pay my parents) and is now unemployed just attending school and getting £60 every second week. Now I pay £200 a month to share a bedroom with S and have since I started working, while she was working she never paid any digs or petrol money for getting picked up which I had too if I asked for a lift anywhere. My mum told me that regardless of me having a job I would be paying the £200 a month like it or not. \n\nMy second point is kind of money related, so anytime my mum is out shopping or just out anywhere and sees anything S might like she will buy her it, makeup/clothes/shoes etc. I asked her why she never buys me anything and she told me that anything I like is just a waste of money because she doesn’t have the same likes in clothes/shoe/belongings etc I have collected a few pop heads which my mum has said is stupid and a waste of money. So she never buys me anything because she doesn’t like it. \n\nAnother thing is that the £200 a month I pay for my half of the bedroom I share with S goes to the holidays that my mum takes my younger brother and sister in (caravan/Camping) I don’t really mind but the thing that gets me is that even though I pay money for half a bedroom it’s all decorated and suited out for S, she has drawers to keep her clothes a desk for her mirror and all her make up while I have 2 boxes to keep my clothes and all my other belongings that my mum doesn’t like is stored away up the loft because there is simply no space in the room for anything of mines. \nThere was also talk about my parents booking Florida for my sister 18th next year while for my 18th I went to the bingo with my mum, her friends and one of my friends. \n\nBasically everything seems to be done according to what S wants and nothing I do, care about, or anything is worth any of their attention so I don’t know if I’m the asshole for thinking they prefer her over me.

      "description": "So I am going to start off with some back story.\n\nMy husband and I are moving in with my parents this week in order to save money to buy a house. \nAt the end of march my cousin is going on vacation for 9 days and asked if we would like to stay at his house and I would feed and water his dogs and take them on a walk occasionally in that time. But mostly it would just be so we could have a place alone for a week or so. He has another family friend that lives a few houses down from him that could easily take care of the dogs. They are outside dogs with the ability to go into a heated garage or dry chicken coop to stay out of the elements. They used to be inside dogs until he moved to this house and his yard is half mud so he doesnt want them on his new hardwood floors and carpets.\n\nSo here is where the question AITA comes in. I have a German Shepherd puppy who will be about 6 months at the time we go over there. She is attached to me at the hip as I do not work and she goes every where with me.\nAfter initially asking my cousin says \"you can bring your dog but she has to stay outside or in the heated garage but I dont want her in the house\" \nI let him know that's not going to work. She needs constant supervision and she also isnt going to do well and probably back slide in her training if she is left to her own devises for 9 days.\nSo he follows it up with \"well you can put her on a leash and just make sure she stays in the kitchen. I would pull the rug up in the living room but that's just a lot of hassle having to move the couches off of it\"\nSo I politely declined saying \"thanks for the offer but I'm sure only a month in to living with my parents we arent going to need a break from them and it will just be too much of a hassle for me with all of the rules my dog will have to follow. Since he already has someone near by to care for his dogs it's probably better for my sanity and my dogs sanity to just stay where we will be at\"\n\nOver the phone he was really cool about it but then at the bar last night he was going on about how he was just trying to do me a favor by giving me a place alone with my husband for over a week. Blah blah blah. But because I dont feel like respecting his rules and want my dog to just have \"free reign\" over his house. I'm not going to take that offer.\n\nSo AITA for declining? Because I feel like me staying there is more me doing him a favor by watching over his house and dogs FOR FREE at a place 50 minutes out from where I live? But he seems to think other wise?",

      "description": "I've been sick the past few days and decided to order groceries delivered. I've used the app a few times before with no issues, and always tip 20%. I ordered about $50 worth of stuff included 3 12-packs of ginger ale. It goes as normal, and they came to my door with the bagged stuff and said they had 2 sodas downstairs and 1 more in the car. I figured ok, and bring in the other stuff while waiting for a knock. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever they never came back. The app lets them text/call me but they didn't. There's no locks or anything that could lock them out. After a while I go downstairs and the 3 packs are tucked back under the open staircase. I guess they didn't want to bring them up the flight of stairs? There's no long hallway or anything, it would have been just upstairs plus 10 feet to my door. I know bringing them upstairs is a pain but that's why I pay for delivery and tip. I want to go back and delete my tip but my roommate thinks it would be a jerk thing to do. However I had to go out, find them, and haul them up myself, while sick, and they just ghosted me. Am I the jerk here?",

      "description": "My brother and I have always been really at odds. For years we would butt heads over everything. He would insult me or tell me to kill myself (and once held a knife at me from across the room), and I would get outraged and scream at him. Our mother eventually got fed up with it and made a rule that we were not allowed to speak to each other. This really hurt me as all I've ever wanted is to have a relationship with him, but he just screams and insults me whenever I speak to him now. A few minutes ago I went downstairs and tried to strike up a conversation about his new Apple Watch, which he responded to by screaming at me to stop talking to him. I told him all I wanted was for him to be nice for once, but he started telling me nobody likes me and the best night of his year was the night I spent at our grandmother's house because he didn't have to see me. Eventually I called him a rotten egg and went up to ask my mother for advice. She said that the whole confrontation was my fault for breaking her no talking rule. I argued back and forth with her about how insane an idea that was, and eventually told her it was lazy parenting to just cover the issue up and hope it all works out when we grow up. She immediately shut down and walked out of the room, which I responded to by (admittedly unkindly) telling her to go to hell. Confrontations like this are really common in my house, and I feel really lost as to how to confront it. I really want to have a relationship with my brother, but it really hurts when all he does is try to get under my skin and hurt me, then hide behind some nonsense rule our mother came up with.",

      "description": "Before I start, here's a quick apology for my somewhat poor English. ( It isn't my native language.)\n\nFirst some backstory: Whenever our school schedules match up, I ride back home with one or two friends. Let's call them girl A and boy B. I am good friends with both of them, but they despise eachother. Most of the time I flip a coin and decide who of the two I go home with. Today it was girl A, she asked me to meet up with her at the lockers after the sixth hours and from there on go home. She didn't show up and thus I biked home with boy B.\n\nTurns out the girl quickly grabbed her and her boyfriend's coat so they could quickly get away without anyone else noticing. But I asked some other friends and they told me she was already gone.\n\nBut girl A just so happens to live somewhere on my way home. Me and boy B were having a laugh  and thought of a 'prank' we could pull on her. The prank was moving her, locked, bike and then slowly send her more and more pictures of the bike eventually revealing it's location. Turns out her bike was in the garage but her boyfriends was still on the driveway. So we took his bike instead.\n\nWe sent a picture of the bike every 30 minutes or so, but it turned out none of the two looked at their phone the 3+ hours they were together. ( or they just didn't open our messaged idk) Next day we told them about what we thought was a funny thing to do. But they got really pissed at us. I told them it was just a joke and there were no bad feelings or anything. But alas they were still annoyed. I asked her how long they looked for the bike and she replied with: 'idk, my mom looked for it.'\n\nIt's now another day later and they're still pissed at us. I really don't think it's that bad of a prank to pull and they don't really have any reason to be upset since they didn't even search for it themselves. This might al be my misguided opinion, hence I'm writing this post.\n\nSo reddit please help me out, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "My partner and I have been together approx 4 years. Her sister is 22, though my partner treats her like she is 17 (coddles her a lot!). For two Christmases and two birthdays, I have given her sister a gift. Really thoughtful gifts that I spent a lot of time considering, shopping around, trying to find something she would really like. First Christmas I didn’t receive anything back, which is whatever. Second Christmas (and birthdays) I also didn’t receive anything back, which felt kinda bad. \n\nThis Christmas I just didn’t buy anything. Though I understand the point of giving a gift is not to receive one back, it just feels super shitty that I spend all of this time thinking about her sisters likes/hobbies/tastes, and she doesn’t offer even a token gesture back. Like I’d be happy with a keychain - at least some thought was there. \n\nAdditionally she’s never even thanked me for gifts. I have to send gifts with my partner as we spend Christmas separately. If I get a gift from someone who isn’t present, I will immediately message them with thanks and occasionally a photo of the item or the item in use. Idk, just seems polite. But I haven’t had that courtesy back - she just takes the gift and says nothing to me about it. \n\nI’m unsure whether this makes me the asshole or not. I feel like my partner thinks I’m a little bit of an asshole but hasn’t told me to get anything, and seems to understand on some level my reasoning of it just feeling shit to not be a thought. I did get gifts for my partners parents, as they began to reciprocate last Christmas. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "I work for a pretty small retailer. And when I say small retailer I mean the size of the stores themselves and not the chain. Each store has less than 20 people on its payroll, and I’m one of four managers who can open and close the store each day. Our old store manager left and my coworker *Zack* and I have been taking care of all administrative work around the store, handling customer complaints, scheduling etc,. We’ve been doing pretty well but recently we got our new store manager. He used to work for our company but has been out for several years due to a work-related injury. He’s been here for a month and during that time he’s been late almost every single day (and not by a few minutes, we’re talking at least one hour) and always has a different excuse, he takes half an hour bathroom breaks regularly, and he’s gruff with our customers. He is overweight and has trouble maneuvering due to his injury, but his position requires a lot of lifting and moving about quickly. Now he is scheduled for 10 minute breaks every 2 hrs, and that’s fine, but he always takes much more time than he is scheduled for, often leaving our less experienced staff members to handle the holiday crowds alone. He also won’t accomplish all the opening tasks because he arrives too late to finish at the pace he moves. I really want to bring it up with someone above him but I know it’s not my place. Zack doesn’t even seem to care that our store has gone downhill ever since the new store manager came onboard. Am I the asshole for wanting him to leave even though I know about his injury? Or is it reasonable???",

I didn’t start a fight when he told me because I don’t want him to use me ‘over reacting’ as an excuse not to tell me shit... I did ask him not to do coke again and he promised never again but tbh I don’t trust him now. He drinks socially and vapes but that’s all. Did I have a right to be pissed off? We have two kids but he didn’t do it at home and he knew he wouldn’t be back until the next day anyway so maybe that’s irrelevant. Do I have a right to be upset that he didn’t tell me before he did coke or does being his wife not give me the right to a say in what he does outside our home? (Obviously excluding breaking the expectations of a marriage) \n\nResubmitted to include AITA in the title and slightly reworded in the interest of being neutral and fair. ",

      "description": "It’s been a piece of shit year. My husband (8 years together and 2 kids later) and I separated in September this year and the list goes on for a while. I have my 2 kids half the year and it hurts me more and more as the holiday gets closer. \nRegardless of what else, I’ve had a shitty year and I’d be happy if I woke up tomorrow and it was January 2019. \n\nI have stressed to my family I just want to see my kids in the morning, do Santa and their presents before they go to their dads house for the evening. Then I want to forget the day exists, my plan is to get drunk and paint my bedroom walls. \n\nMy mum keeps asking me what I’m doing and if I’ll drive to see them (4hrs away) or if they can come to me. I’ve stressed no. And she continues to ask me every couple of days if I’ve changed my plans. \nShe messages every day without fail. Always has. I’m 25... \nTo the point I’ve had to crumble and agree to see her and dad on the 22nd. \n\nI spent my ex’s birthday in the bathroom toilet at work crying, I can’t imagine Christmas will be any different, if not worse. I don’t exactly want to have to force a smile for them or worse bring them down with me. \nI know their intentions are good and they want me to be with family. \nMy friend had a Christmas party which I declined to go for a couple reasons, mainly because I had my kids that weekend and I wanted to have the quality time with them, another because it’s Christmas and the thought of going without my ex made me cry. \nOne friend even made a crack that I’m being too over the top and need to just celebrate it and go along. I refused. \nPeople at work are aware I’ve split from my husband and that I’m having a shit time. I’ve said I’m doing the minimum for Christmas. They attempted to decorate my desk and I said no thanks. \nUsually I’m all for it, but this year I just can’t see the joy. My family is crumbled and whilst I’m thankful I still have my kids and for everything good that has happened I just feel this year I’m not ready for the over the top festivities that is Christmas.. \n\nAm I the asshole for banning Christmas this year?

      "description": "I'm just going to type this whole thing out as it happened, sorry if it gets long or convoluted. This happened about a year ago but for some reason I've been dwelling on it for the last week or so and I feel like revisiting it may help?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year (almost to the day now that I think about it) I \\[24f\\] went out for drinks with Jeff \\[25m\\], one of my best friends. Our friend Annie \\[22f\\] also joined us. Annie and I used to flirt a lot whenever she was in town but she's been in a monogamous relationship forever so I was always careful never to cross a boundary of her relationship. Jeff and I were on-and-off for a few years but haven't been anything other than friends for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe drank, I got very drunk off my three cocktails because I'm a lightweight, and while we were at the second bar Annie kissed me, which was surprising because of the whole boyfriend aspect but I was too drunk to think it through and we made out for a bit. Then she went to the bathroom and Jeff unexpectedly kissed me, which was more shocking because I thought we were completely passed being involved but I brushed it off as \"we're all drunk, kissing is fun, it's not a big deal.\" It honestly didn't occur to me that he might still be attracted to me, and I feel really stupid now for brushing it off like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnnie came back and I went to get a glass of water because I felt like I'd reached my drinking limit and when I came back they straight-up propositioned me for a threesome. I knew I wasn't interested but I think I got nervous so instead of being blunt I made up excuses...I think one of them was that I couldn't have sex because I had to go home and take out the trash. They said they didn't care and were willing to work around all the reasons I couldn't, I started to feel overwhelmed and told them I had to use the bathroom. I ran away and locked myself in the bar's bathroom for a minute to just think about what to do but I think around that time that last drink Annie had bought me was starting to hit...it's all a bit fuzzy here on out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember opening the door to the bathroom and both of them were right outside the door waiting for me. One of them put my coat over me and the other said they'd called an Uber to go back to my place. I remember Annie talking to me in the car on the way there and I could barely keep up with what she was saying but I don't think she realized how drunk I was. Somehow we got back to my apartment and I remember thinking I'd go along with it for now and maybe I'd get into it. So I let them undress me and we all got into my bed. Suddenly I heard a \"polite\" cough on the other side of the wall and realized my neighbor could hear everything we were doing. I got really embarrassed and tried to stop the threesome but Annie started kicking the wall and laughing while Jeff kept me from getting out of the bed, I remember trying to speak but not really being able to because of the alcohol so I don't think they realized that I was trying to end the evening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI won't go into too much detail but after that I figured if I made them cum they'd both leave. I still felt like I couldn't really move or participate and fell really bad about that, but I'm also really angry at Jeff for doing some things without asking first like trying to facefuck me without my permission. He did ask if I was okay with regular P in V sex and respected me when I said no. I think I was starting to sober up by then so I told them I just wanted to cuddle for a bit then they left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw Jeff a few days later and felt so \\*angry\\* at him for no reason, especially since he brought me flowers that day which is something he'd never done before. It was sweet but I just wanted to throw them out the window. I texted him later that I needed to process the evening that that I'd reach out when I was ready. He was so incredibly sweet and understanding and we haven't spoken since. Annie and I have had no contact since that evening, I feel weird and angry at her too but also guilty for feeling so angry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically I alienated and ended friendships two people because I kept giving mixed signals and couldn't get my shit together but I also feel like they should've noticed how drunk I was, especially since I'm a notorious lightweight. Am I being unfair? How do I apologize if I'm the asshole?",

I asked him what would happen if my face was burnt by fire (a bit of a reach but I had a small fire in my building the other day) and he started saying \"well what if become autistic?\" and just kept escalating. So I got pissed and I just kept saying it was my body, and he said he has to deal with \"my\" body for the rest of his life.\n\nI never even tell him what to do with his body, except not to drink in excess anymore because he was hospitalised for an entire day because of one incident.

      "description": "Using a throwaway and going to have to give some background. \n\nI have been dating a guy I've fallen deeply in love with for about a year (I'm 22). He is everything I could have ever wanted in a guy and one of the things I love most about him is his understanding and his humor. On Tuesday night we were really stoned and laughing and he asked me what the worst thing I'd ever done was. I guess it was the drugs but I'd shared something with him that I'd only hinted at before. \n\nWhen I was 15-18 I was a literal sugar baby for married man in his 40s/50s. For the most part I lived a normal teenage life but once a week or so I spent with this guy. I don't really see myself as a victim because I was a willing participant but I also understand how there can't really be a relationship like without the younger party being a victim. When the guy ended it with me I was devastated and I called his wife, sent pics, receipts, texts...everything. It destroyed the guys family, his work and I have no idea what happened to him after that. \n\nI'd hinted that I'd dated much older guys but I guess the combination of being high and trusting my boyfriend, I told him everything. He sort of freaked out but I wasn't sure what he was upset about. He made a joke like \"well at least don't boil my rabbit\" (It's from a movie called Fatal Attraction, about a scorned woman) and it seemed everything was fine. \n\nSo I decided to play a prank on him and on Wednesday, I bought a cheap stuffed rabbit and literally boiled it on his stove. Instead of him finding and seeing it for the joke it was supposed to be, he freaked out. He said he now questioned both my past and current decision making. That I was making a joke out of a situation that I should be ashamed of. Then he changed his tone and said I was a victim and that I shouldn't joke about that either. I tried to explain to him that I don't know how I feel about that situation but he wasn't helping me. He told me to leave and I did. \n\nI haven't heard from him and he hasn't answered my texts. I have no idea what to think. Am I an asshole for doing this?",

      "description": "This is a repost from another sub because I wanted more feedback if possible. Original post has more info (3000 character max in AITA)\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nI’m a senior in university. I am pretty isolated. I for the past three years I have kept maybe one friend and my boyfriend. I have anxiety and depression. The last year has been especially hard. Basically, I only go outside of my house for school or my part time job.\n\nA few months ago I got back in touch with a friend from freshman year, Sarah, and she invited me to eat lunch with her new friend group. The group includes Molly \\[f/21\\], Alex \\[x/21\\], and Candice \\[f/22\\]. I have known all of these people but was never very close to them.\n\nSarah and Candice are definitely leaving the country that we’re in after graduation in June, and Molly and Alex are not sure yet it seems. Additionally, Sarah and Candice are not going to be here from next week to end of May so I wanted to spend as much time with them as possible before they go.\n\n**THE SITUATION**\n\nKeep in mind at this point, we’ve hung out maybe 2-3 times a month maximum since February. So to me this is a LOT but to them it might be nothing, especially since they hang out more as a group.\n\nSarah, Molly and I had plans to go to a European restaurant for lunch on a specific day. I mentioned that I had work after and it’s not far from my work so it would be convenient! *DISCLOSURE: The place has options that I can eat (I have a certain diet that means I’m not just able to go to any restaurant without researching a bit)*\n\nI had mentioned that we should invite Alex and Candice but that I didn’t have their contact/a group chat so I expected if anything Sarah and Molly would invite them. I’m not sure if they did though.\n\nThe day before we were supposed to hang out, I was checking the site for the restaurant online and realized it would be closed. I texted Sarah and Molly and mentioned it and asked if they would prefer going to another place or if they would rather reschedule. They both said that they were cool with rescheduling. \n\nThe next day (when we were originally supposed to hang out), I’m checking Instagram. And I see that Sarah, Molly, Alex, and Candice all posted a story that they were in the same area for lunch as the European restaurant we were supposed to go to. Literally down the block. I wasn’t invited.\n\nWe rescheduled out lunch plan 30 minutes ago. Also Sarah invited me to a picnic in the park on Sunday yesterday. But I still can't help but be a bit upset still.\n\nI’m pretty socially isolated so I am aware that maybe this situation is something people normally wouldn’t be upset about. I have heard that not being around people enough can twist one’s perceptions of what people are doing so I wanted to ask for advice on how to navigate my feelings and/or the situation.\n\nI don’t want to be that person who butts into a group and ruins the whole vibe. I don’t know.\n\n**WITBA if I mention that I feel left out?**",

      "description": "So a few weeks back I moved from the Midwest to Montana for my masters. I'm in a weird place in my life where I don't have many friends and no real relationships outside of family back east. I am also terribly awkward in social situations, but I don't really mind being alone. I'm also the last person you'll find drinking. We use EtOH to preserve specimens so I'm around it all day. I haven't really been \"out for drinks\" since I turned 21.\n\nI love my work, which is good because I spend at least 50 hours a week on it. (This is pretty normal in my lab) Between general lab work, specimen loans, and my own project, I stay pretty busy, which gives me an excuse to avoid most social situations. \n\nMy workspace is directly across from another students, let's call her Bee because she works on Bees. We are on good terms, both being being new students from the Midwest, though she's much more socially proficient than I am. \n\nAnother student, let's call him L, came in and we all started talking about various odds and ends, he was heading out for the day and wanted us to let the PI know he'd been in. L is sharp as a tack, and is one of the better researchers in his field, he remembered my birthday, which I think I mentioned once in passing is the 3rd. Bee and L started talking about bringing food in and organizing something. This made me feel a bit bad because it had been Bee's birthday a few weeks prior and we didn't do anything for it besides wishing her a happy birthday (Though she does have family in town to celebrate with).\n\nAnyways, they eventually decided that we would have a party after work on Monday. Nothing fancy, just the lab going to a local bar. They were so excited about it and I didn't want to tell them that I would rather just work until seven and go home. But now I feel like I'm on the hook and am sort of dreading it. \n\nI know they just want to make me happy and I really appreciate the gesture, so I will be attending, and I will do my best impersonation of an extrovert, but I feel like a dick for not telling them I don't want it, and I feel like it would be similarly dickish to cancel their plans, when they seemed so happy discussing them. \n\nSo, AIAA for not wanting to go to my birthday party?\n\nAlso socially adjusted people of Reddit, am I handling this the wrong way?",

My father says he can’t really say no since he’s family, but this is starting to cause us problems with paying bills, as my father is the only one receiving any sort of money, and hes retired, so he cant really work. \n\nIn addition to not having a job, he’s also raked up $100k+ from my dad to pay for his college a few years ago, but he still hasn’t done anything with his degree.  \n\nRecently, my father has gotten fed up with him, and basically told him to either get a job, or get kicked  out. My brother freaked out and promised he would, but would need more money to study for another college degree. My father agreed, and gave him a $10k deposit.\n\nMy brother is going to finish college soon, and promised he would look for a job ASAP, but I honestly doubt it. I spoke with my dad and told him it would be a good idea to just kick him out now, since hes just going to keep asking for more money, and will probably not get a job as long as he lives here, but he got really offended. He said that my brother was family, and he has to support him, no matter what happens, and to let him look for a job first before kicking him out. I wanted to say, really? And how many years is that job search going to take? But I think it was just better to say nothing.\n\nMy father told other family members, including my brother, about what I said, and they’re all extremely mad at me, saying how rude I am to treat my brother like that, how I should just “get a job and support myself” instead. \n\nAITA for wanting him out asap?\n\ntldr; 29 yr old brother hasn’t had job since high school, still lives at home, went to college twice, and still probably won’t get a job. uses dads money to pay for everything. asked father to just kick him out now, but he wants to wait until he gets a job.\n",

      "description": "Our college gives out distinction certificates for those with SGPAs above 80%. My friend had no place for his certificate and I had to keep it with me in my bag. But we didn't meet after that till our next set of exams. On the last exam, we had planned to meet so I could give him his certificate.  I had texted him before the exam asking him to come to where I was camped out. I finished my paper early and was leaving. I met another friend and got to paper discussion, that's when I thought I saw my friend in another classroom. I asked the teacher supervising the hall(invidulating?) and asked her to give the certificate to the person I thought was my friend. My other friend with me didn't realise the mistake either. \n\nI wasn't in a rush to get home or anything but I had worl to do that wasnt uber urgent either. I thought I'd get it over with. In a bit I got a lift back home and 1KM in, I got a call and turns out my friend was looking for me. I told him where I gave the cert over and asked him to check. I asked if he needed me to come back. He said yes so I walked back, oppologising profusely. Once he/we got there, there was noone and all the faculty offices were empty.  Everything was locked and no sign. \n\nWe tried asking around for a lost property thing and our college has none. Fuck them. We went to the Exam Controller office that handles paper correction with the respective faculty(for malpractice etc). And we waited for an hour for help. No one helped and I told my friend that he could leave and I'd handle it. He told me it's fine cause he's a KM away. He said we'd have to meet anyway to get it from me. And we were both heading out of town soon. I dropped hints that they may charge to replace certificates, or that we could meet the department head and see what could be done. Eventually we left cause there was no point and we both had places to be. I was oppologising through all this while he was trying to downplay it all, saying \"it's okay. That cert isnt the most importa,t\" It isn't, but it has worth.\n\n\nHe wasn't mad at me to the highest sense either and we also tried to make plans to go for aovie(Into the Spider Verse) the plans failed cause of packing and my cousins coming over.\n\n\n\nSo AITA?",

She said 15%.\n\nAfterwards, my one friend mentioned that I should have tipped better than normal just because it's a friend of a friend which is fair enough, but is 15% really the bare minimum tip?

      "description": "Throwaway account for reasons.\nI work in an old-school type of university in southern Europe, which adheres to the idea of every student it's on its own. The reason I say this is because in each of my lectures (I teach fluid dynamics) I have roughly 350/400 students. I can't personally know them individually and, unless they ask, I won't personally go ask them how they are doing with my lectures. ( I always wait 10/20 minutes after class for further questioning from the students).\nHaving so many people in the same room, background noise increases exponentially, as well as constant chatter between students. I hate it. My lectures last 3 hours each period and we have a 5 minutes break every hour, and so, I admit that I may sometimes be on edge.\n\nAlright, now, here comes the real deal.\nWhilst explaining some laws about cylindrical heat exchange, I have had received several basic questions about stuff that was being explained, as well as some pretty dumb questions in itself. Add to that, that, almost everyone starts speaking the moment I stop talking... I snapped.\nA student finally asked the dumbest question he could ask in that specific lecture (something about natural logarithms, which they are suppose to learn the year prior) and I could not handle it.\nI told him (in front of everyone) the answer and then I asked him how he could be in this room  without that knowledge, putting into question his seriousness about the topic at hand and his inability to grasp basic concepts that were explained a year prior, suggesting he should revisit the course once more, since he obviously learned nothing.\nBetween screaming and laughter I shut everyone up and proceeded with the lecture.\n\nAfter class, my assistant (whom was present during the lecture) told me that I might have been harsh with the student and that I should apologize with. Of course, I have no idea who that student was. \nSo, knowing all this and my position as a teacher, should I really spend my time searching for this kid and apologize? Am I an asshole if I don't?\n",

      "description": "A little backstory. My sibling identifies as non-binary, meaning they don’t feel like a man, nor a woman. \nMy parents are very conservative about gender/relationships and they believe only a man and a woman can have a true relationship together. \nSo my sibling has a woman’s body, and they like to wear (men’s) boxers to sleep. My mom saw this the other night, but stayed quiet about it. Later, she came to talk to me about it and how it shocked her and said she wouldn’t want her child to become a man. She then asked me what I would think of my sibling being a man and I said I would not have a problem with it, that I support them in whatever they do, as long as they’re not hurting anyone.\nShe disagreed of course, but we came to terms.\nLater that week, my sibling wanted to talk to me and they asked me if it would be a problem for me if they were to change their body. I obviously said no and was shocked they would even asked me that, because they know how I feel about their gender. They then proceeded to tell me that our mom told them I wouldn’t bear seeing them as a man and that I would resent them for it. \nI talked it out with them, no harsh feelings, however I was really angry with my mom. She is and always has been manipulative, but this really shocked me. She has always turned the truth a bit and she tells white lies all the time to get what she wants, but this was just a complete lie. \nMy sibling told me to not talk to my mother about it, since they didn’t want to cause any more family drama. But I was so angry at my mom, that she would harm the relationship (which is a very healthy and caring one, and my mom knows this)  with my sibling , simply because of her selfish and closed minded reasons. So I went and confronted her about it. She obviously denied it, but went to have a private talk with my sibling right away, so I know she was lying and my sibling got in trouble. They are very mad at me and won’t talk to me. Although I understand my siblings reasonings, I think it wasn’t just about them anymore and that I had to talk to my mom about her lying and her manipulation. I really don’t know what to do at this point, because both, my mom and my sibling, think I’m the A*hole.",

      "description": "Weird title, weird situation.\n\nWe've been officially together for 4 months, as in exclusively but weve known eachother for seven.\n\nTo put it simply, she cries during sex. Full tears. Not so much at first but when we're really speeding up and when we finish. Just bawling, sometimes silent tears and other times sort of moaning/crying.\n\nFirst time this happened i stopped because i thought i was either hurting her or she was having a flashback or something. She immediately wipes her tears and asks why i stopped. Completely normal again, even confused like im the odd one.\n\nShe says that she cries during sex when shes nearing orgasm. She states it matter of factly. Now im not super experienced so maybe this is a common thing women do but i have never heard of it.\n\nShe says when she cries like that she doesn't want me to stop. Ive had sex with her multiple times and its always the same. I ask her to hold it back but she cries anyway. I ask her if she hates when we have sex but she says she likes it. I ask her if shes ever been abused and she says no.\n\nLike i said i dont know if this is normal for women when they orgasm but i told her that she may need to see a therapist. She is angry at me for being \"obsessive\" about it and shaming her supposedly. \n\nI just want, idk, for women to look like they enjoy having sex with me? Lmao AITA?",

      "description": "So, I guess I'll start off with background information. I am 21, and transmasculine, or female to male if that term works for you. I have known since I was 15, though was unable to act on it until I moved several hours away, about three years ago. A couple months after I moved, I started medically transitioning, but had some mental health issues, so I stopped for about a year, and have since been medically transitioning again for a year. Now, I've been fully socially transitioned in my life for almost a year at this point, which is pretty easy with my family so far away. I'm what we have termed \"stealth\". I'm seen fully as male, and nobody knows I'm trans other than my closest friends who have been around me for over a year. It's a very small part of me I like to keep to myself. \n\nMy parents, well, I don't have a great relationship with them. I really do love my mom, she raised me on her own after she seperated from my alcoholic father. She gave me as much as she could when I was younger. But she can be a bit... Narcissistic. She has those tendencies. She takes everything positive, and turns it negative. But she does genuinely love me, and since I live so far away now, our relationship is better, since she cannot control my life as much as she used to.\n\nAnd she does deserve to know these things about her child. But I'm so terrified of her reaction. Even after all these changes, and meeting several trans people, she still doesn't see it. She still talks about how weird trans people are. My stepdad has said some questionably homophobic things to me as well, assuming I'm a lesbian. They're not great with this, and I genuinely don't know if this would get better with me helping them forward. It feels like I'm coming close to having to seperate myself even more from them, especially after I tell them. \n\nTo the point of the question: there's a fairly large chance I could get top surgery within a year. This is something that is very important to me, and my physical health. I've been wearing what's called a binder, and they are... Somewhat dangerous. They're basically a compression top that goes over your chest. I've been wearing it for 6 years at this point, 7 days a week, for about 8 to 16 hours a day, and it's caught up to me. Back issues, serious shoulder pain. I can't exercise with it on, as that's dangerous, but at the same time, I can't leave the house without it on, for obvious reasons and my own personal mental health. \n\nI personally think I would absolutely be the asshole, but I don't know if that's my mom talking inside of me. My friends have told me I should just go and do it without telling my family, and I don't know if that's right. I didn't want to post this on a trans forum, because I'd be getting trans related experiences. I already know their answers. I can absolutely give more information if this is not enough. I just am seeking an outside opinion on the matter.",

      "description": "This story if going to sound stereotypical but this is my situation. I am a man in my mid 30's, I put having a wife and kids off to focus on my career, and now I make a very good living and a year ago I started dating again.\n\nI met a 19 year old aspiring model and \"social media influencer\". Shes attractive, I like her, she likes me, I know that people may think I'm robbing the cradle but thats not the point of this post.  \n\nSo a little bit more to this stereotypical story, we've been dating for a year now, we live together, and I buy her A LOT of stuff. I bought her a 70,000 dollar truck, AND I bought her a 40,000 dollar car. Thats in addition to her constantly using my rapide s to pick up her friends.\n\nWe spent christmas in Sicily. I gave her an 8,000 necklace for her birthday. Needless to say, outside of modeling, which I also pay for (shoots, marketing), she does not work.\n\nI am fine with this, I like spoiling her and its really no issue. However, I am not an idiot and I realize that this looks like a typical case of a gold digger using an older man for his money. I'm not saying thats what this is because I do love her, but that is what it seems like to an outside viewer.\n\nI do love her, we have a very good relationship, but I feel like if we were ever to get married we should have a prenuptial agreement. I told her this after she asked me about us getting married.\n\nPersonally I think we should wait a bit. I'm not into just rushing into anything. But she asked, so I told. I just said that I would feel more comfortable with a prenup. She blows up at me about how could I not trust her, and I just told her nobody knows what the future can hold. I am a child of divorce and I know how messy they can be.\n\nI just said we should wait, but if I had to answer now, I would like a prenup. Things can change. I also feel like its a bit fucked up to accuse me of being selfish or greedy when I have given her so much. AITA? ",

      "description": "Posting from fiancées phone because my reddit acc is locked (idk why I’ve never done anything wrong)\n\nBackstory: me (20/M) and my fiancée (19/F)live with her parents and her 5 younger siblings (11,7,6,5,3) we’ve been saving recently to get enough money for bond to move out and recently came into a bit of extra money and decided to buy a PSVR which we’ve been wanting for the better part of a year.\n\n\nSo we bought a PSVR 2 days ago and set it up in our room and tested it out as soon as we got home, her 11 yr old little brother (from here on out “LB”) came in and saw and was like wow cool and I offered to let LB play for a bit so he did and then I asked him to get of and he did which was good but then for the rest of the day he would periodically come in every half an hour and ask if he could have a go and we kept saying no to the point where he got really annoying and we told him to stop asking. Yesterday he did the same thing and asked every half an hour and asked us/gave us dirty looks every time we left our room and eventually at 11 at night we said sure he could have a go (he should have been in bed but whatevs) . Today is where the real problems began , LB was asking every half an hour again and getting whiny and telling his parents to tell us to let him have a go to which they said no so he just kept sulking all day and eventually my fiancée said to me why don’t we just let him have a go so he stops nagging to which I said no because I don’t want to reward this type of behaviour and because that means he’ll just do it again tomorrow until he gets what he wants, anyways at some stage in the afternoon he ended up just sitting next to our door in the hallway “crying” (we’re not sure how long he was there) so as soon as my fiancée walked out the door she saw him and was annoyed so she whispered to her mum that he was still asking to play so her mum came and smacked him and get him to stop, her dad ended up hearing this and went absolutely off because he was sick of LB constantly asking and complaining and hit LB about 5ish times while screaming at him and my fiancée incoherent words along the lines of stop asking. My fiancée then come back into our room crying saying we should have just let him have a go and that she feels bad LB got hit but I still believe that we shouldn’t have because LB needs to learn he can’t just nag and cry and sulk to get what he wants. Am I the asshole for not letting him use it?\n\nAlso the night we got the PSVR I told LB if he doesn’t nag us we’ll let him have a go (he asked to play it again half an hour later)\n\nThanks for reading if you got this far and sorry if my formatting is bad I’m on mobile and don’t make long posts very often.",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have an interesting background. I met her at work, we dated in secret for ~6 months. She moved to a different department, I moved companies. We made public our relationship and have been dating for 2 years.\n\nI own a condo, she rents a 1 bedroom apartment. I have a roommate to subsidize my mortgage. She pays a lot to live on her own. She also has a large German Shepard mix dog who I love, however he sheds all. the. time. I invite the dog to stay over occasionally and I always need to vacuum up all his fur, use tape to get it out of my couch (because lint rollers aren't strong enough), and take my comforter to the laundromat to get his fur out of it.\n\nRecently, her stepmom &amp; dad visited us, and her stepmom asked at what point we would move in together. This triggered something in her, because after they left, she told me that normally, couples who've been seeing each other for 2 years move in together, and she's wasting money by paying for a place to live when we could be splitting rent (e.g. mortgage) with her living with me. She also makes comments all the time about how frustrating it is for her to bring all of her items to get ready in the morning back and forth between places when she stays over (but refuses to let me stay at her house bc she can't keep it clean due to her dog...)\n\nIn short, I don't want to move in with her. For one, I'm allergic to dogs and do not want to live with one, especially a large, constantly shedding dog who takes up so much space in my tiny 850 sq ft condo. Two, I like having nights alone and not spending every night with her. That's just my personality. I don't want to spend every single night with her. It's not anything to do with her - I love her - but I need my space every now and then. (And I think that part may be what makes me the asshole here but I'd love input). Three, we have no current plans on marriage. She's divorced (she's 33, I'm 27) and doesn't want to remarry. I don't want to get married in general. We're both totally 100% okay with that. Having said that, if we do decide to break up, living together would make it all more difficult. \n\nAm I the asshole here? Should she expect to move in with me after 2 years? Am I valuing my want for personal space too much over her feelings and living situation? Should I not think that living with her dog is this big of a deal?",

      "description": "The other day I got a call from a client, he had a last minute gig and they needed two people at $XX/hr. Would I want to do it and did I know anyone else that would do it. I said I can do it and I will call around. I text my buddy (we'll call him Greg) who is in the same industry. I said \"you free for a gig tomorrow evening? $XX/hr and they want 2 people.\" He says sure. Next night we show up and do the event, no issues. \n\nLater, I give Greg the client's email and tell him to send them his invoice directly. All of a sudden Greg gets mad, he apparently doesn't like said client and said he only did the gig as a favor to me, and wouldn't ever work with client and so now is demanding his full rate $XXX. He seems to think I tricked or misled him. Truthfully, I didn't know he had history with the client, nor did I know he was doing a special price just for me. I thought I was being nice by bringing him on, and I was upfront about the rate and commitment. In my mind there is no difference between me billing the client and then paying Greg versus just having Greg bill them directly. Greg feels he was taken advantage of.\n\nSo am I the asshole and how do I fix this? I don't want to lose a valuable industry connection but I also feel like Greg is being unprofessional and petty. And obviously I have to make the client happy too. ",

I have a team that does really, really well which is important because the last several weekends they have tournaments in which the winning team gets 50000 coins. This is a signifigant amount considering coins cost money.\n\nOn our team is an older lady who plays all the Time and I think the chat is one of her main ways of social contact. For three weekends in a row, when we've needed her most for the weakens tournaments and we've lost by under 10 stars each time. I sent out a message on Friday that said it was a \"all hands on deck\" weekend because we really wanted for win and I warned that anyone not participating would be removed from the team. Well again, this lady did not participate. I sent a message out late Sunday as rhe tournament was drawing to a close and we were in a danger of finishing 6th (I.e, with nothing) that I would be reviewing everyone's play on Monday and anyone getting less than 5 stars would be kicked off. \n\nShe sent an emphatic message this morning begging to allowed to stay on the team. One other person said I was taking this way too seriously, but 3 others said that they too were sick of noshows and I need to remove her. \n\nI'm torn but I fear not being taken seriously but I'm also not about ruining an older ladies fun.\n\nWould I be the asshole?

So I went to his house for the first time.\n\nWe ended up falling asleep on the sofa, so we then went to bed, it was pretty late and I was exhausted, and I just really didn’t want sex, like really didn’t want sex. So I figured when we went to bed and I simply went to sleep, he would have figured I didn’t want sex, right? \n\nHe woke me up about an hour later really pissed off saying “do you have a rule or something, because if you do I should know about it? You have made me feel really shit and blown my self esteem completely”, so I told him I just wasn’t ready, he reaaallly didn’t appreciate me saying this, apparently I should have said before the date???? \n\nLike seriously? Is it a rule to decide before a date if you are going to have sex or not?! I’m trying to explain to him before the date I hadn’t ruled out sex all together, I was just going to see how we got on and where the night led. I told him it was all a bit odd that he got angry about it, but he’s fumingggg. \n\nEither way, roll on watching season 8 alone haha!",

These events have gotten all of us connections within the IRL monster truck universe, and personally has helped me through depression and gotten me opportunities for jobs I couldn't have dreamed of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe and my friend (we'll call him Sam) have met in real life and seen a monster truck show together. This is what led to us doing the RoR events together. He was set to be the third driver, since he's the best out of almost anybody in the community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSam yesterday had something happen to him. He went offline and only told two people (one he hasn't even met irl and the other his cousin) about what happened. The worst part is all I hear about the situation is he wants to take his own life.  I was shocked to know he considered it but also shocked to know he didn't tell me anything. I was sad but also angry that he didn't even consider telling me anything, especially that he wouldn't be back for months. I started to think about the event and how it could be affected, especially since we have only three weeks. After talking about this with some folks in Discord, they started calling me an asshole for caring about my event and not solely on his health. Am I in the wrong? I feel like I have a right to be mad about something important, regardless of his mental status.",

      "description": "Hi I'm new here and this is my first ever post. By the way this is on mobile.\n\n(Background)\nI'm a 19 year old female, I have 3 sisters and no brothers. My father was in the military when I was younger I don't fault him for that.\n\n(Cast)\nOldest sister: Cat\n2nd oldest sister: Taurus\n3rd oldest sister: Cancer\nMe: Yuki\nMom\nDad\n\n(Story)\nThis happened last night when earlier in the day my father told Cat she had to go back home after she was living with for only 2 months. While Cat was in the heat of the moment she threw my name in the mix to hurt our dad and make him feel bad.\nFast forward to when my mom got home. My mom sat us all down, Taurus, Cancer, and me, to talk about how we felt about our dad.\n\nMom: \"I got you all down here to talk about how you feel about your father. Who wants to go first?\"\nCancer: \"I will, I don't really feel anything about daddy. I have nothing to say nothing is bothering me about it.\"\nMom: \" Yuki?\"\nMe: \"I feel like daddy wasn't there alot when I was younger, but I understand why\"\nMom: \"Taurus?\"\nTaurus: \" why am I down here this has nothing to do with me.\"\nMom: \"just answer the question\"\nTaurus: \" he wasn't there and I know he was in the military he couldn't help that.\"\nMom: \"okay now that is all said. Cat said that Yuki hate your father.\"\nYuki: \"no I didn't say that all I said was that I was lost and didn't know what my place was in the world.\"\n\nAfter that I went into more detail why I felt the way I did. Cancer started argue with Taurus, after Cancer said that both me and Taurus were fake sisters I couldn't take it and went up stairs. I went into my room and started listening to music and played freecell (card game), and after a while i texted my dad say that he was not the reason I felt lost and did feel like i had a place in the world. He ended up calling me and I was a crying mess. He calmed me down enough and to me to fo back down stairs so he could speak to Cancer about say we were fake sisters. Cancer told him that I said I feel like he wasn't there and didn't raise us. I feel like I should have told how I felt in person face to face not over the phone. Anyways my dad started to cry and say he was sorry for making me feel like I wasn't there for me when i was younger. Taurus went up stairs and Cancer went up stairs after that and so did I. I feel that everything is my fault, from the start of whole conversation to the end.\n\nToday my dad text me good morning and I told him I was sorry I made him sad and I know he couldn't help it. He text back saying that he love me, my sister, and my mom, and we were going to have to talk and make things right. He also said we a his world and he loves us with all his heart.\n\nAITA for not telling him sooner and him hearing our of someone's else's mouth instead of mine. I just feel like everything is my fault and I don't deserve such a kind person as my father.",

Yesterday I get a LONG message from him saying that he wanted to tell me that he was gay and that he didn't mean to string me on but he was just scared of coming out and he wanted to be friends. \nI was fine with this. People sometimes do get scared of coming out and I was willing to be friends with him because despite the fact he hid this from me I like him as a person.\nWe spoke for a few hours but towards the end of the conversation I was pissed. \nI have always told him I don't like liars. I can forgive a white lies, and I can forgive people who admit to their lies once called out but I won't tolerate lying and then doubling down on that lie. \nThese are the things that came out in quick succession that pissed me off \n\n\"I didn't want to hurt you, I just didn't know I was gay\"\nThen \n\"I slept with nearly 20 men before I got with you, and a few while we were together\" \n\nAnd \n\n\"I just thought I might be bisexual because I was attracted to you\"\nThen \n\"I don't believe in bisexuality, it's just an excuse\" \n\nI pointed out the inconsistensies in his story and that he knows how I feel about doubling down on a lie so if he wanted to come completely clean and tell me what actually happened, which was he used me as a cover story while he was seeing men behind my back, I could accept it. \n\nHe doubled down anyway. So I told him I can't be his friend because I can't trust him. \nNow he's telling people im homophobic because I didn't accept him straight away, but I did. I just didn't accept him lying to me. \n\nAITA \nTL;DR - ex boyfriend slept with men before, during and after our relationship and told me he was straight the whole time. Came out as gay to me and then lied about a) being attracted to me and b) not knowing he was gay. Then doubled down on the lie and I cut him off - AITA",

FEH is one of those games that you have to summon to get characters, if anyone has ever played it you know how annoying and enraging it can be at times. Once the Christmas summons came around Kaito tried to get a character he's wanted since the christmas of 2017 but never got. Kaito was passionate about this and really wanted this ONE CHARACTER. But sadly, he hadn't gotten it. But Jake did. And he was rubbing it in Kaito's face. When Kaito told me about this I confronted Jake, I told him to stop rubbing it in Kaito's face and Jake proceeds to tell me that he went for that one character, why? I don't know why even now. Now, I'm the type of person that refuses to have justice so unserved and so I took matters into my own hands. I yelled at him because we never go for the characters he wants, we respect that but this isn't the first time he's done this to me or Kaito, so I fought with Jake. This is pretty much how the situation went down:\nJake: \"It doesn't effect his game why does it matter so much?!\"\nMe: \"It matters because we always respect you and the characters you want but when we want ONE CHARACTER you go STRAIGHT FOR IT it's unfair!!\"\nHe then blocked me after saying it's just a game.

I had people blocked in my life because of her and money stolen and fights started cuz of her fake claims. Usually whenever I was told anything I felt that I was in the wrong and would grab a smoke thinking I’m the ass hole for not understanding and when she eventually told me to stop smoking I couldn’t because it was what I was used to. When I went to her and told her I need help to stop I got zero support or help I told her I decreased it so i wouldn’t make her feel bad but it never changed. (Update: I happily stopped smoking and I’ve been 3 months clean:))",

      "description": "My godmother’s sister passed recently. Their family is very close to mine because of my parents, but I only really have vague memories of them from growing up before they moved when I was 9 (I’m now 24). When she was hospitalized my mom asked me to come to the hospital so I did to console her and the family. I didn’t really feel any personal connection to the loss but I still wanted to be there to support them. This was actually my closest experience with this kind of loss in a family. \n\nA day before the funeral (which I was not told about at all before) my mom asks if I can go but I am scheduled to work that day and it’s over an hour away. I said I would try to find a replacement to take my shift, which is nearly impossible on such short notice. \n\nThe very idea of funerals make me uncomfortable, especially since it is an open-casket. Also, being very strongly atheist, I would be especially uncomfortable in a very sad religious environment. I also don’t want to be there expected to be as sad as everyone else for someone I barely knew \n\nI’m feeling so conflicted. I managed to fine someone willing to take my shift, but I decided not to go. I can’t shake that feeling of guilt. I supported my godmother and her family while her sister was in the hospital and visited my mom after it happened to console her. My mom sounded so upset about me not going but the the thought of it makes me anxious. Am I an asshole for not going?",

      "description": "A bit of background; I have a large group of tightly knit friends of mostly men, and I’m sorta “the leader” of the group. We’re all involved in a subculture that’s very open about mental health so we all speak very openly about our issues and support eachother. They dub me “the agony aunt” as I’m very well trusted and respected, so I’m usually the person people go to with their deepest, darkest problems. \n\nA couple of years ago I made friends with a guy and kinda took him under my wing. His only group of friends were other men who’d never dare to talk about feelings, and they’d even pick on him for being “weak”.\n\nI introduced the new guy to my group and everyone seems to like him, although he acts a bit distant with people and always says that he doesn’t think that they like him, which isn’t true. He’s just incredibly insecure.\n\nI feel that I made a massive mistake by telling him that if he needs to talk I’ll always be there. I say the same thing to all my other friends, and they do take me up on that offer occasionally, which I don’t mind.\n\nBut the new guy began messaging me every single day with a new “problem”. It’s usually something ridiculous like he met a girl he liked but she probably doesn’t like him back, or that he “feels sad and doesn’t know why”.\n\nI’ve began to realise that he’s taken to needing me to validate his every thought and feeling. He calls me, messages me, comes to my house all the time just to complain about whatever is bothering him that day. He’d never ask how I am doing either, he treats me more as an emotional crutch than a friend.\n\nWhen he speaks to me his messages are extreme vague. He doesn’t usually tell me directly what’s wrong, he just acts super sad and I don’t know what to say to him anymore. I’ve told him that he needs to see a doctor but he just acted like I was being dramatic.\n\nIt had become such a daily stress for me that I’ve stopped reading his messages and hanging out with him. My inbox is full of read messages and missed calls from him, and he knows that I worry about friends so he’s sending vague messages that push me like “I feel like doing something stupid...” but I’m trying to not take the bait.\n\nI know that he has pretty severe depression and has harmed himself before, but I feel like I’ve done everything I can to help him and that he’s just using me at this point. I stopped speaking to him for the sake of my own mental health but I still feel bad about it. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: friend is using me as a personal therapist so I started ghosting him ",

Anyway back to the story.\n\nIt all started the other day where I was sat in the library talking to a few others when he comes up to me with 2 others and starts trash talking me for having a TikTok account. Now even I admit that some of mine can be quite cringy but I try to make it as good as possible and I enjoy doing it.However, the problem is that he has a tiktok account for its intended purpose and spends ( at least what he’s told me) 30 minutes making a few. \n\nHe keeps going on and on for about 5 mins and when I try to correct something he says \n“ shut the f*** up you make tiktoks”\nFinally he leaves and i sit there trying to process what happened. Eventually, I decide that I will: make a second account on Instagram, follow everyone that follows my main except for the kid himself and a few family members, then screen record all his tiktoks and post them to make fun of him.\n\nI’ve screen recorded all of it but I’m still debating whether I should post it so I decided to see if I was being an asshole. Should I post it or should I not?\n\n(Edit; I’m looking back and noticing how sad this sounds so I’m sorry if this made you cringe a lot )\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "This happened at the beginning of the year. My roommate and I were deciding over text which wifi package to get. We have two other roommates who weren’t in the loop at this point. The convo went something like this:\n\nRoommate: We can get the average speed package at X price or get the fastest package for  $50 more annually per person. What do you think?\n\nMe: I’d rather just get the regular wifi package. I don’t want to spend extra money.\n\nRoommate: I just bought the faster package.\n\nMe: What the fuck? We were just deciding together I thought? I dont think I can afford that.\n\nRoommate: Are you kidding me? This is my senior year. I want the fastest wifi. Im not gonna be stuck with shitty connection!\n\nMe: I’m not paying for that shit. You essentially spent my $ without permission. \n\nRoommate (who is now backtracking): Well, I just bought it for myself. You guys can choose whether or not to join the plan (even though he texted me about what I wanted to do in the first place)\n\nMe: Yeah good luck paying at least twice as much as everyone else each month. Let’s see how long that lasts.\n\nRoommate: [stops responding]\n\nI told him in person he should either cancel the plan or pay everyone’s premium. He refused. He kept trying to frame it as it was his wifi plan that he was willing to let us join, but I pointed out that was complete bullshit because none of us could afford any of the plans on our own and the logistics of having a router in the apartment that not everyone knew the password to are very complicated (roommates are going to find out eventually and it will be awkward when guests ask for the password when other roommates are in ear shot). He knew damn well we were in it together. \n\nAlso, I asked him if I went behind his back and got the cheaper wifi without his agreement, do you think we would be having a similar conversation? He said yes but still refused to nudge at this point. \n\nIn the end, he agreed to pay my premium, but not my roommates, because I brought up all the favors I did for him last year.\n\nAITA for refusing to pay the premium when he went behind my back to get the more expensive wifi plan that he needed everyone to contribute to?\n\n\n\n",

He was really sweet and just seemed like a genuinely good kid and was very respectful. Thing is, I agreed to go on the date to give him a chance, I think that’s kinda the point of a first date. Regardless, I just don’t find Gary physically attractive. I just seen him more as a friend than someone I’d be interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with. He asked me on a second date afterwards, and I told him I wasn’t sure and I would definitely get back to him with my decision within a couple days.\n\nHere’s the predicament: Prom is this Saturday and I don’t have a date. That, on it’s own, doesn’t matter, because I’m perfectly content with going with friends and without a date. However, Gary does online school, and thus will never have a prom to go to. I would love to invite him to be my date, but I don’t want to look (or feel) like I’m using him. He seemed down when he mentioned he would never have a prom, and part of me feels like it would be fun for both of us.

I got the cats before the relationship started and they don’t adapt well with other animals due to being abused before I rescued them. They even are afraid of other humans apart from myself and now my girlfriend who they are used to. So I am very hesitant about getting a dog as they would not cope. We also work long hours and I feel we do not have enough free time to care for a dog appropriately, whereas cats are a lot more independent.\n\nThis has put a serious strain on our relationship and especially being long distance currently has made it even worse. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting to get a puppy?",

      "description": "We’ve been together 4 years. Our relationship has been long distance for about two years while I’ve been finishing my degree. I graduate this month (finally!) and the plan is for me to move back to LA where my boyfriend lives.\n\nThe problem is I’m having major doubts about everything now. My boyfriend is in the entertainment industry. In the time I’ve been gone he’s gotten a new manager (I’ll call him Ted). My boyfriend and Ted now share a condo. I don’t really understand the reason for this since I know my boyfriend can afford to live alone (and Ted is supposedly super successful so I would assume that means he has at least enough money for his own place). My boyfriend claims it’s super common for artists to live with their managers but IDK. \n\nAnyway I just dropped it. The other thing is, my boyfriend chose to spend thanksgiving with this guy instead of traveling to see me. I was too stressed over exams to travel and I really wanted my boyfriend to come stay for a couple days. He instead opted to stay local to have a “Friendsgiving” that of course included Ted. \n\nThey’ve also done a bunch of “work” trips together. I found out that they share a room when they go. My boyfriend also thinks this is totally normal. I asked about the bed situation (basically trying to confirm that they always have two separate beds) and he was really vague about it and said “Oh it depends what they have available. We prefer two beds.”  \n\nAnyway Saturday night I got a little buzzed and emotional over some stuff that’s going on with my family. I called my boyfriend and as I’m mid-sentence he put me on hold because he had to “go see what ‘Ted’ wanted.” When he got back on the phone I just flat out asked him if he’s sleeping with Ted. Of course he was caught off guard and was like “wtf are you talking about??” And I just laid out all the reasons I’m suspicious. And do you know what his response was? To hang up on me. \n\nHe didn’t talk to me all day Sunday (and I honestly can’t remember the last time we went a full day without talking so that was odd). Today we texted a little. I think he’s expecting an apology but I haven’t given one (at least not yet). \n\nAITA in this situation?",

      "description": "Recently created throwaway account and first time poster, hope my formatting isn't too bad.\n\nSo last night me(22M) and my gf(22F) were chatting at night, nothing out of the usual. We were talking about her luck at finding jobs and how she had asked one of her bestfriends(20-something M) from another state if he knew of anything. Then, after that she told me that she asked if he was going to a certain convention (which is in the state her friend lives) that she had always wanted to go but hasn't had the chance to. After that he invited her to go, then called her mom to ask for her permission and had already bought my gf tickets to said convention. She said she didn't have any plans to go at first because of economical issues, but then said she felt obligated to do so when her friend told her that he had already bought the tickets. So then she said that they would be staying over at her friend's parents home and she would only pay for the ticket and food for 2 - 3 days. It was getting pretty late so I didn't say anything and just tried to get to sleep.\n\nThis morning I couldn't get the thought out of my head, \"Why didn't she ask if she could invite me to go?\", \"Did she even consider it?\" and so I told her how it made me feel and that I felt excluded from the whole plan. And she told me,\"Well let's go then\" to which I answered, \"It doesn't work like that... He talked with your mom and made plans for the whole thing, and nowhere in those plans was I mentioned or considered\", her friend knows I'm her boyfriend and he didn't bother mentioning me either nor telling my gf if she wanted to invite me. Then she replied,  \"But I was invited, and I don't think I could've just invited someone else\", to which I answered I didn't see nothing wrong in asking if you can invite your SO to join you on this trip. Then she just said that it didn't matter, that she wasn't gonna go anymore and that she was only gonna pay him the ticket back, to which I told her that I had nothing against her going but just wished she had considered inviting me.\n\nAITA? Should I have handled that differently?",

      "description": "This happened about a year ago now. My boyfriend (not a student of the university I was at) was staying in my dorms but because I invited some of my friends over to hang out in my room, I asked him to go out somewhere while they were over. \n\nThis was probably my fuck up, because I didn't specify when they were going to leave and I didn't know how long they were going to stay there. Long story short, they stayed until really late, like around 1 or 2 AM. \n\nWhen they left, I frantically called him, but he wouldn't answer. I thought he was furious with me, as he should have been. He finally picks up, and I try to find out where he is. He told me before going that he would probably be at a bar not too far. But I'm listening to him talk over the phone and I can't understand what he's saying. \n\nIt dawned on me that he was completely drunk. Also, he was trying to stumble his way back.\n\nI'm desperately trying now to find him, trying to get him to call an uber, make out landmarks, anything.\n\nThen he says he's at a park. I go to a nearby park, and I see him. While I'm dragging him back to my dorm, it's obvious that he's upset.\n\nI felt extremely bad that I had put him through such a hard time, and decide he should rest more comfortably. My room only has a twin size bed. A twin size bed for two people is just not enough. So, I had the idea to just lay some spare blankets down on the floor and sleep there by myself while he has the bed.\n\nFor whatever reason, he did not approve of this idea. At all. \n\nNow, he was still very drunk, but it wasn't like before where he was just obviously wasted.\n\nI could hear him stirring behind me, and as I turned, he hit my arm. Hard. I probably cried out, both in pain and surprise and I can't exactly remember what happened after, but he did continue to hit me. At some point, I was crying so much I began to hyperventilate involuntarily. He told me to quiet down because I'll wake up the entire hall if I keep crying, but I couldn't control it, as much as I tried. In the midst of it, I think he told me he wanted me to just sleep in the bed next to him.\n\nThe next morning came, and he was feeling hungover. I grabbed some water and other things for him. I told him about what he did, and he claimed to not remember almost anything. He apologized, and at that moment, I said I forgave him.\n\nAlthough I tried to forget about some of this, the moments keep playing in my head even when I'm not mad at him or anything. I know it's wrong to hold a grudge for a year, especially against your own boyfriend, but I don't know. Am I in the wrong for not being over this?\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend got very drunk and hit me about a year ago. I said I forgave him, but I'm not sure that I really do.",

It's my fault obviously for cracking the screen, but I also feel like it's his fault for leaving the laptop on the floor right next to where we were sitting.

Ok fine, so we moved on.\n\nNow, months later, he text me asking him to buy him a game and mentioned that he missed his uncracked screen.

      "description": "I have a group chat with a few friends for the purpose of getting together and doing things, as well as just having fun and messing around. We like to get together every once and a while to hang out, and do some recreational activities. We all have fairly busy schedules, as we are all adults, so planning on doing things together can be a bit of a hassle sometimes. It’s nice to be able to get together at least once a week, but sometimes not even that is possible because our schedules don’t line up. \n\nI understand that people get busy and sometimes plans don’t work out, that’s just life. I’ve noticed however whenever I pitch an idea to do something on a particular day, not ONCE has the plan actually gone through. I’m understanding if my friends are busy and it doesn’t work for them, but when they say “that’s a great idea, let’s go!” or “works for me!” Isn’t that kind of expected that they should be able to go, or am I just crazy? It also seems when any of them make plans, it usually works for most of them and goes through. It kinda makes me feel like a shitty person how I try to make plans with my friends and it seems like they don’t really give a shit.\n\nThis most recent incident, I asked a few days ago if anyone wanted to get dinner, where two of my friends said they could go and one said they probably couldn’t. When the day arrives, I ask where everyone wants to go and I get no responses. Half an hour after we were supposed to meet up, one of my friends messages us saying that they have too much to do and can’t make it. The other friend straight up doesn’t respond. Third friend doesn’t either but they said they probably couldn’t anyways so I wasn’t upset about that. I reply “awesome, I guess I’ll just let you guys make all the plans since all of mine fall through.” Nothing. They even read it too. \n\nI then said: “cool, I guess nobody gives a shit,” and left the group chat. Now they’re individually messaging me but I’m not gonna respond because I don’t care about their justifications for being shitty friends. If you say you’re going to an event or enthusiastically respond in such a manner, then I don’t know why it would be unreasonable for me to be upset when it falls through last minute. Now if this happened once, it wouldn’t be the end of the world, but it seems like every damn time I try and set something up, this shit happens.\n\nIt makes me feel like trash when this happens. I still like hanging out with them, but it feels like it’s on their terms and never mine. Are my feelings justified or am I just being an asshole?",

      "description": "So, I’m a student and I also work in a very popular store in my country, which means I don’t work there everyday. \n\nOne day, my boyfriend and I were just chilling at his place, doing things like watching videos and stuff. Then he tells me that his stomach hurts (this happens from time to time and we don’t really know what the reason is yet) so he goes to the bathroom and comes up again a while later. He sits down and tells me that it hurts A LOT in the lower parts of his belly before he just kinda leans backwards in his chair. I thought this was because he was just showing how bad it hurt, but he wasn’t giving me any answer when I talked to him.\n\nMe: Ouw.. does it hurt that bad? \n\nBF: *Doesn’t say anything, still leaning backwards in his chair, I can’t see his face*\n\nMe: Hey BF... you ok?  \n\nBF: *Still quite and starts to slide down his chair*\n\nMe: BF???!\n\nHe slides down to the ground and I try to catch him so he doesn’t slam into the floor. He had passed out. I had never seen anyone pass out in-front of me before, it was so scary, so I panicked and yelled for help, thinking he was dying. \n\nThankfully he woke up a bit later, after his sister had come as well to see what was happening. We took him to the doctor and we were there for SO many hours, until 2 am, for them to say that there was nothing wrong. I had work the next morning, but I didn’t leave the hospital while my BF was there to get it checked since I had been the only witness to him passing out. \n\nI was so scared and still felt shaken afterwards, in the morning I told my work I wasn’t coming in that day. I wanted to look over my boyfriend to make sure that he was okay, everyone else was going to work in the house so I wanted someone to be there. And honestly, I couldn’t stop thinking of the moment he was passing out either, if I was at work that day I just wouldn’t be able to focus.\n\nI later told my parents about this and both of them thought I was wrong to not go to work that day. That it wasn’t a good enough reason and that I should’ve went anyways. And it made me cry hearing them say that, my mom who is really nice and usually thinks like me didn’t even agree with me. I still believe I was right. But I just want to know.\n\nWas it a dick move of me to skip work for my boyfriend that day? \n\n(Also, let me add that I’m a great worker. They - as in my boss - have told me how good I am at my job and I very rarely call in sick.) ",

I was totally okay with him borrowing out keys to get back in the house incase we weren't home from work when he got back, he said he was going to catch the train out and then catch the train back home. He never once even hinted they would be at our house, someone who he's never met in person and only knows in an online presence I am not okay with.\nI must add that this friend is planning on moving up to this area and staying with us for a while so while he was he we set him up in the room we plan to give to him and told him to make himself comfortable, but he does not pay rent or renters insurance and most likely won't be moving up for quite a few months.\nI just need to know should I let this go.

      "description": "We've been dating for over two years now, long distance so we're not usually at each other's houses. But she's visited me countless times and I've visited her countless times (we're in neighboring states so the drive isn't too bad).\n\nHer relatives are legitimate pack rats. They live in a house so full of junk that you barely have any room to walk. She's inherited that character trait, so her room has almost nowhere to step as it's full of years-old figures, plushies, computer peripherals, and old clothing. The floor is usually covered in clothes and garbage, you can't see the carpet. Her two desks are piled up, so every time either of us uses her computer or gaming console, something always falls. You can visually see the dust on most of this stuff.\n\nI have a really bad dust allergy. Every time I come over, my allergies kick up to the point where it's difficult for me to breathe in or out, like I'm constantly running a marathon. We've tried countless things to help -- running an air purifier at full blast, washing her bedding regularly, attempting to dust the common room, taking a daily shower while I'm over -- and I've seen doctors who have suggested a daily dose of a nasal spray and Allegra. I've also taken Benadryl to try to help as well. Sometimes the efforts help, sometimes they don't.\n\nI've asked her about the state of her room and whether we should try cleaning it to help get rid of a lot of dust magnets. She suffers from clinical depression, so in her words, she takes one look at the room and hates herself and can't find the energy to work on it. I've offered to help her, but she refuses, not letting me do busywork when I'm their guest and especially when I'm suffering from allergies.\n\nFor a little more context, she and I are very happy together, it's been a wonderful relationship all around. I have no qualms with her, nor her I, but this is something that's been a constant thorn whenever I visit. My allergies kick up at my home too, but only when I do something like roughhouse with my little brother on carpet or pet my cat.\n\nReddit, AITA for asking her to clean her room, or WIBTA if I took a firm stance on the basis of my health?",

      "description": "... And also getting mad at him when he said he wouldn’t? \n\nSo I’ve been in a LDR with this guy for 2 years, living on opposite sides of the world. I left a lot of my things over at his place from my last visit about half a year ago. I have maybe $400+ dollars worth of clothing and accessories there and also a $100 wacom tablet. I have quite a passion for this style of fancy Japanese fashion called himekaji. A lot of clothing articles are rare and sought after and there’s quite the buy/swap/sell culture surrounding it. I left a few of my favourite dresses and skirts at his place. \n\nSo I broke up with him a month ago. In short, things didn’t work out between us for 2 main reasons:\n\nI just didn’t love him like I used to these last few months\n\nThere was someone else I started to have feelings for (There wasn’t any cheating involved, unless you count this as emotional cheating. I reciprocated feelings for him when he expressed his own and then broke up with my bf a few days after not speaking with this guy.)\n\nAfter the breakup, I made no mention of my things I left at his place. I was really undecided on when I should ask him to send my things back to me or whether I should even ask at all. I think I was just hoping he’d do it for me anyway. Finally, he sent me a message saying he “considered burning them but then decided to donate them because someone else would appreciate those clothes far more than I ever did”. That was the final straw and I got mad at him, telling him that it wasn’t his call to make I think he made that remark because he always got irritated at how much I fussed over my fancy clothes (not getting stained or creased etc).  \n\nIf it makes any difference, I would have offered to send him money compensating for the delivery cost and trouble. \n\nIs it fair for him to feel this way? I did break his heart after all and I know he would be understandably sad and angry at me and I should let him. But should he put that aside for this simple gesture of returning the things that are mine? Or should I just accept the consequences of dealing with a breakup? I have absolutely no idea at this point. I just need an outside perspective. ",

They were a gorgeous dark emerald color, with sturdy feeling weight, and a squarish jewel type shape.\n\nThey weren't one of our most expensive wedding gifts, but they perfectly matched my esthetic. I could tell the aunt that gave them to us spent a good amount of time finding the set and thoughtfully selected them. This year, she managed to find a serving bowl that matched and gave it to us for Christmas.\n\nI loved the set.  I've carefully taken care of them for several years. But it's not like I hide them in a curio like fancy porcelain. The smaller cups in particular became a standard choice for serving wine when we had other couples over or nicer meals together.\n\nMy husband has been a little devil may care with them for the last 2 years. Grabs them for drinking whiskey and coke if the other cups are dirty, keeps putting them through the dishwasher, leaving them on the edges of tables, etc. I keep reminding him to please be careful cause I really like this set, it means a lot to me, and isn't something I can replace easily. He just kept telling me \"things are meant to be used\"\n\nLast night he broke one of the small cups while I was asleep and I think fully intended to not tell me. I noticed this morning. Now I can't use the set for entertaining anymore.\n\nI'm pissed. Not like yelling and having a fight, but pissed. Instead of apologising he just tells me \"things break\" and \"it's just things\". \n\nAITA for wanting him to understand why I care about a cup? Or are they just things?",

      "description": "My friend had epilepsy few months ago. I went to check on him early in the morning, cause he didn’t come to work other day. I tried to woke him up, he looked like he is just sleepy. I thought it’s morning, he is probably still in that state of being asleep. He looked like that to me. So I left him alone, thinking that he was just exhausted. \n\nTook my girlfriend out. In the afternoon his friend texted me that I should check on him cause he is not responding on social media’s. It was not bothering me, but I didn’t think of him having epilepsy or being sick. So I went to his room later in the evening, we live on dorms cause we are students, not together but close, took my girlfriend with me. I started to think there is something suspicious. He didn’t move whole day, I checked on him, he didn’t respond, couldn’t move properly and had blood on his lips from bitting. So I called an ambulance, they came and took him to hospital. \n\nAm I asshole for not checking on him properly in the morning? I probably left my friend after epilepsy for whole day maybe more. I feel like I should have called ambulance earlier.\n\nSorry for English. I am not from English speaking country.\n\nTL;DR: left my friend after epilepsy “attack” for probably more than 24 hours. ",

      "description": "So me and this girl dated briefly, about a month, before she decided that we should break up and she only cited that “we went to fast” as a reason. Obviously I wasn’t okay with this, but said that’s fine anyway. Two days later we’re back in my dorm kissing so obviously I think “well she obviously didn’t mean it, I guess things are fine now”. However she’s mentioned recently that we aren’t dating, we’re more than friends, and she wants to get back together eventually, which when put together are all very confusing to me. The thing is she tried to deescalate our relationship again by saying we should stop kissing too, because for now we’re just friends. Five minutes later we were hooking up again, and we did it again today. \n\nWhen I ask her about it she says she does want to get back together, but she keeps trying to deescalate our relationship. She’s said that there’s other things going on in her life that led to her breaking up with me but she hasn’t told me them. Even when we were dating she slowed us down once, then did it twice after we broke up. I just feel so strange about this scenario and I almost feel like I’m being strung along or something. Would I be an asshole if I just totally called things off right now? I feel bad because I really like her, and she does seem to like me but there’s just something that she’s not telling me that really makes this situation feel strange. ",

But to be very honest, I know internally that she has been studying non-stop for 2 years, and has not had time for me EVER in that time (but wouldn’t hesitate to call me when she needed me). She hasn’t even picked my calls up in 2 years. I’ve mentioned it, she says sorry and that she’ll try to be here more. \n\nI’ve told her repeatedly that if she can’t be there for me, I understand but it’s very tiring to be promised one thing and then continuously being disappointed.

And I asked what was that but obviously in an uninterested manner, she replied to me and said it's nothing you'll see when you get to House A. I was like cool and then we left to House A before I could later on move to house C. She uhm unpacks that which she took there by House B out \n\nAnd I note that it's women synthetic hair/Weave which apparently is pricey and I am there perplexed and asked where she took that and she explained she took it from House B laundry line. And later on that day two girls which stay by House B came to house A to ask if we hadn't seen their synthetic hair/Weave and I was tipped by this friend to say no I didn't see anything \n\nAnd so I obliged and said I saw nothing, and then they approached her and told her she took it and they exchanged some words and the two girls said that they gonna call the cops and so they did and they later on at around 8pm pitched at House A to ask my friend whether she took the hair and had a mini questioning with her at that time \n\nAnd so I couldn't leave to House C because of all that drama, so I was waited for the following morning.

      "title": "AITA for spending time with my girlfriend in the room with a shared roommate?",
      "description": "  \n\nOne year ago, during the spring semester of my freshman year at college, I started dating my first girlfriend, and my roommate, being a good friend, would leave the room 3-5 times a week for several hours late at night so that we could spend time in there. However, I never explicitly told him to leave in a hostile way, and I always made it clear that he wouldn’t have to leave if he didn’t want to. She would also spend the night maybe 1-2 times a week, but I also would ask him if it was OK each time and made sure I had the green light. For about the first month or so, we did abuse the room usage. A couple times he stayed outside the room until past midnight. After this, he expressed annoyance at me, and eventually I realized I was being an asshole. Even though I never explicitly told him he couldn’t come back in, I was taking advantage of his kindness by asking for extreme hours of having the room to myself.\n\nOver the summer, we talked about the situation and I apologized, and said that I would try to be a better roommate. The next semester (fall) we were once again sharing a room, and this time I tried to hang out at my girlfriend’s place more. My girlfriend and I usually study together almost every day.  Although there is a living room, I prefer studying in my room because I have a desk setup with a monitor, and there are usually people in the living room watching TV or talking. We were in my room 3 times or less a week and spent the other days at her place or on campus, and I never commanded him to leave the room, but I did ask about 4 times over the course of the semester when I knew he didn't have anything important to do. A couple of these times were late at night but did not alter his sleeping schedule since he sleeps very late. I tried to schedule sex around his schedule, but he rarely leaves the room, and only attended one of his classes, which my girlfriend was also taking. He was generally in the room 24/7 (except to make a quick food run), but he would leave the room 2x a week for a couple hours or less when we studied in there, even though I never asked him to. \n\nFrom his point of view, he said that he feels a societal pressure, and that we wanted him to leave the room when we were just there studying. I always tried to make it clear that he didn’t have to leave, ever, if he didn’t want to, and told him this many times.  Also, my girlfriend and I are very quiet, and spend most of the time in the room studying. She would sit on my bed and study and I would sit at my desk. We didn’t talk loudly or laugh loudly. However, my roommate was still extremely frustrated that he had to deal with me and my girlfriend. He always said that us being in the room made him leave and complained that we “locked him out” to me and our friends. He said he feels like a dog being let in and out of his room.\n\nFast forward to this semester, because of his increasing frustration, I tried to have my girlfriend in the room even less. Since the start of the semester, we haven’t been in the same room as him more than 30 minutes (such as right before or after we go to an event), and I only have sex with her when he leaves the apartment. There were 3 times he came back to the room while we were having sex and knocked on the door. At this point I really don’t want him to be annoyed so as soon as he knocks my girlfriend and I put on our clothes, no matter where we are, and rush out of the room to not bother him. This would take 2-5 minutes tops, but each time this happened I could tell he was really angry. I should have given him a warning that we were using the room, but I didn’t want to make him feel like he was locked out of the room, and I made sure to leave immediately each time he came back. The last time we did this, last weekend, was when some of our friends came over. My roommate and about five of our friends were playing smash (a video game), and my girlfriend and I were kind of just sitting there not playing. We went into the room and it eventually led to sex. Later, as our friends are leaving, he says that he is very annoyed at me. \n\nYes, I admit having sex while our friends were over was a really cringy thing to do, and I wouldn’t do it again. However, my roommate is super angry at me. He called me selfish and ungrateful for what he has done for me and tells me that I’m an asshole. He also said that if I asked anyone else that they’d tell me I was an asshole. Honestly, I’m not sure what other people would think since I haven’t explained the whole situation that much to others. I know I was an asshole in the beginning of the relationship but since then I’ve tried to be with my girlfriend around him less and less, so I don’t really feel like an asshole at the moment. So reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR\n\nI got a girlfriend and we used to spend a lot of time in the room, but now we spend almost no time in the room when he’s there, and he still thinks I’m an asshole. ",

I'm not even sure if I'd be covered legally if he decided to crash into my car because he was in such rage. Was it stupid to do that? Yes, but I was wondering if I was the actual asshole in this situation. Contemplating it afterwards - I think the guy was probably just having a rough day; who doesn't? It might have been good to just give him a break instead of trying to make him more angry and potentially more dangerous to other drivers.\n\nI'm not going to say what freeway or any identifying information here in case this shit comes back to haunt me later. Thanks",

So we ended up not sleeping for 24 hrs straight and was tired as hell and couldnt even stand properly. \nAfter landing, we boarded the shuttle from airport to rental car building and we had to stand because it was already crowded. Some people got down in the next stop and we got place to sit, and the shuttle was full again.\nThen an elderly couple entered the shuttle. Me and my wife shared one seat and offered them the other one where the lady sat down.\nAfter getting down at the rental car, the old man started saying that we should have given him a seat as well because we were a younger couple, he also said it's not in our culture to respect elder people..bla bla bla...I just walked away without any word with him.\nI would 9 out of 10 times give up my seat, but this was just an exception.\nSo, AITA ?",

      "description": "So to give some context, I've been friends with this girl, let's call her Clara, since I was roughly five, our parents knew each other, and we grew up together. We were tight right up until we graduated and went to college, along with three others who formed our tight knit friend group. Two of the others went to college in the same place as me, and the third stayed in our home town and started working, while she went to a college about two hours away. We still talked a lot of Facebook, and as none of us were too far from home and spent summers at home there were many opportunities to hang out etc, however, in the three years since we have started college we have seen each other only a handful of times. \n\nIt all seemed to escalate after she left my 21st birthday after about half an hour, stating that her lift home was leaving and she had no choice, however, other friends coming in late saw her go to a night club across the road with her boyfriend. Shortly after, another girl in our friend group found out her girlfriend had been cheating on her. Rather than support her friend, Clara became close to the girl who had cheated and reported our conversations back and forth with her. \n\nEventually I got drunk, and was with the others for a night out, which Clara had declined to come to. I found they all felt like they had not been close to her for some time, and they felt uncomfortable having her in the Facebook group chat as they felt they couldn't talk openly in it any more. I created a new chat without her in it that night, and we let the other one die. The only communication in it after that was her asking us to go to her birthday, which none of us committed to. Shortly after that she left and hasn't spoken to any of us since. \n\nAm I the asshole for being the one to make the move that ultimately led to her being iced out of the group? As the one who's known her the longest I feel like I at least owed her a conversation to her face about it, but instead we went behind her back. \n\nTL;DR: am I the asshole for effectively cutting out ab old friend who'd grown distant during college from our friend group ?

      "description": "My coworker and I are both women in our late twenties, but we have had very different lives. I come from a middle class home, I’ve attended university and am fairly religious. My coworker hasn’t had the easiest life and of her own admission has had a crazy past. Our different backgrounds has never been problem for me. However she is continually dismissive and condescending to me. At first I thought this was just her being passionate, but I’ve realized it is only with my opinion. I decided that she probably didn’t realize it bothered me and that I would tell her it was an issue as I thought we were on friendly terms.\n\nNote- I am not talking opinions on politics or religion, but traditional office talk. \n\nToday we were talking in a group about troubled friends and crazy times we had when we were younger. Now I can’t compete with my coworker when it comes to crazy times but she cut me off anytime I tried to comment. Finally I asked why she wouldn’t let me speak, she told me she knew where I grew up and I couldn’t understand and shouldn’t contribute. I told her I found it hurtful that she was so assumptive about my life without really knowing me and wouldn’t let me voice my opinion. Her response was “and”, so I told her it hurt my feelings. She told me “it’s not my fault if treating you like that hurts your feelings, that’s on you.” I was floored, I didn’t know how to respond, so I just said, okay then, and turned back to my computer. I was then friendly the rest of the day. \n\nI’m mad because this coworker continually tells everyone how kind and open minded she is and how her biggest  pet peeve is when others are ignorant and small minded. And while she can be very compassionate, she has no problem bowling over, and condescending to anyone who doesn’t fit into her box and regularly brags about people she has put in their place,  normally in an abrasive and offensive manner. Another coworker of ours recently got upset with her for similar behaviors and he got written up because she made such a stink about it. Her behavior however is not only unchecked but she has no regard for how it affects others.\n\nIn the past I had mentioned to our manager that I found her to be condescending to me and that it bothered me, my manager asked me to come to her if there was a specific issue. Now this has been going for on for a few months and I just let it roll off because I am non confrontational, but I am pissed that she couldn’t give a shit that she is offending me and intentionally dismissing me. \n\nWIBTA if I related the full account to my manager and told her that I am deeply offended by my coworkers response and I wanted action taken?",

      "description": "Sorry for any formatting issues. I'm on my phone.\n\nI work in a building with all women, we all vary in ages. I'm 33 and the coworker, I'll call her Sara, is in her late 40's, so it's not like she's a teenager or anything. A lot of gossiping and talking trash behind people's back is a common occurrence there, it's just unfortunately how it is. It's crazy unprofessional but you learn to ignore it.\n\nI used to work closely with Sara and thought we were legit friends. We talked outside of work, even. After we stopped working closely together, I found out that apparently we weren't friends like I thought. She was talking badly about me behind my back to anyone who would stand still long enough. To be fair, she talks trash about a lot of people behind their backs, so it's not like I'm special or anything. Just sucked cause I thought we were friends.\n\nAnyway, other coworkers kept telling me the stuff she was saying and I was trying to not let it get to me...but it was getting to me and I was pissed but I wanted to avoid more drama so I didn't do anything about it. Recently a childhood friend of mine had died and I found out while at work. I hadn't seen him in years, but I was still upset. I wasn't crying or making a scene over it, but everyone could tell I was bummed out. I told a few coworkers about it when they asked me what was wrong, which lead to someone mentioning it to Sara.\n\nShe started talking shit about me for being upset over it! One of the things she said was about how she lost a parent 6 months ago and wasn't moping around upset about it like I was and basically said it was stupid of me to be upset over it. This was literally the day I found out about his death. It was actually within a few hours of me finding out he had died.\n\nI was livid when I was told about what she said. I'd been ignoring the other stuff she says about me but this was the straw that broke the camel's back. I didn't care if talking trash is normal there and that she does it all the time...this time I felt she crossed a line. I went to my boss (I was entirely too angry to confront her myself and my boss knows about Sara's attitude and trash talking people) and told her that it felt like Sara was being a bully at this point, this was different then the usual stupid gossiping/shit talking and I wanted her to make Sara stop. She agreed and talked to Sara.\n\nNaturally, some see me as the asshole for taking her comments personally and having our boss talk to her.\n\nSo. Was I the asshole? Should I have ignored it like I usually do? I was entirely too angry to talk to her myself and that would have just given her more to talk about.",

      "description": "So I  am not even sure where to begin with this shitstorm. But I am bringing this up because my mom and dad usually have my niece over during spring and summer breaks making them awkwardly always have to tell me to not come over and visit. I have also actively not attended Christmas for the past 5 years. This has caused my grandma a lot of distress because it's the one time of year my whole family gathers together. \n\nGetting down to the issue, 5 or so years back I was still living at my parents home (at 23) and my boyfriend(24) ended up moving in with me for a couple years so we could save up to get our own place. Winter break rolls around and my niece 11 at the time is spending a week with us. Normal week nothing weird. I was pretty much in charge of taking care of her. The thing that was bothering me though was she had gotten a kindle for Christmas and was going into chat sites. She showed me some chats she was having with guys admitting they were 20 or older and she was telling them she was 13. I got concerned and let my mom know so we changed the wifi password and pretended the internet was down the rest of her stay.\n\nFast forward almost a year later to October my mom shows up at my work in the middle of my shift and tells my boss there is a family emergency and I need to leave work. She drives me to a coffee shop and basically says that my niece accused my boyfriend of molesting her to a counselor at her school. This caused him to be kicked out of the house with no warning,  I went with him we slept in our car for a week then at my grandma's for another luckily we found an apartment after that. I'm glossing over a lot of hardship and drama so we can get to the point. \n\nSo a few years pass things are awkward I pretty much convinced my whole family minus my sister and her husband aka my niece's parents that my boyfriend was innocent and finally she even confessed to my mom just this past winter break that nothing happened now that she is 16 and a bit more mature. Basically she broke down crying and felt awful and just wanted to see us again. I'd also just got married to said boyfriend so I think this sparked the conversation. \n\nMy mom is fully expecting me to have a chat with her and try to work things out so I can rejoin Christmas. I just feel like she ruined a huge part of my life. I'm still getting anxiety stress just typing this out. I  get that she was just a dumb kid with overactive fantasies.  Am I maybe angry at the wrong person? \n\nTldr; neice accused my boyfriend(now husband)of molesting her, years later confessed it wasn't true. Mom wants me to reconcile with her so I can attend Christmas. ",

      "description": "AITA for being frustrated at my Girlfriend?\n\nWell, this is my first post on this subreddit, so sorry if my formatting is terrible. This is also likely to be pretty long, so sorry. For background  I'm 18m, my GF is 18F. For background we've been together for 5 years, we're currently in the second year of college and we went to the same secondary school, and are in the same college.\n\nTo get right into it, about 2 years ago my GF and I were in the middle of our final exam period of secondary school. We were the two highest performing students in the school so we had expectations and it was stressful. My girlfriend reacted badly, and starting having panic attacks, then depressive episodes, this progressed into self-harm. When my GF told me, I reacted badly. I realised that I was an asshole, and tried to be more understanding and supportive, rather than punishing her, as she was already punishing herself. The cycle of her harming herself and me treating her wounds carried on for about 3 or for months, when she did it so hard she fainted from bloodloss. It was then where I got her therapy, as she was suffering from anxiety at this time too. She wouldn't speak to anyone besides me, and her parents unless she felt safe and comfortable. (which wasn't often.) Her therapy was pretty successful in calming her, and lessening her anxiety until an English exam. \n\nIn the English exam she told me she had seen something. A person, in a black suit with no face. She was hallucinating. This terrified me, and I went to her therapist. She had no idea what to do and nor did my GF. (I've told them since then, but at this point, GF was too scared to tell her parents and I was l too much of a pushover to tell them anyway). \nWe were sort of stuck, so I taught her how to properly care for her cuts, and I started carrying a first aid kit. Neither of us were adults at that point, so we couldn't seek medical help without calling her parents. So we waited, it wasn't too bad at first but it rapidly got worse.\n\nTowards the latter end of secondary school, I stopped listening to her telling me it would make it worse, and I told her parents myself, and she started reviewing Therapy outside of school, which sort of made her symptoms better, and she was finally seen by a doctor. She was diagnosed with psychosis, but nothing further. She was prescribed Aripiprazole, which helped deal with her hallucinations, but not a lot. She was delusional by then, but it stopped the delusions almost entirely. She'd still be nervous about going out in public, but she'd speak to people and didn't believe what used to say (for the record, she believed that she was personally selected by a secret organisation, and that she had betrayed them somehow, it was her job to decode radio transmissions that only she heard, and decipher the codes in them but she was being hunted down, by the men in black suits, trying to stop her).\n\nAll this time, GF was very reluctant to get help, even speaking to her therapist was an issue. I had to be in her therapy sessions with her, just so she'd be comfortable enough to speak at all. Her grades were dropping, she was getting worse and I couldn't do anything about it. There was nothing I could do as we only had a few weeks of school left at that point. But things got even worse when we started college. The first thing I did was set up a person for her to talk to in college, like a mental health mentor. I informed GF's parents about this, and how GF is completely reliant on me, (she struggled to get class work done without me there). I didn't get much a response from them. The Dad's old fashioned, he believed that GF should quit college and try to get a job. Her Mum was scared. She had no idea what to do, nor did I. We told the Mentor she had, and she suggested outside therapy on top of the sessions she was getting in college, as they weren't really doing anything. Eventually her dose was increased to 15mg of Aripiprazole, but I'm still just taking care of her, nothing else. I'm trying my best to help her, she's suicidal at this point. She says she doesn't want to die, but that other people's thoughts are being projected into her head and they are telling her to do it. She's attempted suicide 3 times by now, but she's so reluctant to do anything about it. I understand her difficulty in trying to tell people and get help. I'm getting therapy for my depression at this point, and I find myself getting mad at her, I know it isn't her fault that this is happening. I kneo she can't help it, but it makes me really mad that she's not even attempting to help herself, and nobody but me seems to be trying, not even her parents. I'm just getting mad at everyone involved as nobody seems to be doing anything, am I justified for being mad? AITA? \n",

Last month our bill went way up for numerous reasons, but one of the most wasteful reasons was these people just leave lights on all the time. \n\nNow whenever I go into a room and the light is on I test the group and ask politely that everyone make sure to turn off the lights when they leave a room. \n\nNow everyone is trying to come up with a time frame that they can leave the light. For example one person said, “If I’m just switching my laundry I’m only gone for a minute, so it doesn’t matter if I leave it on.\n\nI’m not crazy, if you’re leaving the room to grab something and come back I have no problem with leaving the light on. However, I believe if you’re not actively doing something on the room just turn the light off and turn t back on when you comeback. \n\nTLDR: Roommate’s leave lights on and I constantly text the group asking people to, “please turn off the lights when you leave a room.”",

      "description": "Tinder date. During the same day of the date, I find out she lives close to work. I invite her to lunch even though we are going on a date later on the same day. Everything was fine  during lunch, we decide to text later to decide where to go after I get off work. She goes to hang out with some friends in the meantime. \n30 min before I get off work, I text her asking where she is or where we should meet. No answer for a while. \nI finish work and outside the office I call her, no answer either. I decide Im gonna call her one more time once I reach the metro station since after that there would probably no going back. If she doesn't answer it basically means I got ghosted. I call her when I reach the metro no answer. A friend group was having drinks like 30min away, I had told them I wasn't going since I had this date, but since I was essentially stood up I told them I had was coming. \n\nWhen I was reaching the bar my friends where at, she calls me and tells me her battery died and that's why I couldn't reach her, she is sorry and that we should meet anyways. At this point I was kinda upset, but I felt like this could happen to anyone and I shouldn't get so mad. I tell her ok let's meet in 50 min in another Station. I have one beer with my friends and leave them ( they weren't so happy about this) . It takes me another 30 min to get to her. She had to wait maybe 10 min at the station. When I reach her she doesn't really apologize again about what happened but informs me that her friend was just laid off work and she wants her and other friends to hang out so she feels better. So she wants to cut the date short, even shorter than it would be already.  \n\nSo we have maybe 1 beer each and then we leave. \n\nNow I was kinda mad that I left my friends for her but she wouldn't do the same for me. I felt disrespected. \n\nOther things to consider. \nI was leaving for vacation the next day, so I tried to make this happen on that day because there would be no other chance for 3 weeks, she knew this.\n\nShe had an early job interview that came up during the time between lunch and the date. So even without friend breakdown, the date wouldn't be able to last so long.",

      "description": "Okay, so here’s the deal (I’m Autistic BTW, not an excuse):\nIn the summer after Senior year I reached out to a girl I had previously had a crush on, asked to junior prom, and been very clear about my feelings for her. Things never worked out and I had moved on. I had no romantic intentions at the time (we were friends by the end of senior year so it’s not like we were strangers).\nWe started talking and snapping, pretty soon she asked me to go to a museum with her. I thought it was a good time. That afternoon, I suggested going to a different museum next week. She agreed and also suggested going to a movie.\nOn the morning of our second date, she said she’s sick with a fever and can’t go. She ignored my next few snaps for about three days before I realized something was up and stopped trying to contact her. She never tried to reestablish contact with me. \nHere’s the twist:\nMy school runs a summer camp for newer highschoolers interested in getting a leg up in a certain extracurricular before the season starts. We both happened to be counselors that year, so I had to be around her for a week. \nFor the first four days, I didn’t mention anything about what happened earlier in the summer.\nOn Friday, I ran into her alone and asked her if she can talk about things. I told he she didn’t have to if she didn’t want to, but maybe we could have a conversation at some point because I was pretty confused and hurt. At this point I was pretty desperate for some sort of closure because I was worried about what I had done wrong earlier, if I did anything to hurt her, etc. She said sure and we agreed to talk later about it.\nThe next day I shot her a quick text letting her know I was ready to talk whenever. She didn’t respond. I figured this was probably it, so I sent a longer one the next day, something along the lines of:\n“Hey, so I’m sorry about whatever I did to push you away and I’m just really confused and kinda hurt by everything that’s happened. I’m not sure where to go from here but I do miss talking to you. If you want to talk to me at any point, feel free to let me know. Anyways, if we never talk again, have a nice life.” \nNext day I’m blocked on all social media. I haven’t tried to contact her again.\nSo that’s the story. This has been bugging me for a long time because looking back I feel like I overstepped my boundaries and I think my desire for closure was irrational. If this had been someone I had met a week ago on Tinder I would absolutely be the asshole here I feel, but I’d known this person for four years.\nWhat do you think? WITA? Everyone I’ve talked to IRL about it says I’m NTA but I’m worried they’re just telling me that bc I’m a friend and they don’t want to call me a dick to my face.\n",

      "description": "This has a pretty big backstory to it so bare with me. At the beginning of the year my boyfriend and I became very close this guy, we'll call him C. It got to a point where every Friday C would come to our place and stay with us all the way up to tuesday morning, we'd party and play xbox, then he would go home and we'd go to our jobs and such and then do it all over again the next friday. During those times C would occasionally do coke. My boyfriend was an addict when he was younger but is clean and has been for a very long time so we never participated but we gave him the greenlight to do it and it was never an issue. Well one night when C was over, my boyfriend went to walk the dog and C offered me some coke. I did some before my boyfriend got back and never told him about it. This happened two more times within the month before I stopped accepting coke from C. I understand that I am definitely the asshole in that situation. I did later come clean to my boyfriend and he was very hurt by it, we dont keep anything from each other and my boyfriend felt that this was a betrayal, I made a decision to do a drug he was sensitive about with another man behind his back. I apologized and have been taking the extra steps to earn my boyfriend's trust again.\n\nHere's where I'm wondering if I am the asshole. My boyfriend told C how hurt he was by what we did and our friendship wont be how it was before. C apologized, but has a habit of becoming defensive when confronted with any wrongdoing so his apology was moreso half an apology and half deflecting any blame. My boyfriend understandably is not satisfied with the apology and we haven't talked to C that much since. C knows that until he makes things right with my boyfriend I wont be talking to him, and he says he's going to make things right. My boyfriend told me that even with a genuine apology from C he probably won't forgive him. I miss hanging out with C, we were all very close and it's hard to make friendships as good as the one we had. However, if my boyfriend chooses not to forgive him, I will stand by him and do the same. I did tell my boyfriend that I do want to be C's friend and my boyfriend thinks that it's messed up that I'd still want that after all of this. So am I the asshole for wanting to be friends with C?",

      "description": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nThis is a bit different from what I usually see here, and it takes a little bit insight into rats as pets to understand, but I'll try to explain as best I can.\n\nRats are social animals and live in mischiefs, usually large groups. So when owning them as pets, it's best to always get more than one, since with a humans usual schedule they can get lonely. \n\nWells, I've owned rats for quite a few years now, and I have owned them in pairs for so far. \n\nWell, I had a pair of hairless males, and one died (Benis), leaving the other boy (Albert) alone. I wasn't about that, and after a week I adopted 2 more males (Noot and Noah) from a rescue to keep him company until he passed (old bastard man). \n\nAlbert HATED them, and after trying and failing to introduce them together or even have have their cages relatively close over a period of time, I gave up because Albert was getting old and sadly, dying.  So I spent the rest of his mortal existence with him alone and alternating  spending time holding him or the other two. \n\nAfter he passed, I was back to two rats, and this was something I was familiar with, but it turns out Noot had cancer (horrible cancer according to vet), and he had to be put down. \n\nSo that leaves Noah. He's been a single male for a couple of months now, and he seems happy enough. I'm home 5 days out of 7 and when I'm at school my grandma spends a lot of time holding him and stuff. \n\nHe gets a lot of free roam time and interacts with our small dog under supervision. He even sleeps in bed with me because I feel so bad about having just one rat and I don't want him to feel alone lol.\n\nI've been considering getting another male but my grandma is kind of afraid to since we went through a sequence of 3 pet rat deaths. Older males are also hard to introduce to eachother and I already failed once.\n\nSo I guess I just want to know if despite me being extra with him if I'm still kind of abusing him by not getting him a new boyfriend?\n\nTLDR; A series of unfortunate events led to one adult male rat being the last standing. I don't think getting a partner is going to work do to history. AITA if I just continue to smother my one rodent in affection? ",

I'm underage and unable to move away from my brother.\n\nSo my brother and I have never been very close (besides when we were babies-toddlers). I have tried many times to build/ rebuild a/our relationship. I've tried playing video games he likes, letting him use my phone (he doesn't have one), and giving him mobile hotspot in the car. I know these are superficial things, but that's what my brother's into. \n\nEvery time I try to do something with my brother he ends up screaming at me, and I end up in my room crying. Many times I have barricaded myself in my room so that I don't have to worry about him coming in. My brother seems to only care about one thing, his X-box/video games, so I'm not sure if he'd care if when I moved out we'd stop talking.\n\nI wouldn't cut out complete contact with him because of my parents and holidays and such, but I wouldn't talk to him if I didn't have to. I really would like to lose all contact with my immediate family, but I feel like that'd be too stressful, so I figure the next best thing is my brother. \n\nI love my brother, but I'm not sure if he loves me.

      "description": "Im in 11th grade right now and have my winter vacations going on. My friend who i call my bestfriend's birthday is on the 28th. \nWe used to have a lot of fights but have been somewhat fine. She is Terrible at texting, the only thing she replied back with is hahahahah or what are you doing and its frankly very pissing off but i manage. She doesn't meet me outside of school or ever wants to call. I have asked her for both plenty of times however shes always like mom wont allow or im sleeping early so i cant call or she'll say that i hate calls. In the past year, we have only called twice and both lasted less than 10 minutes. I always say fine or its okay however she goes out plenty and a lot of the times shes out to late night parties and whenever she sends me a screenshot of something, majority of the time shes on a call which is an hour or 2 long. She started dating a guy in summer and even before they started dating she used to have long hour calls with him which obviously prove that she doesnt dislike talking to people on call and can call and also proves that her mom allows her to go to places. \nI have been telling her about this for a year and we have had some fights. Her birthday was a week ago and i made a plan with her to go out on her birthday as she didnt have anything planned. I woke up in the morning an hour before we had planned to meet. She texts me back and said the plan is cancelled. I was a little annoyed as i had to wake up earlier than my wake up time to go meet her however i thought nothing off it, wished her happy birthday and started playing video games as i had nothing to do. 2 hours later she and another one of her friend sends snaps of them together and i instantly got pissed off. It was her birthday so i didn't say anything. \nAfter her birthday ended. I consulted my other bestfriend and another close friend and both told me to talk to her. I Frankly had very pissed off and annoyed and i wrote a long thing and told her that im done with her and that i deserve better. She wrote some stuff back which i didnt frankly read because it had been going on for so long and it was just the explaination of that one incident. I just said \"ok\". She left me on read. Its been 4 days now and both of us havent talked to each other. \n\nAITA for telling her im done with her?",

      "description": "I was prescribed sleeping pills yesterday although I don't think I need them. It is true I first go to sleep when most people wake up but I sleep during the day and can function the same amount a person with a normal sleep schedule could. So I decided not to them. Today my friend came over to spend the night and she made me a cup of tea, I was instantly suspicious because when I was younger my grandmother used to put my ADHD pills (which I told her I didn't want to take because they made me feel terrible) into a pumpkin pie to make me  take them. But she managed to convince me she didn't by saying the tea was caffeinated to the point where she wouldn't even bother putting a pill in. I believed this until my mother popped in to ask if she put the right number of pills into my tea. I flew into a rage, poured my tea out and yelled at my friend for doing that to me. I also might have locked myself in the bathroom and starting punching myself to get the anger out (a bad habit of mine) but I managed to convince my family I was punching the wall. After that I continued yelling at my friend telling her I didn't appreciate being lied to. She tried to bite back saying I lied to my grandmother about doing my work soon when I actually have a problem finding motivation to do tasks no matter what they are. Then she left to go to bed and my grandmother said that I'd hurt my friend's feelings even though she didn't give a rats ass about my feelings when I was lied to and basically drugged by the person I care about the most.",

      "description": "Context:\n\nHe and I were met online over a game and became close friends and developed feelings.  We met twice, had sex a couple times during one of those trips, and I broke things off after around 7 months.  I'm not interested at all anymore. He has told me has feelings but he is able to accept being friends. We used to talk every day but that has slowly tapered off as I've moved on.  Not sure if that is relevant to the story but it might help.\n\nI've been sick for over a month with a bad cough.  He has asked me once or twice before if I thought about going and seeing a doctor to have it checked out.  I didn't sleep well last night and was in the middle of my work day when the exchange below occurred:\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n\\[5:49 AM\\] Him: Morning, hope you had a good night.\n\n\\[11:31 AM\\] Me: Good morning!\n\n\\[11:32 AM\\] Me: I did not sleep well, I kept coughing\n\n\\[3:55 PM\\] Him: You should go pick up a cough suppressant on the way home, it'll solve that problem.\n\n\\[3:55 PM\\] Me: Yeah, I have a plan.\n\n\\[3:56 PM\\] Him: Does it involve seeing the doctor or just chancing it for another month?\n\n\\[3:56 PM\\] Me: Alright, have a good day.\n\n\\[3:56 PM\\] Him: ?\n\n\\[3:57 PM\\] Me: Your snarky shit\n\n\\[3:57 PM\\] Him: Not at all?\n\n\\[3:57 PM\\] Him: I didn't think that would offensive\n\n\\[3:57 PM\\] Him: my bad\n\n\\[3:57 PM\\] Him: I wasn't throwing shots\n\n\\[3:57 PM\\] Him: I told you I've had a cough for over a month\n\n\\[3:57 PM\\] Me: LOOOL\n\n\\[3:57 PM\\] Me: Whatever\n\n\\[3:57 PM\\] Me: Im not stupid.\n\n\\[3:58 PM\\] Me: I dont know what your deal is, or where this is coming from.\n\n\\[3:58 PM\\] Me: But it's not helpful, you sound like you're just trying to be a shit for ???? reasons.\n\n\\[3:59 PM\\] Him: Well I'm genuinely sorry, that wasn't my intention.  I was trying to be helpful by saying take a cough suppressant so you could sleep.  Honestly wasn't talking shit or throwing shots.  I have no reason or motive, like why would I just come out of nowhere to do that?  Literally, there is no background there at all.\n\n\\[3:59 PM\\] Me: You are\n\n\\[3:59 PM\\] Me: literally\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: making a jab\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Him: Am I giving you a hard time for not going to the doctor?\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Him: yea\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: for me\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: trying\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: to\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Him: but not talking sh it\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Him: or being mean\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: wait it out\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: you have\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: made\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: the same\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: comment\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: before\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: how\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: are you not\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: getting it\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Him: because you're telling me I tried to do something I didnt, but my bad\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Him: I get it.\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: You know what you are doing and you're going to suddenly act stupid and back peddal\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Him: LOL\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: just own up to your bullshit\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Him: dude\n\n\\[4:00 PM\\] Me: Dude\n\n\\[4:01 PM\\] Me: Like, what have I done to you?\n\n\\[4:02 PM\\] Me: What is the difference between \" giving you a hard time for not going to the doctor\" and \"but not talking sh it\", because they are synonymous.\n\n\\[4:03 PM\\] Me: Giving a hard time = talking shit.\n\n\\[4:03 PM\\] Me: ???????????\n\n\\[4:03 PM\\] Me: Him Today at 1:00 PM\n\nAm I giving you a hard time for not going to the doctor?\n\nyea\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHimToday at 1:00 PM\n\nbut not talking sh it\n\n\\[4:03 PM\\] Me: LOL\n\n\\[4:06 PM\\] Him: Ok, I'm going to just back up.  I'm not taking shots at you.  I'm not trying to be mean to you.  I have no motivation nor reason to do that. I was making a light hearted comment about not seeing the doctor, yes, but was it ill intention or meant to upset or degrade you?  Not at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat isn't talking shit, that is poking fun/teasing like you and I do all the time.  It isn't malicious, I'm not trying to make you mad, or be mean.  I have said it before and in that same breath I said \"I've had a cough for over a month before and didn't see the doctor\".  I' have no reason to talk shit or start something over your cough.  And now you're trolling me with emotes??  Wtf?? I said my bad, it wasn't my intent to sit there and rile you up and talk shit.  How did that comment boil into this?  I'm so god damn confused.  Fuck, my bad, I was trying to shoot the shit and tease you a bit but god damn not attack, insult, and fight you over seeing the doctor of all things.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\nThere is more but wont post it unless an update is requested.  You can imagine the rest - basically I just repeated myself and he couldn't understand or accept that he was giving me shit and coming at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I dunno if multiple people count for an AITA but ok. \n\nSo my high school is directly next to a library, and high schoolers like me and my friends go there after school to do homework and chat while we wait for our parents to pick us up. \n\nToday we were talking (to be honest, much louder than we should have been) and a woman who had been sitting a few tables away stormed up to us. \n\nShe gave us a condescending lecture where she said that we were supposed to do homework and how the library was supposed to be dead silent. She also said that we should all leave if we weren't going to discuss homework/school, and threatened to tell a librarian if we kept disturbing her.\n\n The woman then said that she was doing taxes and how us teenagers were disrespecting the whole library. \n\nMe and my friends proceeded to ignore most of what she said and talk about both homework and other random things only a tiny bit more quietly.\n\nSo the woman gave us another angry talking to, in which she ran over her previous points, and left, saying that we were too annoying. \n\nAfter school, our library is usually packed with high schoolers and younger children and their parents. Naturally, it's a bit louder than a normal library, and the people that come to the library are prepared to deal with more chatter than the average library. \n\nBut did we cross a line? \n\nI mean, we didn't want her to leave, but we also didn't want our homework to be completely boring. And she might have not known about the high school near the library.\n\nI know this is really minor and boring but I kinda feel bad for making her leave. ",

      "description": "Mobile, sorry for formatting issues, you know the drill.\n\nFirst off, I don’t come from a family that’s necessarily wealthy. We have an okay house and okay things. Nothing especially nice. Living at home is my mom, my stepdad, one adult sister, one younger sister, my baby brother (~5), and me (16, M). \n\nI’m not the kind of person to ask for things I don’t need. I might be weird, but I really hate having money spent on me. Every time my family goes on a big $2k+ trip (yearly), I always opt to not go, and every time they try to spend big money on me, I tell them not to. It’s just not who I am.\n\nAs a result of this, whenever I want something expensive, I work for it. I usually work whenever I have breaks from school that last more than a week, and as such, I spent my last winter break working with my uncle in a different city. Long hours in a construction-esque job, 10 hours a day, every day, pouring all of my energy into getting the job done so I can make the money I want. The only days I had off over the two week break were Christmas and New Years, and I spent those days with my family. \n\nWith the money I got from this job, I bought Christmas gifts for my family ($80 transformers toy for my stepdad he’d been obsessing over, a good pillow and pillow case for my mom, some treats for my older sister, etc). I also bought some games for my Nintendo switch (which I also earned all the money for) and some party games for me and my friends. And as soon as I got back once and for all, I had about $850 left to put toward buying a PS4 and a VR headset. Given that I’ve never had anything especially nice, it really makes me happy to have something clean and brand new—not used, no scratches, no damage. \n\nI understand that a VR is something that my family would like to experience too, so I’ve given them opportunities to use it under my direct supervision, and they took said opportunities, including my baby brother. I don’t very much mind letting them use my things as long as I’m there to make sure they stay in good condition. \n\nHowever, my parents have been berating me, asking to take the PS4 and VR downstairs so that my baby brother can use it. It’s not like he doesn’t have anything to do—he watches videos on the smart TV all day and plays on the Xbox One that my family keeps downstairs (whenever he’s not too busy wrecking the house). The only qualification is that they say they’ll watch him while he plays, as this whole thing is for their entertainment, apparently. \n\nI know my family, and I know they don’t watch him nearly as much as they should (again, he spends most of his time wrecking the house), and I don’t trust them to watch him the whole time, or even most of it. And I know my baby brother—when he gets upset with the Xbox, he throws the controllers, which often directly results in them being scuffed up and damaged when not outright broken. The other caveat is that they said they would replace the VR if it became broken, but obviously they wouldn’t put down $350 over a scratch or a scuff—the kind of thing that I take extreme care to prevent on a regular basis.\n\nI’m really uncomfortable with this notion, and since I’ve never really had nice things before, I’m not currently willing to give up my PS4 &amp; VR–especially to a toddler who isn’t capable of understanding the value and care that I believe should be put into it. And for my stepdad to have been telling me for the past few weeks how proud he is of me for putting in hard, honest work to earn something really nice, it feels totally wrong that just a few days later he’s asking me to cede the fruits of my strenuous labor just because they want some light entertainment.

      "description": "Backstory. I've known this friend, let's call her Mary, since my first day in public school. First day of primary school, we're friends. Primary school was a mix of on/off friendship because she always got upset and claimed we weren't friends. Next day, she's acting like nothing happened. She said later in life that she was like that because her mum was, and I accept that. But then she kept doing that through school. Ie, she got pissed at me because I wouldn't help her cheat on important tests.\n\nWhen I went through a rough breakup, she stayed friends with my ex who had cheated on me. Mary's defense? \"She didn't break up with me, she's my friend.\" I'm still sore from that despite it being four or so years ago.\n\nLast year she got a boyfriend. Okay, cool, I'm happy for her. Quickly turns out he's toxic. Possessive as fuck and encourages bad behavior to the point I didn't want to be associated with her in any way. Not that I could anyway--her boyfriend barely let her hang out with other people without him. I think it's because he was paranoid that I (M) would take her from him. No one had such intentions.\n\nI, and many other people, tried to tell Mary that her boyfriend was really bad for her but she called us \"jealous haters\" and blew us off.\n\nNow, almost a whole year later, she's realizing that we were all right. She's talking to me more often and... I don't know if I want to respond.\n\nIm very close to Mary's family (her grandparents see me as a grandson) and I've known her since I was 6 but I'm feeling like I should be done. She has something bad happen every few seconds it feels like and she complains *so often.* I understand people have baggage but she never talks to me about anything else but her problems. I feel like she comes to me alone for advice.\n\nWIBTA if I cut contact?\n\n(Obligatory mobile apology, and I didn't proofread) ",

      "description": "Backstory, I'm (26m) part of a Meetup group in my city, been going since around August last year. It's mostly 20's and 30's people, and usually it's normal stuff like going to a bar for drinks, walks, local events, comedy that sort of thing. \n\nWithin the group, about five or six of us really hit it off and have a good friend group now, whatsapp group chats, hang out outside of meetup etc.\nA few months ago, I ended up sleeping with someone from Meetup, let's call her Jane, and basically introduced her to \"conventional\" BDSM (paddles, restraints, gags and whatever) and particarly my sadism. No biggie.\n\nFast forward a few months, Jane has moved away and a few of us are attending a friend's birthday drinks, let's call her Molly, with predrinks starting at hers. I arrive at Molly's, one other person from meetup and our friend group is there, let's call him Dan (who is gay, idk if that matters), as well as Molly's friends from home. Drinks start flowing, we're having fun, drinking games etc. when somehow the conversation ends up around sex, and it's obvious everyone in the room knows about my kinks. \n\nTurns out Jane told Dan, and Dan told everyone else in the friend group, Molly showing a picture of me to her friends saying \"he's coming, he's kinky\" or whatever, before I arrived. I'm a bit embarrassed but we laugh about it and in so I make everyone do the bdsmtest.org test for fun.\n\nFast forward to last night, it's a regularly occurring end of month drinks Meetup, we're at a bar and there are quite a few newbies. We're chatting, having fun, getting to know people as we usually do, and Dan is pretty drunk. I love the fucker, but he cannot drink for shit. He's chatting to people and making signals in my direction and saying things like \"oh he's a kinky bastard\" and \"show everyone what arrived in the post the other day\". Again, I'm embarrassed but I laugh it off and go with it. I'm not ashamed of being what I'm into, and I dont feel kinkshamed... I just don't want people I just met knowing that about me and immediately assigning it as a personality trait or something. I think we're all hanging out today to chill, so WIBTA for asking him to stop?",

      "description": "Also I feel this is important. I’m 18, I got my drivers license at 17. So I’ve only really been driving for a year and a bit.\n\nI have no sense of direction, I mean I’ve gotten lost following a gps before. I have no idea why but it just does not click with me. \nThis gives me huge driving anxiety. I’m not a bad driver in any way, but when I don’t know where I’m going, or I’m going somewhere I’ve never driven to, the anxiety physically hurts. I always get lost.\nCut to a couple nights ago. My mom asks me if I can drive her to my aunts on Friday because that’s where they’re hosting the “club meeting” that night. They basically just sit around and drink wine. My moms really white. Anyways, the drive is about 30 minutes on the highway, and despite going there for Christmas’s or family stuff occasionally, Ive never driven there. Or picked up on the directions to get there. \n\nSo I was a bit hesitant. The conversation goes as follows.\n\nMom: Youll be fine. You just have to drive me there then pick me up. I won’t be too late.\n\nMe: Could (my brothers name) or dad drive you? I’m probably gonna get lost on my way home to be honest.\n\nMom: Are you serious (my name)?! (My brothers name) already has plans, and dad works all day. You really expect him to take time out of his day to drive me back and forth places?\n\nMe: I don’t know I just don’t want to get lost, I have no sense of directi- *she cuts me off*\n\nMom: FINE, I just won’t go then. You can drive to (my girlfriends name) house no problem, but for some reason your sense of direction can’t drive me to Aunt Lindas?\n\nKeep in mind, my girlfriend lives a five minute drive away.. my aunt lives 30 minuets away. You either have to take the highway, or country side roads to get there. \n\nMe: I just don’t feel confident enough to drive home by myself on the highway. I get really nervous, like remember the last place I drove you and we had the gps? I STILL got lost mom..\n\nMom: No, it’s fine. I just won’t go. We’ll just have to take your name off the insurance if you’re not confident enough to drive then. Till we do that there’s no more using my truck. No more going to (my girlfriends name) house or driving her around.\n\nMy mom let’s me use her truck if I pay for gas.\n\nMe: Really..??? Mom (girlfriends name) lives down the road. It’s not hard to drive ther *cut off* \n\nMom: But you can drive to Tims (café), you can drive to McDonald’s, Shoppers (store)?? Why can you drive to all those places? Because you pick choose everything you want to remember? I’m not paying extra on my insurance so you can not drive ME somewhere, when I ask you to. But nope, no more, I’m done (my name). \n\nMe: I’m sorry mom, I just.. *cut off again* \n\n\nMom: I’m not having this conversation (my name). I’m done!\n\n\nIt’s been two days and this is still on my mind and bothering me. Me having driving anxiety is my own problem, I realize that.. but am I the asshole? Or was my mom being just a bit harsh. I may or may not have cried a bit after lol.",

      "description": "I met Alex at the beginning of freshman year of college and we were quick to become friends. We become roommates sophomore year and this is when I started to notice some problems.\n\nAlex is an introvert, so she doesn’t like to engage in conversations all the time. I understand this since I’m also introverted, but she was pretty rude about it. For example, if I saw her in eating the living room, I’d say hi and she’d completely ignore me. She’d be texting her boyfriend with a huge smile so I know she isn’t in a bad mood, but sometimes I was just nonexistent. She’d also ignore me on the bus (all the time), which gets awkward since we’d be heading to the same classes. It got to the point where mutual friends started noticing and asking about it, so it made me really uncomfortable since I didn't know how to respond.\n\nAlex also has a rude way of speaking sometimes. For example, if she said something to me that was a bit hurtful, instead of saying something like \"sorry that upset you, that wasn’t what I meant” she’d say “you’re just sensitive.” She's told me at one point that my problems aren’t real problems, which was pretty hurtful to hear.\n\nThe way Alex was treating me was particularly upsetting since none of my high school friends came to my college, and she was the closest friend I had on campus. She was not like this at all during freshman year, and I have no idea what happened during sophomore year that would make her treat me this way. She’d done many more hurtful things that I won’t mention, but I can never be honest with her since she’d just throw it back at me and tell me to suck it up. I had big family and personal issues going on, so it was a lot for me to deal with. I was eventually diagnosed with depression.\n\nI made the decision in junior year, where an organization that Alex and I were involved in went on a weekend retreat. As much as I didn’t want to spend the weekend with Alex and a bunch of strangers, our attendance was mandatory since we held leadership positions. Shit hit the fan when Alex early while I stayed behind. The second she left, the topic of the conversation was her. I’m talking all 40-50 people. Turns out everyone had their own grievances towards her for one reason or another, which I could all relate to, and for once my anger towards her felt justified. For once, I didn’t have anyone judging me or telling me that I’m sensitive, and at that point I felt that the best thing to do was to end my friendship with her, for the sake of my mental wellbeing.\n\nI’m not a huge fan of ghosting people and I'd prefer talking things out and reaching a consensus. But I can't do that with Alex. I didn’t want to get into another toxic conversation where I’d be told to just grow up, and knowing me, I’d probably see where she's coming from and agree with her. I understand that Alex may have her own perspective but I just don’t want to risk it since I’m doing so much better now. It’s been 2 years since we’ve talked. AITA?",

He was even kind enough to pay for dinner(usually a splits kinda girl).\n\nWhen we got home he was already falling asleep- I told him that I wanted to do something with him tonight and to please not pass out when we get home. I also had made his favourite dessert which he then complained when I served it to him , I was a litre confused because in the car he said he wanted to eat it when we got home. \n\nI then say maybe you should go have a shower to wake up more and he does but then when I’m in the shower (3 minutes I’m very quick ) he falls asleep.\n\nI put on the lingerie on and try to wake him up but it’s useless and he goes back to sleep and just turns away, this happens three times.\n\nAt this point I’m really upset because I’ve spent quite a bit money and was excited to do something for him but he doesn’t care or even want to do anything. \n\nI felt really hurt because I’ve been telling him how excited I was to show him and he just couldn’t care less or pretend to.\n\nI then change and go back to bed and all he said is are you angry at me. To which I replied Valentine’s Day is over now anyway so just go back to sleep and cue turning away.\n\nIt should be noted that multiple times I’ve tried to do things for him and he constantly just ignored me.",

A few hours later she called the house phone and said she was staying the night and wanted my older brother to pick her up because she wouldn't be able to drive herself home. She told me that I needed to tell my brother this, which I said I would. Next time I saw my brother I said,  \"Grandma is staying at the hospital overnight, she's going to call in the morning so make sure you're here when she calls\" he said okay and that was that.\n\nI wake up at around 11 AM and my brother was still home asleep and my grandmother had already called. His bedroom is not in a place where he could have heard it from the home phones location and he didn't even bring it to his room so that he could have heard it while asleep.  I call her and she's pissed but she had a friend come pick her up instead. To skip a bit ahead, she gets home, goes off on him and he tries to put the blame on me, saying that I wasn't specific enough and that I said didn't tell him that *he* was the one who had to pick her up. I don't even have a drivers license so I don't know how he thought I could have done anything. In the end, she's mad enough to kick him out of his house (He's 23).

      "description": "I went into my local catalog shop. Recently they've upgraded so that instead of paper catalogues everywhere they now have iPads, and you can look up the item(s) that you want and if they have it in stock you can order it, get a number on your receipt, wait until your number gets called and then collect whatever it is and take it home there and then.\n\nIt's a fairly recent upgrade and the shop's been known for their paper catalogs for decades, so for the first month or two whenever you'd go in a shop assistant would come over and tell you that you could now order your items on the iPad instead (how to use the search function, etc). This was totally fine, there are a lot of elderly/tech illiterate people, the free tutorial is nice.\n\nI'll usually go \"thanks, I already know how to use the iPads, thanks though :)\"\nAnd they'll usually go \"okay cool well just ask if you have any questions or need help anyway :)\" and that's it.\n\nBut the last couple of times I've gone in and said that, they'll hover behind me, and stare at my screen and try to upsell me. For example, I was debating buying a new games console and one went \"I mean yeah, you COULD get just the console and one game, but you're missing out on x games\"\nAnd I said \"I know what I'm looking for, thanks though\" and the guy just would not leave! Kept making comments about how I should buy x instead/as well, and kept commenting on my searches.\nEventually he got so annoying that I left without buying anything. Other than that though I had never had any bad experiences with that store so I figured I would just come back when he wasn't on and order it then.\n\nCame back a few days later and there's a different guy. But then the same thing happens again! And it isn't just me he's doing it to, and he's even doing it to the people who have *already bought stuff*. There was a girl leaving with a big smart TV and he chased her down to yell \"DO YOU HAVE BROADBAND WITH THAT TV?! WHAT BROADBAND ARE YOU ON?! WE DO BROADBAND NOW\" and she looked visibly uncomfortable. So I left again.\n\nCame back in for the third time, different sales guy is there again. After the initial \"yeah I know how to use the iPad thank you\" he just doesn't leave. Stands and hovers behind me.\nSo I turn around and go, \"can I help you?\" and he goes \"What are you buying today?\"\nAnd I say \"I'm just going to look it up on the iPad, don't need your help, thanks again though\"\n\nAnd ofc he doesn't take the hint. \"No problem. So, we have loads of great deals on. Mind me asking what you're buying and I'll see if any apply to you?\"\nAfter going back and forth with this a few times I eventually snap (not my proudest moment) and say very firmly, \"look, I do not want your help. I get you're just trying to do your job but I've declined your help multiple times now, I can do this myself, please leave me *alone*\"\n\nAnd he looked so affronted! Glared at me and walked away to go harass some other people. And any time I've been back in since the three of them all give me really dirty looks. But I politely told him multiple times I didn't need any help?!\n\nGranted they might be being told to annoy people by his managers or whatever, may not be the guy's fault personally, but I just thought, oh my god take a fucking hint dude.

      "description": "My sister and I have been friends with this guy (I'll call him Ethan) for a few years, mine and Ethan's friendship started when he had a bit of a crush on me when I was still at school and I would help him with his homework, he also became friends with my sister because I think they had a class at school together. We became pretty close and even when I left school and moved to a different city (he was the year below me at school, and my sister is two years below me) we kept in touch and we would regularly video call as a group (I'm talking every night), we would tell eachother just about everything and it was good to have a connection to home since I had just moved away to university alone, this was last year.\n\nFast forward to early this year, my sister and I were getting a bit suspicious that Ethan hadn't been telling us the whole truth of everything in our conversations and it turned out he had been seeing this girl without telling us, which is fine he can do whatever he wants but it was blatant lies when we would explicitly ask him if he was seeing her and he would say they were just friends.\n\nNow, this girl had been a regular topic in our convos for various reasons and I think it was obvious my sister and I weren't keen on her, so I think partially he was just embarrassed to tell us they had been meeting.\n\nEventually it becomes too obvious to deny and she becomes more controlling over who he's allowed to see and even talk to, she started making him block his friends but he said he would never let her block me and my sister, we warned him over and over it sounded like she was toxic af and to get out of there but he didn't listen.\n\nThen, he blocked my sister and I on every form of social media (surprise surprise), but just before he did he told us it was only temporary until he got her off his back, and at this point he had left school and I lived in a different city so there was no way me or my sister would see him in person. This really hurt me and my sister because we considered him one of our best friends and couldn't believe he would listen to this girl, this was about 5 months ago.\n\nMy sister and I kept tabs on his girlfriend checking her Instagram every so often and about two months ago it looked like her and Ethan had broken up because she was plastering a different boy all over her Insta, so we thought he would unblock us sometime soon.\n\nThen, yesterday night he added me and my sister on Snapchat and messaged my sister apologising saying how he feels horrible blah blah but he is yet to message me and apologise.\nMy sister keeps telling me it sounds like he's really sorry and that she's been talking to him constantly since last night.\n\nHowever, he hasn't messaged me and this is annoying and hurting me more, and at this point I don't want to talk to him, but he's told my sister he is going to message me (after she brought me up). So, AITA for not wanting to talk to him again, because he blocked us and got hurt and had no one to come running to because he pushed everyone away, which we WARNED him about SEVERAL times. I have missed him as a friend but I am starting to doubt if it was mutual if he messaged my sister immediately and not me. Part of me feels like I don't really know how to react to this situation and any advice/opinion is appreciated.\n\nTL;DR AITA for not wanting to talk to an old close friend since he tried to get back in contact with me and my sister after letting a controlling girlfriend block us on every social media",

He got free tickets to a rap show last-minute, and was hoping to not have to spend $100+ on a hotel for the night. Mind you, the show is tonight (a Thursday) so I have work tomorrow on Friday, but I hesitantly said yes, he would let me crash with him if I needed to.  \n  \nImmediately after talking though, it occured to me that he said \"tickets\" as in plural, so I called him back and asked, \"where are your friends staying?\". He then explains that he was hoping they could stay with me too, if that wasn't clear. To me that wasn't clear the first time, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. \n\nI politely told him that I couldn't handle this, and he and his friends should find a hotel or Airbnb. This would be different story if I had my own place, or if it was just him. \n\nHe then proceeded to beg me and try and argue his way through, saying things like \"I would do it for you\" or \"your roommates won't mind\" or \"cmon it would be so cool of you to do this for me\".\n\nI feel like I know the answer here, but AITA?\n",

      "description": "So this was a few weeks ago, but I’m finding myself missing my dad more and more every day but I just can’t find it in me to forgive him. \n\nSo a few weeks ago I was scrolling through Facebook looking through my feed and as I passed by one of my dads posts. I scroll back and find a picture that he posted of a document with my moms name on it and the amount of money she owes him on it for child support. \n\nMy mom owed my dad some money after she continued to take child support after I moved out. So my dad posted something to Facebook about and didn’t even bother to blur anything out. \n\nI then proceeded to message him and tell him that if I was my mom I wouldn’t really appreciate something like that be posted out in the open like that and I understood he wanted his money but some things just need to be kept off social media. I also told him how I didn’t appreciate how his friends made jokes about the whole situation in the comments because to me that’s humiliating and embarrassing and just over all disgusting all in all. That night he sent me a message after I got done work with the same picture he posted with my moms name blurred and he said for what it’s worth I’m sorry it hurt your feelings. And I told him the damage was already done, and he wasn’t even sorry for doing what he did but just for hurting my feelings. \n\nHe basically pushed everything I had to say to the side and proceeded to tell me that he was tired of being the bigger person after all these years and that he didn’t really feel the need to be the bigger person in this situation in general. \n\nHe summarized his whole side the other day by basically telling me I’m wrong for feeling this way about it and that I’m angry for no reason. \n\nI miss my dad, but I’m holding up to how I feel because between posting that document, letting your friends joke about it in the comments, then say a next to nothing apology for the action over text, and concluding it with pushing how I felt to the side, I just feel like this was a step over the line for him.

      "description": "Some background info: I walk every day to and from college. I play trombone in the band and I've rented a French horn to learn, which means every Monday and Wednesday I carry a trombone on my right shoulder with my hand to secure the strap (case has backpack straps and I use one since I have an actual backpack too) and the horn in my left. Now, I know this light. If you don't press the button button before the light turns green, even if it's a half second late, the hand doesn't turn into the green walking guy, but the light still will be green for over a minute. I get to the light right as it turns green, and obviously my hands are full so there's no realistic chance of me pressing the button. I look both ways and walk. Then, I hear a loud engine and someone laying into their horn. I turn to see this speeding black car racing towards me and slightly drifting towards the curb but not signaling. Given that I just walked past a bar, I take a couple steps back to position the light pole thing between myself and the car ( I only had taken a couple steps into the crosswalk) as a precaution. The driver slams his break in the middle of the crosswalk, makes an angry gesture towards the red hand, drives extra slowly until he's out of the crosswalk, and then zips away. Now this confused me because whenever I drive, I always look for pedestrians, light or no light. I get that the walk signal is somewhat for my safety but do drivers really rely so heavily on it?\n\nTL;DR I walked technically on a red light even though the traffic light would stay green for a long time, angry driver honks at me",

      "description": "Ok... So this happened a little bit ago \n\n  First some context. I'm in High School (that seems a bit inconsequential but this story is wack for happening in HS). Last year in April I asked this girl out who I liked for some time. I thought she was perfect and we told each other everything. We also loved theater and did a summer play together. I got one of my best friends to join the play too. He was kinda interested in theater too. During the show they became really close. They were their \"people\" (they just told each other their problems). Apparently my ex had a lot of problems and they came up with code-words for her problems. Keep in mind they never told me anything. Eventually I got worried that there was something was really serious going on. So after a lot of asking and pestering they finally told me. They told me that she had cancer and had an operation after the show for 2 weeks. She said that if anyone asked that she was going to be at a summer camp. Another thing was that she only told us and 2 other of her friends and didn't want us to tell our parents. Come the two weeks and I'm a mess. I can't think straight and I'm sad all the time. I wrote her paragraphs almost everyday even though she wasn't allowed to have her phone. I cried a lot and I generally don't cry even though I might feel sad or depressed. My friend I talked a lot to keep it off our minds and I found my self spending more time with family because I didn't want to be alone. I thought she was going to die. But she got back unscathed. I was ecstatic. I knew she was okay. We dated for a little while after (7 months in all). I broke up with her but we were still friendly. We had a couple classes together and we would have friendly exchanges in them. But a little bit before Winter Break she texted me.\n\n(I deleted her texts later but this was the gist of our conversation)\n\nHer:  So you remember the big thing in May (She told me she had another operation around October, I think?)\n\nMe: No\n\nHer: The Big Thing. Like in July\n\nMe: Oh shoot ya\n\nblah blah blah\n\n  My mom, being a Helicopter parent, read my texts. She asked me what \"The big thing\" was. I was hesitant at first but eventually told her. She had a confused face. She told me that her mom had posted on FB her going to the summer camp. I said that that was just a decoy. But then she showed me pictures of her at the camp on the date she said she left. She was fucking laughing and smiling while I was thinking she was dying! I made the decision to not think about the rest of break and text her about it after. After break I worked up the courage to confront her (text) and this is what I sent... (again I deleted the texts but I sent my original paragraph and her response to my friend:  ( I was trying to remain as professional as possible)  [https://imgur.com/Kfk5wzc](https://imgur.com/Kfk5wzc)\n\nI blocked her and cut her out of my life.\n\nNow I feel guilty...",

      "description": "There's a little bit of context to this I guess. I was in a relationship with a guy for the last year and we lived together (cheaper and he had to move cross state for schooling that he ended up not doing), and our relationship was an absolute dumpster fire. We were the kind of couple that was clearly never compatible but neither of us was mature enough to end it or maybe we were both just too hopeful I guess(?), and shit sorta detonated recently. We were spending time apart, he in a city a couple hours away and me here because I had nowhere else to go.\n\nThere were a couple of things he's done in this relationship that were really bad (**anyone with trauma or anxieties surrounding sexual/physical abuse please don't read further**); \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of months into our relationship he'd sorta violated my consent by initiating sex with me in the middle of the night while I was asleep, and when I say asleep *I mean asleep* like \"I wake up and we're already doing things apparently\" asleep. He's also been physically abusive, hit me a couple of times, and been extremely verbally abusive in the past and it reached a point where him being around caused me active anxiety and a fear for my safety. If I was being 100% truthful which I hope to god I am, I've done abusive things too. I always put my all into rectifying that behaviour whenever it's brought up to me but *I've been guilty of bad behaviour as well*. I've reacted super poorly, if he hits me occasionally I hit back, he's triggered actual post-traumatic episodes in me where I've blacked out and apparently done a couple of really mean things, I've always felt bad afterwards but I don't think that that's an excuse or a remedy. Recently we officially broke things off entirely with a big argument, one where I contributed nearly as much to the bad situation as he did, admittedly. \n\nHe yelled at me, insulted me and repeatedly brought up things that our kind of beyond the scope of my control. But \"two wrongs don't make a right\" obviously, I reacted by yelling back and insulting him too. I called him a piece of shit, a dick, a bunch of expletives that honestly did nothing. Very soon afterwards I felt like shit because I really try to have better control over my temper, and whether someone's mocking me for being disabled or not I felt like a personal failure for helping escalate a bad situation. I made an already bad situation worse by participating in it and having too much pride to back down and I feel really guilty.\n\nFlash forward to a couple of days later (today, he left two days ago) and he comes by to grab his things, which I'm obviously fine with. But I sleep in that room, I live in that room and don't get to go out much, and on top of that when he left he'd already stolen something from it that didn't belong to him. So when I found out that he was coming over to get his things I decided to draw a very broad line in the sand and said that I didn't want him in what is now my room. I said he could have a mutually trusted, neutral third party present at all times to grab his things, I said I could go with that person or I could be in the other room with him if he didn't trust me, and I said the only way he would step foot in that room would be to talk to me about our interactions beforehand.  \n\nI made it very clear that no matter what he would get his things but I didn't budge and made it nonnegotiable that he wouldn't go into that room because I didn't feel safe even being in the same room as him let alone having him where I slept.\n\nIf *I was describing this situation to myself* I'd think \"oh not the asshole right\" but I have some moral confounding about the situation. This was still his apartment as well as mine at one point, we both paid rent, we both lived and slept in this room for months and his things were in here. He had concerns about the safety of his belongings which I respect, and I agreed  to not touch anything of his without him being present. He brought by a friend and I ended up letting him in the room but following him and keeping a close eye on him. Wounds being fresh I'm obviously tempted to bitch about his behaviour being insulting and hostile while he was here but I don't think that's productive and I don't want to try and imbalance the scales. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess the **tl;dr** is; Am I the asshole for not wanting this person in the room that I sleep in when they've violated my consent, was that boundary an immature one? I don't always have the best judgement and I can't tell if I did the right thing or if I was just being childish and petulant. ",

      "description": "Ok so, I've been a little on the weak side when it comes to dating. I've had one real gf and it ended with me finding out that she was cheating on me the whole time, so yeah, not the best track record.\n\nWell that was back in highschool and now, nearly 10 years later, When the subject of me trying to date and find a another gf comes up in my group of friends or family (Friends are getting married/Ma wants more grandbabies you know the deal) I give the old \"I'm working on myself right now\" excuse and change the subject.\n\nWell, I start talking to a girl at work a couple of years younger than me and she's great. funny, smart, very driven and passionate about her work. It helps that she's also gorgeous but I digress. After months of not being able to stop thinking about her, I find out via a friend that she's single and get the push from multiple people to just go for it. She was out of town on a business trip, so I shoot her a message asking if when she gets back if she wants to hang. \n\nWell turns out my friend was wrong, she does have a bf and he's the jealous type, so even if she was interested she couldn't really do stuff with me as friends anyway because of him because she \"wants to respect his wishes\". \n\nI tell her that's totally fine and bow out. Don't wanna cause trouble for anyone, plus it kinda felt good to just put myself out there for once. I feel like I grew a bit if I do say so myself.\n\nI didn't completely cut her out of my life but I stopped messaging her and Ive kept our interactions brief to avoid any potential complications. Just a hello or a casual joke here or there, nothing too big.\n\nSo that's my story. Am I an asshole here? I figured trying to be her friend while I still have some feelings for her would possibly lead to me becoming a orbiter werido or whatever and creeping her out. And I don't want that.",

      "description": "Some context: I’ve been with my gf for a year and half. She’s pretty standard for what gifts she likes: clothes/ jewelry. I’m a little more nuanced ( hobbies range from gaming/ reading/ I play guitar and I have a weird thing for hot sauce). Our first bday together she got me some fancy cuff links. It’s a sweet first gift, not something I’d get super excited over, but nice because I needed them. Now we get to her birthday- I get her a pair of over the knee boots that were in her freaking shopping cart. Like I nailed it. Also, got a year long Rosetta Stone subscription to learn Spanish because she said we wanted to learn a language together. Another holiday rolls around and she gets me a hot sauce making kit. This is the sweetest gift I might have ever gotten. Not expensive, just really thoughtful. Almost moved to tears. And I say so. Fast forward to my birthday this year. She completely backslides gets me a wallet which is in the same vain as the gift from the year previous. She also books a day of activities of couples massage and a dinner. Here’s the thing though- at first it was just the wallet. It just felt so impersonal and that it was more for her because she wanted me to have a nicer wallet (old one was a little ratty). It was upsetting- at this point she knows what I like, she knows I am financially strapped and I wouldn’t be able to spend money on some of my more expensive hobbies like gaming. Anyway she says she’ll never get me video game stuff because she doesn’t want to buy me things she buys her 11 yr old brother. That was kind of insulting. I say when I buy gifts I don’t consider myself I only consider what would the other person happiest. She said I made her feel bad, on my birthday...I don’t know..even typing this I feel like I’m being whiny and immature. It would just be so nice if I had someone who wanted to get me these things so they could see the joy in my face. I felt shitty after when I found out about the rest of the stuff, but after she said those things it left a bad taste in my mouth. Anyway her birthday just passed and I got her a nice necklace I knew she wanted, and we went to dinner. We ended up fighting somewhat about the gifts thing (I kept saying things like “yea birthdays are only for the other person, so I don’t consider myself”).  So AITA, should I just give up on hoping to get gifts I like?\n\nTl;Dr GF got me something I wasn’t into, called her out on it, she said she’s not going to indulge my video game hobby, ever. ",

      "description": "We moved into this house last year, not caring that the neighbors had two large german shephards (fwiw, I don't think we even knew they had dogs until after we moved in, but it's not like it would have kept us from buying the house).  They generally free roam their fenced in backyard, but the fence is only 4 1/2 feet tall, if that.  These dogs are LARGE dogs that I can't imagine would have any trouble at all hopping that fence, if they so desired.  \n\nWe noticed pretty quickly, though, that these dogs had a tendency of charging the fence when someone walked by.  I would have no problem if they just ran up out of curiousity, but they charge at it, barking wildly, barring their teeth and growling.   As someone who used to be terrified of dogs, this is incredibly unsettling, not to mention the fact that we have a 100+ pound lab mix of our own who right now, can only use the front yard while leashed out of concerns for his safety.   My mom found the homeowner on facebook and sent her a message about us potentially going halfsies on getting a fence put up - only for the homeowner to tell us that we should try giving them treats to win them over, that they are just protective of their yard, and that they had only \"nipped\" one person that came into their front yard.  \n\nWe plan on paying to get a 6-7 foot privacy fence installed this spring - but the dogs are becoming nuissances now.  They're now in the habit of barking and charging the fence to get at dogs 3-4 yards away.  They barked for an hour straight last night at a dog that is probably half a block away.\n\n\nI've contemplated calling the cops before since this would all put these dogs under the category of \"public nuissance\" in our jurisdiction - but I'm a dog lover and don't want to see these dogs get put down or something because of terrible owners.  However, my nieces and nephew come over all of the time and the last thing I want to see happen is one of these dogs hopping the fence and causing harm to an innocent little kid (or even them just hopping the fence and coming after my dog).\n\nWIBTA if I end up reporting them to the police and/or animal control?\n\n\n(Please note: I'm not mad at the dogs.  They don't know better as they were never trained - that's not their fault; I'm mad at the owners who just don't seem to give a fuck that their dogs are creating problems for their neighbors)\n\n",

      "description": "So about a week ago I got into an argument with my girlfriends mom over some stuff she posted on facebook. Basically for no reason I can figure out she made a long post about how my mom was drinking and driving, encouraged me and my gf to have sex, etc. None of this was true. She never used names but she was descriptive enough to where a good amount of people would know who she was talking about. When I learned about this I messaged my girlfriend telling her I was upset and asking her why her mom would think all that, she said she didn't know but she'd ask her mom. A few minutes I got a message from her mom where she said everything she said was true and added in a little remark about how she felt sorry for me. I'll admit, I got angry so this might be where IATA, I sent her an angry message about how everything she said wasn't true, even using some certain 4 letter words I really shouldn't have. Anyways, after that she messaged my mom about how disrespectful I was for cussing around her (side note: she cussed a lot around me a lot) and how she doesn't want me to be around her daughter anymore. Anyways, now our relationship is over and I'm wondering AITA.",

      "description": "  \n\nI (25/F) am a part-time pre-dental student, currently taking three upper level science classes. I also work an 8-5, 40 hr/wk  job and am the sole income provider in my household. I’m very lucky because my work has let me be very flexible with my hours so I can take classes during the day (I start at 7, go to class, come back until 6 or 7). I am a straight A student. I never skip class and take my time at school very seriously because the grades I get now decide my future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a friend (25/F) who I met at school last year. We are friends outside of class and frequently spend time together. She is taking the same science courses I am but doesn’t have a job. She often decide she “isn’t feeling” class and will skip lectures or just leave halfway through class. Whenever we meet up to study she ends up packing a bowl after about an hour of studying and then tells me she can still study while she’s baked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to share my notes with her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, our professor holds office hours to review practice tests before the midterm. This is the only way to get the answer key for the practice exams. I always use my PTO and take a half day so I can go to campus and meet with him. Rather than go and meet with the professor herself, she will text me and ask if I’ll give her the answers to the practice exam. Or she will skip class to go on a hike with her boyfriend and then ask me to send her the notes I took.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m torn because I know that my helping her doesn’t inhibit my ability to succeed. Giving her my notes or the practice exam info doesn’t negatively affect me. So I feel like an asshole for not wanting to help her. But at the same time I feel like I’m being taken advantage of because she knows she doesn’t have to try hard or attend class because I’ll never skip or slack off. She says she would do the same for me, but I would never put her in that position. It annoys me that she will have access to the material I worked my ass off to compile for absolutely no effort on her part.  It’s also frustrating because my workload is insane, and I know if I can make time for class so can she. Am I just being really judgmental about her work ethic? ",

He had been following girls who post themselves pissing themselves and shiting their pants. He also posted stuff like \"any girls up for shitting on my chest\" and \"give me a number 1=hot, 2=need to fuck, 3=can resist etc. We privately said to him nicely if he knows people can see them and that it is kinda in his best interest to take them down. He straight up blanked us.\n\nSo a few weeks later he posted more wierd shit. So at this point i was done. Whenever he tried to start a conversation i would just ignore him. Like just to disassociate myself with him. By this time the whole year knew. I wasnt friends with him before we found all thia creepy and gross stuff so why should i try to be his friend or mate now?\n\n",

However our personalities are way different. I'm a bit calmer and he's the opposite. He's very high energy, but that's because he relies on/takes drugs. He does weed ALL the time, takes MDMA, cocaine, Ket, etc. You name it. And in terms of alcohol, he's just fine.\n\nHe always has a loud and energetic vibe and approaches girls and they end up sleeping with him. I'm sorry to say, but I'm just jealous, if I'm being honest. I've tried emulating him a bit, and it didn't work. \n\nHe says things to me like ''Girls just want to be fucked, sometimes they want a good fucking, don't be a nice guy'' and then when he hooks up with girls he describes how he had sex with them to me, I think he's doing it to make me jealous.\n\nSo he came to a pre-drinks at my flat and my flatmate (20F) met him for the first time. As the pres went on he saw her and smiled and said some shit along the lines of ''Girl you so pengg'' (cringe...) but to my surprise she started giggling and playing with her hair, I was so jealous honestly...then when we went to the club, they started making out and he came back to my flat and fucked her. \n\nI came back a bit after them, and watched some porn then fell asleep (lol my life). \n\nAnyway I woke up and went to the kitchen and he was there, and then he said hi and winked at me. I knew obviously what had happened. Then I went for a cigarette with him and he described how he fucked my flatmate doggy style. \n\nSo after he left, I went up to watch some TV for a few hours and recover from my hangover with some shitty food. Now my flatmate (20F), we can just call her Amber, comes out to the living room and starts making food.\n\nNow it was only me and her there, and I still had some alcohol in my system, so I just flat out asked her ''I just have to know, why did you fuck James? I'm genuinely curious.'' and she turned around and looked at me very weirdly. So I said ''I'm just curious, I want to know why you made the decision?'' and she looked a bit angry at me and said ''Shut the fuck up''. \n\nBut I honestly WAS curious why she chose to sleep with him, AITA?",

      "description": "I'd like to start this with an apology. This is an emotionally charged topic for me so I'm sorry if my sentences run on or if I say some stuff that doesnt make too much sense.\n\n Me(19) and my boyfriend(21) are about to hit 1 year. Our relationship has always been kinda unbalanced, but I never minded till recent because I love this man with all of my heart. I pay for both of our food, gas, and anything else he wants, I very rarely say no. We both work i just get more hours/have a better job in general.\n\n He lives with his mom and me by myself. We made an agreement to see each other every other day, of course stuff happens and we switch days around/cancel whatever, most of the time it doesnt bother me. Now and then he'll tell me all day about how excited he is to see me tonight and then once I get off work he changes his mind and acts like I'm an asshole if I get upset. I never straight tell him he ruined my day but it really does. I always tell him \"I'm just upset because you got my hopes up.\" Which I dont think is mean. Hes said once that it's not fair that I make him feel bad  for cancelling, but hes ruined my whole day so it seems fair to me. Plus, I'm not trying to make him feel bad, I just dont think I should lie about being sad.\n\n I will admit, i get way more bent out of shape than i should, but I cant help it and I'm not sure why it bothers me so much. Every time I tell him it's okay to cancel, just let me know a little earlier in the day so it doesnt upset me as much. He did this once afterwards and everything was fine. I tried to talk to him about how I thought our relationship was unbalanced and he just told me I was overreacting and refused to have a conversation so I dropped it.\n\nBut todat he told me last second again that he didnt want to come over because hed rather play video games. On a normal day I wouldn't care, yeah whatever it happens all the time. But the whole day before I was having a terrible depression episode. I cried all day and I was really close to ending my life that night. We talked on the phone before bed and he told me he missed me a lot and wanted to see me today and we both agreed to hang out since I finally had a day off. I won't have any time one the day he said we could hang and I told him this. Am I the ass for literally hating him for all of this? I know he has no obligation to see me but I literally pay for his everything and he promised me hed see me. Everyone I've talked to has told me I should dump him but I love him and dint really want to do that. I want an unbiased opinion from someone who wouldn't just tell me what I want to hear. Am I the asshole? Am i just overreacting?",

      "description": "I'm currently 26 years old, and my family lives in another state. I live my own life and support myself financially 100%. My family consists of my Grandmother, my Mother, and my Mother's sister (my Aunt). My family and I have had some major issues in the past, but I've done my best to move on from them. \n\nLast year, I got pregnant. It was a \"happy accident\". I was hesitant about telling my Mom first. She has Borderline Personality Disorder and, despite working on herself, can be a little unpredictable and unsupportive/self-centered at times. I called my Grandmother instead. When I called and told her the news, the first thing she said was, \"well, when are you having the abortion?\"\n\n...what?\n\nShe then proceeded to tell me that I was so young. That I had so much more left to do before \"giving up my life\". Etc. I was absolutely devastated and in shock. I got off the phone crying and felt broken in a way I hadn't since I was young.\n\nBut then things got weird. When my Mom found out, she barely had any reaction to my news. She was just absolutely livid at my Grandmother. Mom tore into her like a feral animal, refusing to speak to her for a while. My Aunt was strangely supportive and had an uncharacteristically heartfelt conversation with me. I found out later that this was a sore spot for both my Mom and Aunt, who had both gotten abortions in their youth because of lack of family support. My news opened up an entire can of worms. My family spent the better part of the next month fighting amongst themselves about MY pregnancy. \n\nI had a miscarriage two weeks after this happened. It was really hard on me and took me a while to recover. \n\nWell, now I'm pregnant again. It's almost a year since the last one. I'm further along, and it's looking healthy. I'm due in October, about two weeks before my birthday (when I usually physically see my family). And I really, really don't want to tell any of them.\n\nI feel guilty, like they're supposed to be a part of this process. And I KNOW that it wasn't my Mom or Aunt that made the abortion comment. Maybe my Mom, at least, deserves to know she's going to be a Grandmother once I hit my second trimester? \n\nBut...I just can't bring myself to tell them. I felt like they turned something deeply personal and important to me into something hurtful. I'd be heartbroken to be met with non-supportive comments again. Since I found out about my pregnancy this time, I've been actively trying to figure out how to hide it and schedule times we'll see each other either when I could hide the bump or after the baby's due date. It feels like a crappy game of keep-away. I guess I'm hoping that actually seeing my child will make them all behave better. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA? Should I be more forgiving and tell my family the next time I see them in May? Or would it be okay if I just...never told them about my pregnancy, just having them meet the baby in November?",

      "description": "Let me preface this by explaining, I go to a pretty difficult high school where we learn hard courses and are expected to understand everything. While this is difficult we are supported by our great teachers who can teach very well.\n\nAbout two months we got a student teacher for my Literature class, she only teaches my period. She also goes to a really good college and is still learning how to teach fully. She’s very interactive with students and follows what my normal teacher tells her to do. Previously I also had a student math teacher in which he stayed for a month taking notes during my period and taught a during a different.\n\nThe only issue is that she cannot teach that well, and is definitely not ready to teach at my school. She is not present for other lessons and only reads the lesson plan. Her handwriting is barely readable and we constantly have to pause to ask her what word was written. She grades overly harsh while barely teaching us half the material or creating terrible projects that are only based on prior knowledge. (One project was a trailer where I drew the unlucky straw and got a group where no one knew how to edit a video). This really showed with a recent test we had. My teacher said that we would be tested on quotes from one of the Shakespeare books we were reading while only getting a section of the quote. We had to identify the character, the context, theme and etc. All the quotes from the test we also supposed to be quotes we discussed before as well. After identifying all the quotes we’ve studied it was pretty easy to study for said test. Only issue is, half of the quotes were never discussed.\n\nSome friends from another period felt the test was easy while basically everyone from my class struggled trying to find out what each quote was. And after having to deal with this for two months I’ve gotten pretty sick of it. I don’t want this ruining my GPA or my previous grades in this class but I feel as it is.\n\nShe seems nice enough and could probably teach well at a less intense high school but honestly is completely ruining my experience in the class. I really don’t want to be the reason for her preforming poorly in whatever college course she is taking (I’m not really sure how it works) but I also don’t want my grade to be ruined. She’s been here far to long and the class has been delegated to a “homework” class as we don’t learn anything than the obvious.\n\nI really need some advice...",

      "description": "Let me give some context to this first.   \n\n\nMy friend who I know in real life who's in her late teens, about the same age as me, has anxiety problems she's been dealing with for a couple of years now. Each time that she has a problem she comes on our group chats and basically vents and says all the problems and self deprecating thoughts she's been having even when people are talking or something else is going on or no one has anything to say that hasn't already been said, and this usually happens every three days or sometimes days in a row. Most of these problems she's talking about can't be solved by **only** coming to us, such as being highly shaky or having migraines. She also has problems with her dad at home as far as I know, but I don't really know how often it is since I'm not her.  \nBefore this situation that I'm about to explain happened, we were basically best friends.  \n\n\nOne day she started to basically break down to me over the internet, and this is where I stopped talking to her mainly.  \nShe comes on asking me if she's being annoying, I ask her if there was a specific instance that made her feel that way and she said no. Seconds later completely out of the blue, she says she hates herself, wants to pretend she doesn't exist, and would be cutting herself if I didn't make her promise not to. (I made her promise not to when I first her about it because it gave me peace of mind to know she's okay.)  \n\n\nAt this point, I feel kind of annoyed since she comes to us every day with her problems and isn't taking her own steps to fix them. I say that I'd expect her own sense of integrity to do the right thing, not just my solemn promise. She says she just wants to be able to vent, that her anxiety is a hellish feeling, and that her giving her word to someone is important because her integrity won't do the right thing. I understand these things, but the main problem I'm having with it is that she isn't taking steps to confront her problems herself (as in get professional help) and, what feels to me, like she is looking for validation.  \n\n\nI took steps back from talking or inviting her to things lately because of this entire thing and because of how much stress I felt when I was dumping into this. I told her at the end to find things that would help her physically and to do more to help herself. When I see her in public I try not to talk to her because I don't want to get back into this.\n\nIt's about a month later, and she hasn't done anything to change.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole, though? I feel pretty guilty about it.",

      "description": "Pretty sure that this will be a RIP account because... animals.\n\nMiddle-aged, very busy dad with 2 kids, stay at home mom (recently able to afford for her to retire and concentrate on kids.)  Finally making enough money to buy nice things.  Bought 'dream house' this year, and outfitted it with some lovely, somewhat expensive items (hardwood floors, nice rugs, furniture, couches, etc.)  I'm a very involved parent, husband, and physician - but try to remain balanced, exercising and taking enough time for myself so I don't go insane.  Things are going quite well.\n\nWife expresses a desire to get a dog.  I said I would never say 'absolutely not' because I'm just not that kind of guy - but say if she does, she's on her own - that I will never walk it, do anything for it - and that I vehemently oppose this, for a few reasons.  \n\nOne, I have no time for anything else.  I really don't want ANY more responsibilities - I feel maxed out sometimes, and think I am pushing it in terms of stress.  \n\nTwo, I do not want a dog.  I do not dislike dogs, but get no real pleasure from them.  (Don't hate me for this - I'm vegetarian for 10 years because of compassion to animals, but perhaps mostly because of reason #1, do not want a dog in my house at this time.)  \n\nPerhaps most of all, in my opinion, we have a rich history of failure with dogs.  My wife (then girlfriend) 'surprised' me with a dog that I didn't want when we were dating (and also had no time.)  This dog ended up getting neglected when we were both working full time and n school, so her solution was to buy a second dog as a companion.  This second dog was insane, very jealous of our new baby and we ended up having to give her to a family member (who ended up taking our first dog as well, several years later.  Embarrassing.)\n\nWhile out at an activity with my son recently, I came home to see that she had...rescued a dog.  I'm so pissed.  This puppy is chewing our expensive items (which she replaced, only to have them chewed, too.)  I estimate that this dog has done about $3,000 worth of damage to our house.  To her credit, my wife is doing everything with this dog because I'm afraid I have made good on my promise to do (almost) nothing.  To emphasize, this is 99% because I have no additional time, or energy.  She's exhausted.  I have walked the dog, rarely, when she is too tired - but really only in an attempt to tire the dog, so it stops chewing up our house.  She tried to integrate me more with the dog, but I can't stand it.  It bites (it's a puppy, I get it, it's not evil), it jumps on your face when sitting/resting, it barks at night...there is nothing to like about this animal, as far as I am concerned.  I resent the hell out of this dog, and push it away when it approaches me.  I feel bad, but can't emphasize how much I do not want this furry little chore machine.\n\nI don't know what the solution is here, perhaps if I continue to ignore the dog it will avoid me...(I'll never be actively cruel or abusive although I am aware that some will consider this action abusive in itself) and perhaps (hopefully) it settles in with the wife/kids and stops tearing up the house.  AITA for behaving this way?  (And if I am, I don't know what the solution is!)  ",

      "description": "This is addressing many situations, so I'll try to not let this get out of hand. Specifically last year, as I was planning my birthday. People were complaining to me that I wasn't doing enough. I wanted to go to Renaissance festival. I was paying for everyone's ticket but one person (this person I had given cash to for gas many times, as well as paid for their entrance to other events and paid for their meals, all as a thank you for driving me around so much). I got super sick from the stress of planning my birthday.\n\nSpecifically from people going behind my back, changing plans without telling me. Plans that specifically involved me. And then getting mad at me when I addressed them about said plan. \n\nI cancelled my party because I was sick (thankfully I hadn't paid for anything yet). I then cut out about 3 of those friends that day without a word. I had issues with these friends for awhile before hand and had called them out for crappy behavior a few times. They'd apologize and go back to treating me like crap within a few days.\n\nI didn't feel like explaining to them why their behavior upset me. Because it clearly didn't get anywhere in the past and I was tired of putting my mental health on the line for people who obviously didn't care. \n\nI have been told by many that just blocking without a word is the worst thing you can do. I honestly don't care. I don't think it's my responsibility to give someone closure for the end of a toxic friendship. I don't think it's my responsibility to go through the emotional labor of telling them what they did wrong when they have a history of not listening, and it's going to do me more harm than good. \n\nI know I'm selfish for this line of thinking, but my mental health has been so much better this past year and a half for living life in this way. I have so much better friends now, and I don't have a bunch of drama and toxicity following me around anymore.\n\nSo am I the asshole for cutting toxic (I do not hesitate to call them toxic) friends out of my life without a word? Am I further an asshole for not caring about whatever emotional things they needed to go through after this?\n\n**TL;DR** AITA for cutting out toxic friends suddenly by blocking them and never speaking to them again? Am I further the asshole for not caring what emotional strife this may have caused?",

      "description": "My brother (M28) dated IND1 (F 24) for 3 yrs. They had a great relationship &amp; supportive community of friends/fam. My (M30) girlfriend (F25) and I spent a lot of time w them, went on trips (camping , rock climbing etc). Over the last 18 mo, I noticed red flags about my bro’s behavior. I tried reaching out, I didn’t do it in a way he would respond positively to and he ended up pushing me away. Long story short, he confessed to me he had an entire separate relationship with another woman, had sexual encounters w multiple other women, &amp; had been dabbling in drugs/alcohol. He also told IND1. She didn’t want anything to do w him after that. Our community was obviously fractured.  I care about IND1. What my brother did was incredibly hurtful &amp; wrong but I love him and will be there for him. A friend of ours (M26) – IND2, has always been around at group outings. He &amp; his girlfriend have been together for as long as we’ve known them. He for some reason confided in me that he cheated many times. He also always made odd comments about IND1, which I always tried to redirect bc they seemed entirely inapprop. He made a comment once abt the physical appearance of IND1 wearing spandex while she was still dating my brother.  I ended up telling him that he had to keep my girlfriend &amp;IND1 out of our conversations if we were to be friends – that I could listen to him and let him vent, but we had to set strict boundaries. He &amp; his girlfriend broke up at some point; he says she never knew about his other partners. So really, the only person in this entire clusterf* who knows about his character is me. F-fwd to tday. IND2 has been hanging out w IND1 &amp; wants to go out on a dbl date. I have 0 interest in making friends, or going on dbl dates. All I want to do is tend to my relationships (girlfriend, bro, family). Knowing that he and I are friends, she asked me what I thought abt him. I told her everything I knew. That he had always made sexual comments about her body, &amp; he cheated on his girlfriend for over 2 yrs much like my brother had. That although her personal life was not my business, I couldn’t willingly withhold that info from her&amp; that unless she was willing to go thru another similar situation, she shouldn’t date him.\nI feel like a broke his trust by spilling everything abt him to IND1. I also feel that I unknowingly covered for my brother. I always gave my brother the benefit of the doubt, w the obvious red flags I didn’t say anything to IND1 bc I trusted my brother &amp; though I suspected something I couldn’t prove it.\nAITA for telling IND1 everything that IND2 confided in me? The last thing I want is for her to be played by IND2 who seems to have swooped in to cash in on an apparent opportunity. She has no interest in him now, and IND2 will probably find out soon what I told her.",

      "description": "For context, my dad bought me a 1999 BMW m3. It's a nice car and I'm really grateful for it. This weekend he went on an out of state trip and me, my sister, and my mom stayed home. None of us (from my knowledge) touched the BMW. My dad decided to go out to the car and dink around with the CDs since we hadn't tested that yet, while I stayed inside. While there he decided to put the top down (it's a convertible). When he did this he heard something shatter like glass. He came in and immediately started saying someone was screwing with the car. I reply, \n\"I don't think anyone has touched the car this weekend\" and \"I didn't touch it\". He starts screaming someone is lying and is slamming things and throwing things. I start yelling back\n\"Well I didn't touch it\" and go outside to read a book. A couple hours later and I'm still pissed about being accused of screwing with it when I've never even touched the exterior without him around and I'm always honest, I'm not some rebellious teen. I'm a four point o 16 year old taking college classes. My dad started talking to me like earlier exchange never happened, and since I'm still annoyed, I give short answers. He started yelling at me again about why I won't let it go and I told him \n\"You yelled at me for something I didn't do and you never said sorry.\" He then gets mad again and starts yelling about someone lying to him. I'm still pissed, but should I just let it go? Am I being an asshole by caring it on?",

      "description": "It was heavily snowing nickel sized flakes since 1pm here and by the time I was off work there was a good inch of slippery, treacherous sludge on top of the asphalt. I decided to take the boring drive home. One of the big reasons I hate going that way is an intolerably short light where the two big roads cross. It has two lanes but the left lane becomes a turn only almost immediately after the intersection and is an invitation for asshole behavior as most civilized people stay right and wait their turn. I have occasionally been that asshole, but today I decided to be patient. I waited 3 turns of the light in that damn right lane, and suddenly I hear the sounds of an asshole who's had enough of this waiting bullshit. He's driving a Challenger. Of course he is. He's decided to enter a torquey rear wheel drive car in a drag race - ON FUCKING SNOW. I am silently seething thinking if I was up front I could totally take him because AWD + TURBO + SNOW = WINNING. Fact. I see someone else jump out to cut the line with him. Fucker! Both these jackasses are going to dive in front of the people in front of me and I'll be lucky to make the light. Then I realize it's got government wheels. It's an unmarked Explorer. Mopar Douche had no idea there's a cop right behind him. His rear window is covered in snow. I switch from seething to anticipation... Oh shit! He's gonna go sliding through the intersection and get lit up by Burger King. He creeps on the red light - violation 1. He can be pulled over any time now. He creeps again. Then again. He's almost in the crosswalk before the other light even goes yellow. I take it all in. He gets on it as soon as the light goes green and gets a good foot or so of tail movement from tire spin. He's still going faster than the guy on the right. He does a bit more fishtailing and then cut over right. The Explorer is right behind him four cars ahead. He doesn't pull him over. I'm mad again. Traffic ahead of me slows down as someone makes a left. Traffic gets going again, and there I see it - the sex lights on the right shoulder. Am I the asshole for literally laughing out loud at watching instant karma play out?",

      "description": "Just to give you guys some very important context / I come from a very wealthy family, my partner comes from quite the opposite. My dad very generously bought me a house at the start of this year which my partner and I have just moved into.\n\nMy partners (of three years) mom has been going through a bit of a rough spot in life and has become increasingly isolated. She just lost her job and was given 2 months to leave her rental property as her landlord is selling. Long story short, she’s moving in with us (we have 3 spare bedrooms so space isn’t the issue). \n\nI strongly believe that family is supposed to help each other when things get tough... but my main concerns are: \n\n1) she is very, very moody and can be quite abrasive. Every time we visit her - it always gets to the point where my SO and I are both like “okay time to go home now!”. I don’t want to feel that way in my new home, which I have been very excited about moving into for a while now.\n\n2) all of her bad circumstances have come as a result of some pretty shitty life decisions on her behalf (I.e she just up and left her partner of 5 years randomly, quit her job and lived off all of her savings until it ran out, moved out to the middle of nowhere by herself on 100 acres, tried to get back with said partner she left, etc...). She is a very good person, but just damaged and does not know how to sustain healthy relationships (with friends and family too). She had so many opportunities to not be in this situation and yet she managed to ruin all of them. And at each point I was internally screaming “what are you doing?!?!”. All of this makes empathising with her current situation harder for me.\n\n3) my partner has a lot of shame about his poor upbringing - and does not want my dad finding out about his mom moving in with us (because he fears my dad perceiving his family in a negative light - or that they’re using me). But he’s also very concerned about his usually stoic mother, who recently confessed to him she’s been having suicidal thoughts. He also totally respected if I felt the need to tell my dad (who lives on the other side of the world) - but I just don’t want to live with a secret. And tbh, I don’t want my dad perceiving the situation any other way than it is. I think he will assume I’m being taken advantage of. \n\n4) I work from home. I thoroughly enjoy my alone time during the day. She will be in the house all day, every day. I have to move my office into a room now. \n\n5) she has the most annoying, barking dog that sheds everywhere. He’s a bad influence on my dog (makes him start barking when around) and she has an entire different set of rules for her dog than I have for mine. I just really don’t want to live with her dog. I LOVE dogs, but this one just... frustrates me.\n\n6) I was so excited to have my own home that I could have my friends come and visit - and it feels like her living with us will change the dynamics. I almost feel like I’m back in high school again. \n\nHer horse just recently died and she loved this horse dearly. But for some reason, when my partner was discussing the logistics of her moving in, I couldn’t help but express my DISCONTENT with the situation. It came out - and I told him I’m just very unhappy with it, and that I can’t pretend to be happy. But I also said I understand why it has to happen. He was hurt, but also worried. He felt embarrassed about the situation but said his need to make sure his mom is okay overrides his uncomfortable feelings.  \n\nI think my biggest frustration is knowing that her moving in is only a bandaid fix, and that she needs to change some fundamental issues in the way she deals with life so she dosent end up in the same situation / relying on us physically, emotionally and financially. What’s the long term solution?!\n\nAITA for not being more empathetic towards my future future MIL and for low-key making my SO feel guilty by passive aggressively expressing my frustration with the situation?",

      "description": "TL/DR at the bottom:\n\nGrandmother has been pretty bad off and on for the last 12+ years. Beat breast cancer, had a few heart attacks, even had her memory go for a while there and that even started to come back. She just had to be airlifted to a hospital (they live out in the middle of nowhere) because they believe she was having a pretty severe stroke. I'm definitely not wishing this be the end....it just seems like it could be.\n\nThe issue I have now, is that I live 1200 miles away without a car (live in a city, don't need for day to day life), with my now pregnant fiancee. I know my mom would fly me out, but I also need to save all the PTO I have from work for when our baby comes so I can be there for those first few weeks because she is going to need all the help she can get.\n\nThe last time I saw my grandmother was in November, that was a really hard time because she could hardly remember anything and was having fits in the nursing home she was in because she would wake up not knowing where she was or thought that the nurses were poisoning her and not letting her leave. She would eventually calm down, but only when family was around to get her back in a lucid state. I felt, after I left that last time, that it would be the last time I saw her alive and kind of came to terms with that on the drive back with my mom to her house. \n\nAs much as I love my grandmother, we never really saw eye to eye through most my life. Instead of being that grandmother figure, she would always more be the disciplinary/judgmental figure while I was growing up. She always questioned every little thing I did, especially in my teenage/early 20s years to the point where it became a task to go see her because I knew I was going to be berated every time. The saving grace being my grandfather is pretty much the perfect example of a grandfather type.  I feel like my mom would understand why I couldn't make it, I just don't know about the rest of the family.\n\nWIBTA?\n\nTLDR: Live a long distance away from grandparents, even though mom would pay for my flight I feel I need to save PTO for the birth of my child.

      "description": "I've been on this project at work for a software pilot for months now. Both myself and \"Tara\" had been assigned to this project as co-managers. I've had bad experiences with her in a past project - she basically pushed me out by withholding info and excluding me from meetings - but I've tried my best to forget about it. But this one's not going so smoothly, either.\n\nTara's demanded that I run every email past her, run every potential meeting time past her (even though I can see when people are free because calendars), every idea I've proposed to her she's shot down, etc.\n\nShe's also pulled me into private meetings with her where she literally just criticizes me the whole time. Tara's criticized me for:\n\n\\-answering questions the software company has of us (\"you didn't have to answer that for them so quickly - you don't owe them speed; they're serving us, and you should run your response by me first anyways\").\n\n\\-sympathizing/agreeing with another employee on the project when they privately voiced frustrations about the software.\n\n\\-offering to help the database transition go a bit smoother for the software company (it would have taken seconds for us to do, whereas the other method would have taken the company hours). When I explained to her why I offered, she grew angry and said, \"Well, that's their problem to deal with.\"\n\nTara's also tried to get the project manager on the software company's end in trouble with his boss. She's kept records of every (actual or not) mistake he's made - told me to do the same - and reported them to his boss when he's been nothing but very polite to us.\n\nShe's consistently hostile in the meetings with them, too. She's accusatory and passive aggressive and very demanding.\n\nToday was the final straw, however. She wrote out what she intended to do next to myself and our managers. Part of that was related to asking the company more about the data transfer - my area of expertise as someone in IT - and she'd mentioned that she was going to be busy all day, so I responded and told her I'd contact them about that particular matter to save her time.\n\nShe asked me privately if I'd asked my manager his opinion, first. I responded and copied him on the email and said that I had, in person. She whipped back and wrote like four paragraphs about how I shouldn't have sent the company the question, there was no need for urgency, \"I was going to ask them that in my email tomorrow along with other things, perhaps I wasn't clear enough? I appreciate that you're eager to move the project along, but we should really work to improve our workflow\". Worse yet, she copied my manager on it.\n\nI know this might be a \"duh, you're NTA\", but for someone to be this extreme, it makes me wonder if I'm doing something incredibly wrong to have made her feel she needs to control everything? That I did something bad/am incompetent enough to provoke this reaction from her? Or is she just as bonkers as I'm thinking she is?",

      "description": "So when I was in high school I came out as bisexual an usually hang around LGBTQ+ people and I had a friend who stood out the most (let's call her Karen).\n\nKaren was a caring friend who stood beside me on most of my problems (mostly family issues) and I felt like she was a sister to me.\n\nAbout 2 years later I started hooking up with a mutual friend of ours. We hooked up for about 6 months when I asked her to be my girlfriend. She said no, and, in hindsight, she actually told me she wanted nothing serious when we started seeing each other. I took it pretty badly. I still liked her. But my friends helped me through.\n\nFast foward a couple of months, another mutual friend of ours was moving to another country and threw a party. Seeing that he knew all four of us, he invited us all. I still liked my ex, and everyone knew (seeing that I was still a little bit depressed over we \"breaking up\"), however I said to myself that it was the last opportunity to see my friend and I shouldn't let it get in the way.\n\nSo I went to the party with my friends. After a couple of hours, and drinks, we were all a little bit drunk, and I saw Karen and my ex kissing. Not saying that I own any of them, and that they owed me anything, it made me upset that Karen actually hooked up with someone she knew I liked without her talking to me (again, not saying that she needed permission, but I think she could've given me a heads up, since she knew that it would've hurt me)\n\nAbout half an hour after I confronted Karen and her only response was that she knew I wouldn't like it, but she was into her (my ex), but thought it would end our friendship, so she would rather do it and say she was sorry later.\n\nThe fact that she knew that it would hurt me made me think that she was doing it only to make me miserable, which led to me cutting all ties with her. But a few days later I learned that she liked my ex long before she and I got in a \"relationship\",but never said anything, and suffered the same fate that I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Friend hooked up with an ex I still had feelings for\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for cutting off ties with Karen ?",

      "description": "I lived in the philippines with my brothers when I was growing up while my parents worked overseas. My mom worked in Canada and my dad worked in Hong kong. When i turned 16 it was time that me and my brothers immigrated to Canada to have a better life with my mom, my dad followed us from hong kong. It was now our first time living together as a family. During our time together, my mom learned that my dad cheated on her and I have a half-brother in the philippines. It was a tough time for my mother since she had kidney problems and has been doing dialysis 3 times a week and the stress was not helping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few years my mom moved on and still learned to accept my dad so we were still living in the same house. Before I used to look up to my dad and have been yearning for that father-son bond, but during this time living with him I realized how much of an asshole he turned out to be. I tried connecting with him trying to share some stories of my day but every conversation turns into something so negative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"hey dad, So I met a new friend at school today\"\n\n\"is it a girl?\"\n\n\"No, hes a boy\"\n\n\"You hangout with boys a lot, you should go for the hot girls so you can get a girlfriend\"\n\n\"Anyways dad, yeah on our way to his place his turban got stuck on the--\"\n\n\"Turban?? dont ever hang out with muslims they--\"\n\n\"Dad hes not even Muslim... Anyways we played mario--\"\n\n\"YOURE ALWAYS PLAYING COMPUTER GAMES YOU SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP YOU!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm not the kind of person to hold a grudge so I always try to find a way to have a good meaningful relationship with my dad when I get the chance. But he is just a vile person and I cant stand it. When I had my first girlfriend cheated on me and I had my first break up, I was in a dark part of my life and I went to my family for support. I thought this would be a good time to have a moment with my dad and see if he can endow me with any wisdom that he has but alas, when I told him the story he just fails to see how much of a dick he is. Instead of giving words of comfort or assurance like a real person he told me that I should have fucked my girlfriend better so that she wouldnt go and look for another dick and it was my fault. I truly could not believe what he just said but I was young and for days I kept having an inner conflict whether he was right or not. Obviously it was wrong and a fucked up way to think about the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways back to when I was in my first year in university, my dad went back to the philippines to visit the kid for a couple of days. Family means a lot to us so we were alright with that action. Now I am in my 4th year of university my dad called everyone to meet. He confessed that he has another child with his mistress and the girl is now 3 years old. He cheated twice on my mother and he even had the nerve to ask us (since we are Canadian citizens and he isnt) if we can help my dad sponsor the 2 kids AND the wife in order for them to immigrate to Canada. My brother was furious and told my dad to get out of the house. He will now be leaving our lives this march.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew how it felt being cheated on but I couldnt imagine the pain my mother is going through since he did this twice. Although he is an asshole, I know that my mom truly loved him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough this was such a shitty turnout, I cant help but feel so happy that I dont get to see my dad anymore, he has brought nothing but negativity to the household.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough he did provide for the family (not even much since he had to provide for my half-siblings too) and I wouldnt be where I am without him, Are we the assholes for kicking him out of the house and refusing to help the other family have a better life here in Canada as well as preventing the two kids from growing up without a father like me and my brothers did?",

      "description": "So recently my friend asked me to a bridesmaid for her upcoming wedding that is less then three months away at this point. Now I'm very flattered she asked, but Bride To Be has informed me that the only reason she asked me to be in the party is because the girl who originally was filling the roll dropped out, and she can't think of anyone else who could fill in on such short notice. \nTo be honest I wasn't even sure I was going to be invited to this wedding in the first place, let alone in the party, because Bride To Be was originally getting married in a courthouse, but then decided she wants a big ol' shindig on a farm (oh joy, the smell of horse excrement wafting across the field as Bride and Groom exchange vows). \nAnyways, in addition to being a last resort option there are certain requirements I must do for the wedding. \n1.) The color scheme is some ugly blue/green shade (Bride To Be has yet to inform me what specific shade of said color I am to wear), so I am to wear a blue/green bowtie and cummerbund. (Yes, I am female. No, I will not wear a dress or skirt. Bride To Be is okay with this and even seems to be encouraging the suit.) \n2.) Have my hair a \"natural color\". (My hair is dyed whatever color I need it to be for work related purposes. I've tried explaining this to Bride To Be but she doesn't seem to care.)\n3. Deal with/ignore Groom To Be's extremely religious parents who will undoubtedly not be happy that a woman is in a suit and is one if the bridesmaids. (This is also why I must have my hair a natural color because apparently \"funky\" colored hair is the devil.) \nHonestly I don't really even care about the ugly color or religion parents, but asking me to change my hair for one day when I need my hair certain colors for work is what really bothers me. \n\nSo yeah, AITH here for wanting to back out of this wedding?",

      "description": "So this a long story but I’ll put a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI met my stepdad when I was five, my mum and dad had divorced that year and then my mum met my stepdad (he shall be named Rob). He got cancer so we moved in with him, it was all pretty quick and sudden, my mum, my big brother and me. \n2 years later, his cancer was gone, my little brother was born and Rob and mum were engaged. \n\nBefore all this, things were okay. I had a nice relationship with Rob. At least that’s what I am told I don’t really remember.\n\nNow every memory I have of Rob from the age of 7-20 are horrible memories, he was abusive to me and my big brother, who is autistic. Physically, emotionally and verbally abusive. He would comment on my weight starting at a young age, invade my personal space and privacy by going through my phone and internet history, because he looked through my history he found out I was bisexual and he outted me to my mum who I wasn’t comfortable knowing about that, he would hit me as a punishment and swear at me. We had different political and moral opinions and would constantly argue about that. He favoured his real son over me or my brother because he was a little angel and I was the family freak (his words). Im always compared to my little brother who wins all the awards at school because he’s so academic and smart, while I’m artsy and I won awards for reading a Robert burns poem and designing some sportswear. He was the first person I told about me being clinically depressed and he shrugged it off saying “I am far more depressed than you”.\n\nEverything I did wasn’t good enough for him. I knew we were never going to get along as people.\n\nThen Rob was diagnosed with cancer again. I was in my 2nd last year of high school so I threw myself into my studies instead of caring about Rob. Rob was then cured of this cancer but he was still feeling ill and then he died a few years later (last July). They think they didn’t get all the cancer out or it was a brain tumour I don’t know. He died when my wee brother was 13 so it hit him hard.\n\nNow this is where I think I’m an asshole. I’m kinda glad he’s dead. I don’t need to deal with his lies, his down grading, the destructiveness, his narcissism, his ego. I don’t need to deal with any of that any more. I’m free. I’m so happy I’m free from this hatred that clouded my life for so long. He was one of the reasons I was depressed. I hated myself so much because of him.\n\nBut I can’t help but feel, this isn’t how I’m supposed to feel. I’m supposed to be sad he’s gone, upset that he won’t see his son go to university, sad he won’t see my win any awards, I’m supposed to be sad. But I’m not.\n\nDoes that make me an asshole?\n.\n.\n.\nTLDR - Stepdad is verbally, emotionally and psychically abusive to me since I was 7, he had cancer twice and then passed away in July (I was 20 then), I don’t feel sad because he’s dead and that makes me feel like an asshole. AITA?",

      "description": "Some background info as to why I’m really hesitant on meeting them. \n\nWhen I was in my last year of secondary school my friends and I went on this trip with the high school and had volunteer counselors. One of them was a man closer to 30 finishing up his college degree. Initially he seemed ok, we asked him questions about college, jobs, just normal future questions you’d ask say a teacher.\n\nWell fasts forward my friend began speaking to him more and it went from school to flirting. I was pretty weirded out but figured, hey it’s a grown man, she probably says they’re flirting but it’s not and I told her to be careful. Well they got together a few months before she turned legal.\n\nI had a lot of red flags going off in my head. And I warned her again but again I never got directly involved for months when their relationship began. What she told me was that he had gotten out of a long committed relationship a while back ago, he convinced her to start drinking, smoking, having sex, which in itself isn’t totally bad. But what worried me was that in all the time I’ve known her, she had constantly told us her faith won’t let her and that she’s loyal to her God and would never betray her parents who I’m not gonna lie, were pretty damn strict. She threw that out the window pretty quickly.\n\nShe would take him with her whenever we hung out. It was weird that a grown man was hanging out with high school girls even if he was claiming he was trying to get to know his girlfriend’s friends better. I told her again I was uncomfortable with him and she in turn told one of our mutual friends that she and her boyfriend thought I needed to get my head out of my ass and not be so jealous over their relationship and stop being delusional. There were also a few more hurtful choice words said to me that I rather not repeat and we haven’t spoken since. \n\nIt’s been a couple of years since then, but we’re still in the same friend group. They’re still together, a little bit on and off. My friends and I recently agreed to meet on a certain date and because our schedules are so busy, it’s really rare that we all get together. However she wants to come and bring her boyfriend too and I told my friends I possibly will not attend if she’s there with him. A larger chunk of my conscious agrees their relationship is really weird, another part of me is beginning to doubt if I was wrong about him since they’re still together after so long. My friends want me to come but I can’t forget the horrible things they both said about me not even to my face with no apology and the fact that they don’t think anything was wrong with him pursuing a 17 year old when he was almost 30. Friends might not be calling me an asshole to my face but I can tell some of them are disappointed in me.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to even give them, especially him, a chance and possibly miss the one chance my friends and I get to gather?\n",

      "description": "So my fiancée and I have been together almost 4 years now and we are getting ready to plan a wedding. The thing is that we cannot afford it. I make good money but she doesn’t and, while we live comfortably, we aren’t able to really save much money (other than my 401k). \n\nSo we are heading to the grocery store and she brings up that if we save $300 a month for the next year and a half, we should have close to $10k. Then we can just take a loan out for the rest. I said, absolutely not, I refuse to take a loan out for a one day event. She then got defensive and brought up that we paid $6000 for a fence, and I shot that down as an argument. \n\nAfter going back and forth I said we are not having a wedding we can’t afford, if we don’t have the money, we don’t have the wedding. Now she isn’t talking to me and has been in the bedroom for the last 3 hours. ",

      "description": "Some background info, I'm 20 have and live at home with my mom. She is a teacher and currently I have no job and am not going to school (don't know what I'd go to school for and getting a part time job, which is all I could do as I'm relied on to be home during the day, would basically only pay for the transportation to and from said job).\n\nI help a lot around the house, cooking dinner, cleaning, and most importantly watch/take care of my 10 year old twin brothers when my mom is at work. Although I also have to take care of them a lot when she is home as she has homework to grade and things of that nature. This hampers my ability to go out with friends most days as well, along with them having their own busy schedules.\n\nAnyways I pretty much daily ask my Mom to do things with me, play board games, watch a movie, watch TV, make dinner together, etc. She frequently turns me down during the weekdays which I understand for the most part as she has to go to bed early and get up early as well as having to do work from home. This still bums me out sometimes because she chooses to do mindless stuff like browse Facebook or watch reality TV instead. Occasionally she will also just watch a good movie or TV show or do something completely on her own, that I would enjoy doing with her, without telling me and that really upsets me.\n\nBut what this post is really about (feel free to comment on the rest though) is tonight I wanted to go see a movie because my brothers were going to their fathers for the night. So basically my Mom and I could actually go see a good, adult movie that we wanted to see. There was really only one time we could go based on when my brothers were being picked up and that was 9 PM. My Mom claimed 9 PM was too late even though as I'm writing this (Midnight) my Mom is still awake and the movie would have ended over an hour ago.\n\nI got very upset because there are very few times that we could go see a movie together as my brothers only go to their dads once, maybe twice a month. Basically its rare that we have the opportunity to do something together out of the house.\n\nI told my Mom I think she is an asshole and selfish with her free time. I think calling her an asshole was probably too much but I really wasn't trying to be mean, I was just saying how I felt. And besides those two things I said I mostly just told her that what she did upset me. \n\nAfter a while of talking she mentioned that we spend tons of time together (she was talking about when we are both in the living room). I said \"that's not really what I'm talking about because you mostly sit on your phone and tell me that I'm bossy and rude anyways.\" She started to say \"well you are really bossy\" but I cut her off after that and told her to \"fuck off.\" The bossiness shes talking about btw is when I tell my brothers to turn the volume of their tablets down/wear headphones if we are all in the living room. Like I said they are 10 and watch annoying YouTube videos so I don't think its an absurd request.\n\nShe hasn't apologized for anything yet either btw and I feel like she really should.\n\nSo am I the asshole here for demanding too much of my moms free time? I feel like my mom has been and was tonight, very rude and selfish especially since its so rare we have an opportunity to go see a movie together. I still love my Mom obviously just wondering if I have the right to be as upset as I am here.",

      "description": "So I was in a bath the other night and had over filled it. This lead to water spilling out of the bath and apparently into the flat below. They came up the stairs and knocked on the door to inform me. I said I didn't know that and that I would investigate for them and that I was sorry. I went back inside and decided to finish my bath first before investigating as I didn't realise the urgency of the matter. A few minutes later I heard some bumps from outside the bathroom, so I got out to investigate. As I opened the door I happened to open it into the female neighbour. I panicked, covered my naked genitals and shouted \"Get out.\" She didn't, so I shouted \"Get the fuck out\" and other variations. I then proceeded to escort her out of the flat with one hand on my groin to cover it up. She claims I was pushing her and that she left immediately but I have no recollection of that. I went back inside and dried off. I dressed and then went downstairs. I saw the woman on the stairs and said \"How dare you come into my flat without permission?\". This descended into a massive shouting match between me and the couple. The husband and I got eye to eye to argue and the wife then put her hand on my upper chest/neck area which I swiped away (similar to that thing with Jim Acosta the CNN reporter and the woman trying to take the mic from him) because it was a tense aggressive situation and she put her hand on me. The husband then screamed about how he would attack me if I ever put my hands on her again. Eventually we went our separate ways although definitely not amicably and with them threatening to call the police on me. I went up stairs and also phoned the police. Whilst upstairs I proceeded to stomp around incredibly loudly, this I totally acknowledge I was the asshole for doing. They then told the police that I had been staring into their first floor window from the ground, menacingly at some point in the past, that I had tried to spit on the man, none of which is even close to true.  So my question is simply am I the asshole.",

      "description": "Try to keep this as brief as possible. Girlfriend and I have been together 2 years, were recently looking to move in together. She was going to spend the rest of the month in her apartment then move into my place, and she's been spending most days over here anyway gradually moving some of her stuff in.\n\nThis is fucking gross, so fair warning. For the three days straight she's been over I've noticed an odd smell when I picked up my toothbrush. I wasn't sure what it was so I rinsed it and kept using it as normal. One morning she asked me if I had noticed anything different, but refused to elaborate when I asked for an explanation so I was on high alert now. I left my phone running in the washroom peaking out of the towel cabinet that faces the sink, and I totally get how invasive that was and if it turned out I was wrong I was prepared to admit to it and accept the consequences for my assumptions as they came.\n\nTurns out she had been rubbing my toothbrush inside her pants in the mornings as she wakes up before me and putting it back in the container. When I got my phone and seen the video I was livid, and confronted her immediately. She reacted like it was a gigantic joke, laughing, trying to hug me and saying she wanted to see how long it'd take for me to figure it out. Apparently she viewed it as a prank.\n\nI felt incredibly disgusted and betrayed, I feel like it's disrespectful and not at all a prank and it's unhygienic. It's not even like she did it once, she had been doing it for days. I told her to get the stuff that she had brought over in the past few days and leave, that I didn't want to be with her anymore.\n\nShe's absolutely dumbfounded I could see this as anything other than a harmless prank. It's her opinion that it shouldn't matter because I washed it before use anyway. On one hand, she's been so inconsolable and has been begging me to reconsider so much that I'm second guessing my decision to end it and wondering whether I'm being too harsh. On the other hand, if this is her idea of a prank and the sort of thing she can do, not only do I not trust her in my house around my stuff, I don't trust her in general. Am I the asshole if I want to end things?",

(My father as any logical male avoids any wedding preparations for he knows he will be eaten alive by the female crew)\n\nA short bio of the main cast:\n\nMother: kind, warm, social, the leader in her social group, lower middle class, touching love language, in debt from young foolish mistakes and the strongest woman I know.\n\nWife: smart af, kind, finished college, was a tomboy in he teens, has a silly personality, quality time love language, bad at reading people's expression and quite bad with interacting with humans.\n\nMe: smart, gamer, in middle of engineering uni, big frame, kind, impossible to make angry, always smiles, touching love language, loves to help and confident.\n\nMIL: raised her daughter alone, worked for the past 20 years 7 days a week as a house maid, no friends, gift love language, not in debt and lonely.\n\nHappened two years ago, I decided to propose to my wife after finishing my mandatory army enlistment, all was great, we flew to Prague to marry(stupid laws in my country), her mother complained that she won't go if I invite more than 5 people, I did as I was instructed, 5 people came from my place, to my amazment I have an extended family in Germany, 30 people came from there, she was furious. At the ceremony her car arrived late and with all the confusion she was sat in the third row(me and my wife didn't notice) while my mother was in the first row, she was furious. Fastforward a year later, my family demand a ceremony in my country, me and wife agree. \n\n2 months before the ceremony I get a call from my mother, she was crying ( I have seen her cry scarcely mind you, this made me furious beyond my expectations) in short: allot of heated words were transfered mostly in the direction of my mother, which hurt her much, I immediately called my MIL and without thinking let loose my anger, frankly I don't remember what I mostly said, but that encounter left me distrustful of her.\n\nFast forward a week before the ceremony, my mother and father invited around 120 people who they know and respect, my MIL in law invited 6, called my wife and told her she won't come to such a big collection of people, left my wife in tears ( her reasoning are understandable, she has a tendency to distrust others, she feared all those people will come with out money and we will start our new life in debt), later stated the wedding will be the last thing she wants to do with my parents, mind you my father wanted to strangle her but kept his cool.\n\nA year passed since and Everytime we visit the families, if I have to be in MIL house I try to be as quick in my visit as possible, I did this from intuition, I didn't notice this behaviour till last week when my wife mentioned it and revealed to me it hurt her MIL and her, afterwards asked me to not be an asshole and give her mother more from my time, to which I have yet answered, but truly desire to say \"fuck her\", AITA?",

It was a “NB I’m leaving you I can’t do this anymore” and them saying “no I love you, will you marry me?!” I was shocked and of course said yes because in the moment I was .. well shocked?! We drove to the nearest store that was open at that time (it was 11pm) and it happened to be my contries version of Walmart, and got a $40 ring. I said the next day that I wasn’t happy with the proposal and that ever since I was a little girl I dreamed of a beautiful and thoughtful proposal, and that I wanted a decent ring. They said they would do it again and actually put thought into it, but they still haven’t. Their brother is proposing to his girlfriend this weekend and it’s genuinely triggering for me to watch him plan and buy the ring and be so excited and I’m upset that I never got that. Am I the asshole for wanting my fiancé to buy a new ring (doesn’t even have to be expensive. I’ve said hundereds of times I would be okay with a $100 pandora ring) and put some thought into a genuine proposal? ",

      "description": "Apologies for the format; on mobile.\n\nIt started smoothly enough. My psychiatrist was asking how I've been, which aspect of my life appeared to have improved, etc. He made me rate from 1-10 my low mood, low energy, and lack of motivation; 1 being the normal and 10 being the absolute worst. I said that my mood was around 1, energy was around 2-3, and motivation as a solid 5. Then he asked my mom what am I like at home. She was like, \"oh, he's doing well, but we have planned for him to live in the countryside, but I am the only one shouldering the expenses for the travel, the household expenses, and I have just recovered from the flu so my body's hurting right now. My husband is also a senior but he can't help with the expenses, so I have to find ways to pay for those. I don't know what to do anymore, and my son doesn't know how that fills me with despair. I just want him to be cured, and what else can I do to help?\" Those weren't her exact words, but that's the gist of it. \n\nThen my psychiatrist said that it seems to him that I enjoy making her auffer, because I don't seem to care how she's feeling. I need to learn how to stand on my own two feet, because someday my parents will be gone. I should take this time in the countryside to think about what to do in life.\n\n\nI mean, he's right of course. As if I didn't know that already. My mom complains to anyone and everyone whether they ask how's she's doing or not. I know i'm a useless piece of shit, but should I feel like an asshole too?",

      "description": "So, me and my little sister have always had a rough relationship. We've fought since she learned to talk and walk, and it's been going on for close to 15 years now. We don't physically fight anymore, since I'm a grown man, and she's 15 years old, 5'8 and maybe at most 120lbs. Her attitude however is toxic. When she gets mad at me, even for things like light teasing, she either turns to personal attacks, or violence. \n\nI can't tell you the amount of times she's kicked me in the chest, punched me in the face or something. It's not a big deal physically because I can handle it, it's more a matter of attitude. She makes really nasty remarks when she gets mad, and she seems to provoke me intentionally. When she's not pissed at me she barely acknowledges my existence.\n\nFor backstory, when I was younger, years back I was a horrible brother. Up till about 11 I was dealing with severe, unmedicated at the time ADHD, and I was a little shit, I said bad things, and did bad things to her, and I regret it every single day. I know I did wrong as a kid, but it's been years, I've apologized a number of times, and tried to mend the relationship.\n\nI've tried spending time with her, since we do have common interests, but that never ends well since we usually end up blowing up on each other. I love her a lot, but I'm done with her attitude. I've spent the better part of this decade trying to make up for how shitty I was to her as a kid, and she still gives me shit, even when I genuinely try to engage with her. So I don't want anything to do with her, when I move out I'm not sure if I'll ever really speak to her all that much. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to speak to my sister anymore?",

      "description": "So, let me explain. Yesterday I took a seven hours bus and it’s already long on its own, let alone when you’re sitting next to someone obnoxious. This guy next to me was spreading his legs on my side more than necessary. He did not need all of that space, and he was also sitting in the aisle seat so he could have leaned towards the corridor. But no, he decided to spread his leg so to take so much room and part of my seat, and he was comfortably spreading his arm too so that I had less than half of my seat. I was not going to tell him because I felt silly but also I thought he would have realised because I was literally squished towards the window and his leg was touching mine which made me really uncomfortable. \n\n\nI tried to make him understand by putting my bag in between our seat multiple times but he just kept moving it to spread his leg more. Dude I know you need space but I need it to, and considering it was a seven hours journey it was honestly hell. So the guy wouldn’t get the memo, and he was also sleeping all of the time, so it’s not even that I could just casually mention it.\nWhat I did was when it got dark I just put my phone brightness all the way up so it would be blinding even for me. I know it’s petty but I don’t even think he even noticed which makes me even more mad. AITA for wanting to bother him?\n",

      "description": "So my boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years and living with each other for about 1.5 years. We both work full time and do a bunch of extra curricular activities together. I love him to pieces and we have gotten along pretty well.\n\nSo to start off, I have always been a night owl. I just don't function well in the morning and prefer to stay up late. Before I used to have to take sleeping aids or smoke some weed to help me sleep early if I needed to work or go to school early the next day. Recently I got a promotion at my work that gives me a flexible schedule where I can work mostly at home. So I usually work later in the day since that's when I am most active. So now my sleep schedule is 4am-12pm. I've been much happier with this schedule and have been avoiding sleeping aids because of it.  \n\nNow that info is out of the way, my boyfriend is has been doing these annoying things to get me to wake up earlier (like 9-10am when I went to bed at 4am). He'll tickle me, put his cold hands on my body, throw the dogs on my bed, whatever little annoyances he can do to wake me up.  I've been kind of brushing it under the rug until today. I told him if I did the same to him he wouldn't appreciate it, so I don't know why he things it's okay to do it to me. His reasoning is that I don't have a healthy sleep schedule and it's out of concern for my well being. I asked his what a healthy sleep schedule is, and he responded \"sleeping when the sun goes down and waking up when the sun comes up\". I then told him that I would have to see some research on that, because different people can have different sleep schedules and can still be healthy as long as they are sleeping the right amount of hours. Then he got kind of offended and said that he won't offer any critique of me anymore. Now he's not talking to me. Idk if I am being an asshole here, but I feel like I am justified in confronting him about it. \n\nSide note: I still get up early (7am) to let out our dogs and feed them so he can sleep. I didn't bring that up to him.",

      "description": "I'm M18 and moved in with my dad and stepmom back in November. This is going to need a bit of background though I think before I start.\n\nMy dad has always been a drug user, from very heavy stuff back in the day to now only weed and alcohol. He's aggressive and abusive but also caring. Very narcissistic and outright stupid sometimes, but also smart and logical other times. He's very unpredictable but he's always been kind to me. My mom's side of the family, who I've spent most of my life with, all dislike him greatly. I've always defended him as much as I can, but I definitely understand and agree with them, to a degree.\n\nLike I said above, my dad is unpredictable. An accurate metaphor would be a sparkplug. Since November, he's gotten progressively worse and worse, consistently yelling at my stepmom and myself for the dumbest things, like not putting enough creamer in his coffee or no mustard on a sandwich. This is seriously the things he gets so mad about, he has to leave for several hours and come back that night and \"apologize\". My stepmom and I discuss him frequently when he's gone and we have no idea what to do. He doesn't have a job, except from Uber-ing occasionally, and my stepmom works 40+ hour weeks at a restaurant to support us. I help out as much as I can with my financial aid, mostly by paying certain bills or just taking care of myself and taking that burden off of them.\n\nMy dad is still kind to me, but it feels a bit backhanded. He bought me an expensive game (AC Odyssey Gold Edition) for Christmas, which is awesome, and he buys the food I like and treats me with respect, but he also kicked in my door because I was struggling with my counselors to get a schedule at college. He fixed it afterwards and apologized, and we talked about it all. The next morning though, he barges in my room at 7 in the morning and yells at me for the exact same thing, despite having an understanding the previous day!\n\nRecently I've just stayed in my room and kept it locked. I go out and get food when he leaves, and I talk very minimally to him. I feel like I can't do anything in this house without getting yelled at or even potentially hit. I always hear him yelling through the walls. He gets mad I don't talk to him and spend time with him, but what am I supposed to do? As a result I barely eat and sleep and live in constant anxiety about what he's gonna do next.\n\nAm I the asshole Reddit? I don't know at this point. I feel justified in not giving him the satisfaction of being a dick and still getting what he wants (time with me).

      "description": "I love my wife. She is fun, caring, and does a lot more for me than I do for her. That being said, she is currently enrolled in an online graduate program. The course work is not too difficult for me, who in general has an easier time in school than her. My wife uses that fact to say things like “if you would just do the assignment it would take you ten minutes, for me it would take an hour! So please just do it.” When I respond with things like “would love to help you if you’d try but you are putting no effort into it and I feel like you are taking advantage of me.” She will respond that she often does things that are not just her responsibility like go grocery shopping cooking etc. and that it doesn’t matter whose responsibility it technically is. I have very long days and my own graduate program I am doing. I leave at 630am and get home at 730pm which just shows how annoying extra work would be but also shows how she is dealing with our son much more than I am. Should I just do the work for her even if I think she’s perfectly capable and just taking advantage of me? Am I the asshole for not doing something that is easier for me than her?\nThanks",

(I mean I like the songs..though not their rendition)\n\n\\- I think they might be rehearsing because they're only repeating pieces of the song (over and over) with no backup other than the voice. \n\n\\- Last but not least, most of the times it sounds plain bad. It's like I am forced to be a part of someone's shower concert.\n\nWhy would I stifle people's creativity? I work from home and have exams coming up.

      "description": "About a year ago, I met a woman at a party and we hit it off. In fact, we slept together on the night we met. In the course of this, I discovered that she was significantly younger than me (she's 19, I'm 35).\n\nSome time after we met, she reached out to me on social media, wanted to meet again in a more dating context. I was reluctant for two reasons: first, I was fairly sure she had a boyfriend by then and, two, I wasn't entirely comfortable with our age difference. She assured me that she didn't have a boyfriend and, over time and a number of conversations, I came to believe that our age difference wouldn't be an issue. \n\nFinally, I agreed to meet, and offered a time and place. She declined, so I offered another time and place. We went back forth like that for a bit until she finally simply ghosted me. I felt a bit like a dumbass, and was a bit butthurt, but I dismissed it and moved on.\n\nA little bit later, I saw some posts on social media from her that made it clear that she *did* have a boyfriend, and had at the time we were talking about getting together. I considered the whole thing a bullet dodged.\n\nRecently, in the last month or two, she's been posting on social media again, but now she's describing her recovery from drugs (which is news to me, I didn't even realize she was an addict.) She's also talking about how lonely she is, how sorry she is that she burned so many bridges, and how she wishes some of her friends would be willing to re-connect now that she's clean.\n\nThis woman sounds like ten pounds of trouble in a five-pound bag, and I really don't want to get dragged into any of it. But a good friend of mine (whose advice I typically trust) said that I was being too mean and that I should reach out to her and at least be friends.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not wanting to get involved with this woman and all of her drama?\n\nTL:DR A woman lied to me about having a boyfriend, convinced me to date her, then ghosted me. Later, she claims to be getting clean from drugs and wants to rekindle the relationship at some level. I want nothing to do with her. AITA?",

      "description": "I(21m) have lost all respect for my sister (26). \n\nIt started when she moved down to Columbus to attend CCAD for animation and failed her first semester.... and then decided she needed to introduce more stress into her life by buying a dog. A large, expensive, high-maintenance dog, an Afghan hound, saying she “needs” a dog. \n\nThe next part comes when I’m in Columbus on a visit to a medical center to have a speech issue addressed. My mom decided we should stop by my sister’s apartment, and when we arrive, the place is disgusting. Not only is there trash *everywhere*, there’s two birds in one cage, neither of which are even hers, there are particulates floating in the air. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I am 100% serious about this.\n\nNext, a few months later i find out she’s short on rent. *Again.* And my mom has to pay for it. \n\nFast forward a couple more months, she’s almost evicted for not paying rent, and my mom can’t afford to pay it, so she has to start asking members of our extended family to give her money so she can pay it. \n\nSome other time along the way, I was forced by our mother to give my sister about $200 from *my* financial aid money that *I* need for *my* schooling to her. \n\nAnd then around Thanksgiving she visited, and I hear her speaking with our father about how she constantly stress-spends her money. \n\nOh, and this one’s a little petty: She calls me a weeaboo for liking anime while she’s simultaneously obsessed with Korean drama, K-Pop, going so far as to teach her dog tricks in Korean rather than English.\n\n\nI just try to avoid her whenever she’s home for holidays because I can’t stand her way of life, but my dad thinks I’m too harsh. \n\n\nTLDR: I hate my sister because she:\n\n-bought an expensive dog while on a tight college student budget (Afghan hound)\n\n-lived in squalor(She’s moved now, but I can’t imagine her new place is any better)\n\n-has 0 financial sense, wastes money and then leeches off of other people in the family\n\n-convinced our mother to force me to give her my financial aid money\n\n-hounds me about an interest of mine while being unhealthily obsessed with Korea herself\n\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way towards her?

      "description": "Hi guys, it's my first post here and I'm really curious if AITA. Just before you read, I checked the relationship posts post and believe this is unique enough to post it. \n\nBackground: I (21) live in Britain and migrated from Poland for University. I have been with my GF (20, Polish) for 2 years now and for 1y9m we've been an LDR, during this time we have seen eachother more or less every 1.5-2 months for around a week or two and once she came over for summer for 3months. The relationship is great and we have really good contact being eachothers best friends as well, we talk a lot on the phone and it is as good as possible. Both of us treat this really seriously and are looking forward to the future.\n\nWhen back in Poland where a lot of my friends and family are, I never had more than a few days so whenever I met with my friends my GF hanged out with us as well, but the last meeting was really bad and we got into a massive fight because she wanted to go home really early and just acted plain bad. Which is why I said I want to meet my friends without her just so I can chill and not listen to her moaning about every part of the night (not the words I used) this is where I am wondering as she is saying ATA for not wanting to spend time with her, and wanting to see my friends without her, but from my point of view I have every right in the world to see my friends with whom I haven't met without my gf since 2 years without her. So IATA for this? \n\nIt is my first post and I'm not sure if there is enough detail, I'll answer any questions in comments guys. ",

      "description": "Backstory: My family moved from Alaska to the lower 48. We sold our house for a huge loss and planned to rent until we could reestablish our savings and  financially swing the big move. My husbands family, however, was pressuring us to move sooner than later. So much so, that they offered to help us get set up. We moved, with basically what fit in the back of our SUV and they did help us get oriented. For that we were grateful. \n\nAround this time my SIL got a brand new dining set and showed up at our apartment with her old set. Again, we were grateful, but it wasn’t something we needed or asked for.  It wasn’t even something we were asked if we wanted. This was 6 months ago, and we have been making due with the table. However, this large round table, does not fit functionality in the dining area of the apartment. The chairs are tearing up the wall because it’s just too big for the space. \n\nFast forward to today, I listed the table on FB marketplace for $100 or an equitable trade that would work for the space we have. If the table sold, the intention was to purchase a different table on the marketplace that would be better suited for the apartment. Well SIL saw the post and essentially lost her shit, and then had MIL texting me about how awful I am and how selling the table is terrible. She is apparently going to show up in the morning to repossess said table.\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n1. The table was gifted and is ours to do with as we wish. \n2. It’s not a family heirloom or really anything special it’s just a table.\n3. We are not trying to turn a profit from the gift, only get another used item that will work more functionality in the space.\n\nSo reddit am I the asshole for wanting to sell or trade this table? Or should I have asked for permission?",

      "description": "Was in a big discussion about a video game, one thing lead to another, (as they do) and I expressed how I loved that one of the characters is overweight, being a plus sized person myself. Another participant asked somewhat bluntly why I don’t try losing weight.\n\nThe question frustrated me, and my response was along the lines of ‘that question is never appropriate, nobody chooses to be fat, everyone has their reasons that losing weight is hard for them and nobody has to please you.”\n\nThe person who asked insisted after that it was because they were a personal trainer who could give me tips. I responded not understanding this and apologized, and tried to come down and be more civil with a better understanding of the question, but then the rest of the participants started HOUNDING me about how wrong I was to say what I did, that losing weight should be easy for me and that I’m making excuses. It really made me shut down. I didn’t ask for an intervention, I just wanted to express why a video game character was important to me.\n\nTLDR; I made a point that was vulnerable to express how I feel about a character. Someone asked something I found blunt and prying and I may have overreacted, and I basically got boo’d out of the conversation.",

      "description": "This is my first post, so I apologize if I give too much, or not enough, information. \n\nMy friend, A, has been one of my dearest friends for several years. We have been close since our freshman year of university. I have a great deal of love towards her, but the way she has been carrying on with another friend of mine, B, upsets me. I have not been friends with B for as long as I have with A, but B is a good guy and I care about him. \n\nA and B have been \"dating\" for several months now, and it's fairly one-sided. A has stated that she is not physically attracted to him, that she doesn't feel \"a spark\" around him, etc. But she continues to see him because she feels he's a good guy, and she doesn't want to miss out on that. B, for his part, is extremely invested in A. He has strong feelings for her, but is frustrated because he can't read her and isn't sure if they're always on the same page. They have never defined the relationship between them, and have even only kissed a handful of times. \n\nI can't help but feel like A is leading B on, and that if they continue on like this, B will only get hurt more. I've encouraged both of them to communicate with each other, to no avail. I'm at the point where I want to encourage B to leave A and to find someone who can actually fulfill his wants and needs. But to do so would betray A's trust and hurt her feelings. My other friends say I would be the asshole if I told B to leave A, because A deserves my loyalty (longer friendship) and I have no right to interfere in another relationship, but if I were in B's situation, I would want my friends to tell me. I feel like I'll be the asshole no matter what, but in which scenario would I be the lesser asshole? ",

      "description": "I really need some perspective here, because this is causing a huge problem in my relationship.\n\nI have a friend that I used to be best friends with in elementary school. About 4 months ago (when I was single) we found each other on Tinder and decided to hang out and catch up. We had a really great conversation for about 3 hours in a public place. Afterwards, he kissed me, and things escalated to another sexual activity - though not outright sex. After that we decided to keep in touch as friends, and haven't spoken since. \n\nFast forward to today. I'm in a new relationship, and he knows about my sexual history. My friend texted me and told me he'd be coming to my city and asked if I wanted to get coffee. He even expressly said that sexual stuff wasn't necessary (which may sound weird, but we had left the possibility open the last time we talked 4 months ago). I told him I was seeing someone now, so sex stuff was definitely off the table. He was very supportive, but still wanted to meet up because we're friends. \n\nMy new partner thinks it's absolutely unacceptable that I would consider meeting up with this friend, and he doesn't see why I would find value in maintaining a relationship with said friend. He says that no girl would consider staying friends with someone who would be open to the possibility of having sex with them. He's basically saying that nobody should ever be friends with people that would fuck them if both parties were consenting. Again, his point is that the only people you should be friends with are people who would never conceivably fuck you under any given circumstances. From my perspective, I really liked connecting with someone from my childhood, and the sexual stuff was more of just an impulsive afterthought that I would never do when I was in a committed relationship. I understand his concern, but I want him to trust that I would not behave unethically, especially since I've been completely open with him and have not tried to hide anything. \n\nPlease let me know what you think.

      "description": "So first things first, I'm married. So there was no chance at all I ever entertained the idea of talking to someone else, this also isn't a super serious post like all the other relationship ending ones. Ok, on to the story.  \n\nThis past weekend a friend of mine invited my wife and I to go eat out with him and his wife and another couple, the have drinks at a local bar after dinner.  \n\nThe night is going amazing until we're at the bar when a big group of girls recognizes my friend and to say hi. He introduces everyone in our group, including our wives and who is married to whom.   \n\nOne of the girls however decided that she wanted to try her luck I guess, idk? She was fairly intoxicated and kept trying to talk to me, ignoring the fact that my wife was five feet away talking to my friends wife. I was trying to be nice and slowly remove myself from the situation without being rude, but she was being persistent and my patience was wearing out having already emphasized that my wife was right behind us.    \n\nAlso, I'm 28, this girl was roughly 22-24. Which I seized on when she made her move and asked \"do you have a snapchat?\" To which I replied, \"Isn't that for children?\" Nobody else heard it so the embarrassment was strictly between her and I, but it was enough to get her to leave me alone. I didn't think anything of it because I'm likely never going to see her again.  \n\nI told my wife about the incident the next day and she laughed about it but said \"You didn't have to be mean.\"  I'm not torn up about it, but I love reading comments on this sub, So I figured I'd leave it open to the court of public opinion.",

That being said, I refuse to go to the shelter and help clean, serve/prepare food etc.  There’s a whole room of people there receiving help. Am I crazy in thinking that a few of these able bodied people could pitch in and serve the food that was graciously donated to them? \n\nI was asked “How can they serve if they’re eating?” Really?

      "description": "Very long. TL;DR at the end.\n\nBackstory, my mom has been a vicious drug addict for her whole life. She started drinking when she was 11, and doing drugs when she was 13. \n\nShe moved out when I was 15, about 5 years ago. She had been cheating on my dad with two of our neighbors, and smoking meth. Not only that, but she had been snorting Adderall, and injecting heroin. That was the last straw for our family. We let it go on for FAR too long, seven trips to rehab and all. Me and my siblings were suffering because we had to call the ambulance almost nightly because she would abuse painkillers and blood pressure medication to the point of seizures or near death. Many other terrible things, but I think you get the point.\n\nShe was living in a few sober living places, bouncing in and out of sobriety for about 2 years. She was MASSIVELY fat when she didn't do meth. She became addicted to food. Thus, she got gastric bypass, under my father's insurance before it ran out. She then soon lost her job because of a failed drug test. She spiralled. She lived in a car I had given her, and it got stolen. She got another car from a boyfriend, and it got burned down. She now lives in a homeless community. Aka, on the side of the road. \n\nLast time I saw her was June 2018, and she was emaciated. Her face was sunken in, her skin was leathery and blotchy, she had even seemed to shrink In Height. She barely resembled my mom. My mom growing up was always plump and red, fair skin, blonde hair. Now her hair was mostly grey and thinned. Her skin had no color besides sun stress. She used to have super clear blue eyes, and they were this terrible grey/brown. Almost hazed over. It broke my heart. \n\nFrom that point on, I never wanted to see her again. She wasn't the person that I grew up with. She was a drug addict shell. That's it. I saw her at my sister's wedding in August 2018, and ignored her as much as possible. She made my fucking skin crawl. After that, I never wanted to hear from her. I wanted her to stop existing. \n\nIt seemed like all the trauma came back, and I realized I don't have to talk to her. I don't owe her anything. Right?\n\nShe reached out to my two siblings recently, for help going to rehab. She didn't reach out to me because I'm not the most kind to her. My siblings asked me for help, and I told them I loved them, but would not help her. \n\nThey're very mad at me now. They were asking me to go down and meet with her to \"lift her spirits\" and stay with her because she misses her kids. I refuse to do that. They have both called me angry, called me crying, and begged me to go. I see no point, and I no longer want to associate with her. \n\nMy dad said \"it's the kind thing to do\" but understands me. He won't see her either. He's done a lot for her, and won't go out of his way for her. \n\nI see it like this: I used to be forced to deal with her manipulation and emotional abuse. She is 57, and has not been sober for more than a year of her life. I don't think she will ever recover. Why subject myself to the pain of seeing her in this condition, if I don't want a relationship with her? I'm supporting my siblings, but I no longer feel responsible for her. AITA?\n\nTL;DR mom has been a drug addict her whole life. She was abusive my whole life. I no longer want anything to do with her, and my siblings are upset because I won't go visit her in rehab.

      "description": "Let me just start out with saying I love my GF, and don’t want our relationship to end.  About 4 months ago, I found out my GFs brother (18) was moving in with us, as his mom could no longer deal his poor attitude and hatefulness towards her.  I was reasonably upset that I wasn’t consulted first, but I knew my GF was just doing what was best for her family.  Since he’s been here, both of us have been emotionally strained by the presence of GF’s brother.  All he does is lay in bed and play video games. He has stolen about 80 bucks from each of us, refuses to get a job, even when I set up a decent gig for him at my workplace.  He seldom says a word to either of us, and when he does, it’s normally something toxic. Additionally, he doesn’t bathe.  I have been keeping track and it’s been over a month since his last bath, and hasn’t brushed his teeth since he’s arrived (I bought him a toothbrush when he first arrived and it’s still unopen).  Finally, after GFs brother forcibly kicked my cat, I had enough.  I told my GF I had enough and could no longer accommodate her brother living with us.  She went to talk to her mom, who guilt tripped my GF to keep GF’s brother living with us, saying if he moves back, she’s going to have to get a divorce.  I don’t know what to do, and told my GF that he’s straining our relationship, and don’t know if I can take it anymore, and we may have to take a break until this matter is resolved .

      "description": "I'm writing this on mobile, so apologies for any wonky formatting!\n\nI'm a college student and I live with three other amazing girls, including one girl who's been my best friend since we were 12. We're all really close, more like sisters than friends.\n\nMy best friend has a bad habit of leaving her laptop open and running while she's away, and while this mostly happens in our dorm room, she's been known to do this around campus. I have repeatedly warned her that this isn't safe, as not everyone is trustworthy and people might see an open, unlocked laptop as free real estate, and claim it as their own. She rolls her eyes and says that she only leaves it open in our room, but I know that's not always the case as I have come across the laptop on occasion while my friend is no where in sight.\n\nSo, I've taken to trying to teach her a lesson. Whenever she leaves her laptop open and running while shes away for atleast an hour, I change her background. Usually it's either pictures of feet (she finds all feet revolting, and therefore hates Quentin Tarantino films), or various pictures of our lord and savior, Shrek. She's been leaving her laptop open less and less and since I started doing it, I've only come across her open unlocked laptop once in the wild of our college campus. \n\nIt's been a few months since the last incident, but about 30 minutes ago she scampered off to an hour long meeting and left her laptop open, unlocked, paused on a Backstreet Boys video. I could not resist temptation, and her background picture is now a picture of Barry B. Benson from the critically acclaimed Jerry Seinfeld movie \"The Bee Movie.\" \n\nSo Reddit, I ask you, am I the asshole for changing my friends laptop background despite how much it annoys her?",

I'm currently finishing up packing, donating old things to goodwill, getting organized, so all I have to do is load my moving truck up and leave. I'm hustling to get it all finished. Now in this last week two family members suddenly have all these things they want done before I leave! Putting together furniture, getting my moving truck earlier so they can use it to pick stuff up from a department store, and clearing out one of their basements. I pretty much flat out refused to do any of it. It got brought up at Thanksgiving and I got made out to look like the bad guy!  It's a pet peeve of mine in the first place when people try and tack things onto my plans (hey since you're going that way, would you mind going by here since it's nearby etc). I need to get all my stuff done on time, quit adding shit for me to do for you \"before I go\"!",

I wanted to hit him so bad but he was this tall white trash fat dude that would have fucked me up so I didn’t and then he eventually got back in his car and when I started walking into the store this old lady came up to me and was asking if I was okay and said she would call the police if I wanted her to but I told her it was okay.

Later that day we finished the slideshow and called it a day, but i forgot to log off my gmail.   \n\n\nFast forward to the next day i decide to check my facebook account on my phone only to realise i have been logged out and my password didn't work, i quickly change my password and deleted some random posts that A(i am gonna call him A) made, only after 2 mins to find out that the passwords gets changed again. I figured then out someone might have access to my Gmail, and managed to log him off through my phone, at this point i had no idea who did this.  \n\n\nJust a moment after all this i get a message on snapchat from A that the post i made was funny, then i realised it was him because we were not friends on facebook, i asked him how he knew what my post sounded like since we were not friends, and he tried to tell me some one else( i have no idea who he was talking about, certainly not one of my facebook friends) told him. That was the moment i realised it was him.  \n\n\nSo i go to the only teacher we both had to complain about A and he said to me he would talk to him first thing next morning(it was the last class of the day).  \n\n\nThe next morning my teacher talked to A and told him to not do things like this again, then A came up to me and apologised, but i did not want to accept this because this stressed me so much out and i cant handle stress very well.  \n\n\nTL:DR i forgot to log out of my Gmail and he changed my facebook password twice, posted something on my facebook and had full access to my Gmail.  \n\n\nSo AITA for not accepting his Apology?",

      "description": "tl;dr at the bottom\n\nHey, so I've been mulling this decision over in my head for some time, and finally decided on it due to my concern for my sister's safety. A bit of background:\n\nMy younger sister is two years younger than me and a junior in college. We've always been close, but as she's gotten older I've adopted more of the \"protective big brother\" role, according to her. Admittedly, I do care about her safety and am initially skeptical of boyfriends she has, but I'm not overbearing or nosy. Anyways, since she's been in college she's attended parties and begun drinking regularly, similar to many college students including myself when I was in college. No problem there. Throughout her 3 years she's called me a few times during the night, often crying, about how she's so drunk and such an embarrassment to her friends, yada yada. I usually just talk to her, crack some jokes to make her laugh, and then ask whichever friend is with her to make sure she drinks water and gets to bed with a trashcan near her or what not. I text or call her the next day and make sure everything is fine, which it usually is. That's not the norm by the way, it happens maybe once every semester, so like 5 times since she's been in college.\n\nWell, this last semester, it's happened 3 times already. She's been starting some harder classes and additional work related to her major (nursing) so she's been extremely stressed. I wouldn't be concerned except for the last time she got drunk, she called me after throwing up on and off for an hour, and in the middle of our conversation she said \"I wanted to drink so that I wouldn't be so stressed out.\" She had never cited her stress as the reason for her drinking before. Between the reasoning and the fact that it was the 3rd time she'd called me drunk in one semester, when again she'd normally only call me maybe once a semester, I became concerned. I tried talking to her that night and the next morning about how I wanted to make sure she wasn't drinking because of stress, as that's not a healthy choice or coping method. I advised maybe seeking tutors to help with the school work, or reducing her job hours as she doesn't have to work to pay through school (our family is fairly well off, she works for experience/to pay her share). She typically doesn't want to talk about her calling me the next day, and takes my advice with a grain of salt, often changing subjects when I bring it up. Normally I keep these conversations private, but after this last time I told 2 other people, my mom and my older sister.\n\nMy older sister is the oldest of our family (6 kids) and me and my sister are the youngest, so she's a sort of guardian/role model to us, and we often seek her advice. She shared my concern and advised me to talk to my mom, which I did. I told my mom about my sister's drinking and the reason she gave for drinking. I didn't phrase it like I was tattling on my mom, and repeatedly expressed how I didn't mind that my sister drank, just that I didn't want her drinking to cope with stress as I thought that could be unhealthy. My mom is old school, hardly drinks, raised us strictly religious, and frowns upon any sort of partying or reckless behavior. Naturally, she didn't enjoy hearing about my sister, but she also isn't ignorant and wasn't shocked by the news. She didn't really comment the entire time I told her, or after, but just nodded and thanked me for telling her. I don't know what she plans to do, or when she'll talk to my sister, but I know my sister will be mad at me because she asks me not to tell our mom all the time. Again, I normally wouldn't, but the reasoning she gave this last time concerned me. Am I the asshole for telling our mom? Our mom is a nurse as well, and took the same courses and what not (though I'm sure the curriculum has changed) but she may be able to relate to my sister's struggles and help her. I'm not trying to justify my actions, just explain them. It's done, and I can't take it back, but I am left wondering if I did the right thing. \n\nThank you all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr Betrayed my sister's trust and told our mom about her(sister's) drinking after my sister said she was drinking to cope with stress.

      "description": "My father likes to get off of work, and hang out at the bar for a few hours before he comes home. This has lead to some rocky behavior, and he’s come home drunk before, but this time, it’s a long drawn on mess.\n\nI (20 F) attended the restaurant for the first time with my boyfriend (23 M) and we ordered some chicken wings (remember this for later). The entire experience wasn’t the best. Service was poor, bathrooms were filthy, and one of our wings was completely undercooked. \n\nAlmost every chicken wing I’ve ever eaten has some cooked blood near the bone that appears as a dark brown or purple. No big deal there. However, as my boyfriend bit into one of the wings, the consistency was wrong, and it let out a decent amount of bright red blood. He said it tasted like iron as soon as he bit into it.\n\nWhen brought the the attention of my dad’s favorite bartender, who was serving us, he told us “they’re supposed to be like that!” We asked for one order or wings to be removed from the bill. They removed it for us.\n\nImmediately after, my boyfriend posts a negative review of the restaurant (one star), mentions the poor service and gross restrooms, and shares a photo of the wing.\n\nTwo days later, I get a phone call from my dad while he’s at the restaurant. He’s Incredibly upset at me because of a review I didn’t post. He went in a rant about how the guys at the bar are “his family” and that now he’s embarrassed to go back, as the bartender showed him the review. \n\nI tell my dad that the bartender should not have given him a hard time about the review, because he (my dad) was not the one who wrote it. I was told that I needed to get my boyfriend to delete the review.\n\nI protested this. For one, I wasn’t the one who wrote it, so I didn’t feel I should be getting flack for it. I told my dad the following: \n\n“It isn’t my fault he wrote that. You have [S/O’s name’s] phone number, so you should talk to him directly about it instead of yelling at me. “ \n\nI went on to tell him that my s/o is entitled to his opinion, and went on to say “bad business practices deserve bad reviews so they can change and get better.” \n\nMy dad still insists that I somehow make the review go away. I can’t do that on my own, as I’m not about to take my s/o’s phone and do it, but I’m certainly not going to tell my boyfriend what he can and can’t do. I continue to insist that the review isn’t my problem, but this has only lead to my boyfriend not being welcomed into my parents house any longer, and some strong words about my “piece of sh*** boyfriend thing” from my dad.\n\nAm I really in the wrong? I don’t think I did anything unfavorable expect for stick up for my boyfriend \n\n",

      "description": "I was friends with a guy for about 7 years and I suppose over time, I assumed he was straight, especially considering he had a girlfriend at the time of the incident which I will divulge into later. He was quite camp I suppose but most people just thought he was straight. I never talked to him about it but he never seem insecure or anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring an English class, a girl asked me if I thought my friend was gay and I said \"I've known \\[the guy\\] for 7 years and I'm pretty sure he's bi\". The girl went on to tell the guy that I said that and he refused to speak to me for 2 years straight and left our friendship group despite having many mutual friends. I later found out that most of the class heard me so perhaps that  exacerbated the issue. I tried to apologies many times throughout the remainder of our time at school together but he never accepted it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were a few other things that may have made matters worse such as the fact that his girlfriend asked me to prom a week before starting dating him and being young, I said something non-committal like \"yeah sure\" but she just ended up going to prom with him obviously. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've always felt bad about it but reflecting upon it, I think he may have overreacted. No homophobia was intended obviously but I think his reaction would have been different if I told everyone he was straight.",

      "description": "Quick backstory is that I have a black family that is on one side of my property that’s lived there for generations and I’m a white man that bought the property on the street corner. We both have about an acre of land and are well off. Dad and his son are an outspoken black activist and I’m white so we usually disagree yet we have civil conversation that are productive and get along real well with bad blood till last weekend.\n\nWe are planning on replacing a fence between our land so we drew up a contract splitting the cost and putting it right down the middle of the line. The current fence was put up off eyeballing the line. Over time it became crooked and beat up so I had a surveyor come out and confirm the property line and found out that I actually gained a foot of property from him.\n\nI invite him over Saturday to break him the news. Fast forward he got on the topic that his family lived on the property for generations and should just use the current fence line that the guy who owned my place before made. I told him we would be using the one from the survey since it’s legally my property and if he wanted to get a second opinion then he can and we would wait to move the fence. He said he wouldn’t pay to have a white man take more property from him. Its pretty important and can cost a lot more to move a fence after it’s build I assumed he would want to confirm it. He kept saying no and left.\n\nOn sunday while I was working over by the fence, his son who’s 19, come over ask why I “thought it was ok that a white man can take a black mans land just cause of some paper” i explained that property lines aren’t theft and it changed the value which set him off and how I’m taking money from them like my ancestors took everything. I got heated by being called a racist and told him my family fled Italy during WW2 to poor Detroit and wasn’t involved in his history at all. Basically the whole reparation issue was stupid and he’s crazy for using all white people argument since my family came in 1940’s. He walked away after I said that if the roles were reversed they wouldn’t have a problem and race shouldn’t be involved. (basically he's acting crazy)\n\nNext time I saw them the son glared at me and the dad was pissed I fought with his son but knew he provoked me. We made friendly until he asked what I decided on the fence. I kinda chuckled and said were using the legal one. He was dumbfounded and I asked if he was crazy that I wouldn’t want to add more property. He got pissed and walked off after saying that he won’t pay for the fence and he wants his money back then and now we aren’t talking. Should I move forward with the contract or AITA\n\nTdlr: I get my property surveyed before replacing a fence and gains a foot and upsets my neighbors who blame me for being racist and stealing land. I call them crazy and they want to back out of their half and think I’m racist now.",

      "description": "So my school went on a ski trip this week. My friend (we’ll call her L) and a girl i was on good terms with but not very close to (we’ll call her Kay) were roommates during the trip. So the trip is going fine, none of us three decided to ski because it was so cold (around the -30s) and we were afraid of getting frostbite so we just stayed in the resort. The resort was huge and had many things to do so we were never bored. The first day went fine. We aimlessly played around at the pool and went for lunch together. That night we just talked about boys we liked, told stories, etc... just normal girl sleepover topics. Kay announced that she liked a boy in our class (let’s call him Jack) and her and I talked about him while L was on her phone, snapchatting a bunch of boys that she would lead on. She would occasionally take a turn talking about Jack so we thought nothing of it. We went to sleep that night and woke up in the morning to get breakfast that the school provided us. After that, we went to the pool. Me, Kay, and L swam around with a few sophomore boys and then got in the hot tub (it was 24$ for an hour. L made me pay for her and give her the change.) about 30 minutes into our hot tub time, L got out and said she needed to take her medicine. We thought nothing of it because she was always getting sick. I asked her if she wanted me to tag along to keep her company or something. She aggressively declined, saying she didn’t want people around while she took her medicine. I still wasn’t suspicious because she probably took a lot and didn’t want to show others how sick she was. Me and Kay sat in the hot tub for another 20 minutes before we texted L “hey where are you... do you need help? You’ve been gone for a long time”. she just said that she would be back in a little bit. We thought it was weird but we also wanted to get our money’s worth of the hot tub so we stayed in. Around five minutes later, L came back super proud. We asked her what happened. She proudly said that she was gone for a long time because she was fucking Jack.... what the hell? She’s 14 let me tell you. I looked over at Kay who looked like she was holding back tears. L asked her what was wrong and she just said “Nothing... I didn’t like him that much anyway” and walked away. As soon as she left the room, I started yelling at L. “WHAT THE HELL? SHE SAID SHE LIKED HIM! WHY DID YOU DO THAT??” I shouted. L replied “What are you talking about? It’s fine , she said she didn’t like him” god i wanted to slap her. She obviously did. I pulled her to where Kay was sitting in the resort’s ice cream place and made her apologize. She let out a half assed apology and Kay, still heartbroken, forgave her because she didn’t want beef with L. So everything felt normal until that night. I had asked for a cute boy’s shapchat in the lobby and he gave it to me (yay). As soon as I got back to the room, Kay told me to get ready for the sledding session I had forgotten about promising her to go on. We hurried and went to the bus that was going to a small slope. On the ride, Kay told me how upset she was about L and Jack. I agreed, saying she was right about being mad and that was that. We sledded for about an hour before going back. I had left my phone in the room to charge and L must have noticed because she was busy snapchatting the guy that I asked to give me his snap. I yelled at her because I was obviously mad at her for doing that behind my back (oh this is important because I let my friends put their finger prints in my phone so they can play games on it or something. I have nothing to hide after all). She started crying saying that he said hi first and it escalated from there. I didn’t talk to her for the rest of the night. The next morning she tearfully told me that she was sorry and had blocked him. I thanked her for her apology and forgave her. On the bus ride home, I sat with her because the other seats were taken. I looked over at her phone and saw that she just sent a snapchat to the guy I yelled at her about. She told me it wasn’t a big deal and to talk to her when I got over it. Needless to say, it was a silent 5 hour bus ride home. After returning home, I promptly snapchatted her and told her that friends don’t lie and that I wouldn’t be talking to her again because if she wanted to be a whore, do it around someone else. She then texted offensive and hateful words to me for slut shaming her. I left the app for the day. She posted pictures on her story like “I hate when society only notices you flaws and never your tears” I scoffed to myself and deleted her fingerprint from my phone. \n\nSo, Reddit, am I the Asshole for “slut-shaming” a girl for being a terrible friend?\n\nTLDR: A 14 y/o girl fucks a guy that her friend likes and then steals a cute boys snapchat from my phone (like she didn’t have enough on there) then gets mad at me for “slut-shaming” her.\n\nUpdate: JACK TEXTED ME AND SAID THAT L HAD LIED AND THEY HADNT DONE ANYTHING. THAT MEANS L LIED TO HURT KAY INTENTIONALLY!!!!",

      "description": "Three people are going to be involved in this story. Let's call my current two friends **X** and **Y**, while the friend I'm going to talk about is gonna be called **Z**.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met all three of these guys back in 2015, in a course that involved TV and Movies. It was one of the best years of my life and I was so glad that I met these three guys. \n\nX was someone who didn't just enjoy movies but also loves to play video games, so he's someone I'm defiantly considering a good fellow.\n\nY is defiantly the one who has the strongest connection to movies. He has very strong opinions about certain things involving the subject and can be quite defensive at certain points. But he is cool, he showed me some good TV shows.\n\nZ was so nice, intelligent and had a nice sense of humour. He was an actor so he plays in amateur theater plays and he is genuinely good.  \n\n\n  \nOur time at that course was great, especially for me considering how I've always had a bad social life, but these guys defiantly made improve on things that I am grateful for. We went out and watched lots of movies and premieres, hanging out at so many places that it really made my life better.\n\nHowever, there were many moments, that involved both Y and Z.   \n\n\nOne thing about Z, is that he wasn't really mentally healthy (as far as I know), as he takes pills, has dyslexia and there was one time during the year where he was at the hospital for so many weeks, that after me and Y had stopped, Z could still continue for a few months (X was also there for another half year but that doesn't matter).\n\nAs I mentioned, Y has strong opinions when it comes to movies, so if you say something that he defiantly disagrees with, he will take it a bit seriously. It's not that Y doesn't respect other people's opinions, but depending on what it is, he always wants to know \"*Why*\" they have that opinion. This has led to many moments where even after it would be explained to Y, he would answer it with, \"*That doesn't make sense to me...*\".   \n\n\nMoments like this is supposedly expected when it involves a subject, like movies, that is bounded to both subjective objective discussions. The thing is, however, is that I've never really been good at these kind of things, so whenever Y suddenly asks, \"*So what did you think of...\", \"How do you feel about...\",* that's where I would suddenly get nervous and always try to think of a correct answer, that wouldn't lead to another moment where Y would just sit silently with an expressionless face after hearing something he most likely didn't expect.\n\nHe can be quite the \"mood shifter\". First, everyone is having a good time, but all of a sudden, it feels so heavy and it nearly always involved Y.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample: One time (during 2015), when we were home at X's place, we were planning to watch 3 movies. I brought mine, X had his and Y had his. We first watched X's, then mine. It was evening (can't remember if it was late) and as we were ready to watch the final movie, Z tells us that he feels too tired to watch any more movies for the day. I was fine with that and I'm pretty sure X was too. But Y felt so irritated about it (It was his favourite movie), as it literally made all three of us sit there in silence, not knowing what to do. This was the first time I had experienced Y's behaviour and it was baffling. We quickly came to a solution that we would watch Y's movie the next day. We would again have a good time, but the scene was still in my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I need to note about Y, is that he is an extrovert. He has told me that he needs and wants to be with his friends all the time. But one thing that was unfortunate for him during the year at that class, is that he lived furthest away, in which he had to wake early up in the morning every day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut all four of us had made this far with our group friendship, that towards the upcoming summer where we would end our year at the course, we would travel someplace. It would be the first time for me to travel without a parent but I was excited about it. \n\nIt wasn't the last time we were going to travel either. \n\nWhen we would travel for the second time, another scenario would happen that involved Y and Z again.   \nI would lay on a couch at the lobby where we stayed and Y comes over and sits down next to me, asking: \n\n\"*So, what now?\"*\n\nI was confused.\n\n*\"I don't know...? What's up?\"*\n\n*\"We need to buy tickets for the trip tomorrow\"*\n\n*\"Yeah, well, do you know how to?\"*\n\n*\"Yeah, but...Uhm...me and Z had a slight...argument\"*\n\nTurns out Y had shown a clip from a certain YouTuber that Z didn't like. I think what made Y irritated at Z was how he expressed it, but I wasn't there so I can't tell for sure.   \nBut I think one of the things that make Y irritated at certain statements, is *how* people say it. If he feels that their attitude was rather \"harsh\", that's where he wants to distance himself from others. \n\nAnyway, Z was pretty much the one who came up to Y and wanted to make it cool again between them. I'm not sure if it was an apologize, but they were on good terms again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we're at the point where we all do something different in our lives. We were hanging out and all like before, but Y felt like Z was beginning to distance himself from the group, speculating how he was hanging more out with new friends with them. I tried to tell him that he shouldn't think about it too much though. \n\nY and I were involved with a lot of activities that Z had to do with. We went and saw three of Z's plays and one time welcomed him back home from a class trip. \n\n  \nNow, this is what I want to talk about...  \n\n\nWhile me, X, Y and Z had stopped at the film course, we still didn't want to quit the movie making stuff, so for a while, we had planned a short-film with me and Z as one of the lead roles. \n\nA weekend, in late 2017, we were home at Y's place it was dark and we were discussing the script and such. We read through the script and whenever Z had to read out loud, his voice felt really tired and he looked tired too. His alarm goes off and he says that he needs to take his pills. However, he didn't have them with him. At first, he said that it was probably going to be ok. But only a few moments later, he says, \"*Guys, I'm tired, I have to go home...\".*\n\nY reacted to this and begged him to stay, stating that it was weekend, as if he implied that one can stay up late if it's Friday/Saturday. He really wanted him to stay (Again, Y is an extrovert). Z stayed for only a half minute, before he stood up, took grabbed his stuff and said, *\"Sorry, guys. I have to go. I'll see you soon.\"* He gave all three of us a hug, before he walked out the door. Though, not knowing at that time, that was the last time X and Y saw Z.  \nAfter he left, Y was once again irritated.  \nY: *\"Yeah, yeah. What the hell does he know about finding his way home?!\"*  \nIt was once again one of those moments, that was really baffling me. But the three of us just continued to discuss the script.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of days later, I discovered something shocking. Ever since we met, we had this group chat on messenger. I saw that Z had left the group chat, the same evening which he left Y's place.   \nSoon Y and X discovered it and we all hoped that it was nothing too serious.   \nAt the time, I asked Z if he wanted to come and hang out with us, but he said that he couldn't.   \nBeing way too desperate to figure out what was going on, we had another friend spy on him, to see what he had to say.   \nZ simply stated that he couldn't stand how Y has to be angry about certain things people say, that doesn't involve him. This is what I talked about when I said Y had strong opinions. \n\nMeanwhile, Y stated to me and X that he felt sorry for what he did and that he wanted to talk to Z and be friends again. But we couldn't get both of them to talk it out. This was where X was beginning to feel irritated about it too. All he wanted was just them to talk it out, but nothing happened.\n\nEventually, one of Z's next plays were coming up and he had basically invited me, so I figured this would be a nice opportunity to quickly talk about this. So I went, saw his play and after it was over, I managed to get a hold of him. He was glad to see me and I was glad to see him (Note, that this took place months after the event at Y's place). I asked him if he was happy enough with how things were now, or if he wanted to come back to us. He was fine as things were now. X and Y knew that I was there, in which they had asked me to ask a few specific things but I'm not sure if I forgot the questions or if I didn't want to bother asking them anyway. \n\nAll in all, Z's connection with me had pretty much been strongest between the four of us, so he asked if he wanted to meet again sometime and I was cool with that. But X and Y were completely done with him. I could understand how they felt, as if only Z could've talked with Y, we could've found a solution to make everything the same as things were before. But both of them called Z weak because he didn't want to solve the situation like an adult and I honestly didn't know what to say about that.  \nX quickly showed me a picture of a chat conversation between him and Z, just after I got home from Z's play and told them what happened. This is what I remember from the picture.  \n\n\nX: *\"You do know that you're the cause of this broken friendship, right?\"*\n\nZ: *\"I know\".*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're in the present now. X and Y are one of my best friends that I'm still hanging out with, playing video games with them and such almost every day, but I haven't been in contact with Z for almost a year now. But I know we're going to see each other soon eventually, (which X and Y don't know) so I want to ask...  \n\n\n**Am I an asshole for wanting ",

      "description": "Someone that I used to be really close to put me down as a reference (without letting me know) for a new job and I'm feeling hesitant about providing a reference. She started cancelling plans to get together and has been trying to avoid making them for about a year ago. I haven't seen her since May (it was like pulling teeth to get together), despite her always being around and making plans with others. Most recently we had plans the week of Thanksgiving, but she cancelled last minute to host a \"Friendsgiving\" with other friends. Of course, the day the woman called me to ask for a reference, my \"friend\" suddenly asked if I was free to get together (her other listed reference informed her that the woman had called). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo obviously I have some personal, negative feelings creating my reservations, but in addition...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) The times the HR woman is available to talk doesn't match up with my schedule. I'm in class or at the hospital (for clinic) all day M-F. I leave my house at 9 and get home around 8 most days. My very little free time during the days (meal breaks) I use for studying for finals.  I'm not sure if I want to use this time to provide a reference for someone who I personally feel is just using me at this point. Additionally, I'd have to lie/or leave out information (see #2). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I also worked with the friend and saw how frustrated she became working with children (some on the spectrum). This is for a special ed assistant teacher and, as someone that works with children, I don't feel like she is good fit for a job working with children with intellectual disabilities. She was never rough or physically abusive with them, but she would \"punish\" them in ways that are not appropriate for behaviors that they can't control. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I an asshole if I don't provide a reference? I got the call Thursday night and the HR woman was only available a few hours on Friday, so I haven't had the opportunity to call if I wanted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This really isn't that drastic or exciting compared to some of the other posts here, so apologies lol. \n\nBasically, there's a coffee shop on my university's campus that my best friend, who uses a wheelchair, and I go to almost every day. There's one girl who works there who is a little...weird with him. She's never *said* anything rude to him but she has a habit of talking to me/whoever he's with instead of directly to him, and speaking as if he's a child when she does talk to him. She's been told by (in polite terms) that he is a fully mentally competent adult man and she should talk to him as such but it doesn't seem to go through to her. My friend insists he isn't bothered by this but it irks me quite a bit because I think like...if she's treating him this way she almost certainly does others too. I've been considering putting in an official complaint about her. \n\nHere's the thing; this girl is in some of my classes and I happen to know that she's currently supporting herself and this job is her only means by which to do so. She had a complaint put in once about her before but that was for something that genuinely wasn't her fault (a customer accused her of intentionally giving her dairy instead of an alternative when she didn't actually order an alternative) and she got in a bunch of trouble for it. I remember her crying in class because she was terrified of being fired. \n\nI don't want her to have no means to support herself because of me or whatever but she really doesn't seem to ever change any of her behaviour in this context and I really don't think it's how someone in the customer service industry should be acting.

      "description": "Background: I’m 23F and.... tbh, probably mildly autistic. I don’t say that as an insult to myself, it’s just true—my primary school teachers wanted me screened for it and so did my old therapist—I just never got it done. I know I say things or act unemotional and cold often, because I just don’t know how to act and say things?\n\nMy boyfriend is 24M and opposite to me. As in, not autistic, reads into everything that’s said to him, doesn’t trust people or what they say as easily and wears his heart on his sleeve.\n\nI said, probably almost verbatim to him, “I’m more attracted to you than anyone else”. It got sorta heated and he asked me why tf I said that how would I feel if he said that to me—I wouldn’t feel anything? I mean I’d feel good? But he kept insisting it meant I was attracted to other people or something bizarre.\n\nHe’s the second boyfriend that’s said I don’t know how to talk—but then again, the first that said that was VERY manipulative.\n\nI’m afraid either I hurt people by what I say, or I’m just going to be manipulated again into walking on eggshells all the time.\n\nWas I the asshole? How’d you feel if your SO said that? I can take it so be honest.",
